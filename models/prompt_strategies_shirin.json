This classification applies to the journal name, title, and/or abstract of a study. Respond in JSON format with the key: gpt_label.\n\nInformation for Classification:\n1. Definition of Interventions: 'Intervention' includes treatments, procedures, or actions to prevent or treat disease.'Non-drug-interventions' encompass therapies without a specific molecular structure.\n2. Guidelines for Clinical Trials: Studies re-analyzing clinical trial data labeled as respective clinical trials. Pharmakokinetic studies labeled as drug-intervention studies. Long-term adverse events studies labeled as clinical trials if the therapy is mentioned specifically.\n3. General Annotation Guidelines: Labels are hierarchical; select the highest applicable label. Refer to the numbers accompanying  the labels for the hierarchy. 'Remaining' is used for studies outside neuroscience/psychiatry, clinical trials with unspecific therapies, and uncertainties. \n4. Study Labels: Labels defined for different study types; choose the most specific applicable label.\n\n\n\nLabels and Guidelines:\n1. Study protocol: A study protocol for a clinical trial or systematic review.\n2. Human, systematic review: A structured research summary including human data.\n3.
