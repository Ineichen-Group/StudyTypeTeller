340,28645717,Vaccine,Surveillance of pneumococcal colonization and invasive pneumococcal disease reveals shift in prevalent carriage serotypes in Massachusetts' children to relatively low invasiveness.,"Following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), overall nasopharyngeal colonization rates have not changed significantly, however a dramatic and sustained decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children was observed in every setting where the PCVs were implemented. We aimed to describe the differences in invasive disease potential of serotypes that are common colonizers in pre- and post-vaccine eras in order to provide further insight in our understanding of dynamic epidemiology of pneumococcal diseases.	Using data from surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage and enhanced surveillance for IPD, a serotype specific 'invasive capacity (IC)' was computed by dividing the incidence of IPD due to serotype x by the carriage prevalence of that same serotype in children <7years of age in Massachusetts. We have evaluated the serotype specific invasive capacity in two periods; pre-PCV13 (2001/02, 2003/04, 2006/07, 2008/09) and post-PCV13 (2010/11 and 2013/14), and by age groups; <24monthsvs. ≥24months.	An approximate 50-fold variation in the point estimate was observed between the serotypes having the highest (7F, 38, 19A, 3, 33F) and the lowest (6C, 35B, 21, 11A, 23B and 23A) computed serotype specific invasive disease potential. In the post-PCV13 era (6C, 35B, 11A, 23B and 23A), 5 of the 7 most common serotypes colonizing the nasopharynx were serotypes with the lowest invasive capacity. Serotype specific invasive capacity trended down in older children for majority of the serotypes, and serotypes 3, 10A and 19A had significantly lower invasive capacity in children older than 24months of age compared to younger children.	Invasive capacity differs among serotypes and likely by age. Point estimates of IC for most of the common serotypes colonizing children in Massachusetts in post-PCV13 era were low and likely explain the continued reduction in IPD from the pre-PCV era in the absence of specific protection against these serotypes.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,"<journal>Vaccine</journal><title>Surveillance of pneumococcal colonization and invasive pneumococcal disease reveals shift in prevalent carriage serotypes in Massachusetts' children to relatively low invasiveness.</title><abstract>Following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), overall nasopharyngeal colonization rates have not changed significantly, however a dramatic and sustained decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children was observed in every setting where the PCVs were implemented.

47,11482695,Acta neurochirurgica,Carotid endarterectomy: a new technique replacing internal shunts.,"Carotid endarterectomy has been reported to increase the time free from cerebral ischemic events in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a high grade of stenosis of the internal carotid artery. In cases in whom the compensatory circulation during the carotid clamp time is not sufficient, the use of intraluminal shunts has been proposed. However, the use of intraluminal shunts present several problems, such as the technical difficulties in positioning the shunt, the variability of time requested for the placement, the inconstancy of the blood flow during surgery, and the need to clamp off the carotid to introduce and remove the shunt. For these reasons, most operators prefer not to employ intraluminal shunts, while others do use them only in selected cases. The purpose of this work is to present, for the first time, a new type of temporary extraluminal shunt, connecting the femoral to the internal carotid artery with the interposition of a roller pump to regulate the blood flow. This method allows one to perform carotid endarterectomy without interrupting the blood flow to the brain.	407 consecutive patients, who underwent carotid endarterectomy between August 1992 and April 2000, were considered. 35 patients presented an absolutely insufficient collateral circulation, demonstrated by important modifications of the electroencephalographic monitoring during the carotid clamp time. In these patients the endarterectomy was performed using a new femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt.	In all the cases in whom the femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt was positioned, the normalisation of electroencephalographic monitoring was achieved by regulating the blood flow with the interposed roller pump. The use and the placement of the shunt was simple and easy. None of the patients showed postoperative complications, except for one who had a stroke two days after surgery.	The results obtained, although to be confirmed by further studies, seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of our femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt, which was simple to use and safe.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,"<journal>Acta neurochirurgica</journal><title>Carotid endarterectomy: a new technique replacing internal shunts.</title><abstract>Carotid endarterectomy has been reported to increase the time free from cerebral ischemic events in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a high grade of stenosis of the internal carotid artery.

MSA is a degenerative neurological condition that includes olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Shy-Drager syndrome and striatonigral degeneration. The usual predominant features of MSA are cerebellar ataxia, autonomic dysfunction and Parkinsonism. Stridor is present in over one third of patients and has been reported previously as a presenting symptom in MSA: however previously reported patients have always gone on to develop other neurological symptoms. The usual investigations of bilateral abductor vocal fold paralysis caused by MSA will not reveal the pathological process and we believe that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the medulla and brain stem and autonomic function tests are probably the investigations of choice. It is a worthwhile exercise attempting to identify MSA as the cause of stridor as the prognosis is good in the medium term if appropriate support is offered.",Remaining,"<journal>The Journal of laryngology and otology</journal><title>Vocal fold abductor paralysis as a solitary and fatal manifestation of multiple system atrophy.</title><abstract>A patient is presented who had bilateral abductor vocal fold paralysis pathologically proven to be due to multiple system atrophy (MSA) in the absence of other neurological features.

Supplementum,"Childhood acute bacterial meningitis in the Sudan: an epidemiological, clinical and laboratory study.","The aims of the present study were to document the epidemiology, clinical features and complications of childhood acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) in The Sudan during both an inter-epidemic (endemic) period (1985-1986), and the 1988 serogroup A epidemic; and to examine the phenotypic and genetic similarities and differences of Neisseria meningitidis strains isolated in The Sudan and Sweden. A new enzyme immunoassay test (Pharmacia Meningitis EIA-Test) was evaluated as a potential rapid diagnostic method for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae (HI) type b, Neisseria meningitidis (MC) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNC). The test was found to have good sensitivity (0.86) and specificity (0.95) in the inter-epidemic period; and to be adaptable to the field work in The Sudan during the 1988 MC epidemic. During inter-epidemic (endemic) situations in The Sudan, greater than 90% of childhood ABM was caused by one of the three organisms, HI type b, MC and PNC. HI accounted for 57% of the cases. The peak incidence (76%) of HI cases was in infants (less than 12 months) similar to the situation in other African countries. The overall case fatality ratio was 18.6%. Prospective follow-up of survivors for 3-4 years revealed that an additional 43% either died or had permanent neurological complications, the most prevalent and persistent of which was sensorineural hearing loss recorded in 22% of long term survivors. Post-meningitic children were found to have significantly lower intelligence quotients (92.3 +/- 13.9) than their sibling controls (100.7 +/- 10.2, P = 0.029). Features of the large serogroup A sulphonamide resistant MC epidemic (February-August 1988) in Khartoum are described. An estimated annual incidence of 1,679/100,000 was recorded at the peak of the epidemic. The highest attack rate was in young children less than 5 years, as in many other African countries; nevertheless, a high morbidity was observed in adults (31% of the cases greater than or equal to 20 years). The clinical features, mortality (6.3%) and short term sequelae in Sudanese children were generally within the framework described for MC disease elsewhere. Detailed analysis of MC isolates from Sudan and Sweden by characterizing their electrophoretic enzyme types, DNA restriction endonuclease pattern and outer membrane proteins, revealed that serogroup A MC clone III-1 was responsible of The Sudan epidemic in 1988 and has been the dominant serogroup A organism in Sweden since 1973.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted and all supervisors of the university hospital service were interviewed. Routinely collected case registries were also reviewed.

249,18084303,Nature structural & molecular biology,Structural basis for synaptic adhesion mediated by neuroligin-neurexin interactions.,"The heterophilic synaptic adhesion molecules neuroligins and neurexins are essential for establishing and maintaining neuronal circuits by modulating the formation and maturation of synapses. The neuroligin-neurexin adhesion is Ca2+-dependent and regulated by alternative splicing. We report a structure of the complex at a resolution of 2.4 A between the mouse neuroligin-1 (NL1) cholinesterase-like domain and the mouse neurexin-1beta (NX1beta) LNS (laminin, neurexin and sex hormone-binding globulin-like) domain. The structure revealed a delicate neuroligin-neurexin assembly mediated by a hydrophilic, Ca2+-mediated and solvent-supplemented interface, rendering it capable of being modulated by alternative splicing and other regulatory factors. Thermodynamic data supported a mechanism wherein splicing site B of NL1 acts by modulating a salt bridge at the edge of the NL1-NX1beta interface. Mapping neuroligin mutations implicated in autism indicated that most such mutations are structurally destabilizing, supporting deficient neuroligin biosynthesis and processing as a common cause for this brain disorder.",Animal-other,"<journal>Nature structural & molecular biology</journal><title>Structural basis for synaptic adhesion mediated by neuroligin-neurexin interactions.</title><abstract>The heterophilic synaptic adhesion molecules neuroligins and neurexins are essential for establishing and maintaining neuronal circuits by modulating the formation and maturation of synapses.

90,16332401,Neurobiology of aging,Increased cholesterol in Abeta-positive nerve terminals from Alzheimer's disease cortex.,"Synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poorly understood but evidence suggests it is a key pathological event. In order to precisely detect stable synaptic changes, we have developed methods for flow cytometry analysis of synaptosomes prepared from cryopreserved AD samples, and have previously shown that amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulates in surviving presynaptic terminals in AD cortex. In the present experiments we have examined amyloid-containing terminals in more detail, first dual labeling synaptosomes from AD cortex for Abeta and a series of markers, and then using quadrant analysis to compare amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative terminals. Amyloid-positive synaptosomes were larger in size than amyloid-negatives (p<0.007), and significant increases were observed in mean fluorescence for the lipid raft markers cholesterol (27%; p<0.0005) and GM1 ganglioside (24%; p<0.005). SNAP-25 immunofluorescence was increased by 31% (p<0.0001) in amyloid-bearing terminals, consistent with a sprouting response to amyloid accumulation. These results suggest that Abeta accumulation in synaptic terminals may underly dysfunction prior to or independent of extracellular amyloid deposition.",Remaining,"<journal>Neurobiology of aging</journal><title>Increased cholesterol in Abeta-positive nerve terminals from Alzheimer's disease cortex.</title><abstract>Synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poorly understood but evidence suggests it is a key pathological event.
