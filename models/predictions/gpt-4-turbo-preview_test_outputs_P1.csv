1,15055442,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,Emerging tumor entities and variants of CNS neoplasms.,"Since the appearance in 2000 of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms, numerous descriptions of new entities or variants have appeared in the literature. In the group of neuronal and mixed glioneuronal neoplasms are lesions with distinctive morphological features that are still not included in a precise classification, including extraventricular neurocytoma, papillary glioneuronal tumor, rosette-forming glioneuronal of the fourth ventricle, glioneuronal with neuropil-like rosette, and DNT-like tumor of the septum pellucidum. The glioneuronal tumor with neuropil-like rosette and oligodendroglioma with neurocytic differentiation represent morphological variants of genetically proven diffuse gliomas. The lipoastrocytoma and the pilomixoid astrocytoma enlarge the group of astrocytic lesions. Rare, low-grade gliomas of the spinal cord with extensive leptomeningeal dissemination associated with unusual neuroimaging are described. The chordoid glioma of the third ventricle and the papillary tumor of the pineal region seem to be correlated by a common histogenesis from the specialized ependyma of the subcommissural organ. An embryonal tumor with neuropil and true rosettes combining features of neuroblastoma and ependymoblastoma is discussed. These new, recently described lesions indicate that the complex morphologic spectrum of CNS tumors is far from being completely delineated.",Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology</journal><title>Emerging tumor entities and variants of CNS neoplasms.</title><abstract>Since the appearance in 2000 of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms, numerous descriptions of new entities or variants have appeared in the literature.

2,11172874,Journal of affective disorders,Serotonergic gene expression and depression: implications for developing novel antidepressants.,"The development and configuration of several neural networks is dependent on the actions of serotonin (5-HT) acting through multiple hetero- and autoreceptor subtypes. During early brain development 5-HT modulates morphogenetic activities, such as neural differentiation, axon outgrowth, and synaptic modeling. In the adult brain, midbrain raphe serotonergic neurons project to a variety of brain regions and modulate a wide range of physiological functions. Several lines of evidence indicate that genetically determined variability in serotonergic gene expression, as it has been documented for the 5-HT transporter, influences temperamental traits and may lead to psychopathological conditions with increased anxiety, depression, and aggression. Investigation of the regulation of serotonergic gene transcription and its impact on neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis spur interest to identify serotonergic gene-related molecular factors underlying disease states and to develop more effective antidepressant treatment strategies. Gene targeting strategies have increasingly been integrated into investigations of brain function and along with the fading dogma of a limited capacity of neurons for regeneration and reproducibility, it is realized that gene transfer techniques using efficient viral vectors in conjunction with neuron-selective transcriptional control systems may also be applicable to complex disorders of the brain. Given the fact that the 5-HT system continues to be an important target for drug development and production, novel strategies aiming toward the modification of 5-HT function at the level of gene expression are likely to be exploited by enterprises participating actively in the introduction of alternative therapeutic approaches.",Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Journal of affective disorders</journal><title>Serotonergic gene expression and depression: implications for developing novel antidepressants.</title><abstract>The development and configuration of several neural networks is dependent on the actions of serotonin (5-HT) acting through multiple hetero- and autoreceptor subtypes.

There is strong evidence supporting prompt decompressive craniectomy after large hemispheric ischemic stroke as a means to reduce mortality. Nevertheless, functional outcomes can vary significantly. Clinical trials have traditionally judged these outcomes by a priori dichotomization without taking into account individual patient and caregiver preferences. If these are not incorporated into shared decision-making, there are significant risks in both directions, i.e. producing outcomes that may be judged as unacceptable to survivors, or not offering life-saving treatments to patients that according to their own values could be beneficial. In the absence of decision aids, we explore insights from decision theory and propose an expected utility-inspired approach as a supplementary navigating tool in the decision-making process. Four patient case scenarios are discussed as a demonstration of using individualized rankings of outcome preferences, and deriving expected utilities for interventions such as decompressive craniectomy versus medical therapy.

During the past 15 years, considerable research activity has focused on psychometrically identified individuals hypothesized to be en route to schizophrenia (i.e., putative schizotypes). The Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) has figured prominently in such prediction-oriented psychometric high-risk work. This report examines research using the PAS completed since 1987 that has established the instrument as a valid index for detecting liability for schizophrenia (or schizotypy) and as, arguably, the schizotypy index of choice for research. These results are presented and interpreted in light of Meehl's theoretical framework of schizotypy. Other measures of and assessment devices for schizotypy (schizophrenia-related liability) are identified. Of these other measures, the Chapmans' Magical Ideation Scale and the schizophrenia liability index of Moldin and colleagues are particularly well established. Methodologic suggestions for future psychometric high-risk and other work using objective measures of schizotypic psychopathology are offered.

11,30119850,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,State-of-the-art review on automated lumen and adventitial border delineation and its measurements in carotid ultrasound.,"Accurate, reliable, efficient, and precise measurements of the lumen geometry of the common carotid artery (CCA) are important for (a) managing the progression/regression of atherosclerotic build-up and (b) the risk of stroke. The image-based degree of stenosis in the carotid artery and the plaque burden can be predicted using the automated carotid lumen diameter (LD)/inter-adventitial diameter (IAD) measurements from B-mode ultrasound images. The objective of this review is to present the state-of-the-art methods and systems for the measurement of LD/IAD in CCA based on automated or semi-automated strategies. Further, the performance of these systems is compared based on various metrics for its measurements.	The automated algorithms proposed for the segmentation of carotid lumen are broadly classified into two different categories as: region-based and boundary-based. These techniques are discussed in detail specifying their pros and cons. Further, we discuss the challenges encountered in the segmentation process along with its quantitative assessment. Lastly, we present stenosis quantification and risk stratification strategies.	Even though, we have found more boundary-based approaches compared to region-based approaches in the literature, however, the region-based strategy yield more satisfactory performance. Novel risk stratification strategies are presented. On a patient database containing 203 patients, 9 patients are identified as high risk patients, whereas 27 patients are identified as medium risk patients.	We have presented different techniques for the lumen segmentation of the common carotid artery from B-mode ultrasound images and measurement of lumen diameter and inter-adventitial diameter.

20,1480765,Progress in brain research,"Brain banking and the human hypothalamus--factors to match for, pitfalls and potentials.","The study of an increasing number of processes occurring in the human brain can be carried out on autopsy material. The availability of this material, whether fresh, frozen or fixed, makes it possible to develop methodologies for studying the neuroanatomical and neurochemical aspects of the human brain. It has also become possible in recent years to correlate functional changes with neurochemical changes and with neuroanatomical abnormalities in disease states. Some compounds and structures are damaged irreversibly within minutes after death and some brain components are known to disintegrate within seconds. This led to the widespread idea that autopsy material would not be suitable for basic research purposes and would not supply the necessary answers on the various fundamental questions regarding processes occurring in normal or diseased brain. However, from data published in recent years in which autopsy material has been routinely used, it becomes more and more evident that this is a misconception. There is an increasing number of reports based on the use of normal and pathological human brain tissue obtained by autopsies in spite of the fact that there is a worrying continuous decline in autopsy rate which causes serious concern among scientists world-wide (Anderson and Hill, 1989). It also became evident that when using the proper fixation procedures, sufficient structural integrity is retained in the tissue to allow morphological and morphometrical studies (Swaab and Uylings, 1988). Electron microscopic examination of synaptosomal preparations from post-mortem human brain showed them to be only slightly less pure than preparations from fresh tissue although there was some degree of damage (Hardy et al., 1982). Agonal state effects the stability of brain compounds and causes brain hypoxia. This again forms a tremendous difficulty for the study of human neurological and psychiatric diseases as one of the frequent causes of death is bronchopneumonia which leads to brain hypoxia and results in pronounced lactic acidosis. The Netherlands Brain Bank has succeeded to partly circumvent some of the serious problems encountered in providing human tissue for research by performing rapid autopsies with an average post-mortem delay of 2-4 h. This has become possible by a close collaboration of numerous nursing homes in Amsterdam and its vicinity and with the neuropathologists of the Free University in Amsterdam. We also measure the pH of the tissue as indicator of agonal state in order to reveal unsuitable specimens.

This has become possible by a close collaboration of numerous nursing homes in Amsterdam and its vicinity and with the neuropathologists of the Free University in Amsterdam. We also measure the pH of the tissue as indicator of agonal state in order to reveal unsuitable specimens. The human hypothalamus contains various nuclei manifesting a wide variety of changes in different conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</abstract>","{""gpt_label"": ""Remaining""}",Remaining

Defects in primary cilia lead to a myriad of diseases in humans such as obesity and cancers. In the mature brain, both neurons and astrocytes contain a single primary cilium. Although neuronal primary cilia are not directly involved in synaptic communication, their pathophysiological impacts on obesity and mental disorders are well recognized. In contrast, research on astrocytic primary cilia lags far behind. Currently, little is known about their functions and molecular pathways in the mature brain. Unlike neurons, postnatal astrocytes retain the capacity of cell division and can become reactive and proliferate in response to various brain insults such as epilepsy, ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative β-amyloid plaques. Since primary cilia derive from the mother centrioles, astrocyte proliferation must occur in coordination with the dismantling and ciliogenesis of astrocyte cilia.

Options to avoid prolonged dying are limited since advanced dementia patients cannot qualify for Medical Aid in Dying. Physicians and judges can insist on clear and convincing evidence that the patient wants to die-which many advance directives cannot provide. Proxies/agents' substituted judgment may not be concordant with patients' requests. While advance directives can be patients' last resort to attain a peaceful and timely dying consistent with their lifelong values, success depends on their being effective and acceptable. A single flaw can provide opponents justification to refuse the directive's requests to cease assisted feeding.	This article considers 24 common advance directive flaws in four categories. Process flaws focus on how patients express their end-of-life wishes. Content flaws reflect drafters' selection of conditions and interventions, and how they are described. Inherent flaws can make advance directives unacceptable to authorities concerned about premature dying. Strategies are needed to compel physicians to write needed orders and to prevent third parties from sabotaging these orders after they are  implemented. The article includes excerpts from 'dementia-specific' directives or supplements that exemplify each flaw-mostly from the US and Europe. No directive critiqued here included an effective strategy to resolve this long-debated bioethical conflict: the past directive requests 'Cease assisted feeding' but the incapacitated patient apparently expresses the desire to 'Continue assisted feeding.' Some opponents to the controversial request, cease assisted feeding, use this conflict as a conceptual wedge to practice hard paternalism. This article proposes a protocol to prevent this conflict from emerging. These strategies may prevent authorities from requiring patients to fulfill authorities' additional clinical criteria as a prerequisite to honor the requests in patients directives.	This critique of flaws may serve as a guide to drafting and to selecting effective and acceptable advance directives for dementia. It also poses several bioethical and clinical questions to those in authority: Does your paternalistic refusal to honor patients' wishes respect their self-determination?

31,19432386,Dialogues in clinical neuroscience,Multiple rare variants in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders.,"Recent studies in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) support an important role for multiple rare variants in these conditions. This is a clinically important finding, as, with the demonstration that a significant proportion of ASDs are the result of rare, etiological genetic variants, it becomes possible to make use of genetic testing to supplement behavioral analyses for an earlier diagnosis. As it appears that earlier interventions in ASDs will produce better outcomes, the development of genetic testing to augment behaviorally based evaluations in ASDs holds promise for improved treatment. Furthermore, these rare variants involve synaptic and neuronal genes that implicate specific pathways, cells, and subcellular compartments in ASDs, which in turn will suggest novel therapeutic approaches in ASDs. Of particular recent interest are the synaptic cell adhesion and associated molecules, including neurexin 1, neuroligin 3 and 4, and SHANK3, which implicate glutamatergic synapse abnormalities in ASDs.

To evaluate suspected abnormal events, primary care physicians must first be familiar with normal behaviors, movements and breathing patterns. Abnormal nocturnal events can then be categorized as nocturnal seizure, parasomnia, sleep-related movement disorder or sleep-related breathing disorder. Diagnoses in the above categories can be made clinically; however, it is important to know when to refer for additional evaluation. Comprehensive literature review was undertaken of nocturnal and sleep-related disorders. This guide reviews nocturnal seizures, normal and abnormal nonepileptic movements and behaviors, discusses broad indications for referral for electroencephalography (EEG) or polysomnography (PSG), and guides counseling and management for patients and their families, ultimately aiding in interpretation of both findings and prognosis. Epilepsy syndromes can result in seizures during sleep or adjacent periods of wakefulness. Parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders tend to also occur in childhood and may be distinguished clinically. Referral to additional specialists for specific studies including EEG or PSG can be necessary, while other times a knowledgeable and vigilant clinician can contribute to a prompt diagnosis based on clinical features. Nocturnal events often can be managed with parental reassurance and watchful waiting, but treatment or evaluation may be needed.

56,29802210,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",Neuroprotection via AT2 receptor agonists in ischemic stroke.,"Stroke is a devastating disease that afflicts millions of people each year worldwide. Ischemic stroke, which accounts for ~88% of cases, occurs when blood supply to the brain is decreased, often because of thromboembolism or atherosclerotic occlusion. This deprives the brain of oxygen and nutrients, causing immediate, irreversible necrosis within the core of the ischemic area, but more delayed and potentially reversible neuronal damage in the surrounding brain tissue, the penumbra. The only currently approved therapies for ischemic stroke, the thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and the endovascular clot retrieval/destruction processes, are aimed at restoring blood flow to the infarcted area, but are only available for a minority of patients and are not able in most cases to completely restore neurological deficits. Consequently, there remains a need for agents that will protect neurones against death following ischemic stroke. Here, we evaluate angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 (AT2) receptor agonists as a possible therapeutic target for this disease. We first provide an overview of stroke epidemiology, pathophysiology, and currently approved therapies. We next review the large amount of preclinical evidence, accumulated over the past decade and a half, which indicates that AT2 receptor agonists exert significant neuroprotective effects in various animal models, and discuss the potential mechanisms involved. Finally, after discussing the challenges of delivering blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeable AT2 receptor agonists to the infarcted areas of the brain, we summarize the evidence for and against the development of these agents as a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.",Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Clinical science (London, England : 1979)</journal><title>Neuroprotection via AT2 receptor agonists in ischemic stroke.</title><abstract>Stroke is a devastating disease that afflicts millions of people each year worldwide.

66,31443692,BMC neurology,Remote ischemic conditioning improves cognition in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.,"Subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) is very common among the older people, but has no approved treatment. Preclinical trials show that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) reduces recurrence of ischemic stroke. We hypothesize that RIC may also be an effective therapy for patients with SIVD.	Thirty-seven consecutive SIVD cases were enrolled in this randomized control study. Eighteen RIC patients underwent five brief cycles of conditioning (bilateral upper limb compression at 200 mmHg) followed by reperfusion twice daily over 6 consecutive months. Nineteen control patients underwent the same process, but at a pressure of 60 mmHg which caused no restriction on the blood flow of the upper limb. The primary outcome measures were changes in neuropsychological assessments. The secondary outcomes included the changes in high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentration, white matter lesion volume (WMLV), diffusion tension imaging (DTI) metrics of white matter. All data were collected at baseline and follow-up.	A significant treatment difference favoring RIC at 6 months was observed on performance of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Trail Making Test A and B (TMT-A & TMT-B), and Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO) (p < 0.05). The control group did not show much improvement after the treatment, and only with a slight change in HVLT-R and TMT-R (p < 0.05). Covariance analysis of efficacy between the two groups suggested that RIC patients performed better on JLO than control patients at the 6-month follow-up (RIC 23.10 vs. control 18.56; p = 0.013). Although DTI metrics were comparable, Hs-CRP levels and WMLV in RIC patients showed a declining trend.	Over the 6-month treatment period, we found that RIC was safe and effective for improving cognitive function in SIVD patients.

Weight control thus seems to be important after stroke, and methods for monitoring nutritional status need to be simple and non-invasive. Here we aimed to assess if the nutritional intervention altered body composition in men and women in this study cohort, and also to examine the correlation between the methods for assessing body-, fat- and fat-free mass.

The control group included subjects of matching age and sex with no ADHD, ASDs, or chronic disease and taking no vitamins. The hematological parameters of the patients, including MPV, vitamin B12, and vitamin D, were assessed. RESULTS The study included a total of 79 children and adolescents aged 2-18 years (32 females and 47 males). Of the patients, 36 were in the ADHD group, 18 in the ASDs group, and 25 in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in hematological parameters between the groups, but there were significant differences in terms of vitamin D and vitamin B12. The patient groups showed lower levels of vitamin B12 and vitamin D. In the ADHD group, there was a negative correlation between both vitamins and MPV (p<0.05). Partial correlation analysis of the ADHD group showed that MPV in particular was negatively correlated to vitamin D, and not to vitamin B12 (p: 0.03).

A commercial chiral derivatizing agent, trifluoroacetyl-prolyl chloride, is then added to the solution that is directly extracted with hexane and subsequently analyzed by GC/MS in SIM mode. R and S isomers of amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA and MDEA can be separated and detected with a limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mg for amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDA, and of 0.2 ng/mg for MDMA and MDEA. The method was then applied to 12 samples from suspected amphetamines abusers, showing the presence of both isomers of amphetamine and MDMA in one sample (27 and 1.5 ng/mg, respectively) and of MDMA in further eight samples, in concentrations ranging from traces to 2.7 ng/mg.

PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS). A total of 84 different mutations were detected, and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals. Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations, 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity (severe PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). Then, 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications. The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity. These patients are considered functionally hemizygous.	The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level. Cognitive performance (IQ) was also significantly related to genotype. The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96, respectively, whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84, respectively. Of the patients with PKU, 92% had been treated during childhood. Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations. Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for >6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group.	The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances.

86,19394958,Journal of psychiatric research,"Reduced neuronal expression of insulin-degrading enzyme in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients with haloperidol-treated, chronic schizophrenia.","Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a neutral thiol metalloprotease, which cleaves insulin with high specificity. Additionally, IDE hydrolyzes Abeta, glucagon, IGF I and II, and beta-endorphin. We studied the expression of IDE protein in postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia and controls because: (1) the gene encoding IDE is located on chromosome 10q23-q25, a gene locus linked to schizophrenia; (2) insulin resistance with brain insulin receptor deficits/receptor dysfunction was reported in schizophrenia; (3) the enzyme cleaves IGF-I and IGF-II which are implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease; and (4) brain gamma-endorphin levels, liberated from beta-endorphin exclusively by IDE, have been reported to be altered in schizophrenia. We counted the number of IDE immunoreactive neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, and the basal nucleus of Meynert of 14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 matched control cases. Patients had long-term haloperidol treatment. In addition, relative concentrations of IDE protein in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were estimated by Western blot analysis. There was a significantly reduced number of IDE expressing neurons and IDE protein content in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia compared with controls, but not in other brain areas investigated. Results of our studies on the influence of haloperidol on IDE mRNA expression in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, as well as the effect of long-term treatment with haloperidol on the number of IDE immunoreactive neurons in rat brain, indicate that haloperidol per se, is not responsible for the decreased neuronal expression of the enzyme in schizophrenics. Haloperidol however, might exert some effect on IDE, through changes of the expression levels of its substrates IGF-I and II, insulin and beta-endorphin. Reduced cortical IDE expression might be part of the disturbed insulin signaling cascades found in schizophrenia.

To assess the spatial and temporal expression patterns of transforming growth factor-beta1 and -beta2 (TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2) in the human spinal cord after traumatic injury.	Germany, Aachen, Aachen University Hospital.	Sections from human spinal cords from 4 control patients and from 14 patients who died at different time points after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) were investigated immunohistochemically.	In control cases, TGF-beta1 was confined to occasional blood vessels, intravascular monocytes and some motoneurons, whereas TGF-beta2 was only found in intravascular monocytes. After traumatic SCI, TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity was dramatically upregulated by 2 days after injury (the earliest survival time investigated) and was detected within neurons, astrocytes and invading macrophages. The staining was most intense over the first weeks after injury but gradually declined by 1 year. TGF-beta2 immunoreactivity was first detected 24 days after injury. It was located in macrophages and astrocytes and remained elevated for up to 1 year. In white matter tracts undergoing Wallerian degeneration, there was no induction of either isoform.	The early induction of TGF-beta1 at the point of SCI suggests a role in the acute inflammatory response and formation of the glial scar, while the later induction of TGF-beta2 may indicate a role in the maintenance of the scar.

Resilience, demographics, and psychopathology were measured at Time 1 and recent SLEs and current MDD and GAD were measured at Time 2.

90,27180681,Scientific reports,Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.,"DDX3X is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that has been implicated in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism including translation initiation and the assembly of stress granules (SGs). Recent genomic studies have reported recurrent DDX3X mutations in numerous tumors including medulloblastoma (MB), but the physiological impact of these mutations is poorly understood. Here we show that a consistent feature of MB-associated mutations is SG hyper-assembly and concomitant translation impairment. We used CLIP-seq to obtain a comprehensive assessment of DDX3X binding targets and ribosome profiling for high-resolution assessment of global translation. Surprisingly, mutant DDX3X expression caused broad inhibition of translation that impacted DDX3X targeted and non-targeted mRNAs alike. Assessment of translation efficiency with single-cell resolution revealed that SG hyper-assembly correlated precisely with impaired global translation. SG hyper-assembly and translation impairment driven by mutant DDX3X were rescued by a genetic approach that limited SG assembly and by deletion of the N-terminal low complexity domain within DDX3X. Thus, in addition to a primary defect at the level of translation initiation caused by DDX3X mutation, SG assembly itself contributes to global translation inhibition. This work provides mechanistic insights into the consequences of cancer-related DDX3X mutations, suggesting that globally reduced translation may provide a context-dependent survival advantage that must be considered as a possible contributor to tumorigenesis.",Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Scientific reports</journal><title>Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.</title><abstract>DDX3X is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that has been implicated in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism including translation initiation and the assembly of stress granules (SGs).

The data suggest that pathological changes we have observed in the cerebellum in ET are a part of the pathophysiological cascade of events in both forms of the disease and that both groups seem to reach the same pathological endpoints at a similar age of death.</abstract>","{""gpt_label"": ""Human-case-report""}",Human-case-report
92,27138817,Psychiatry research,Psychopathological factors associated with problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use in a sample of adolescents in Germany.,"In Germany, high prevalence rates for problematic alcohol use and problematic Internet use in adolescents were reported. The objective of the present study was to identify psychopathological factors associated with these two behavior patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation assessing psychopathological factors for both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use in the same sample of adolescents. We surveyed a sample of 1444 adolescents in Germany regarding problematic alcohol use, problematic Internet use, psychopathology and psychological well-being. We conducted binary logistic regression analyses. 5.6% of the sample showed problematic alcohol use, 4.8% problematic Internet use, and 0.8% both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Problematic alcohol use was higher in adolescents with problematic Internet use compared to those without problematic Internet use. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms were statistically significant associated with both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Prosocial behavior was related to problematic Internet use. Male gender and less peer problems were associated with problematic alcohol use.

98,12244316,Nature genetics,"Mutation of TDP1, encoding a topoisomerase I-dependent DNA damage repair enzyme, in spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy.","Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) repairs covalently bound topoisomerase I-DNA complexes and is essential for preventing the formation of double-strand breaks that result when stalled topoisomerase I complexes interfere with DNA replication in yeast. Here we show that a deficiency of this DNA repair pathway in humans does not predispose to neoplasia or dysfunctions in rapidly replicating tissues, but instead causes spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) by affecting large, terminally differentiated, non-dividing neuronal cells. Using genome-wide linkage mapping and a positional candidate approach in a Saudi Arabian family affected with autosomal recessive SCAN1, we identified a homozygous mutation in TDP1 (A1478G) that results in the substitution of histidine 493 with an arginine residue.

Fifty-five individuals with AS (aged < 5 years: n = 16, 5-12 years: n = 27, ≥ 18 years: n = 12; deletion genotype: n = 40, nondeletion genotype: n = 15) and 20 typically developing children (aged 1-12 years) were enrolled across six USA sites. Several clinical outcome assessments and digital health technologies were tested, together with overnight 19-lead electroencephalography (EEG) and additional polysomnography (PSG) sensors. Participants were assessed at baseline (Clinic Visit 1), 12 months later (Clinic Visit 2), and during intermittent home visits.	The participants achieved high completion rates for the clinical outcome assessments (adherence: 89-100% [Clinic Visit 1]; 76-91% [Clinic Visit 2]) and varied feasibility of and adherence to digital health technologies.

Furthermore, the observed AS EEG phenotype of excess delta-band power was consistent with prior reports.	Although feasible clinical outcome assessments and digital health technologies are reported herein, further improved assessments of meaningful AS change are needed.

Few currently available diagnostic tests have significantly improved this early uncertainty, while the 'gold standard' diagnosis continues to require clinical dementia in life and the presence of pathologic brain lesions of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain at autopsy. Here, the inflammatory agonist bradykinin, a small nano-peptide, that induces PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 in fibroblasts, was applied to punch-biopsy-obtained human skin fibroblasts. Quantitative imaging of the phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 bands was then used in a ratio that is mathematically configured into an AD-Biomarker Index (AD-Index).

From March 2006 to July 2008, MRI was performed on 135 pregnant women whose fetuses diagnosed as fetal ventriculomegaly at an average of 32 gestational weeks in Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University. Mild ventriculomegaly was defined when the width of unilateral or bilateral fetal cerebral ventricle triangle was 10-15 mm, moderate ventriculomegaly 16-20 mm and severe ventriculomegaly >20 mm. We introduced the Denver developmental screening test (DDST) to follow-up the mild ventriculomegaly and normal babies, confirmed by MRI, at 6-12 months after birth and a case-control study was conducted. The intelligence and growth of these infants were analyzed.

119,33076949,Molecular brain,Brain transcriptome analysis reveals subtle effects on mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis of mutations in the SORL1 gene implicated in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease.,"To prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we must understand its molecular basis. The great majority of AD cases arise sporadically with a late onset after 65 years of age (LOAD). However, rare familial cases of AD can occur due to dominant mutations in a small number of genes that cause an early onset prior to 65 years of age (EOfAD). As EOfAD and LOAD share similar pathologies and disease progression, analysis of EOfAD genetic models may give insight into both subtypes of AD. Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) is genetically associated with both EOfAD and LOAD and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between both forms of AD. Currently, the role of SORL1 mutations in AD pathogenesis is unclear. To understand the molecular consequences of SORL1 mutation, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the orthologous gene in zebrafish. We generated an EOfAD-like mutation, V1482Afs, and a putatively null mutation, to investigate whether EOfAD-like mutations in sorl1 display haploinsufficiency by acting through loss-of-function mechanisms. We performed mRNA-sequencing on whole brains, comparing wild type fish with their siblings heterozygous for EOfAD-like or putatively loss-of-function mutations in sorl1, or transheterozygous for these mutations. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small number of differentially expressed genes due to the sorl1 genotypes. We also performed enrichment analysis on all detectable genes to obtain a more complete view on changes to gene expression by performing three methods of gene set enrichment analysis, then calculated an overall significance value using the harmonic mean p-value. This identified subtle effects on expression of genes involved in energy production, mRNA translation and mTORC1 signalling in both the EOfAD-like and null mutant brains, implying that these effects are due to sorl1 haploinsufficiency. Surprisingly, we also observed changes to expression of genes occurring only in the EOfAD-mutation carrier brains, suggesting gain-of-function effects. Transheterozygosity for the EOfAD-like and null mutations (i.e. lacking wild type sorl1), caused apparent effects on iron homeostasis and other transcriptome changes distinct from the single-mutation heterozygous fish. Our results provide insight into the possible early brain molecular effects of an EOfAD mutation in human SORL1.

However, rare familial cases of AD can occur due to dominant mutations in a small number of genes that cause an early onset prior to 65 years of age (EOfAD). As EOfAD and LOAD share similar pathologies and disease progression, analysis of EOfAD genetic models may give insight into both subtypes of AD. Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) is genetically associated with both EOfAD and LOAD and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between both forms of AD. Currently, the role of SORL1 mutations in AD pathogenesis is unclear. To understand the molecular consequences of SORL1 mutation, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the orthologous gene in zebrafish. We generated an EOfAD-like mutation, V1482Afs, and a putatively null mutation, to investigate whether EOfAD-like mutations in sorl1 display haploinsufficiency by acting through loss-of-function mechanisms. We performed mRNA-sequencing on whole brains, comparing wild type fish with their siblings heterozygous for EOfAD-like or putatively loss-of-function mutations in sorl1, or transheterozygous for these mutations. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small number of differentially expressed genes due to the sorl1 genotypes. We also performed enrichment analysis on all detectable genes to obtain a more complete view on changes to gene expression by performing three methods of gene set enrichment analysis, then calculated an overall significance value using the harmonic mean p-value. This identified subtle effects on expression of genes involved in energy production, mRNA translation and mTORC1 signalling in both the EOfAD-like and null mutant brains, implying that these effects are due to sorl1 haploinsufficiency. Surprisingly, we also observed changes to expression of genes occurring only in the EOfAD-mutation carrier brains, suggesting gain-of-function effects. Transheterozygosity for the EOfAD-like and null mutations (i.e. lacking wild type sorl1), caused apparent effects on iron homeostasis and other transcriptome changes distinct from the single-mutation heterozygous fish. Our results provide insight into the possible early brain molecular effects of an EOfAD mutation in human SORL1. Differential effects of heterozygosity and complete loss of normal SORL1 expression are revealed.</abstract>","{

120,28928448,Scientific reports,Intact animacy perception during chase detection in ASD.,"We explored the strength of implicit social inferences in adolescents with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a chasing paradigm in which participants judged the absence/presence of a chase within a display of four seemingly randomly moving dots. While two of these dots always moved randomly, the two others could fulfill the role of being either the chasing (wolf) or chased (sheep) dot. In the chase-present (but not the chase-absent) trials the wolf displayed chasing behavior defined by the degree to which the dot reliably moved towards the sheep (chasing subtlety). Previous research indicated that chasing subtlety strongly influenced chase detection in typically developing (TD) adults. We intended to replicate and extend this finding to adolescents with and without ASD, while also adding either a social or a non-social cue to the displays. Our results confirmed the importance of chasing subtlety and indicated that adding social, but not non-social, information further improved chase detection performance.

123,33351671,Environmental health perspectives,The Association between Residential Green Space in Childhood and Development of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"Access to green space has been hypothesized to have a beneficial impact on children's mental well-being and cognitive development. The underlying mechanisms of the mental health benefits of green space are not fully understood, but different pathways have been suggested, such as the psychologically restoring capacities of green space, the ability to facilitate physical activity and social cohesion, and the mitigation of exposure to air pollution.	In this nationwide cohort study, we investigated associations between residential green space in early childhood and a clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	The cohort included individuals, who were born in Denmark between 1992 and 2007 (n=814,689) and followed for a diagnosis of ADHD from age 5, during the period 1997-2016. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of vegetation greenness surrounding each residential address in a quadratic area of 210m×210m in which the residence was located in the center of the quadrate. Individual exposure to green space was calculated as the average of NDVI surrounding each individual's residential address (or addresses if more than one) between birth and the fifth birthday. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ADHD, according to exposure level and adjusted for calendar time, age, sex, parental socioeconomic status, neighborhood level socioeconomic status, and urbanicity.	Individuals living in areas defined by sparse green vegetation (lowest decile of NDVI) had an increased risk of developing ADHD, compared with individuals living in areas within the highest decile of NDVI (IRR=1.55; 95% CI: 1.46, 1.65). Adjusting for the known confounders attenuated the result, but the association remained (IRR=1.20; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.28).	Our findings suggest that lower levels of green space in residential surroundings, during early childhood, may be associated with a higher risk of developing ADHD. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6729.",Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Environmental health perspectives</journal><title>The Association between Residential Green Space in Childhood and Development of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Population-Based Cohort Study.</title><abstract>Access to green space has been hypothesized to have a beneficial impact on children's mental well-being and cognitive development.

Evaluation of olfactory and gustatory functions was performed on patients through the 'Sniffin' Sticks' method in order to assess the olfactory threshold, the capacity for discriminating and identifying olfactory stimuli, and the overall olfactory function, and through the 'taste strip' kit method in order to assess the gustatory function. The results were processed statistically to assess differences between patients with anorexia nervosa, patients with bulimia nervosa and healthy controls.	The two groups of patients with bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa showed a poorer olfactory and gustatory function compared with the healthy controls; discrimination of olfactory stimuli and overall olfactory function were reduced in both samples, as well as the overall gustatory function and the perception of bitter stimuli, whereas olfactory threshold was altered only in patients with bulimia nervosa. In both samples, scores for olfactory function fell within the range of hyposmia.	Our data suggest that patients with eating disorders have an altered perception of olfactory and gustatory stimuli. The alterations observed are worth further investigation.</abstract>","{""gpt_label"": ""Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention""}",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
127,3681758,Journal of psychiatric research,A Markov model for predicting levels of psychiatric service use in borderline and antisocial personality disorders and bipolar type II affective disorder.,"This study examines the relationship between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the use of psychiatric services in a naturalistic follow-up comparison with antisocial personality disorder and bipolar type II affective disorder. In the first follow-up series, borderline psychopathology was associated with higher levels of psychiatric service use (emergency, daycare, and inpatient). Markov analyses indicated that the transition between levels of psychiatric service use followed a stationary, second order process (i.e. the immediate past and current service use, predicted use on the next follow-up, and the relationship did not depend on the point in time examined in the follow-up series). Further, the transition probabilities generated from this model did not depend significantly on diagnosis. Predictions from the Markov model about the cumulative probability that subjects would use the highest level of psychiatric services were tested on a second series of follow-ups on the same subjects 20 months later. The model-based predictions (starting from the observed levels in the first two follow-ups of the second series) clustered into three groups, of high, middle, and low predicted probabilities. The subject group with the lowest predicted likelihood had a cumulative probability of 0.19 for using emergency, daycare, or inpatient hospitalization by 22 months of follow-up, whereas the group with the highest likelihood (containing a disproportionate number of BPD subjects) had a cumulative observed probability of 0.80. The Markov model generated from this second series supported the stationarity of the transition process.

The four boys presented in our study, between 10 and 17 years of age, with classical Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, who all had a duplicated proteolipid protein gene, invariably manifested type I despite their various clinical severities. Follow-up MRI after an interval of 5 years and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in three of the patients. The white matter on the last MRI was unchanged in volume and the distribution of high-intense areas. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed no abnormal peaks. These results were consistent with the lack of definite neurologic regression in the last 5 years and with the pathologic characteristics of well-preserved axons and the absence of sclerosis.

We used the Office for National Statistics to determine the population at risk. We computed crude and sex-age standardised FEP incidence per 100,000 person-years. We used Poisson regression to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) across the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 321 incident cases of FEP were identified during the COVID-19 pandemic, accounting for a crude rate of 69.8 (95% CI 62.1-77.4) per 100,000 person-years. The crude rate for the year before was 47.5 (95% CI 41.2-53.8). The incidence variation between the two years accounted for an adjusted IRR of 1.45 (95% CI 1.22-1.72).

147,31408379,Traffic injury prevention,Driving/riding after alcohol and marijuana use among young adults: Is residing with family protective?,"Objective: Driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs increases the risk of motor vehicle fatalities, the leading cause of death among young adults. The current study documented the prevalence of driving after alcohol and marijuana use in the past 2 weeks as well as the prevalence of riding with a driver who had used each substance during that time frame. We tested whether young adults who lived with family members (i.e., their parents or their children) were less likely to engage in these behaviors. Methods: Participants aged 18-25 who resided in nonmetropolitan areas in the United States (N = 1,131; 55% female, Mage = 22.6) completed an online survey. Multivariate logistic regressions examined alcohol- and marijuana-related driving and riding behaviors adjusting for demographic factors. Interactions tested whether associations varied by gender. Results: In the 2 weeks prior to the survey, 17% of participants drove after drinking alcohol and 21% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking. The prevalence of driving after marijuana use was 11%, and 16% of the sample had ridden with a driver who had been using marijuana. Participants who lived with their parents were less likely to ride with a driver who had been using alcohol or marijuana (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 0.71 and 0.55, respectively). Living with parents was also associated negatively with driving after both substances, but these associations were no longer significant when controlling for substance use frequency and driving frequency. Surprisingly, the odds of driving after marijuana use were over 2 times larger for young adults who lived with their children. For women, but not men, residing with children decreased the odds of driving and riding after alcohol use. Conclusions: Living with parents protects against riding after substance use among young adults. Prevention programs should target young adults who live independently or those transitioning away from the parental home. Furthermore, given the higher rates of driving after marijuana use among young adult parents, this group should be educated about the risks associated with this behavior.",Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Traffic injury prevention</journal><title>Driving/riding after alcohol and marijuana use among young adults: Is residing with family protective?</title><abstract>Objective: Driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs increases the risk of motor vehicle fatalities, the leading cause of death among young adults.

The prevalence of driving after marijuana use was 11%, and 16% of the sample had ridden with a driver who had been using marijuana. Participants who lived with their parents were less likely to ride with a driver who had been using alcohol or marijuana (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 0.71 and 0.55, respectively). Living with parents was also associated negatively with driving after both substances, but these associations were no longer significant when controlling for substance use frequency and driving frequency. Surprisingly, the odds of driving after marijuana use were over 2 times larger for young adults who lived with their children. For women, but not men, residing with children decreased the odds of driving and riding after alcohol use. Conclusions: Living with parents protects against riding after substance use among young adults. Prevention programs should target young adults who live independently or those transitioning away from the parental home. Furthermore, given the higher rates of driving after marijuana use among young adult parents, this group should be educated about the risks associated with this behavior.</abstract>","<title>Driving/riding after alcohol and marijuana use among young adults: Is residing with family protective?</title><abstract>Objective: Driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs increases the risk of motor vehicle fatalities, the leading cause of death among young adults. The current study documented the prevalence of driving after alcohol and marijuana use in the past 2 weeks as well as the prevalence of riding with a driver who had used each substance during that time frame. We tested whether young adults who lived with family members (i.e., their parents or their children) were less likely to engage in these behaviors. Methods: Participants aged 18-25 who resided in nonmetropolitan areas in the United States (N = 1,131; 55% female, Mage = 22.6) completed an online survey.

148,2625165,European journal of vascular surgery,Extracranial carotid artery aneurysms.,"Aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries are uncommon vascular lesions. During the period 1976 to 1986 we encountered 18 extracranial carotid aneurysms in 14 patients. The aneurysms were atherosclerotic (12 in 9 patients), congenital (3 in 2 patients), mycotic (1) and secondary (false aneurysms) after previous carotid surgery (2 in 2 patients). The patients presented with neurological symptoms (11) or a pulsating mass in the neck (2). In one patient the aneurysm was detected accidentally during angiography. From this study it became clear that 'carotid aneurysm' is not a well defined entity. The 'normal' configuration of the carotid bulb with its usually larger diameter, is in part a cause of the problem of definition. A recently described technique for predicting normal vessel diameters in stenosing lesions of the carotid arteries was retrospectively applied to all our patients with aneurysms. With these measurements, made on standard preoperative angiograms, it was possible to quantify the degree of dilatation, and confirm the diagnosis of aneurysm. Eleven of the 14 patients were operated on without mortality, no neurological deficits were seen as a result of the operation and minimal morbidity occurred in six patients. From this study we conclude that surgical correction of accessible carotid artery aneurysms is a relatively safe procedure and these lesions should be operated on irrespective of symptoms. This is the first report that gives clear guidelines for measuring dilatation of the extracranial carotid arteries and based on these guidelines we suggest criteria for the discrimination between physiological dilatation and pathological aneurysm formation, the latter condition being an indication for operation.",Remaining,0,0,"<journal>European journal of vascular surgery</journal><title>Extracranial carotid artery aneurysms.</title><abstract>Aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries are uncommon vascular lesions.

Pathological changes occur mostly in the pallidium and stratium.	We report seven patients with a new form of chronic manganese toxicity due to long-term intravenous use of a solution consisting of ephedrine, acetylsalicylic acid and potassium permanganate as a psycho-stimulant, popularly known as 'Russian Cocktail'.	The age of the patients ranged between 19 and 31 years, and the duration of substance abuse was between nine and 106 months. The onset of symptoms from first use ranged seven to 35 months. The initial symptom was impaired speech followed by gait disturbance and bradykinesia. In addition to these symptoms, choreic movements, ataxia presenting as backward falls and dystonia were also seen. Serum and urine samples revealed high levels of manganese. Hyperintense lesions on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were seen in bilateral basal ganglia and brainstem, dentate nuclei, features consistent with manganese intoxication.

159,36314672,Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology,Effects of woody plant encroachment by eastern redcedar on mosquito communities in Oklahoma.,"Woody plant encroachment into grasslands is occurring worldwide, affecting ecosystems in ways that likely influence mosquito-borne disease transmission. In the U.S. Great Plains, encroachment by eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) (ERC) may be expanding conducive habitat for mosquitoes and their hosts, but few studies have evaluated associations between ERC encroachment and West Nile virus (WNV). To test the hypotheses that mosquito abundance and WNV-infected mosquitoes increase with increasing ERC cover, we collected mosquitoes in 32 sites in Oklahoma reflecting various ERC encroachment stages. We found support for our first hypothesis, as mean abundance of Aedes albopictus increased significantly with ERC cover. However, Psorophora columbiae and Anopheles quadrimaculatus abundance decreased with increasing ERC. There was no significant association with ERC for other mosquito species. We could not test our second hypothesis due to low WNV prevalence, but the only detected WNV-infected pool of mosquitoes (Cx. tarsalis) was collected in ERC. Our results suggest ERC encroachment increases abundance of at least one medically important mosquito species, but further research is needed to clarify how encroachment affects ecology of the entire WNV disease system through changes to vector and host communities, vector-host interactions, and thus disease transmission and prevalence. Understanding relationships between woody plant encroachment and the nidus of infection for mosquito-borne diseases will be crucial for targeting public health efforts, including land management activities that limit and/or eradicate woody plant encroachment, particularly in areas with high levels of disease risk.",Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology</journal><title>Effects of woody plant encroachment by eastern redcedar on mosquito communities in Oklahoma.</title><abstract>Woody plant encroachment into grasslands is occurring worldwide, affecting ecosystems in ways that likely influence mosquito-borne disease transmission.

166,15115064,Development and psychopathology,Affect dysregulation in the mother-child relationship in the toddler years: antecedents and consequences.,"The purpose of this study was to examine child, maternal, and family antecedents of children's early affect dysregulation within the mother-child relationship and later cognitive and socioemotional correlates of affect dysregulation. Children's affect dysregulation at 24 and 36 months was defined in the context of mother-child interactions in semistructured play and toy cleanup. Dyads were classified as dysregulated at each age based on high negative affect. Affect dysregulation was associated with less maternal sensitivity and stimulation, more maternal depressive symptoms, and lower family income over the first 36 months of life. Children with early negative mood, lower Bayley Mental Development Index scores and insecure-avoidant (15 months) or insecure-resistant attachment classifications (36 months) were more likely to be in an affect-dysregulated group. Controlling for family and child variables, affect-dysregulated children had more problematic cognitive, social, and behavioral outcomes at 54 months, kindergarten, and first grade. The findings are discussed in terms of the early role played by parents in assisting children with affect regulation, the reciprocal nature of parent-child interactions, and the contribution of affect regulation to children's later cognitive, social, and behavioral competence.",Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Development and psychopathology</journal><title>Affect dysregulation in the mother-child relationship in the toddler years: antecedents and consequences.</title><abstract>The purpose of this study was to examine child, maternal, and family antecedents of children's early affect dysregulation within the mother-child relationship and later cognitive and socioemotional correlates of affect dysregulation.

168,32563266,BMC public health,Correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.,"In Korea, higher education has rapidly grown influenced by sociocultural tradition. Parents invest a significant portion of their household income in their children's education. Private education has been considered to greatly affect students' psychology and behavior. However, past research has largely neglected to study parents who pay these costs. Since household income and education level are important determinants of socioeconomic status (SES), education expenditures are likely to cause depressive symptoms. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.	Data were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS, 2015, 2018). The sample analyzed consisted of 397 and 337 fathers and 403 and 370 mothers in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The independent variable in this study was the proportion of private education cost. This proportion was calculated by dividing each household's private education costs by its equivalized household disposable income (EHDI) and multiplying this number by 100. The main dependent variable was parental responses to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-11 (CESD-11). Using a generalized linear model, we investigated the effects of the proportion of private education cost on parental depression.	The results showed that fathers with higher proportions of private education cost exhibited higher CESD-11 scores compared to fathers with lower proportions cost (moderate: β = 0.419, S. E = 0.164, p = 0.0105; high: β = 0.476, S. E = 0.178, p = 0.0076), indicating that a higher ratio of private education cost may negatively affect depression in fathers. However, there was no discernable correlation between mothers' CESD-11 scores and the proportion of private education cost (moderate: β = - 0.078, S. E = 0.250, p = 0.7555; high: β = 0.003, S. E = 0.215, p = 0.9882).	These results may be explained by the tendency for fathers to experience greater economic burdens than mothers in patriarchal Korean society.",Remaining,0,0,"<journal>BMC public health</journal><title>Correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.</title><abstract>In Korea, higher education has rapidly grown influenced by sociocultural tradition.

Of the later, 13 had severe obstructions of the extracranial portion of the carotid artery, four had obstruction of the intracranial portion, and five had severe aortic valve insufficiency (AI), with more than 60% regurgitation in all cases. Measurements could be performed within an accuracy of about +/- 20% under clinical conditions and revealed perfusion values of 5 to 8 ml per second (300 to 480 ml per minute) in healthy persons. Of the patients, values less than 3 ml per second (180 ml per minute) were detected in nine, between 3 and 5 mm per second (180 to 300 ml per minute) in four, and normal values in another four, while significant backflow was observed only in patients with severe AI. Consecutive blood flow profiles were recorded every 4 msec; these demonstratedthat, for a period lasting from 40 msec to 280 msec after the initial systolic peak, blood flow decelerated more rapidly in the central portion of the vessel lumen than near the wall. This situation was present in all healthy persons and in most patients with pathological flow. In patients with AI, flow reinversion from reverse to normal began near the vessel wall, while in the middle third of the vessel lumen, blood was still flowing backward. These phenomena seem to be in agreement with the theoretical and experimental findings of Wormersly, Müller, and others.

A significant increase in the experience of headaches (p=0.003) as well as chest pain (p=0.004) during bipolar depression was predicted by a major increase in rejection sensitivity when depressed, i.e., state rejection sensitivity.

We then investigate how these concepts help to understand brain dynamics in mental disorders. We find that in both first episode and long-term schizophrenia, reduced functional connectivity of early visual and related temporal cortex areas is associated with increased temporal variability of the functional connectivity, consistent with decreased stability of attractor networks related to sensory processing. In ADHD, we find these functional connectivities are increased and their temporal variability is decreased, and relate this to increased engagement with visual sensory input as manifest in high screen time usage in ADHD.

For stress detection algorithms focused on short-duration time windows, there is potential benefit in including HRV features derived from the detection of smaller peaks within the ECG waveform: the P, Q, S, and T waves. However, the potential drawback of using these small peaks is their smaller magnitude and subsequent susceptibility to noise, making them more difficult to reliably detect. In this work, we demonstrate the potential benefits of including smaller waves within binary stress classification using a pre-existing data set of ECG recordings from 57 participants (aged 18-40) with a self-reported fear of spiders during exposure to videos of spiders. We also present an analysis of the performance of an automated peak detection algorithm and the reliability of detection for each of the smaller parts of the ECG waveform. We compared two models, one with only R peak features and one with small peak features. They were similar in precision, recall, F1, area under ROC curve (AUC), and accuracy, with the greatest differences less than the standard deviations of each metric.

For stress detection algorithms focused on short-duration time windows, there is potential benefit in including HRV features derived from the detection of smaller peaks within the ECG waveform: the P, Q, S, and T waves. However, the potential drawback of using these small peaks is their smaller magnitude and subsequent susceptibility to noise, making them more difficult to reliably detect. In this work, we demonstrate the potential benefits of including smaller waves within binary stress classification using a pre-existing data set of ECG recordings from 57 participants (aged 18-40) with a self-reported fear of spiders during exposure to videos of spiders. We also present an analysis of the performance of an automated peak detection algorithm and the reliability of detection for each of the smaller parts of the ECG waveform. We compared two models, one with only R peak features and one with small peak features. They were similar in precision, recall, F1, area under ROC curve (AUC), and accuracy, with the greatest differences less than the standard deviations of each metric. There was a significant difference in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which represented the information loss of the model. The inclusion of novel small peak features made the model 4.29×1028 times more probable to minimize the information loss, and the small peak features showed higher regression coefficients than the R peak features, indicating a stronger relationship with acute psychological stress. This difference and further analysis of the novel features suggest that small peak intervals could be indicative of independent processes within the heart, reflecting a psychophysiological response to stress that has not yet been leveraged in stress detection algorithms.</abstract>","{""gpt_label"": ""Remaining""}",Remaining

195,25080285,Brain : a journal of neurology,Genetic impact on cognition and brain function in newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: ICICLE-PD study.,"Parkinson's disease is associated with multiple cognitive impairments and increased risk of dementia, but the extent of these deficits varies widely among patients. The ICICLE-PD study was established to define the characteristics and prevalence of cognitive change soon after diagnosis, in a representative cohort of patients, using a multimodal approach. Specifically, we tested the 'Dual Syndrome' hypothesis for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, which distinguishes an executive syndrome (affecting the frontostriatal regions due to dopaminergic deficits) from a posterior cortical syndrome (affecting visuospatial, mnemonic and semantic functions related to Lewy body pathology and secondary cholinergic loss). An incident Parkinson's disease cohort (n = 168, median 8 months from diagnosis to participation) and matched control group (n = 85) were recruited to a neuroimaging study at two sites in the UK. All participants underwent clinical, neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments. The three neuroimaging tasks (Tower of London, Spatial Rotations and Memory Encoding Tasks) were designed to probe executive, visuospatial and memory encoding domains, respectively. Patients were also genotyped for three polymorphisms associated with cognitive change in Parkinson's disease and related disorders: (i) rs4680 for COMT Val158Met polymorphism; (ii) rs9468 for MAPT H1 versus H2 haplotype; and (iii) rs429358 for APOE-ε2, 3, 4. We identified performance deficits in all three cognitive domains, which were associated with regionally specific changes in cortical activation. Task-specific regional activations in Parkinson's disease were linked with genetic variation: the rs4680 polymorphism modulated the effect of levodopa therapy on planning-related activations in the frontoparietal network; the MAPT haplotype modulated parietal activations associated with spatial rotations; and APOE allelic variation influenced the magnitude of activation associated with memory encoding. This study demonstrates that neurocognitive deficits are common even in recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease, and that the associated regional brain activations are influenced by genotype. These data further support the dual syndrome hypothesis of cognitive change in Parkinson's disease. Longitudinal data will confirm the extent to which these early neurocognitive changes, and their genetic factors, influence the long-term risk of dementia in Parkinson's disease. The combination of genetics and functional neuroimaging provides a potentially useful method for stratification and identification of candidate markers, in future clinical trials against cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease.",Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Brain : a journal of neurology</journal><title>Genetic impact on cognition and brain function in newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: ICICLE-PD study.</title><abstract>Parkinson's disease is associated with multiple cognitive impairments and increased risk of dementia, but the extent of these deficits varies widely among patients.

198,35124278,Journal of proteomics,"Isotopic N,N-dimethyl leucine tags for absolute quantification of clusterin and apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. In the past decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to biomarker discovery for early diagnosis and treatment of AD. Herein, this study aims to quantify clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in blood samples from AD patients and evaluate these two proteins as potential biomarkers in AD diagnosis. In-house synthesized 5-plex isotopic N,N-dimethyl leucine (iDiLeu) tags were used to label target peptide standards at different concentrations to construct standard curves. Our study revealed that the levels of CLU and APOE exhibited clear differences in male vs. female AD groups but not in male vs. female non-AD groups. In contrast, the levels of serum CLU and APOE did not show statistically significant differences in the AD groups and non-AD groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) with CLU and APOE showed some separation between the AD and non-AD participants. Significance: Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for sex-related pathways, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: As blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis are cost-effective and introduce less invasiveness, discovery and validation of biomarkers in the blood samples of AD patients have become a hot topic in Alzheimer's and dementia research. Thus far, amyloid β (Aβ), total-tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in blood show great accuracy and specificity in diagnosis of AD. However, the underlying mechanism of AD pathology remains to be elusive and complex. Besides these well studied proteins, many other proteins, such as clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) have also been found to be related to AD development. It has been implicated that these two proteins are involved in Aβ clearance and deposition. In this study, we measure the absolute concentrations of these two proteins in blood and shed some light on the potential roles of CLU and APOE in AD pathology. Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for specific pathways between different genders, leading to personalized medicine in the future.

Results of the study indicated that 40 adolescents (14.3%) scored at or above a raw score of 77 for depression based on the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS). This suggests that these adolescents should be identified for further evaluation. Results of the Stepwise Linear Regression indicated that a history of sexual abuse was the most potent factor in predicting depression. These findings highlight the importance of screening concurrently for depression and a history of sexual abuse in family planning and other healthcare settings.</abstract>","{

LCA was applied to parent-report DSM-IV ADHD symptom profiles of N=2,848 child and adolescent Australian twins and compared to North American findings. Separate models were fitted for females (N= 1,432) and males (N= 1,416).	The most congruent latent ADHD classes across samples included a non-symptomatic class, three mild-moderate and two severe classes. Also present within samples was a rare hyperactive-impulsive class and a unique class, the structure of which was idiosyncratic across samples. Mean symptom endorsement and individual symptom endorsement probabilities for each of the stable classes were similar across samples. Consistent with previous findings, there was substantial overlap between the DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes with the severe inattentive and severe combined latent classes. However, DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes were distributed over several latent classes in each sample, and a substantial proportion of individuals with no DSM-IV diagnosis were also assigned to these severe classes.

215,17018553,Journal of pediatric psychology,Family socialization of adolescent's self-reported cigarette use: the role of parents' history of regular smoking and parenting style.,"To examine the main and interactive effects of parental history of regular cigarette smoking and parenting style on adolescent self-reported cigarette use.	Predictors of adolescent self-reported cigarette use, including parents' history of regular cigarette smoking and two dimensions of parenting behavior, were analyzed in a sample of 934 predominately Caucasian (96.3%) parent-adolescent dyads. Families were drawn from the control group of a randomized control trial aimed at preventing adolescent substance use.

223,20309621,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,The heavy burden of psychiatric comorbidity in youth with autism spectrum disorders: a large comparative study of a psychiatrically referred population.,The objective of the study was to systematically examine patterns of psychiatric comorbidity in referred youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) including autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Consecutively referred children and adolescents to a pediatric psychopharmacology program were assessed with structured diagnostic interview and measures of psychosocial functioning. Comparisons were made between those youth satisfying diagnostic criteria for ASD and age and sex matched youth without ASD referred to the same clinical program. 9.3% (217/2323) of the referred youth (age range: 3-17 years) met DSM-III-R criteria for ASD. ASD youth suffered from significantly higher number of comorbid disorders than comparisons (6.4 ± 2.7 vs. 5.2 ± 2.9; p < 0.001). Ninety-five percent of the youth with ASD had three or more comorbid psychiatric disorders and 74% had five or more comorbid disorders. ASD youth were also more functionally impaired and required extra-assistance in school and therapeutic interventions at higher rates than age and sex matched non-ASD referred youth. Youth with ASD have high levels of psychiatric comorbidity and dysfunction comparable to the referred population of youth without ASD. These findings emphasize the heavy burden of psychiatric comorbidity afflicting youth with ASD and may be important targets for intervention.,Remaining,0,0,<journal>Journal of autism and developmental disorders</journal><title>The heavy burden of psychiatric comorbidity in youth with autism spectrum disorders: a large comparative study of a psychiatrically referred population.</title><abstract>The objective of the study was to systematically examine patterns of psychiatric comorbidity in referred youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) including autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.

224,28419491,Psychophysiology,Intrinsic neural activity differences among psychotic illnesses.,"Individuals with psychosis have been reported to show either reduced or augmented brain responses under seemingly similar conditions. It is likely that inconsistent baseline-adjustment methods are partly responsible for this discrepancy. Using steady-state stimuli during a pro/antisaccade task, this study addressed the relationship between nonspecific and stimulus-related neural activity, and how these activities are modulated as a function of cognitive demands. In 98 psychosis probands (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychosis), neural activity was assessed during baseline and during a 5-s period in preparation for the pro/antisaccade task. To maximize the ability to identify meaningful differences between psychosis subtypes, analyses were conducted as a function of subgrouping probands by standard clinical diagnoses and neurobiological features. These psychosis 'biotypes' were created using brain-based biomarkers, independent of symptomatology (Clementz et al.,). Psychosis probands as a whole showed poor antisaccade performance and diminished baseline oscillatory phase synchrony. Psychosis biotypes differed on both behavioral and brain measures, in ways predicted from Clementz et al. (). Two biotype groups showed similarly deficient behavior and baseline synchrony, despite diametrically opposed neural activity amplitudes. Another biotype subgroup was more similar to healthy individuals on behavioral and brain measures, despite the presence of psychosis. This study provides evidence that (a) consideration of baseline levels of activation and synchrony will be essential for a comprehensive understanding of neural response differences in psychosis, and (b) distinct psychosis subgroups exhibit reduced versus augmented intrinsic neural activity, despite cognitive performance and clinical similarities.",Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Psychophysiology</journal><title>Intrinsic neural activity differences among psychotic illnesses.</title><abstract>Individuals with psychosis have been reported to show either reduced or augmented brain responses under seemingly similar conditions.

We hypothesized that depressive symptoms are also linked to low levels of secondary control (i.e., influencing the psychological impact of objective conditions by adjusting oneself to fit them). To test the hypothesis, we developed the Secondary Control Scale for Children (SCSC), examined its psychometrics, and used it to assess the secondary control-depression symptomatology association.

233,16319418,Journal of lipid research,Increased sphingomyelin content impairs HDL biogenesis and maturation in human Niemann-Pick disease type B.,"We previously reported that human Niemann-Pick Disease type B (NPD-B) is associated with low HDL. In this study, we investigated the pathophysiology of this HDL deficiency by examining both HDL samples from NPD-B patients and nascent high density lipoprotein (LpA-I) generated by incubation of lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) with NPD-B fibroblasts. Interestingly, both LpA-I and HDL isolated from patient plasma had a significant increase in sphingomyelin (SM) mass (approximately 50-100%). Analysis of LCAT kinetics parameters (V(max) and K(m)) revealed that either LpA-I or plasma HDL from NPD-B, as well as reconstituted HDL enriched with SM, exhibited severely decreased LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification. Importantly, we documented that SM enrichment of NPD-B LpA-I was not attributable to increased cellular mass transfer of SM or unesterified cholesterol to lipid-free apoA-I. Finally, we obtained evidence that the conditioned medium from HUVEC, THP-1, and normal fibroblasts, but not NPD-B fibroblasts, contained active secretory sphingomyelinase (S-SMase) that mediated the hydrolysis of [(3)H]SM-labeled LpA-I and HDL(3). Furthermore, expression of mutant SMase (DeltaR608) in CHO cells revealed that DeltaR608 was synthesized normally but had defective secretion and activity. Our data suggest that defective S-SMase in NPD leads to SM enrichment of HDL that impairs LCAT-mediated nascent HDL maturation and contributes to HDL deficiency. Thus, S-SMase and LCAT may act in concert and play a crucial role in the biogenesis and maturation of nascent HDL particles.",Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Journal of lipid research</journal><title>Increased sphingomyelin content impairs HDL biogenesis and maturation in human Niemann-Pick disease type B.</title><abstract>We previously reported that human Niemann-Pick Disease type B (NPD-B) is associated with low HDL.

The objective was to investigate GM changes in older depressed and similar aged healthy subjects using two different methods, cortical thickness in frontal lobe structures and voxel-based morphometry (VBM).	Sixty eight subjects participated (30 healthy comparison subjects, 38 depressed) and underwent 3T T1 MR imaging as well as clinical and cognitive assessments. Frontal cortical thickness was measured using FreeSurfer while VBM was undertaken using the DARTEL algorithm in SPM8. Group differences in cortical thickness and GM volumes were assessed using ANCOVA. Effects of cortical thickness and VBM results on cognitive and depression variables were also investigated.	No significant differences in frontal lobe cortical thickness were observed between groups (F(1, 62) ≤ 2.7, p ≥ 0.1). In addition, no significant relationships of cortical thickness on cognitive and depression scores were identified (partial correlation |r'|=0.01-0.31, p ≥ 0.06). VBM showed that GM volumes were indistinguishable between groups but significant age effects were apparent, independent of diagnosis.	Results suggest that cortical GM changes in late life depression (LLD) are similar to healthy older subjects and appear to be related to age rather than cognitive or depressive symptoms.

To test the hypothesis that visual acuity is impaired in ALS, we compared three measures of visual acuity in ALS patients (n = 25) attending a multidisciplinary ALS clinic and age matched control subjects (n = 25). Bilateral monocular and binocular visual acuities were assessed using high contrast (black letters on white background) and low contrast (2.5%, 1.25% grey letters on white background) visual acuity charts under controlled lighting conditions following refraction. Binocular summation was calculated as the difference between binocular and best monocular acuity scores. There were no associations between binocular or monocular high contrast visual acuity or low contrast visual acuity and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis (generalized estimating equation models accounting for age). Binocular summation was similar in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and control subjects. There was a small magnitude association between increased duration of ALS symptoms and reduced 1.25% low contrast visual acuity.

Because these disabling symptoms are generally not well tolerated by caregivers, patients with these symptoms tend to be institutionalized earlier than patients without them. The identification of protective and risk factors for neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD would facilitate the development of more specific treatments for these symptoms and thereby decrease morbidity and mortality in AD. The E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a well-documented risk factor for the development of AD. However, genetic association studies of the APOE 4 allele and BPS in AD have produced conflicting findings.	This study investigates the association between APOE and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a large sample of clinically well-characterized subjects with probable AD (n=790) who were systematically evaluated using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Behavioral Rating Scale for Dementia (BRSD).	Our study found that hallucinations were significantly more likely to occur in subjects with no APOΕ4 alleles than in subjects with two Ε4 alleles (15% of subjects and 5% of subjects, respectively; p=.0066), whereas there was no association between the occurrence of delusions, aberrant motor behavior, or agitation and the number of Ε4 alleles. However, 94% of the subjects with hallucinations also had delusions (D+H).	These findings suggest that in AD the Ε4 allele is differentially associated with D+H but not delusions alone.

Recently, many researchers demonstrated downregulation of PRSS8 in cancer tissues as well as its tumor suppressor role in cancer development. However, the biological functions of PRSS8 in glioma remain unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated a decreased expression of PRSS8 in glioma tissues and cell lines. PRSS8 upregulation inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, xenograft experiments showed that PRSS8 overexpression suppressed glioma cell growth in vivo. We also found that upregulated PRSS8 reduced the protein expression levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR in glioma cells. Taken together, our study demonstrated that overexpression of PRSS8 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

In the present experiments we have examined amyloid-containing terminals in more detail, first dual labeling synaptosomes from AD cortex for Abeta and a series of markers, and then using quadrant analysis to compare amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative terminals. Amyloid-positive synaptosomes were larger in size than amyloid-negatives (p<0.007), and significant increases were observed in mean fluorescence for the lipid raft markers cholesterol (27%; p<0.0005) and GM1 ganglioside (24%; p<0.005).

Here, we examined signaling events in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and searched for therapeutic agents that could overcome TRAIL resistance in glioma cells. TRAIL induced apoptosis through death receptor 5 (DR5) and was mediated by caspase-8-initiated extrinsic and intrinsic mitochondrial pathways in sensitive glioma cell lines. TRAIL also triggered apoptosis in resistant glioma cell lines through the same pathways, but only if the cells were pretreated with chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin, camptothecin and etoposide. Previous studies suggested that this was due to an increase in DR5 expression in wild-type TP53 cells, but this mechanism did not account for cells with mutant TP53.

Amino acid composition and sequence analyses of purified FA2 revealed identity to the amino acid sequence of the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human type I procollagen. Gel filtration of AF as well as purified FA2 demonstrated two molecular forms of FA2, which during gel filtration were elucidated corresponding to MW of approximately 100 kDa and 30 kDa. The molecular forms were referred to as the high molecular component (FA2-HM) and low molecular component (FA2-LM), respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis (reducing and nonreducing conditions) showed a MW of 27 kDa for both FA2-HM and FA2-LM. Mass spectrometry analysis however revealed a MW of 14.343 +/- 3Da. Proteins with collagenous domains often reveal aberrant behaviour both in gel filtration and SDS-PAGE and this phenomenon may account for the apparent higher MW of FA2 observed using these techniques compared to mass spectrometry and amino acid composition/sequence analyses. A polyclonal, monospecific rabbit antibody raised against FA2 was used in immunohistochemical localization studies. Due to the obvious association of FA2 to the BM structure in adult and fetal skin, it was initially referred to as a BM associated component. However, FA2 was immunologically distinct from the well established BM components and moreover, the diffuse distribution of FA2 along the BM differed from linear localization of BM components (e.g. collagen type IV and laminin). The identification of FA2 as the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human procollagen type I has the implication that in the immunohistochemical investigations the anti-FA2 may not distinguish between the free propeptide and procollagen type I.

Consequently, a significant increase in endosome/lysosome-dependent degradation of internalized glutamate receptors was observed in ALS2(-/-) neurons. These phenotypes closely resembled the endosomal trafficking abnormalities induced by a constitutively active form of Rab5 in wild-type neurons.

253,16696567,Chemical research in toxicology,Ebselen induced C6 glioma cell death in oxygen and glucose deprivation.,"Studies have shown that ebselen is an antiinflammatory and antioxidative agent. Its protective effect has been investigated in oxidative stress related diseases such as cerebral ischemia in recent years. However, experimental evidence also shows that ebselen causes cell death in several different cell types. Whether ebselen will have a beneficial or detrimental effect on cells under ischemic condition is not known. Herein, we studied the effect of ebselen on C6 glioma cells under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro ischemic model. We found that ebselen significantly enhanced cell death after 3 h of OGD as observed by lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cellular morphological changes. Further studies revealed that depletion of cellular glutathione level by the combined action of ebselen and OGD played a role in enhanced cell death as demonstrated by the following evidence: (1) cellular GSH was significantly depleted by the combined effort of ebselen and OGD, compared to that of ebselen or OGD insult alone; (2) exogenous addition of N-acetyl cysteine completely diminished the cell damage induced by ebselen and OGD; (3) supplement of glucose, which provides cellular reducing agents and thus maintains cellular GSH level, to the OGD medium diminished C6 cell damage induced by ebselen.

254,22363216,PLoS genetics,GTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of Parkinson's disease-associated LRRK2 is regulated by ArfGAP1.,"Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common cause of autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and also contribute to idiopathic PD. LRRK2 encodes a large multi-domain protein with GTPase and kinase activity. Initial data indicates that an intact functional GTPase domain is critically required for LRRK2 kinase activity. PD-associated mutations in LRRK2, including the most common G2019S variant, have variable effects on enzymatic activity but commonly alter neuronal process morphology. The mechanisms underlying the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of LRRK2 GTPase and kinase activity, and the pathogenic effects of familial mutations, are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a novel functional interaction between LRRK2 and ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 1 (ArfGAP1). LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 interact in vitro in mammalian cells and in vivo in brain, and co-localize in the cytoplasm and at Golgi membranes. PD-associated and functional mutations that alter the GTPase activity of LRRK2 modulate the interaction with ArfGAP1. The GTP hydrolysis activity of LRRK2 is markedly enhanced by ArfGAP1 supporting a role for ArfGAP1 as a GTPase-activating protein for LRRK2. Unexpectedly, ArfGAP1 promotes the kinase activity of LRRK2 suggesting a potential role for GTP hydrolysis in kinase activation. Furthermore, LRRK2 robustly and directly phosphorylates ArfGAP1 in vitro. Silencing of ArfGAP1 expression in primary cortical neurons rescues the neurite shortening phenotype induced by G2019S LRRK2 overexpression, whereas the co-expression of ArfGAP1 and LRRK2 synergistically promotes neurite shortening in a manner dependent upon LRRK2 GTPase activity. Neurite shortening induced by ArfGAP1 overexpression is also attenuated by silencing of LRRK2. Our data reveal a novel role for ArfGAP1 in regulating the GTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of LRRK2; reciprocally, LRRK2 phosphorylates ArfGAP1 and is required for ArfGAP1 neuronal toxicity.

SAH and cerebral lymphatic blockage (CLB) models in adult New Zealand rabbits were used. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from experimental animals 5 d after modeling and was added into cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The neurons were randomly divided into blank control, normal CSF, SAH, and SAH+CLB groups. At different points of time, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was detected by colorimetric method. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of neurons. Expressions of Bax and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) were determined by immunohistochemical staining. LDH leakage detection revealed that, compared with blank control group, CSF from normal rabbit did not damage the neurons, whereas the leakage of LDH increased in SAH group and SAH+CLB group. The increasing effect was more obvious in SAH+CLB group than that in SAH group. Normal CSF did not induce the apoptosis of neurons, whereas neuron apoptosis was found in SAH group and the apoptosis was even more severe in SAH+CLB group. Bax and Hsp70 protein expressions were found in both SAH and SAH+CLB groups. Expression of Bax protein in SAH+CLB group was stronger than that in SAH group in a time-dependent manner. At 0.5 h and 1 h, the expression of Hsp70 protein in SAH+CLB group was stronger than that in SAH group, whereas the expression became weaker at 2 h and 4 h.

Using a modified RE-AIM framework, the indicators that are considered important for effective and sustainable implementation were defined.	A systematic literature search was undertaken in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cinahl, followed by a hand search for key papers. The included publications were mapped based on the dimensions of the RE-AIM framework: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.	Fifty-four papers met the inclusion criteria and described various psychosocial interventions. A distinction was made between studies that used one and studies that used multiple implementation strategies. This review shows that to improve their knowledge, caregivers needed at least multiple implementation strategies, only education is not enough. For increasing a more person-centered attitude, different types of knowledge transfer can be effective. Little consideration is given to the adoption of the method by caregivers and to the long-term sustainability (maintenance).	This review shows that in order to successfully implement a psychosocial method the use of multiple implementation strategies is recommended. To ensure sustainability of a psychosocial care method in daily nursing home care, innovators as well as researchers should specifically pay attention to the dimensions Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of the RE-AIM implementation framework.</abstract>","{

266,35090475,Harm reduction journal,Interim opioid agonist treatment for opioid addiction: a systematic review.,"Opioid use disorder is a public health problem and treatment variability, coverage and accessibility poses some challenges. The study's objective is to review the impact of interim opioid agonist treatment (OAT), a short-term approach for patients awaiting standard OAT, in terms of treatment retention, access to standard OAT, quality of life and satisfaction with treatment.	We conducted a systematic review searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL up to May 2020. Due to variability between studies and outcome measurements, we did not pool effect estimates and reported a narrative synthesis of findings rating their certainty according to GRADE.	We identified 266 unique records and included five randomized trials with some limitations in risk of bias and one observational study limited by selection bias. The studies assessed similar approaches to interim OAT but were compared to three different control conditions. Four studies reported on treatment retention at 4 months or less with no significant differences between interim OAT and waiting list or standard OAT. Two studies reported treatment retention at 12 months with no differences between interim OAT and standard OAT. Two trials assessed access to standard OAT and showed significant differences between interim OAT and waiting list for standard OAT. We rated the quality of evidence for these outcomes as moderate due to the impact of risk of bias. Data on quality of life or satisfaction with treatment was suboptimal.	Interim OAT is likely more effective than a waiting list for standard OAT in access to treatment, and it is probably as effective as standard OAT regarding treatment retention.

Hematomas smaller than 4 cm in diameter as well as those located in several brain regions were found to tend easily to resorption at the control computer tomography due to which we preferred treating them using conservative therapeutic methods. This therapeutic approach to the patients with hematomas is supported by the statistical analysis.

This was a single-centre, single-arm prospective study, enrolling all patients with localised prostate cancer scheduled for RARP with five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function scores of >17, from July 2015 to September 2016. All patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. The demographics, perioperative, postoperative and complications data were evaluated. Potency recovery data were evaluated in particular and any sign/symptom of local allergy/intolerance to the ChiMe was recorded and evaluated.	In all, 140 patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. Applying the ChiMe was easy in almost all the cases, and did not compromise the safety of the procedure. None of the patients reported signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging.	In our experience, ChiMe applied on the NVBs after NS-RARP was feasible and safe, without compromising the duration, difficulty or complication rate of the 'standard' procedure. No patients had signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. A comparative cohort would have added value to the study.

In order to cope with this problem, lumbar nerve blocking techniques developed by Meelhuysen and major and minor psoas muscle blocking techniques developed by Awad have been used in combination with physical therapies. Based on these techniques, we conducted major and minor psoas muscle phenol block (motor point block or intramuscular nerve block) under ultrasonic monitoring. Phenol block was conducted in nine patients with cerebral infarction (13 blocking procedures) and three with spinal cord injuries (six blocking procedures) while keeping them in a lateral position with the operation side upside. The beginning of the femoral nerves and part of the lumbar artery were visualized by ultrasound in some patients. As a result of the improvement of hip flexor spasticity, the range of hip joint motion (determined by the Mundale technique, prone hip extension and Thomas test) improved shortly after blocking. When physical therapy was conducted after blocking, improvement of skin care management was observed in eight cases, ability to keep in a stable sitting position in nine, improvement of a standing posture in three, increases in the ability to walk in two and alleviation of pain in three.

Overall, 33 patients with organic erectile dysfunction underwent penile implant surgery during the study period. The Titan OTR inflatable penile implants were inserted using a penoscrotal approach. Patient and partner satisfaction was assessed with the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) questionnaire.	One implant was removed because of infection, and three patients underwent revision surgery due to problems with autoinflation, deflation, and a displaced reservoir, respectively.

280,35714700,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,Provision of Home-Based Primary Care to Individuals With Intellectual and/or Developmental Disability Is Associated With a Lower Hospitalization Rate Than a Traditional Primary Care Model.,"The objective of this study was to determine if providing home-based primary care (HBPC) to individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) was associated with a lower hospitalization rate than a control group receiving traditional primary care.	Individuals with IDD living in supported residential settings in Ohio were offered HBPC. Individuals electing HBPC made up the intervention group. Those who did not opt for HBPC continued to receive traditional primary care services and made up the control group. Hospitalizations were tracked in both groups.	The 757 study participants had IDD diagnoses and received residential support services throughout the study period.	Annualized hospitalization rate was determined in both groups and was compared using generalized estimating equations while controlling for patients' age and hospitalization rate in the year prior to the study.	The results showed that group membership had a significant effect on the hospitalization rate (Wald χ[2] = 20.71, P < .01). Being in the control group was associated with a 2.12-fold increase in annual hospitalization rate for a given patient. The overall population hospitalization rate was 329 hospitalizations per 1000 per year in the HBPC-receiving individuals and 619 hospitalizations per 1000 per year in the control group.

Illness severity and duration are unrelated to outcomes from cognitive behaviour therapy.,"The present study aimed to examine whether Anorexia Nervosa (AN) illness severity or duration is associated with retention or treatment response in outpatient, enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-E).	Patients with a confirmed AN diagnosis (N = 134) completed measures of eating disorder symptoms and quality of life, and had their BMI objectively measured before, during, and after treatment. We evaluated whether illness severity or duration predicted treatment outcomes, using longitudinal regression models.	Greater levels of illness severity and duration were not associated with poorer treatment outcomes.	Patients with more severe or long-standing AN illness did just as well in CBT-E as any other patient starting treatment. Therefore, classifying individuals as 'severe and enduring' appears to lack clinical utility in CBT-E.

The purpose of this study is to compare these three different treatment options in terms of local response, survival, and quality of life. From June 1995 to July 1998, 70 lung cancer patients with new diagnosed single brain metastasis were treated with either WBRT alone (n = 29), or SRS alone (n = 23), or the combination of both methods (n = 18). Multiple endpoints, including survival, freedom from local progression (FFLP), freedom from new brain metastasis (FFNBM), local control, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and causes of death, were measured from the date of treatment completion and compared using univariate and multivariate analyses. For patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, the median survivals were 5.7, 9.3, and 10.6 months, the median FFLP were 4.0, 6.9, and 8.6 months, the median FFNBM were 4.1, 6.7, and 8.6 months, and the local response rates were 55.6, 87.0, and 88.9%, respectively. Four of the 29 patients treated with WBRT-alone continued with progression of disease. The post treatment KPS showed improvement in 41.4, 82.6, and 88.9% of patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, respectively. The progression of new and/or recurred metastatic brain tumor as the cause of death accounted for 51.7%, 50. 0%, and 28.3% of the patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that the significant differences among the three treatment arms were observed based on all of the above mentioned endpoints. However, the comparison between SRS-alone and SRS+WBRT groups indicated that adding WBRT only improves FFNBM (P = 0.0392). Cox regression analyses revealed no significant difference in both of the KPS (P = 0.1082) and causes of death (P = 0.081) among the three arms. Both SRS alone and SRS+WBRT seem better in prolonging life and improving quality of life than WBRT alone for patients with single brain metastasis from lung cancer. But the combined therapy did not show significant advantage over SRS alone in improving survival, enhancing local control, and quality of life except for a more favorable FFNBM.

These problems can lead to cascading effects on children's overall development. However, few studies have identified evidence-based interventions for this population.	A 6-year-old boy with bilateral HL presented to the clinic with significant behavioral challenges. These challenges (e.g., fatigued quickly, poor attention, and hyperactivity) were affecting the reliability of audiological testing to determine cochlear implant candidacy. Thus, the child was referred for Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) to address these behavioral challenges.	PCIT is an evidence-based intervention that has been shown to significantly improve externalizing behavior problems. This study describes how the Child-Directed Interaction phase of PCIT was tailored for a child with bilateral HL. The goal of the intervention was to reduce externalizing behaviors in order to reliably complete a cochlear implant evaluation. Post-intervention, significant improvements were noted in behavior, including a decrease in disruptive behavior to normal levels. This led to completion of previously unsuccessful audiological testing and determination of cochlear implant candidacy.	This study illustrates how PCIT was successfully tailored to one child with an HL. This is critical as children with HL are at risk for behavior problems, and effective interventions for disruptive behaviors in children with HL may lead to significant improvements in medical and psychosocial outcomes for children with HL and their families.</abstract>","{""gpt_label"": ""Human-case-report""}",Human-case-report

Treatment in supine position including field verification as a prerequisite for anesthesia without intubation.,"For craniospinal axis irradiation in young children sometimes anesthesia is required. In order to minimize risks from the anesthesist's point of view supine position would be preferable to standard prone position.

However, postoperative progressive spinal deformity complicates outcome in a subset of patients after surgery. We set out to determine whether the use of laminoplasty (LP) vs laminectomy (LM) has reduced the incidence of subsequent spinal deformity following intradural tumor resection at our institution.	We retrospectively reviewed the records of 238 consecutive patients undergoing resection of intradural tumor at a single institution. The incidence of subsequent progressive kyphosis or scoliosis, perioperative morbidity, and neurological outcome were compared between the LP and LM cohorts.	One hundred eighty patients underwent LM and 58 underwent LP. Patients were 46 +/- 19 years old with median modified McCormick score of 2. Tumors were intramedullary in 102 (43%) and extramedullary in 102 (43%). All baseline clinical, radiographic, and operative variables were similar between the LP and LM cohorts. LP was associated with a decreased mean length of hospitalization (5 vs 7 days; P = .002) and trend of decreased incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak (3% vs 9%; P = .14). Following LP vs LM, 5 (9%) vs 21 (12%) patients developed progressive deformity (P = .728) a mean of 14 months after surgery. The incidence of progressive deformity was also similar between LP vs LM in pediatric patients < 18 years of age (43% vs 36%), with preoperative scoliosis or loss of cervical/lumbar lordosis (28% vs 22%), or with intramedullary tumors (11% vs 11%).	LP for the resection of intradural spinal tumors was not associated with a decreased incidence of short-term progressive spinal deformity or improved neurological function.

[et al] = Zeitschrift fur Kinderchirurgie,Long-term neurodevelopmental impairment in neonates surgically treated for necrotizing enterocolitis: enterostomy associated with a worse outcome.,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) patients often have neurodevelopmental impairment, but the long-term follow-up data is limited. We determined whether surgical factors were of prognostic value for long-term neurodevelopment in children surviving surgery for NEC (SNEC).	SNEC patients born between 1996 and 2002 were tested for verbal (VIQ), performance (PIQ) and total (TIQ) intelligence using Wechsler's Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition, Dutch Version, and motor skills using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC). Neonatal and surgical data were obtained retrospectively to assess prognostic factors.	19 patients (12 boys), median age 9.9 years (range 6.2-13.1), gestational age 31.0 weeks (range 25.2-40), birth weight 1 250 g (range 780-3 175) were evaluated. Infants with an enterostomy (n=14) scored lower on intelligence than children with a primary anastomosis (n=5): VIQ 85 ± 12 vs. 101 ± 15, p=0.04; PIQ 79 ± 13 vs. 92 ± 11, p=0.06; TIQ 82 ± 11 vs. 97 ± 13, p=0.04. Motor skills were either suspect or clinically impaired in 74%. Clinical classification of results suggest more children in the enterostomy group had a performance rated as clinically impaired compared to the primary anastomosis group, although no statistical difference in M-ABC score was found. There were no differences between primary anastomosis and enterostomy patients with regard to gestational age, birth weight, comorbidities, preoperative Bell stage, residual small and large bowel lengths, inotropic medication, duration of ventilatory support, NICU and hospital stay, and physical exam data on follow-up. However, a selection bias could not be ruled out.	The results suggest that an enterostomy in SNEC patients could be associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes by the age of 6-13 years compared to a primary anastomosis, although the severity of illness was comparable between both groups. Further studies are needed to prevent selection bias and to elucidate the impact of abdominal surgical factors on neurodevelopmental outcome and the underlying pathophysiology.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0,"<journal>European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

SNEC patients born between 1996 and 2002 were tested for verbal (VIQ), performance (PIQ) and total (TIQ) intelligence using Wechsler's Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition, Dutch Version, and motor skills using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC). Neonatal and surgical data were obtained retrospectively to assess prognostic factors.	19 patients (12 boys), median age 9.9 years (range 6.2-13.1), gestational age 31.0 weeks (range 25.2-40), birth weight 1 250 g (range 780-3 175) were evaluated. Infants with an enterostomy (n=14) scored lower on intelligence than children with a primary anastomosis (n=5): VIQ 85 ± 12 vs. 101 ± 15, p=0.04; PIQ 79 ± 13 vs. 92 ± 11, p=0.06; TIQ 82 ± 11 vs. 97 ± 13, p=0.04. Motor skills were either suspect or clinically impaired in 74%. Clinical classification of results suggest more children in the enterostomy group had a performance rated as clinically impaired compared to the primary anastomosis group, although no statistical difference in M-ABC score was found. There were no differences between primary anastomosis and enterostomy patients with regard to gestational age, birth weight, comorbidities, preoperative Bell stage, residual small and large bowel lengths, inotropic medication, duration of ventilatory support, NICU and hospital stay, and physical exam data on follow-up. However, a selection bias could not be ruled out.	The results suggest that an enterostomy in SNEC patients could be associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes by the age of 6-13 years compared to a primary anastomosis, although the severity of illness was comparable between both groups. Further studies are needed to prevent selection bias and to elucidate the impact of abdominal surgical factors on neurodevelopmental outcome and the underlying pathophysiology.</abstract>","<title>Long-term neurodevelopmental impairment in neonates surgically treated for necrotizing enterocolitis: enterostomy associated with a worse outcome.</title><abstract>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) patients often have neurodevelopmental impairment, but the long-term follow-up data is limited.

301,35446941,Brain : a journal of neurology,Clearance of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prions in vivo by the Hsp70 disaggregase system.,"The metazoan Hsp70 disaggregase protects neurons from proteotoxicity that arises from the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. Hsp70 and its co-chaperones disassemble and extract polypeptides from protein aggregates for refolding or degradation. The effectiveness of the chaperone system decreases with age and leads to accumulation rather than removal of neurotoxic protein aggregates. Therapeutic enhancement of the Hsp70 protein disassembly machinery is proposed to counter late-onset protein misfolding neurodegenerative disease that may arise. In the context of prion disease, it is not known whether stimulation of protein aggregate disassembly paradoxically leads to enhanced formation of seeding competent species of disease-specific proteins and acceleration of neurodegenerative disease. Here we have tested the hypothesis that modulation of Hsp70 disaggregase activity perturbs mammalian prion-induced neurotoxicity and prion seeding activity. To do so we used prion protein (PrP) transgenic Drosophila that authentically replicate mammalian prions. RNASeq identified that Hsp70, DnaJ-1 and Hsp110 gene expression was downregulated in prion-exposed PrP Drosophila. We demonstrated that RNAi knockdown of Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila enhanced neurotoxicity, whereas overexpression mitigated toxicity. Strikingly, prion seeding activity in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila was ablated or reduced by Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 overexpression, respectively. Similar effects were seen in scrapie prion-exposed ovine PrP Drosophila with modified Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression.

303,15956992,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Constitutively active micro opioid receptors mediate the enhanced conditioned aversive effect of naloxone in morphine-dependent mice.,"Naloxone administration produces a robust conditioned place aversion (CPA) in opiate-naive rodents by blocking the action of enkephalins at mu opioid receptors. This aversive response is potentiated by prior exposure to morphine. In vitro studies indicate that morphine treatment may promote constitutive activity of mu opioid receptors. We hypothesized that such enhanced constitutive activity in vivo may underlie the increased aversive property of naloxone by uncovering the inverse agonist property of this drug. The CPA produced by naloxone was compared with that produced by the neutral antagonists 6-alpha- and 6-beta-naloxol in mice with and without prior morphine exposure. While all three drugs produced CPA, only naloxone CPA was enhanced by morphine given 20 h prior to each naloxone injection. Furthermore, only naloxone produced withdrawal jumping when given 20 h after morphine, even though 6-alpha-naloxol was able to produce jumping when given 4 h after morphine. These data suggest that morphine may enhance naloxone CPA by increasing levels of constitutively active mu receptors and further support the role of such constitutive activity in mediating naloxone-precipitated physical withdrawal. Such long-term changes in constitutive activity of the mu receptor induced by exogenous opiate exposure may thus be an important factor in hedonic homeostatic dysregulation proposed to underlie the addictive process.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,"<journal>Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology</journal><title>Constitutively active micro opioid receptors mediate the enhanced conditioned aversive effect of naloxone in morphine-dependent mice.</title><abstract>Naloxone administration produces a robust conditioned place aversion (CPA) in opiate-naive rodents by blocking the action of enkephalins at mu opioid receptors.

304,21801595,Neurological research,Differential effects of endothelin receptor A and B antagonism on behavioral outcome following traumatic brain injury.,"Previously we have reported that endothelin receptor A and B antagonists elicit differential effects on cerebral blood flow and cellular damage. In summary, endothelin receptor A antagonists restore microcirculation and diminish cellular damage after injury, while endothelin receptor B antagonists had no effect on either parameter. However, what is not known is the effect of either antagonist on behavioral outcome. Therefore, this work was designed to test the effects of endothelin receptor A and B antagonism on behavioral outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI).	A total of 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats (400-450 g) were used in this study. Four groups (n = 12 per group) were generated as follows: sham operation, trauma+vehicle (0·9% saline), trauma+40 nmol BQ-123 (a selective endothelin receptor A antagonist) and trauma +20 nmol BQ-788 (a selective endothelin receptor B antagonist). All treatments were delivered via intracerebroventricular injection. Trauma was induced using a weight acceleration impact device. Twenty-four hours post-injection animals were tested for 21 days on a radial arm maze task to determine cognitive outcome.	Our data indicated that endothelin receptor A antagonism significantly reduced the extent of behavioral deficits following TBI while endothelin receptor B and vehicle injection had no effect.	The results suggest that endothelin receptor A, but not endothelin receptor B, antagonism improves behavioral outcome following TBI.

BMSCs secrete various factors that can regulate the microenvironment, which is called paracrine effect. Among these paracrine substances, exosomes are considered to be the most valuable therapeutic factors. Our study found that BMSCs-derived exosomes therapy attenuated cell apoptosis and inflammation response in the injured spinal cord tissues. In in vitro studies, BMSCs-derived exosomes significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PC12 cell apoptosis, reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL (interleukin)-1β and promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors including IL-10 and IL-4. Moreover, we found that LPS-induced protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) was significantly downregulated after treatment with BMSCs-derived exosomes. In in vivo studies, we found that hindlimb motor function was significantly improved in SCI rats with systemic administration of BMSCs-derived exosomes. We also observed that the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and pro-inflammatory factors was significantly decreased, while the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and anti-inflammatory factors were upregulated in SCI rats after exosome treatment. In conclusion, BMSCs-derived exosomes can inhibit apoptosis and inflammation response induced by injury and promote motor function recovery by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, which suggests that BMSCs-derived exosomes are expected to become a new therapeutic strategy for SCI.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,"<journal>Human & experimental toxicology</journal><title>Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes reduce apoptosis and inflammatory response during spinal cord injury by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.</title><abstract>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most common destructive injuries, which may lead to permanent neurological dysfunction.

308,22851280,"Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I alter hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission in young and old rats.,"In rats, as in humans, normal aging is characterized by a decline in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as in glutamatergic function. Both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels have been reported to decrease with age, and treatment with either GH or IGF-I can ameliorate age-related cognitive decline. Interestingly, acute GH and IGF-I treatments enhance glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus of juvenile animals. However, whether this enhancement also occurs in old rats, when cognitive impairment is ameliorated by GH and IGF-I (des-IGF-I), remains to be determined. To address this issue, we used an in vitro CA1 hippocampal slice preparation and extracellular recording techniques to study the effects of acute application of GH and IGF-I on compound field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), as well as AMPA- and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs, in young adult (10 months) and old (28 months) rats. The results indicated that both GH and IGF-I increased compound-, AMPA-, and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs to a similar extent in slices from both age groups and that this augmentation was likely mediated via a postsynaptic mechanism. Initial characterization of the signaling cascades underlying these effects revealed that the GH-induced enhancement was not mediated by the JAK2 signaling element in either young adult or old rats but that the IGF-I-induced enhancement involved a PI3K-mediated mechanism in old, but not young adults. The present findings are consistent with a role for a GH- or IGF-I-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission in mitigating age-related cognitive impairment in old rats.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,"<journal>Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)</journal><title>Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I alter hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission in young and old rats.</title><abstract>In rats, as in humans, normal aging is characterized by a decline in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as in glutamatergic function.

309,12941437,Life sciences,Modulation of MK-801-elicited mouse popping behavior by galantamine is complex and dose-dependent.,"The ability of phencyclidine (PCP), a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, to precipitate a schizophreniform psychosis in susceptible individuals is consistent with the hypothesized pathologic occurrence of NMDA receptor hypofunction in this disorder. Because the psychosis caused by PCP resembles schizophrenia in all of the relevant domains of psychopathology, investigators have sought to characterize animal models of NMDA receptor hypofunction. MK-801 (dizocilpine) binds to the same hydrophobic channel domain in the NMDA receptor-associated ionophore as PCP, and has been shown to elicit intense irregular episodes of jumping behavior in mice, termed 'popping.' MK-801-elicited mouse popping is an animal model of NMDA receptor hypofunction that has been used to screen novel candidate compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia. Recently, a selective abnormality in the transduction of the acetylcholine signal at the level of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor has been described in schizophrenia. The existence of a nicotinic cholinergic abnormality in schizophrenia has stimulated interest in a potential therapeutic role for positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic receptors. Galantamine is a compound that possesses two interesting properties: inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic neurotransmission. Theoretically, galantamine would be expected to increase the efficiency or likelihood that acetylcholine will promote channel opening and ionic conductance at nicotinic receptors. As expected, in the current investigation statistically significant popping behavior was elicited by MK-801 in mice (T(22) = 2.16, P < 0.05). This MK-801-elicited popping was significantly attenuated by 100 mg/kg of galantamine (T(22) = 2.24, P < 0.05).

The meloxicam treatment significantly decreased the MDA level in normotensive rats subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. The protective effect of meloxicam against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury was more pronounced in hypertensive rats as compared to normotensive animals.</abstract>,"{""gpt_label"": ""Animal-drug-intervention""}",Animal-drug-intervention

Activation of melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in several neurological diseases. In the present study, we have explored the role of MC1R activation on neuroinflammation and the potential underlying mechanisms after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats.	A total of 169 post-natal day 10 unsexed rat pups were used. HI was induced by right common carotid artery ligation followed by 2.5 h of hypoxia. BMS-470539, a specific selective MC1R agonist, was administered intranasally at 1 h after HI induction. To elucidate the potential underlying mechanism, MC1R CRISPR KO plasmid or Nurr1 CRISPR KO plasmid was administered via intracerebroventricular injection at 48 h before HI induction. Percent brain infarct area, short- and long-term neurobehavioral tests, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot were conducted.	The expression levels of MC1R and Nurr1 increased over time post-HI. MC1R and Nurr1 were expressed on microglia at 48 h post-HI. Activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 significantly reduced the percent infarct area, brain atrophy, and inflammation, and improved short- and long-term neurological deficits at 48 h and 28 days post-HI. MC1R activation increased the expression of CD206 (a microglial M2 marker) and reduced the expression of MPO. Moreover, activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 significantly increased the expression levels of MC1R, cAMP, p-PKA, and Nurr1, while downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β) at 48 h post-HI. However, knockout of MC1R or Nurr1 by specific CRISPR reversed the neuroprotective effects of MC1R activation post-HI.	Our study demonstrated that activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 attenuated neuroinflammation, and improved neurological deficits after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats. Such anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects were mediated, at least in part, via the cAMP/PKA/Nurr1 signaling pathway. Therefore, MC1R activation might be a promising therapeutic target for infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,"<journal>Journal of neuroinflammation</journal><title>Activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 attenuates neuroinflammation via cAMP/PKA/Nurr1 pathway after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats.</title><abstract>Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic (HI)-induced brain injury.

Preventing microglial activation to inhibit neuroinflammation may become a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Guizhi Fuling capsule (GZFL) has a strong repression on inflammatory responses. Here, the presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, a well-established mouse model of AD, were divided into: WT mice (WT), WT mice+GZFL (WT+GZFL), PS cDKO mice (cDKO), and PS cDKO mice+GZFL (cDKO+GZFL). Mice in the WT+GZFL and cDKO+GZFL group were fed standard chow containing 2000 ppm GZFL for 90 days. After 60 days of GZFL treatment, mice were given to behavioral tests for 30 days in order to explore the effects of GZFL on cognitive and motor function. Then, mice were sacrificed for examining the effects of GZFL on inflammation. Furthermore, primary microglia were obtained from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats and pretreated with or without GZFL (50 μg/ml) for 1 h in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) stimulation to speculate whether the underlying mechanism of GZFL's anti-inflammatory potential was closely associated with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that GZFL has the ability to alleviate memory deficits in PS cDKO mice, which attributes to the improvement of neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. In addition, GZFL could inverse the tau hyperphosphorylation and the lessened expression of synaptic proteins in hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Furthermore, GZFL prevented LPS-induced neuroinflammatory responses in primary microglia by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. It is noteworthy that therapeutic effects of GZFL on memory impairment are depended on the inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses by the blockage of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether chronic unpredicted stress (CUS) mediated neurological alterations are associated with impaired hippocampal insulin signaling or not, and studied the effect of quercetin in this scenario. Male Swiss albino mice were subjected to 21day CUS, during which 30mg/kg quercetin treatment was given orally. After 21days, behavioral functions were evaluated in terms of locomotor activity (Actophotometer), muscle coordination (Rota-rod), depression (Tail Suspension Test (TST), Forced Swim Test (FST)) and memory performance (Passive-avoidance step-down task (PASD)). Further, hippocampal insulin signaling was evaluated in terms of protein expression of insulin, insulin receptor (IR) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) and neurogenesis was evaluated in terms of doublecortin (DCX) expression. 21day CUS significantly impaired locomotion and had no effect on muscle coordination. Stressed animals were depressed and showed markedly impaired memory functions. Quercetin treatment significantly improvement stress-mediated behavior dysfunction as indicated by improved locomotion, lesser immobility time and greater frequency of upward turning in TST and FST and increased transfer latency on the day 2 (short-term memory) and day 5 (long-term memory) in PASD test. We observed significantly higher IR expression and significantly lower GLUT-4 expression in the hippocampus of stressed animals, despite of nonsignificant difference in insulin levels. Further, chronic stress impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, as indicated by the significantly reduced levels of hippocampal DCX expression. Quercetin treatment significantly lowered insulin and IR expression and significantly enhanced GLUT-4 and DCX expression in the hippocampus, when compared to CUS. In conclusion, quercetin treatment efficiently alleviated stress mediated behavioral dysfunction by modulating hippocampal insulin signaling and neurogenesis.</abstract>","{

Before hospital admission, the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was excluded by a normal chest X‑ray and two negative PCR tests on throat swabs. On admission the only symptom was a dry cough with clinically inconspicuous auscultation findings. The laboratory investigations revealed anemia and increased inflammation parameters, e.g. C‑reactive protein (CRP) 92.4 mg/l and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 102 mm/h (according to Westergren). A large vessel vasculitis was demonstrated on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). After the diagnosis of a giant cell arteritis, treatment with an oral glucocorticoid and subcutaneous methotrexate (MTX) was initiated, with good clinical and laboratory parameter responses. Dry cough has been described in rare cases in the literature as the first sign of large vessel vasculitis.

Thus, we aimed to examine the association of lithium and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), the first-line antimanic medications for youth with BD, with neurocognition in a relatively large sample of youth with BD. Methods: Participants included 91 youth with BD-I, -II, or -Not Otherwise Specified, aged 13-20 years (n = 14 current lithium use, n = 51 current SGA use). We examined four tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery: Intra/Extra Dimensional Set-Shifting Task (IED), Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP), Stockings of Cambridge Test (SOC), and Affective Go/No-Go (AGN). Within-sample Z-scores were computed, and a global neurocognitive composite score and g factor derived from these tests comprised the primary outcomes. Multivariable analyses controlled for age, sex, and IQ. Results: Current lithium use was significantly associated with poorer cognitive flexibility/set-shifting (IED). After further controlling for lifetime comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and current depression symptoms in sensitivity analyses, the lithium finding was no longer significant. Current SGA use was significantly associated with greater affective processing bias (AGN). No significant findings survived correction for multiple comparisons. All other cognitive outcomes were not significantly associated with current lithium use, current SGA use, or total number of current medications. Conclusions: Treatment with lithium or SGAs was associated with minimal neurocognitive impairments, with small effect sizes in primary multivariable analyses. This study adds to the limited body of literature examining medication use in relation to neurocognition in youth with BD. While the current study cannot rule out associations of smaller effect size, present findings suggest that leading mood-stabilizing medications are not associated with frank neurocognitive impairments in youth with BD.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0,"<journal>Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology</journal><title>Association of Lithium and Second-Generation Antipsychotics with Neurocognition in Youth with Bipolar Disorder.</title><abstract>Objective: Numerous studies have examined the association of antimanic medications with neurocognition in adults with bipolar disorder (BD).

We retrospectively reviewed 1653 plasma samples from 709 patients (aged 6 months to 16 years) and compared the concentration-to-dose ratio (CD ratio) of LTG among different AED regimens. The median CD ratio of patients receiving LTG monotherapy was 1.25 μg/mL/mg/kg. In patients receiving LTG plus VPA, the CD ratio was increased by about 140%. The CD ratio was elevated from a low VPA concentration (<40 μg/mL) and the increase was VPA concentration-dependent. In contrast, the median CD ratio of patients treated with LTG plus the inducers phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine was 0.42, 0.63, and 0.66, respectively, and phenytoin significantly reduced the CD ratio in comparison with phenobarbital or carbamazepine (p < 0.001). Pediatric patients of all ages beyond infancy showed similar susceptibility to VPA or inducers, but infants had higher CD ratios compared with the other age groups. Among other AEDs, topiramate, ethosuximide, and rufinamide reduced the CD ratio.

This study included consecutive hospitalised patients with untreated moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder referred to an inpatient addiction medicine consultation service, between June 2018 and September 2019, in Nova Scotia, Canada. We assessed the proportion of patients initiating first-line OAT (buprenorphine or methadone) in-hospital, and the proportion initiating SROM after declining first-line OAT. We compared rates of outpatient OAT continuation (i.e., filling outpatient OAT prescription or attending first outpatient OAT clinic visit) by medication type, and compared OAT selection between patients with and without chronic pain, using χ[2] tests.	Thirty-four patients were offered OAT initiation in-hospital; six patients (18%) also had chronic pain. Twenty-one patients (62%) initiated first-line OAT with buprenorphine or methadone. Of the 13 patients who declined first-line OAT, seven (54%) initiated second-line OAT with SROM in-hospital. Rates of outpatient OAT continuation after hospital discharge were high (>80%) and did not differ between medications (P = 0.4). Patients with co-existing chronic pain were more likely to choose SROM over buprenorphine or methadone (P = 0.005).	The ability to offer SROM (in addition to buprenorphine or methadone) increased rates of OAT initiation among hospitalised patients.

From 2015 to 2019, there appeared to be a shift in payer mix, with increases in Medicaid/Medicare and declines in cash and commercial insurance. Concomitant benzodiazepine and opioid analgesic use declined over time; in 2019, 16.6 % and 14.3 % of treatment episodes had any concomitant benzodiazepine or opioid analgesic, respectively, and <5 % had chronic (>90 overlapping days) concomitant use (3.0 % and 0.4 %, respectively).	The number of oral buprenorphine treatment episodes increased over the study period, and prescribing was generally consistent with the REMS and other treatment guidelines. There was a decline in concomitant buprenorphine and benzodiazepine or opioid analgesics, and chronic concomitant use was rare.</abstract>","{

Considering the limited knowledge regarding the immune mechanisms involved in narcolepsy whether related to flu vaccination or not and the recent progresses in cytokine measurement technology, we assessed 30 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors using the Luminex technology in either peripheral (serum) or central (CSF) compartments in a large population of 90 children and adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 in comparison to 58 non-hypocretin deficient hypersomniacs and 41 healthy controls. Furthermore, we compared their levels in patients with narcolepsy whether exposed to pandemic flu vaccine or not, and analyzed the effect of age, duration of disease and symptom severity. Comparison for sera biomarkers between narcolepsy (n = 84, 54 males, median age: 15.5 years old) and healthy controls (n = 41, 13 males, median age: 20 years old) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of several pro- and anti-inflammatory serum cytokines and growth factors with interferon-γ, CCL11, epidermal growth factor, and interleukin-2 receptor being independently associated with narcolepsy. Increased levels of interferon-γ, CCL11, and interleukin-12 were found when close to narcolepsy onset. After several adjustments, only one CSF biomarker differed between narcolepsy (n = 44, 26 males, median age: 15 years old) and non-hypocretin deficient hypersomnias (n = 57, 24 males, median age: 36 years old) with higher CCL 3 levels found in narcolepsy. Comparison for sera biomarkers between patients with narcolepsy who developed the disease post-pandemic flu vaccination (n = 36) to those without vaccination (n = 48) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of three cytokines, regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted, CXCL10, and CXCL9, being independently and significantly increased in the group exposed to the vaccine. No significant differences were found between narcoleptics whether exposed to flu vaccination or not for CSF biomarkers except for a lower CXCL10 level found in the exposed group. To conclude, we highlighted the role of sera cytokine with pro-inflammatory properties and especially interferon-γ being independently associated with narcolepsy close to disease onset.

To assess the associations of tramadol, compared with codeine, with mortality and other adverse clinical outcomes as used in outpatient settings.	Retrospective, population-based, propensity score-matched cohort study using a primary care database with routinely collected medical records and pharmacy dispensations covering more than 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain (≈6 million people).

New prescription dispensation of tramadol or codeine (no dispensation in the previous year).	Outcomes studied were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, constipation, delirium, falls, opioid abuse/dependence, and sleep disorders within 1 year after the first dispensation.

The variation from non-suppressor to suppressor (which yielded in 60% of this sample) can be explained by the clinical improvement, but not the inverse change. In this paper, different possibilities on this change are analyzed, the most probable being the direct effect of the carbidopa in eminentia media.

The aim of the study was to assess whether children born of hPAE with ADHD, with or without morphological FASD, differ in terms of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene polymorphisms, and if genetic predisposition affects response and safety of MPH treatment. The polymorphisms of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) were analyzed in DNA samples. A borderline significance was found for the correlation between MPH side effects and the G allele of COMT (rs4680) (p = 0.04994) in all ADHD children. No effect of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) polymorphisms and the treatment efficacy was observed. The analyzed DRD2 and COMT gene polymorphisms seem to play no role in MPH efficacy in ADHD children with hPAE, while low-activity COMT (Met158) variant carriers may be more intolerant to MPH.

No effect of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) polymorphisms and the treatment efficacy was observed. The analyzed DRD2 and COMT gene polymorphisms seem to play no role in MPH efficacy in ADHD children with hPAE, while low-activity COMT (Met158) variant carriers may be more intolerant to MPH. The MPH treatment is effective in ADHD independent of FASD, although the ADHD-FASD variant requires higher doses to be successful. These results may help in optimization and individualization in child psychiatry.</abstract>","<title>Influence of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) Gene Polymorphisms on Safety and Efficacy of Methylphenidate Treatment in Children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.</title><abstract>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in a course of high prenatal alcohol exposure (hPAE) are among the most common causes of developmental disorders. The main reason for pharmacological treatment of FASD children is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and methylphenidate (MPH) is the drug of choice. The aim of the study was to assess whether children born of hPAE with ADHD, with or without morphological FASD, differ in terms of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene polymorphisms, and if genetic predisposition affects response and safety of MPH treatment. The polymorphisms of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) were analyzed in DNA samples. A borderline significance was found for the correlation between MPH side effects and the G allele of COMT (rs4680) (p = 0.04994) in all ADHD children.

Treatment-induced pericystic inflammation and its association with blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, as determined by Evans blue (EB) extravasation, was studied in infected untreated and anthelmintic-treated pigs. We compared the magnitude and extent of the pericystic inflammation, presence of EB-stained capsules, the level of damage to the parasite, expression of genes for proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue remodeling by quantitative PCR assays between treated and untreated infected pigs and between EB-stained (blue) and non stained (clear) cysts. Inflammatory scores were higher in pericystic tissues from EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts from untreated pigs and also from anthelmintic-treated pigs 48 hr and 120 hr after treatment. The degree of inflammation correlated with the severity of cyst wall damage and both increased significantly at 120 hours. Expression levels of the proinflammatory genes for IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α were higher in EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts and unaffected brain tissues, and were generally highest at 120 hr. Additionally, expression of some markers of immunoregulatory activity (IL-10, IL-2Rα) were decreased in EB-stained capsules. An increase in other markers for regulatory T cells (CTLA4, FoxP3) was found, as well as significant increases in expression of two metalloproteases, MMP1 and MMP2 at 48 hr and 120 hr post-treatment. We conclude that the increase in severity of the inflammation caused by treatment is accompanied by both a proinflammatory and a complex regulatory response, largely limited to pericystic tissues with compromised vascular integrity. Because treatment induced inflammation occurs in porcine NCC similar to that in human cases, this model can be used to investigate mechanisms involved in host damaging inflammatory responses and agents or modalities that may control damaging post treatment inflammation.",Animal-other,5,1,"<journal>PLoS neglected tropical diseases</journal><title>Post-treatment vascular leakage and inflammatory responses around brain cysts in porcine neurocysticercosis.</title><abstract>Cysticidal treatment of neurocysticercosis, an infection of humans and pig brains with Taenia solium, results in an early inflammatory response directed to cysts causing seizures and focal neurological manifestations.

371,29883458,PloS one,Sexual behavior and testis morphology in the BACHD rat model.,"Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in brain neurodegeneration and peripheral pathology affecting different organs including testis. Patients with HD suffer from motor and cognitive impairment, and multiple psychiatric symptoms.

The BACHD rat model of HD carries the human full-length mutated HTT (mHTT) genomic sequence with 97 CAG-CAA repeats and displays HD-like alterations at neuropathological and behavioral level.	This study aims to phenotype the BACHD rats' sexual behavior and performance as well as testis morphology because alterations in these aspects have been associated to HD.	Two rat cohorts at the age of 3 and 7 months were subjected to mating tests to assess different parameters of sexual behavior. Histological analyses for testis morphology were performed in different rat cohorts at 1.5, 7 and 12 months of age whereas immunohistochemical analyses were carried out at 7 and 12 months of age to visualize the presence of mHTT in testicular tissue. Furthermore, western blot analyses were used to assess HTT and mHTT expression levels in striatum and testis at three months of age.	At 3 months, BACHD rats showed a decreased time exploring the female anogenital area (AGA), decreased latency to mount, increased number of intromissions and ejaculations and enhanced hit rate. At 7 months, all sexual parameters were comparable between genotypes with the exception that BACHD rats explored the AGA less than wild type rats. Testis analyses did not reveal any morphological alteration at any of the examined ages, but showed presence of mHTT limited to Sertoli cells in transgenic rats at both 7 and 12 months.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the motor, cognitive and emotional changes associated with dopaminergic and BDNF imbalance after DM exposure in rats. Sixty Wistar rats (9-10 months-old) were used, under Ethics Committee on Animal Research license (ID 19/2017). The animals were randomly divided into four groups: control (CTL, 0.9% saline), DM2 (2 mg DM in 1.6 mL 0.9% saline), DM4 (4 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline), and DM8 (8 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline). DM groups were submitted to 9 or 15 inhalations, one every 48 h. Half of the animals from each group were randomly selected and perfused 24 h after the 9th or 15th inhalation. Throughout the experiment, the animal's behavior were evaluated using catalepsy test, open field, hole-board test, Modified Elevated Plus Maze, and social interaction. At the end of the experiments, the rats were perfused transcardially and their brains were processed for Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) and Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunohistochemistries.

Regardless of rat sex, with the disease development xanthine oxidase (XO) activity and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression increased in spinal cord, whereas glutathione levels decreased. This was accompanied by the rise in spinal cord malondialdehyde level. On the other hand, with EAE development superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased, while O2[-] concentration increased only in spinal cord of male rats. Consequently, SOD activity was lower, whereas O2[-] concentration was higher in spinal cord of male rats with clinically manifested EAE. XO activity and iNOS mRNA expression were also elevated in their spinal cord. Consistently, in the effector phase of EAE the concentration of advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) was higher in spinal cord of male rats, which exhibit more severe neurological deficit than their female counterparts. In as much as data obtained in the experimental models could be translated to humans, the findings may be relevant for designing sex-specific antioxidant therapeutic strategies.

375,21831324,BMC veterinary research,The impact of West Nile virus on the abundance of selected North American birds.,"The emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America has been associated with high mortality in the native avifauna and has raised concerns about the long-term impact of WNV on bird populations. Here, we present results from a longitudinal analysis of annual counts of six bird species, using North American Breeding Bird Survey data from ten states (1994 to 2010). We fit overdispersed Poisson models to annual counts. Counts from successive years were linked by an autoregressive process that depended on WNV transmission intensity (annual West Nile neuroinvasive disease reports) and was adjusted by El Niño Southern Oscillation events. These models were fit using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.	Model fit was mostly excellent, especially for American Crows, for which our models explained between 26% and 81% of the observed variance. The impact of WNV on bird populations was quantitatively evaluated by contrasting hypothetical count trajectories (omission of WNV) with observed counts.

These studies describe application of simultaneous high-speed video kinematics with multichannel electromyography (EMG) to characterize the movement disorder exhibited by tottering mutant mice. These mice provide a uniquely valuable model, because they exhibit paroxysmal dystonia superimposed on mild baseline ataxia, permitting the examination of these two different problems within the same animals. At baseline with mild ataxia, the mutants exhibited poorly coordinated movements with increased variation of stance and swing times, and slower spontaneous walking velocities. The corresponding EMG showed reduced mean amplitudes of biceps femoris and vastus lateralis, and poorly modulated EMG activities during the step cycle. Attacks of paroxysmal dystonia were preceded by trains of EMG bursts with doublets and triplets simultaneously in the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis followed by more sustained coactivation. These EMG characteristics are consistent with the clinical phenomenology of the motor phenotype of tottering mice as a baseline of mild ataxia with intermittent attacks of paroxysmal dystonia. The EMG characteristics of ataxia and dystonia in the tottering mice also are consistent with EMG studies of other ataxic or dystonic animals and humans.

When injected into C57BL/6J mice, MPTP penetrates into the brain and is converted to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP[+]) by monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B in astrocytes. MPP[+] has high affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) on dopaminergic neurons, and is taken up into the cell to cause cell death. There have been relatively few researches on the acute MPTP toxicity to embryonic or newborn mice. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the influence of MPTP and MPP[+] on embryonic and newborn mice by measuring sequential changes in major indexes of MPTP toxicity and MPTP metabolism; levels of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), DAT, MAO-A and MAO-B. In addition, we measured the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in the brain of newborn mice. A single injection of MPTP and MPP[+] reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, in the brain of newborn mice about 6-12 hr after the injection. Similarly the levels of mRNAs and proteins of DAT and TH were lowered in the brain of embryonic and newborn mice as well. The levels of these indexes were generally recovered at 24 hr after injection, indicating that the neurotoxicity induced by a single injection of MPTP or MPP[+] is temporary and recoverable in embryonic and newborn mice.

In this study, C57Bl/6J mice were injected intracerebrally with [3H]inositol, and poly-PI turnover in brain was assessed by determining the levels of labeled inositol monophosphates (IP1) accumulated after intraperitoneal injection of LiCl (6 meq/kg body weight) 4 hr before killing. Using this experimental protocol, acute ethanol administration (by gavage) resulted in time- and dose-dependent decreases in the levels of labeled IP1 in both cerebrum and cerebellum as compared with controls. The ethanol-induced decrease in labeled IP1 correlated well with the decrease in levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (as measured by the radioreceptor assay) and the increase in blood ethanol concentration. Despite a 4-fold higher accumulation of labeled IP1 in the cerebrum compared with the cerebellum, there were no major differences in the steady-state levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (based on tissue weight) in either brain region. Intraperitoneal injection of atropine (50 mg/kg) (a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist) to the lithium-treated mice resulted in a 34% decrease in labeled IP1 as compared with controls. This result suggests that a substantial proportion of the signals transduced were due to activation of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor.

Using this experimental protocol, acute ethanol administration (by gavage) resulted in time- and dose-dependent decreases in the levels of labeled IP1 in both cerebrum and cerebellum as compared with controls. The ethanol-induced decrease in labeled IP1 correlated well with the decrease in levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (as measured by the radioreceptor assay) and the increase in blood ethanol concentration. Despite a 4-fold higher accumulation of labeled IP1 in the cerebrum compared with the cerebellum, there were no major differences in the steady-state levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (based on tissue weight) in either brain region. Intraperitoneal injection of atropine (50 mg/kg) (a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist) to the lithium-treated mice resulted in a 34% decrease in labeled IP1 as compared with controls. This result suggests that a substantial proportion of the signals transduced were due to activation of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor.

In some reported conditions, the cerebellar lesion is combined with degeneration of other systems. Here we describe a new hereditary cerebellar cortical degeneration in eight adult American Staffordshire and Pit Bull Terriers.

In addition, nerve cell loss appears to be associated with a lysosomal storage disease, which is restricted to the affected cell populations. The stored material was histologically and ultrastructurally identified as fluorescent lipopigment. Since animals were euthanized at various stages of the disease, it could be shown that lysosomal storage preceded neuronal loss.

AHF was surgically induced by portocaval shunting followed by hepatic artery ligation 48 hr later. In the infusion group the dose of NH4-Ac, initially 0.78 mmol/kg/hr, was increased every 2 hr by 0.13 mmole/kg/hr during a 10-hour period to simulate the arterial NH3 concentrations observed in AHF. Ammonia levels in rabbits administered the NH4-Ac infusion were identical to those observed in AHF, with the exception of the higher initial value in the AHF group. Moreover, the mean rates of increase in grade of encephalopathy in the two groups were similar, although the EEG grades in the infusion group were significantly less at all time points. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a more pathophysiological approach to identification of the putative toxins in hepatic encephalopathy is feasible.

390,24009395,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",A causative link between inner ear defects and long-term striatal dysfunction.,"There is a high prevalence of behavioral disorders that feature hyperactivity in individuals with severe inner ear dysfunction. What remains unknown is whether inner ear dysfunction can alter the brain to promote pathological behavior.

Using our previously described rat model of IMSCT, we describe a technique for microsurgical tumor resection and present the functional and histopathological analysis of tumor progression.	Twenty-four Fischer 344 rats were randomized into two groups. All animals received a 5-microl intramedullary injection of 9L gliosarcoma cells.

At a BBB score less than 5 (e.g., functional paraplegia), all animals of both groups were killed and sent for histopathological analysis.	Group 1 had a median onset of functional hind limb paraplegia at 15 +/- 1.0 days. Group 2 had a median onset of hind limb paresis at 53 +/- 0.46 days.

Primary neurons were isolated and cultured. Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups and fed diets with different amounts of n‑3 PUFAs. A model of spinal cord contusion was created at the T10 spinal segment and the composition of PUFAs was analyzed using gas chromatography. Spinal repair and motor function were evaluated postoperatively. Assessment of the effects of n‑3 PUFAs on autophagy and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) was performed using immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. In vitro, n‑3 PUFAs inhibited mTORC1 and enhanced autophagy. The n‑3 PUFA levels and the ratio of n‑3 PUFA to n‑6 PUFA in the spinal cord and serum of rats fed a high‑n‑3 PUFA diet were higher before and after operation (P<0.05). Additionally, rats in the high‑n‑3 PUFA group showed improved motor function recovery, spinal cord repair‑related protein expression level (MBP, Galc and GFAP). Expression levels if these protiens in the high‑n‑3 PUFA diet group expressed the highest levels, followed by the low‑n‑3 PUFA diet group and finally the control group (P<0.05). high‑n‑3 PUFA diet promoted autophagy ability and inhibited activity of the mTORC1 signaling pathway compared with the low‑n‑3 PUFA diet group or the control group (P<0.05).

To address this, Tg mouse model of AD, Tg-NSE/PS2m, which expresses human mutant PS2 in the brain, was chosen. Animals were subjected to treadmill exercise for 12 weeks from 24 months of age. The exercised mice were treadmill run at speed of 12 m/min, 60 min/day, 5 days/week on a 0% gradient for 3 months. Treadmill exercised mice improved cognitive function in water maze test. Treadmill exercised mice significantly reduced the expression of Aβ-42, Cox-2, and caspase-3 in the hippocampus. In parallel, treadmill exercised Tg mice decreased the phosphorylation levels of JNK, p38MAPK and tau (Ser404, Ser202, Thr231), and increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK, PI3K, Akt and GSK-3α/β. In addition, treadmill exercised Tg mice up-regulated the expressions of NGF, BDNF and phospho-CREB, and the expressions of SOD-1, SOD-2 and HSP-70. Treadmill exercised Tg mice up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and down-regulated the expressions of cytochrome c and Bax in the hippocampus. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus in mice was significantly decreased after treadmill exercise. Finally, serum TC, insulin, glucose, and corticosterone levels were significantly decreased in the Tg mice after treadmill exercise. As a consequence of such change, Aβ-dependent neuronal cell death in the hippocampus of Tg mice was markedly suppressed following treadmill exercise. These results strongly suggest that treadmill exercise provides a therapeutic potential to inhibit both Aβ-42 and neuronal death pathways.

Group 2 received one pill of solifenacin 5 mg plus one puff of desmopressin nasal spray 1 h before bedtime every night. All patients were evaluated after three months for their response to treatment and drug side effects.	The mean age in desmopressin alone group and solifenacin plus desmopressin group was 8.1 ± 2.2 (5-14) and 7.9 ± 2.2 (5-14) years respectively (p-value >0.05). In group 2, 37/44 (84.09%) patients achieved complete response after three months of treatment in comparison to group 1 in which 27/44 (61.36%) patients showed complete response (p-value <0.05). In group 1, 8/44 (18.18%) patients developed treatment related side effects whereas in group 2, 12/44 (27.27%) patients developed side effects (p-value >0.05).

This was a randomized, parallel arms, placebo-contolled trial. Children with hypertonic CP aged 2 to 15 years awaiting bony hip surgery at a tertiary hospital were randomized to receive either BoNT-A or placebo injections into the muscles of the hip on a single occasion immediately before surgery. The primary outcome was the paediatric pain profile (PPP), which was assessed at baseline and weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment allocation was by minimization. Participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were masked to group assignment.	Twenty-seven participants (17 males, 10 females; mean 8y 8mo [SD 3y 9mo], range 3y 4mo-15y 10mo) were allocated to BoNT-A and 27 participants (14 males, 13 females; mean 8y 11mo [SD 3y 5mo], range 4y 1mo-15y 2mo) to placebo. Mean (SD) PPP at 6 weeks for the BoNT-A group (n=24 followed up) was 10.96 (7.22) and for the placebo group (n=26) was 10.04 (8.54) (p=0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.82, 3.18). There were 16 serious adverse events in total during 6 months of follow-up (n=6 in BoNT-A group).	Use of BoNT-A immediately before bony hip surgery for reducing postoperative pain for children with CP was not supported.	Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) does not reduce postoperative pain following bony hip surgery. BoNT-A also does not affect postoperative quality of life.

400,37550718,Trials,"Can dexamethasone improve postoperative sleep and postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy? Protocol for a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study.","Perioperative sleep disorders (PSD) are an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD), which is a common complication after surgery. Elderly patients who undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) often experience perioperative sleep disorders (PSD). Dexamethasone, a medication that works by inhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-suprarenal cortical axis, can reduce the negative effects of surgical stress. The objective of this study was to determine whether intravenous administration of dexamethasone at the time of anesthesia induction could improve postoperative sleep quality in elderly patients, thereby indirectly reducing the risk of postoperative cognitive impairment and accelerating postoperative rehabilitation.	This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted at a single center. A sample size of 116 patients was determined through calculation, and these patients were randomly assigned to either the dexamethasone group (group D, n = 58) or the blank control group (group C, n = 58). On the day of surgery, the anesthesia nurse prepared either diluted dexamethasone or saline in advance, according to the patient's assigned group. The blinded anesthesiologist administered the medication during induction, and a dedicated person followed up with the patient for three consecutive postoperative days. All other aspects of care were managed equally between the two groups. The primary outcome measure was sleep quality, while secondary outcome measures included postoperative sleep time, postoperative delirium (POD), pain scores, and other complications. Relevant test measures were recorded for analysis.	This study aims to investigate the impact of intravenous dexamethasone on sleep quality and duration of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). If the findings of this study protocol are affirmative, it could enhance the sleep quality of elderly patients after surgery, thereby minimizing the risk of postoperative delirium (POD), and providing substantial evidence for the perioperative enhanced recovery management of elderly patients.

Protocol for a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study.</title><abstract>Perioperative sleep disorders (PSD) are an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD), which is a common complication after surgery. Elderly patients who undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) often experience perioperative sleep disorders (PSD). Dexamethasone, a medication that works by inhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-suprarenal cortical axis, can reduce the negative effects of surgical stress. The objective of this study was to determine whether intravenous administration of dexamethasone at the time of anesthesia induction could improve postoperative sleep quality in elderly patients, thereby indirectly reducing the risk of postoperative cognitive impairment and accelerating postoperative rehabilitation.	This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted at a single center. A sample size of 116 patients was determined through calculation, and these patients were randomly assigned to either the dexamethasone group (group D, n = 58) or the blank control group (group C, n = 58). On the day of surgery, the anesthesia nurse prepared either diluted dexamethasone or saline in advance, according to the patient's assigned group. The blinded anesthesiologist administered the medication during induction, and a dedicated person followed up with the patient for three consecutive postoperative days. All other aspects of care were managed equally between the two groups. The primary outcome measure was sleep quality, while secondary outcome measures included postoperative sleep time, postoperative delirium (POD), pain scores, and other complications.

A 1-month, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, followed by a 6-month open-label follow-up.	Ambulatory subjects treating themselves outside of a medical setting.	One hundred thirty-one adult subjects with migraine, diagnosed according to International Headache Society criteria, were enrolled in the study: 113 treated at least one headache in the controlled trial, and 74 treated at least one headache in the open-label phase. All subjects were members of the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Medical Care Program and were recruited at two urban medical centers.	Intranasal lidocaine 4% or saline placebo 0.5 mL was dropped into the nostril on the side of the headache, or bilaterally for bilateral headache, according to study protocol.	Trial: percent of headaches relieved to mild or none at 15 minutes and relapse of headache within 24 hours. Open-label: percent of headaches relieved to mild or none at 15 and 30 minutes and relapse within 24 hours.	In the controlled trial, headache was relieved within 15 minutes in 34 (35.8%) of 95 subjects treated with 4% intranasal lidocaine compared with 8 (7.4%) of 108 subjects receiving placebo (P < .001). Headaches relapsed in 7 (20.6%) of 34 subjects treated with 4% intranasal lidocaine compared to 0 of 8 placebo subjects (P = .312). In the open-label follow-up, headaches were relieved in 129 (41.2%) of 313 episodes within 15 minutes and in 141 (57.6%) of 245 episodes after 30 minutes. Headaches relapsed in 28 (19.9%) of 140. The response did not diminish over time: 32 (62.8%) of 51 first headaches were relieved at 30 minutes and 10 (71.4%) of 14 seventh headaches were relieved. Relapse occurred in 28 (20%) [corrected] of 129 headaches at a mean time (+/- SD) of 7.4 (+/- 6.6) hours.	Intranasal lidocaine 4% provides rapid relief of migraine symptoms.
