278,14673555,European journal of clinical pharmacology,Pharmacokinetic modelling of valproic acid from routine clinical data in Egyptian epileptic patients.,"This paper describes a developed pharmacokinetic model for the estimation of valproic acid (VPA) clearance (CL) calculated from routine clinical data taken from Egyptian epileptic patients.	Retrospective clinical data from 81 adult and paediatric epileptic patients with one trough VPA serum concentration per patient were analysed using NONMEM to estimate drug CL and determine the influence of different covariates. A qualification group of 20 epileptic children (3-13 years old) was used to evaluate the final model.	The population CL as estimated by base model (no covariates) was 0.581 l h(-1) with inter-individual variability (C.V. %) of 17.4% and SD of residual error was 6.82 mg l(-1). Univariate selection and backward deletion of different covariates led to the development of the final regression model of CL as follows: CL(Lh-1) = 0.101 + 0.151 * CBZ + 0.000248 * VPADD + 0.0968 * age/20 + 0.0803 * INDI, in which CBZ indicates co-administration of carbamazepine, VPADD the daily dose of VPA and INDI uncontrolled epilepsy. The between-subject variability in CL was 23.6% while the standard deviation of the residual error was 5.24 mg l(-1). The model predictions in the qualification group were found to have no bias and satisfactory precision.	The population pharmacokinetic model for VPA could be used for a priori recommendation and dose optimisation of that drug in the Egyptian population of epileptic patients.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,"<journal>European journal of clinical pharmacology</journal><title>Pharmacokinetic modelling of valproic acid from routine clinical data in Egyptian epileptic patients.</title><abstract>This paper describes a developed pharmacokinetic model for the estimation of valproic acid (VPA) clearance (CL) calculated from routine clinical data taken from Egyptian epileptic patients.

492,32299778,Clinical colorectal cancer,Efficacy and Safety of Bevacizumab Combined With First-Line Chemotherapy in Elderly (≥75 Years) Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Real-World Study.,"Although elderly patients are the first concerned by colorectal cancer (CRC), they are underrepresented in clinical trials. The real-world CASSIOPEE study was thus conducted in elderly patients treated for metastatic CRC (mCRC).	This French prospective, multicenter, noninterventional study aimed to estimate 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and describe treatments, patient autonomy (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living; Balducci scale), and safety over 24 months, in patients older than 75 with mCRC, starting first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (NCT01555762).	From 2012 to 2014, 402 patients were included (safety population: n = 383, efficacy population: n = 358). Patient characteristics were as follows: mean age, 81 ± 4 years (<80 years, 46%; 80-85 years, 44%; >85 years, 10%); men, 52%; colon primary tumor, 80%; main metastatic site, liver 66%; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 0-1, 81%. Median PFS was 9.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.3-10.2). It was superior for patients ≤85 years (<80 years: 9.3 months; 80-85 years: 9.5 months) compared with patients >85 years (8.3 months). Median OS was 19.0 months (95% CI, 16.5-21.5) and decreased in the 2 oldest groups (20.6, 17.8, and 13.0 months). Autonomy assessments decreased over time leading to nonconclusive results. Twenty-six percent of patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs): 7% bevacizumab-related SAEs, and 6% bevacizumab-targeted SAEs. Two fatal bevacizumab-related adverse events were reported (hemorrhagic stroke and intestinal ischemia).	This large French real-world study showed that medically fit older patients with mCRC could have a benefit/risk balance similar to that of younger patients when treated with first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

1264,18338212,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,Buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction after internal iliac artery embolization in patients prior to endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.,"Coil embolization of the internal iliac artery (IIA) is used to extend the application of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in cases of challenging iliac anatomy. Pelvic ischemia is a complication of the technique, but reports vary as to the rate and severity. This study reports our experience with IIA embolization and compares the results to those of other published series. The vascular unit database of the Leicester Royal Infirmary was used to identify patients who had undergone IIA coil embolization prior to EVAR. Data were collected from hospital case notes and by telephone interviews. Thirty-eight patients were identified; 29 of these were contactable by telephone. A literature search was performed for other studies of IIA embolization and the results were pooled. In this series buttock claudication occurred in 55% (16 of 29 patients) overall: in 52% of unilateral embolizations (11 of 21) and 63% of bilateral embolizations (5 of 8). New erectile dysfunction occurred in 46% (6 of 13 patients) overall: in 38% of unilateral embolizations (3 of 8) and 60% of bilateral embolizations (3 of 5). The literature review identified 18 relevant studies. The results were pooled with our results, to give 634 patients in total. Buttock claudication occurred in 28% overall (178 of 634 patients): in 31% of unilateral embolizations (99 of 322) and 35% of bilateral embolizations (34 of 98) (p = 0.46, Fisher's exact test). New erectile dysfunction occurred in 17% overall (27 of 159 patients): in 17% of unilateral embolizations (16 of 97) and 24% of bilateral embolizations (9 of 38) (p = 0.33).

557,34708477,Human brain mapping,Mental health in the UK Biobank: A roadmap to self-report measures and neuroimaging correlates.,"The UK Biobank (UKB) is a highly promising dataset for brain biomarker research into population mental health due to its unprecedented sample size and extensive phenotypic, imaging, and biological measurements. In this study, we aimed to provide a shared foundation for UKB neuroimaging research into mental health with a focus on anxiety and depression. We compared UKB self-report measures and revealed important timing effects between scan acquisition and separate online acquisition of some mental health measures. To overcome these timing effects, we introduced and validated the Recent Depressive Symptoms (RDS-4) score which we recommend for state-dependent and longitudinal research in the UKB. We furthermore tested univariate and multivariate associations between brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and mental health. Our results showed a significant multivariate relationship between IDPs and mental health, which was replicable. Conversely, effect sizes for individual IDPs were small. Test-retest reliability of IDPs was stronger for measures of brain structure than for measures of brain function.

871,19219502,Lung,Chronic sleep complaints in premenopausal women and their association with sleep-disordered breathing.,"In clinical practice, we have found that premenopausal women have delayed diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).	During a 4-year period, we systematically collected the clinical and polysomnographic variables for all women referred for sleep complaints using preestablished questionnaires, scales, clinical grid, polygraphic montage, and scoring criteria. The variables collected on premenopausal SDB women were analyzed and compared to those of postmenopausal women within 5 years of menopause.	Of 977 women, 316 were premenopausal with SDB. Complaints of chronic insomnia and sleepwalking were the most common reasons for referral, had been present for a mean of 6.4 +/- 5.4 years, and had lead to unsuccessful symptomatic treatment. The normal-weight premenopausal SDB group had anatomically small upper airways, while those with body mass index (BMI) >/= 25 kg/m(2) complained more frequently of snoring and daytime sleepiness and their clinical presentation was closer to those of the postmenopausal SDB comparison group. Premenopausal women often had a low apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), but there was a discrepancy between the low AHI and the amount of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) needed to control the SDB, and there was a need for higher pressures in overweight premenopausal SDB women (mean 9.1 +/- 1.9 and 10.1 +/- 2.6 cmH(2)O).	Normal-weight premenopausal SDB women often present with atypical sleep complaints of chronic insomnia and parasomnias. Clinical attention paid to craniofacial features and use of specific scales such as Mallampati help with the suspicion of the presence of SDB, and a low AHI is unrelated to the positive clinical impact of nasal CPAP treatment.",Remaining,"<journal>Lung</journal><title>Chronic sleep complaints in premenopausal women and their association with sleep-disordered breathing.</title><abstract>In clinical practice, we have found that premenopausal women have delayed diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).

1618,20486703,Bioconjugate chemistry,Aggregation of Alzheimer amyloid beta peptide (1-42) on the multivalent sulfonated sugar interface.,"The mechanism of amyloidosis of amyloid beta (1-42) (Abeta (1-42)) was investigated by the well-defined glycocluster interface. We prepared monovalent, divalent, and trivalent 6-sulfo-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (6S-GlcNAc) immobilized substrates. The morphology and secondary structure of Abeta (1-42) aggregates on the substrates were investigated by dynamic-mode AFM and FTIR-RAS. Abeta (1-42) interactions with multivalent sugars were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance, and the cytotoxicity of Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Morphological images showed, interestingly, that Abeta (1-42) aggregates had a tendency to form globules rather than fibrils as the valency of 6S-GlcNAc on the substrate was increased. The SPR measurements indicated that this morphological change of Abeta (1-42) was related to the change of binding mode, and the binding mode was dependent on the multivalency of the sugar. Globular Abeta (1-42) was more toxic than fibrillar Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells.

891,17254426,Twin research and human genetics : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies,"The Taipei Adolescent Twin/sibling Family Study I: behavioral problems, personality features, and neuropsychological performance.","The present study aimed to investigate genetic and environmental influences on behavioral problems, personality features, and neuropsychological performance among adolescents in Taipei, Taiwan. Between 1996 and 1998, with the assistance of the Twin Association and junior high schools in Taipei City, we solicited a list of twins from 51 junior high schools in Taipei. Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the twins enrolled in these schools were obtained. The vast majority of the recruited twins were between 12 and 16 years old. The recruited twins received assessments for behavioral problems, general and schizotypal personality, and cognitive functions.

PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS). A total of 84 different mutations were detected, and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals. Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations, 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity (severe PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). Then, 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications. The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity. These patients are considered functionally hemizygous.	The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level. Cognitive performance (IQ) was also significantly related to genotype. The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96, respectively, whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84, respectively. Of the patients with PKU, 92% had been treated during childhood. Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations. Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for >6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group.	The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances. Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU. The significant relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy.",Remaining,"<journal>Pediatrics</journal><title>Relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance in females with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: report from the Maternal Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study.</title><abstract>To examine the relationship of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotypes to biochemical phenotype and cognitive development in maternal phenylketonuria (PKU).

Clinicians may also question service users' ability to make considered decisions about their treatment when in crisis. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to investigate crisis treatment preferences of a sample of community-dwelling adults with borderline personality disorder.	Participants were 41 adults with borderline personality disorder who had created joint crisis plans during a randomized controlled trial. Data from all 41 joint crisis plans were analyzed iteratively via a thematic analysis framework.	Participants gave clear statements in their crisis plans relating to the desire to recover from the crisis and to improve their social functioning. Key themes included the desire to be treated with dignity and respect and to receive emotional and practical support from clinicians. Many participants spoke of the importance of connecting with others during periods of crisis, but several reported a clear desire to be left alone during a future crisis. Other themes concerned preferences for specific treatment refusals during crises, including particular types of psychotropic medication and involuntary treatment.	The variation of participants' preferences underscores the importance of developing individually tailored crisis plans for people with borderline personality disorder. The need to be treated with dignity and respect and to be given autonomy in decision making--also identified in global surveys of people with severe mental illness--is important to people with borderline personality disorder.

Different 3DUS-techniques are already commercially available. Most commonly, a transducer-integrated motor drives a scan-head to acquire a volumetric dataset, which is then reconstructed and viewed using various post-processing techniques. It has been proved feasible to apply 3DUS with pediatric transducers in typical pediatric investigations. Based on our own experiences and on review of the literature, 3DUS can be successfully used in infants and children for brain, spine, cardiac, urinary tract (particularly assessment of hydronephrosis, and virtual cystoscopy), and female genital (e.g., for assessment of uterine malformations) US, and for various other applications, particularly in small parts. Power Doppler data can be integrated, allowing 3DUS-angiography. Thus, 3DUS promises to become a useful adjunct for imaging children, particularly as it enhances ultrasound by offering additional, previously inaccessible planes, rendering options and surface assessments. 3DUS should be increasingly exploited, thus hopefully helping reduce the need for more invasive or burdening (e.g., ionizing radiation) investigations in children.",Non-systematic-review,"<journal>Pediatric radiology</journal><title>Potential role of 3DUS in infants and children.</title><abstract>The objective of this review is to discuss basic technical aspects as well as potential pediatric applications of three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS).

The accuracy of indirect BP measurement is strongly influenced by the position of both patient and arm during the measurement. Acute stroke patients are often nursed in lateral decubitus positions. The effect of these alternating body positions in relation to affected body side on the outcome and reliability of BP readings in acute stroke patients is unknown.	An automatic oscillometric BP device was used. BP was measured in both arms in the (back) supine and both lateral decubitus positions.	In total, 54 consecutive acute stroke patients were included. Thirty-five patients had right-sided deficits and 19 patients had left-sided deficits. Supine BP readings were similar in the right and left arms regardless of side of deficit. Measurements of BP in the lateral decubitus positions resulted in significantly lower BP readings in the uppermost arm (around 12 mm Hg in both arms) and significantly higher readings in the right lowermost arm (around 6 mm Hg) compared to the supine position. This effect seemed less pronounced when the left lowermost arm was measured. There was no relation between change of BP readings in various lateral positions and side of stroke.	Alternating lateral decubitus positions according to nursing standards in acute stroke patients lead to a mean 18 mm Hg BP fluctuation. This may largely be explained by hydrostatic pressure effects, partly by anatomic factors in the left lowermost arm, but not by the side of stroke.",Remaining,"<journal>Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association</journal><title>Variations of blood pressure in stroke unit patients may result from alternating body positions.</title><abstract>Blood pressure (BP) is one of the major vital parameters monitored in the stroke unit.

1143,26847429,European journal of pediatrics,The long-term treatment of a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus and glutaric aciduria type 1: the effect of insulin.,"The coexistence of two diseases associated with different metabolic disorders is a very rare event. Some associations, although sporadic, can be particularly challenging both in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management and in terms of theoretical perspective. Here, we report a child affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). The child was diagnosed with classical T1DM at 15 months of age, with a tendency toward hypoglycemia. A few months later, during an acute intercurrent infective episode, the child displayed acute hypotonia of the lower limbs and limbs dystonia. A brain MRI showed bilateral striatal necrosis, suggesting GA1 diagnosis. Treatment with a low-lysine dietary regimen and carnitine supplementation was started and resulted in an improvement in metabolic control and a reduction of hypoglycemic episodes along with an increasing in insulin daily dose. After 2 years, the neurological outcome consisted of a reduction in dystonic movements and a metabolic stability of both diseases.	This case provides some insight into the reciprocal interconnections between the two metabolic disorders. Similar pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the neuronal injury might have impacted each other, and a strict relationship between a specific aspect of GA1-impaired metabolism and glucose homeostasis might explain how the tailored management of GA1 was not only effective in controlling the disease, but it also resulted in an improvement in the control of the glycemic profile. What in known: • Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) usually presents in childhood with severe and possibly irreversible neuronal damage, triggered by a catabolic stress • The association of GA1 with other diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), is a rare event, complicating the treatment management What is new: • Insulin treatment has a role in preventing GA1 metabolic decompensation, even in the catabolic condition of hypoglycemia • Promoting GA1 metabolic equilibrium by tailoring drug and dietary treatment in our patient affect by T1DM has a positive impact also in improving glycemic balance.",Human-case-report,"<journal>European journal of pediatrics</journal><title>The long-term treatment of a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus and glutaric aciduria type 1: the effect of insulin.</title><abstract>The coexistence of two diseases associated with different metabolic disorders is a very rare event.

Three clinical forms of Gaucher disease have been described: type 1 as non-neuronopathic, type 2 as acute neuronopathic, and type 3 as subacute neuronopathic. We recently identified a rare mutation (G-->A at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1604) [Choy et al., 1994a, Am J Med Genet 51:156-160] and a novel mutation (T-->G at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1366) in two type 1 Gaucher patients by sequence analysis of the entire glucocerebrosidase coding region [Choy et al., 1994a, 1994b, Hum Mol Genet 3:821-823]. To demonstrate that these are deleterious and not neutral mutations, we cloned the full-length glucocerebrosidase cDNA of patients and of a normal control in the plasmid vector pAcUW1, recombined the human gene into the Baculovirus genome downstream of its polyhedron p10 promoter, and expressed the inserted gene in cultured cells of Spodoptera frugiperda transfected by recombinant Baculovirus. The levels of residual glucocerebrosidase activity determined in transfected cells with the Gaucher G1604A and T1366G alleles are 6.9% and 2.9% of that expressed by the normal allele (normal = 352.0 nmol/hr/mg protein or 100%). By comparison, the enzyme-specific activity expressed in transfected cells by 2 known Gaucher alleles, A1226G and T1448C, that are prevalent in type 1 and type 2 Gaucher disease are 23.4% and 3.3% of normal. No endogeneous glucocerebrosidase activity was detected in cultured cells transfected by either the wild-type Baculovirus or Baculovirus with the pAcUW1 plasmid vector without the glucocerebrosidase cDNA insert. These findings show that the Baculovirus expression system in cultured Spodoptera frugiperda cells is a suitable system for the functional expression and characterization of the normal and mutant glucocerebrosidase alleles. Moreover, the use of this expression system demonstrates that the G1604A and T1366G mutations are both deleterious mutations resulting in profoundly deficient glucocerebrosidase activity and subsequent Gaucher disease.",In-vitro-study,"<journal>American journal of medical genetics</journal><title>Gaucher disease: functional expression of the normal glucocerebrosidase and Gaucher T1366G and G1604A alleles in Baculovirus-transfected Spodoptera frugiperda cells.</title><abstract>Gaucher disease is an inherited sphingolipidosis resulting from deficient glucocerebrosidase activity.

Recently a tissue-specific and selective upregulation of the multidrug efflux transporter ABCB1 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the spinal cord of both patients and the mutant SOD1-G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that prevalently kills motor neurons has been reported. Here, we extended the analysis of P-gp expression in the SOD1-G93A ALS mouse model and found that P-gp upregulation was restricted to endothelial cells of the capillaries, while P-gp expression was not detected in other cells of the spinal cord parenchyma such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Using both in vitro human and mouse models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we found that mutant SOD1 astrocytes were driving P-gp upregulation in endothelial cells. In addition, a significant increase in reactive oxygen species production, Nrf2 and NFκB activation in endothelial cells exposed to mutant SOD1 astrocytes in both human and murine BBB models were observed. Most interestingly, astrocytes expressing FUS-H517Q, a different familial ALS-linked mutated gene, also drove NFκB-dependent upregulation of P-gp. However, the pathway was not dependent on oxidative stress but rather involved TNF-α release.

Most interestingly, astrocytes expressing FUS-H517Q, a different familial ALS-linked mutated gene, also drove NFκB-dependent upregulation of P-gp. However, the pathway was not dependent on oxidative stress but rather involved TNF-α release. Overall, these findings indicated that nuclear translocation of NFκB was a converging mechanism used by endothelial cells of the BBB to upregulate P-gp expression in mutant SOD1-linked ALS and possibly other forms of familial ALS.

1116,19544314,Depression and anxiety,Comorbid anxiety as a suicide risk factor among depressed veterans.,"Depressive disorders greatly increase suicide risk; however, little is known about the contribution of comorbid anxiety disorders or anxiety symptoms to the risk of suicide death among depressed patients. We examined whether depressed veterans with comorbid anxiety had higher risks of suicide death.	Using VA administrative databases we identified 887,859 patients with depression. We then used univariate and multivariate logistic regression, controlling for demographics and substance use disorders, to determine the odds ratios of completed suicide associated with individual comorbid anxiety disorders, the presence of any comorbid anxiety disorder, the prescription of an antianxiety medication, or the prescription of a high dose of an antianxiety medication.	In multivariate analyses, the odds of completed suicide were significantly increased for patients with panic disorder (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.53), generalized anxiety disorder (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.47), and anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified (OR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12-1.38). The odds of completed suicide were also greater among patients who received any antianxiety medication (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.55-1.88), and were further increased among those who received high dose treatment (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.98-2.57). Odds of completed suicide were decreased among patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.97), and there was no statistically significant relationship between social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and all other anxiety disorders and suicide.

1845,17241214,Epilepsia,Photosensitive benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy.,"To describe the electroclinical features of subjects who presented with a photosensitive benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (PBMEI).	The patients were selected from a group of epileptic subjects with seizure onset in infancy or early childhood. Inclusion criteria were the presence of photic-induced myoclonic seizures and a favorable outcome. Cases with less than 24 month follow up were excluded from the analysis.	Eight patients were identified (4 males, 4 females). Personal history was uneventful. All of them had familial antecedents of epilepsy. Psychomotor development was normal in 6 cases, both before and after seizure onset. One patient showed a mild mental retardation and a further patient showed some behavioral disturbances. Neuroradiological investigations, when performed (5 cases), gave normal results. The clinical manifestations were typical and could vary from upward movements of the eyes to myoclonic jerks of the head and shoulders, isolated or briefly repetitive, never causing a fall. Age of onset was between 11 months and 3 years and 2 months. Characteristically, the seizures were always triggered by photic stimulation. Non photo-induced spontaneous myoclonic attacks were reported in 2 cases during the follow-up. Other types of seizures were present at follow-up in 2 cases. The outcome was favorable, even if, usually, seizure control required high AED plasma levels. Since the clinical symptoms were not recognized early, some patients were treated only many years after the onset of symptoms.	Among BMEI patients, our cases constitute a subgroup in which myoclonic jerks were always triggered by photostimulation, in particular at onset of their epilepsy.",Remaining,"<journal>Epilepsia</journal><title>Photosensitive benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy.</title><abstract>To describe the electroclinical features of subjects who presented with a photosensitive benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (PBMEI).

A retrospective study was undertaken to define better the incidence and clinical features of this infection, and to establish current diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. Forty cases of spinal epidural abscess were encountered at our institution between July 1979 and March 1991. All medical records and radiological images were reviewed. We report a significant increase in the incidence of epidural abscess after June 1988 (p = 0.0195). Sixteen patients used drugs intravenously, and six had undergone spinal procedures. Twelve patients were misdiagnosed in various emergency rooms or clinics and discharged. Localized back pain, fever, and neurological deficit remained the typical clinical manifestations. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated uniformly when measured (21 cases). Magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic specifically in 23 of 24 instances. The majority of patients underwent surgical drainage, but five selected patients were managed nonoperatively. The highly variable presentation of spinal epidural abscess may confuse the diagnosis and delay indicated surgical intervention. Localized back pain in a febrile patient at significant risk for epidural abscess warrants erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement. The presence of erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevation or evidence of spinal cord compression on physical examination are indications for immediate magnetic resonance imaging examination with contrast enhancement.

New epidemiologic data supporting previous studies on mild cognitive impairment and progression to AD are reviewed, as are those examining the relationship between total infectious burden (additive seropositivity to various microbes) and cognition/AD. The latter indicates the involvement of HSV1 and cytomegalovirus (and the necessity of taking into account any marked differences in sensitivity of antibody detection). Recent studies that provide further support for the occurrence of repeated reactivation of latent HSV1 in the brain in AD pathogenesis are also discussed.-Itzhaki, R. F.

538,27812760,Neurochemical research,Sex Difference in Oxidative Stress Parameters in Spinal Cord of Rats with Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis: Relation to Neurological Deficit.,"The study examined (a) whether there is sex difference in spinal cord and plasma oxidative stress profiles in Dark Agouti rats immunised for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal experimental model of multiple sclerosis, and (b) whether there is correlation between the oxidative stress in spinal cord and neurological deficit. Regardless of rat sex, with the disease development xanthine oxidase (XO) activity and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression increased in spinal cord, whereas glutathione levels decreased. This was accompanied by the rise in spinal cord malondialdehyde level. On the other hand, with EAE development superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased, while O2[-] concentration increased only in spinal cord of male rats. Consequently, SOD activity was lower, whereas O2[-] concentration was higher in spinal cord of male rats with clinically manifested EAE. XO activity and iNOS mRNA expression were also elevated in their spinal cord. Consistently, in the effector phase of EAE the concentration of advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) was higher in spinal cord of male rats, which exhibit more severe neurological deficit than their female counterparts. In as much as data obtained in the experimental models could be translated to humans, the findings may be relevant for designing sex-specific antioxidant therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the study indicated that the increased pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance in plasma may be an early indicator of EAE development. Moreover, it showed that plasma AOPP level may indicate not only actual activity of the disease, but also serve to predict severity of its course.",Animal-other,"<journal>Neurochemical research</journal><title>Sex Difference in Oxidative Stress Parameters in Spinal Cord of Rats with Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis: Relation to Neurological Deficit.</title><abstract>The study examined (a) whether there is sex difference in spinal cord and plasma oxidative stress profiles in Dark Agouti rats immunised for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal experimental model of multiple sclerosis, and (b) whether there is correlation between the oxidative stress in spinal cord and neurological deficit.

606,27138817,Psychiatry research,Psychopathological factors associated with problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use in a sample of adolescents in Germany.,"In Germany, high prevalence rates for problematic alcohol use and problematic Internet use in adolescents were reported. The objective of the present study was to identify psychopathological factors associated with these two behavior patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation assessing psychopathological factors for both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use in the same sample of adolescents. We surveyed a sample of 1444 adolescents in Germany regarding problematic alcohol use, problematic Internet use, psychopathology and psychological well-being. We conducted binary logistic regression analyses. 5.6% of the sample showed problematic alcohol use, 4.8% problematic Internet use, and 0.8% both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Problematic alcohol use was higher in adolescents with problematic Internet use compared to those without problematic Internet use. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms were statistically significant associated with both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use.

1773,36203173,BMC medical ethics,Flaws in advance directives that request withdrawing assisted feeding in late-stage dementia may cause premature or prolonged dying.,"The terminal illness of late-stage (advanced) Alzheimer's and related dementias is progressively cruel, burdensome, and can last years if caregivers assist oral feeding and hydrating. Options to avoid prolonged dying are limited since advanced dementia patients cannot qualify for Medical Aid in Dying. Physicians and judges can insist on clear and convincing evidence that the patient wants to die-which many advance directives cannot provide. Proxies/agents' substituted judgment may not be concordant with patients' requests. While advance directives can be patients' last resort to attain a peaceful and timely dying consistent with their lifelong values, success depends on their being effective and acceptable. A single flaw can provide opponents justification to refuse the directive's requests to cease assisted feeding.	This article considers 24 common advance directive flaws in four categories. Process flaws focus on how patients express their end-of-life wishes. Content flaws reflect drafters' selection of conditions and interventions, and how they are described. Inherent flaws can make advance directives unacceptable to authorities concerned about premature dying. Strategies are needed to compel physicians to write needed orders and to prevent third parties from sabotaging these orders after they are  implemented. The article includes excerpts from 'dementia-specific' directives or supplements that exemplify each flaw-mostly from the US and Europe. No directive critiqued here included an effective strategy to resolve this long-debated bioethical conflict: the past directive requests 'Cease assisted feeding' but the incapacitated patient apparently expresses the desire to 'Continue assisted feeding.' Some opponents to the controversial request, cease assisted feeding, use this conflict as a conceptual wedge to practice hard paternalism. This article proposes a protocol to prevent this conflict from emerging. These strategies may prevent authorities from requiring patients to fulfill authorities' additional clinical criteria as a prerequisite to honor the requests in patients directives.	This critique of flaws may serve as a guide to drafting and to selecting effective and acceptable advance directives for dementia. It also poses several bioethical and clinical questions to those in authority: Does your paternalistic refusal to honor patients' wishes respect their self-determination? Protect vulnerable patients from harm? Force patients to endure prolonged suffering? Violate the principles of bioethics?

123,26876488,Scientific reports,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor promoter methylation and cortical thickness in recurrent major depressive disorder.,"Recent studies have reported that methylation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene promoter is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to investigate the association between cortical thickness and methylation of BDNF promoters as well as serum BDNF levels in MDD. The participants consisted of 65 patients with recurrent MDD and 65 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Methylation of BDNF promoters and cortical thickness were compared between the groups. The right medial orbitofrontal, right lingual, right lateral occipital, left lateral orbitofrontal, left pars triangularis, and left lingual cortices were thinner in patients with MDD than in healthy controls. Among the MDD group, right pericalcarine, right medical orbitofrontal, right rostral middle frontal, right postcentral, right inferior temporal, right cuneus, right precuneus, left frontal pole, left superior frontal, left superior temporal, left rostral middle frontal and left lingual cortices had inverse correlations with methylation of BDNF promoters. Higher levels of BDNF promoter methylation may be closely associated with the reduced cortical thickness among patients with MDD. Serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in MDD, and showed an inverse relationship with BDNF methylation only in healthy controls.

A cross sectional, qualitative study.	Community.	Fourteen spinal cord injury survivors.	Subjects participated in a semi-structured interview about 'when', 'where' 'by whom' and 'how' they received and 'would' prefer to receive bad news.	Answers to 'how' questions were coded according to SPIKES protocol (Setting, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Empathizing, Summary).	Eight participants (57%) reported that they received bad news from a physician, mostly during rehabilitation. All would prefer to be informed by a physician and majority preferred to be gradually informed during rehabilitation. Half were not satisfied with the content of information. Only half felt that his/her physiatrist understood his/her emotional distress. Majority of participants who received bad news from physicians reported that the setting was private and their family members accompanied them.	Most spinal cord injury survivors were unsatisfied with knowledge and emotional support provided by rehabilitation physicians. Participants would prefer to receive bad news by a senior physiatrist in a planned meeting during rehabilitation.",Remaining,"<journal>The journal of spinal cord medicine</journal><title>Breaking bad news in spinal cord injury; a qualitative study assessing the perspective of spinal cord injury survivors in Turkey.</title><abstract>Prior abstract publication: 2[nd] Medical Rehabilitation Congress; Nov 4-7, 2010; Ankara, Turkey Objective: This study aims to investigate the process of breaking bad news from the perspective of spinal cord injury survivors.

1768,3226364,Medical hypotheses,The TILT formula for brain lesions.,"A formula to evaluate and grade brain lesions is reported. The formula is based on 4 descriptive factors which characterize the lesion severity and potential outcome on the subject. The factors are, type of lesion, intensity of lesion, location and time of lesion duration before therapy is applied (TILT). A relative value is assigned to each TILT factor and the sum of these values determines the severity of the injury or traumindex. The relative benefit of specific therapy can then be assessed quickly and objectively by applying its effect on TILT. Three examples picked at random from the literature, illustrate application of TILT comparing 'claimed' and 'apparent' benefit of specific treatments. The formula is useful for both model-induced basic and sustained clinical injuries of the brain.",Remaining,"<journal>Medical hypotheses</journal><title>The TILT formula for brain lesions.</title><abstract>A formula to evaluate and grade brain lesions is reported.
