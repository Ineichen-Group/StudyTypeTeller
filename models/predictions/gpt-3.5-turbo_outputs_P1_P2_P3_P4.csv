340,28645717,Vaccine,Surveillance of pneumococcal colonization and invasive pneumococcal disease reveals shift in prevalent carriage serotypes in Massachusetts' children to relatively low invasiveness.,"Following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), overall nasopharyngeal colonization rates have not changed significantly, however a dramatic and sustained decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children was observed in every setting where the PCVs were implemented. We aimed to describe the differences in invasive disease potential of serotypes that are common colonizers in pre- and post-vaccine eras in order to provide further insight in our understanding of dynamic epidemiology of pneumococcal diseases.	Using data from surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage and enhanced surveillance for IPD, a serotype specific 'invasive capacity (IC)' was computed by dividing the incidence of IPD due to serotype x by the carriage prevalence of that same serotype in children <7years of age in Massachusetts. We have evaluated the serotype specific invasive capacity in two periods; pre-PCV13 (2001/02, 2003/04, 2006/07, 2008/09) and post-PCV13 (2010/11 and 2013/14), and by age groups; <24monthsvs. ≥24months.	An approximate 50-fold variation in the point estimate was observed between the serotypes having the highest (7F, 38, 19A, 3, 33F) and the lowest (6C, 35B, 21, 11A, 23B and 23A) computed serotype specific invasive disease potential. In the post-PCV13 era (6C, 35B, 11A, 23B and 23A), 5 of the 7 most common serotypes colonizing the nasopharynx were serotypes with the lowest invasive capacity. Serotype specific invasive capacity trended down in older children for majority of the serotypes, and serotypes 3, 10A and 19A had significantly lower invasive capacity in children older than 24months of age compared to younger children.	Invasive capacity differs among serotypes and likely by age. Point estimates of IC for most of the common serotypes colonizing children in Massachusetts in post-PCV13 era were low and likely explain the continued reduction in IPD from the pre-PCV era in the absence of specific protection against these serotypes.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,"Human, systematic review"
47,11482695,Acta neurochirurgica,Carotid endarterectomy: a new technique replacing internal shunts.,"Carotid endarterectomy has been reported to increase the time free from cerebral ischemic events in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a high grade of stenosis of the internal carotid artery. In cases in whom the compensatory circulation during the carotid clamp time is not sufficient, the use of intraluminal shunts has been proposed. However, the use of intraluminal shunts present several problems, such as the technical difficulties in positioning the shunt, the variability of time requested for the placement, the inconstancy of the blood flow during surgery, and the need to clamp off the carotid to introduce and remove the shunt. For these reasons, most operators prefer not to employ intraluminal shunts, while others do use them only in selected cases. The purpose of this work is to present, for the first time, a new type of temporary extraluminal shunt, connecting the femoral to the internal carotid artery with the interposition of a roller pump to regulate the blood flow. This method allows one to perform carotid endarterectomy without interrupting the blood flow to the brain.	407 consecutive patients, who underwent carotid endarterectomy between August 1992 and April 2000, were considered. 35 patients presented an absolutely insufficient collateral circulation, demonstrated by important modifications of the electroencephalographic monitoring during the carotid clamp time. In these patients the endarterectomy was performed using a new femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt.	In all the cases in whom the femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt was positioned, the normalisation of electroencephalographic monitoring was achieved by regulating the blood flow with the interposed roller pump. The use and the placement of the shunt was simple and easy. None of the patients showed postoperative complications, except for one who had a stroke two days after surgery.	The results obtained, although to be confirmed by further studies, seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of our femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt, which was simple to use and safe.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Non-RCT non-drug-intervention

Couples in IBCT made steady improvements in satisfaction throughout the course of treatment, whereas TBCT couples improved more quickly than IBCT couples early in treatment but then, in contrast to the IBCT group, plateaued later in treatment. Both treatments produced similar levels of clinically significant improvement by the end of treatment (71% of IBCT couples and 59% of TBCT couples were reliably improved or recovered on the Dyadic Adjustment Scale; G. B. Spanier, 1976). Measures of communication also showed improvement for both groups.

479,9578881,The Journal of laryngology and otology,Vocal fold abductor paralysis as a solitary and fatal manifestation of multiple system atrophy.,"A patient is presented who had bilateral abductor vocal fold paralysis pathologically proven to be due to multiple system atrophy (MSA) in the absence of other neurological features. MSA is a degenerative neurological condition that includes olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Shy-Drager syndrome and striatonigral degeneration. The usual predominant features of MSA are cerebellar ataxia, autonomic dysfunction and Parkinsonism. Stridor is present in over one third of patients and has been reported previously as a presenting symptom in MSA: however previously reported patients have always gone on to develop other neurological symptoms. The usual investigations of bilateral abductor vocal fold paralysis caused by MSA will not reveal the pathological process and we believe that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the medulla and brain stem and autonomic function tests are probably the investigations of choice. It is a worthwhile exercise attempting to identify MSA as the cause of stridor as the prognosis is good in the medium term if appropriate support is offered.",Remaining,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Case report
485,2115207,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases. Supplementum,"Childhood acute bacterial meningitis in the Sudan: an epidemiological, clinical and laboratory study.","The aims of the present study were to document the epidemiology, clinical features and complications of childhood acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) in The Sudan during both an inter-epidemic (endemic) period (1985-1986), and the 1988 serogroup A epidemic; and to examine the phenotypic and genetic similarities and differences of Neisseria meningitidis strains isolated in The Sudan and Sweden. A new enzyme immunoassay test (Pharmacia Meningitis EIA-Test) was evaluated as a potential rapid diagnostic method for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae (HI) type b, Neisseria meningitidis (MC) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNC). The test was found to have good sensitivity (0.86) and specificity (0.95) in the inter-epidemic period; and to be adaptable to the field work in The Sudan during the 1988 MC epidemic. During inter-epidemic (endemic) situations in The Sudan, greater than 90% of childhood ABM was caused by one of the three organisms, HI type b, MC and PNC. HI accounted for 57% of the cases. The peak incidence (76%) of HI cases was in infants (less than 12 months) similar to the situation in other African countries. The overall case fatality ratio was 18.6%. Prospective follow-up of survivors for 3-4 years revealed that an additional 43% either died or had permanent neurological complications, the most prevalent and persistent of which was sensorineural hearing loss recorded in 22% of long term survivors. Post-meningitic children were found to have significantly lower intelligence quotients (92.3 +/- 13.9) than their sibling controls (100.7 +/- 10.2, P = 0.029). Features of the large serogroup A sulphonamide resistant MC epidemic (February-August 1988) in Khartoum are described. An estimated annual incidence of 1,679/100,000 was recorded at the peak of the epidemic. The highest attack rate was in young children less than 5 years, as in many other African countries; nevertheless, a high morbidity was observed in adults (31% of the cases greater than or equal to 20 years). The clinical features, mortality (6.3%) and short term sequelae in Sudanese children were generally within the framework described for MC disease elsewhere. Detailed analysis of MC isolates from Sudan and Sweden by characterizing their electrophoretic enzyme types, DNA restriction endonuclease pattern and outer membrane proteins, revealed that serogroup A MC clone III-1 was responsible of The Sudan epidemic in 1988 and has been the dominant serogroup A organism in Sweden since 1973. The Sudanese strains isolated prior to the epidemic (1985) were clone IV-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Remaining,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,"Human, systematic review"

249,18084303,Nature structural & molecular biology,Structural basis for synaptic adhesion mediated by neuroligin-neurexin interactions.,"The heterophilic synaptic adhesion molecules neuroligins and neurexins are essential for establishing and maintaining neuronal circuits by modulating the formation and maturation of synapses. The neuroligin-neurexin adhesion is Ca2+-dependent and regulated by alternative splicing. We report a structure of the complex at a resolution of 2.4 A between the mouse neuroligin-1 (NL1) cholinesterase-like domain and the mouse neurexin-1beta (NX1beta) LNS (laminin, neurexin and sex hormone-binding globulin-like) domain. The structure revealed a delicate neuroligin-neurexin assembly mediated by a hydrophilic, Ca2+-mediated and solvent-supplemented interface, rendering it capable of being modulated by alternative splicing and other regulatory factors. Thermodynamic data supported a mechanism wherein splicing site B of NL1 acts by modulating a salt bridge at the edge of the NL1-NX1beta interface. Mapping neuroligin mutations implicated in autism indicated that most such mutations are structurally destabilizing, supporting deficient neuroligin biosynthesis and processing as a common cause for this brain disorder.",Animal-other,In-vitro-study,Animal-other,Animal-other,In-vitro study
90,16332401,Neurobiology of aging,Increased cholesterol in Abeta-positive nerve terminals from Alzheimer's disease cortex.,"Synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poorly understood but evidence suggests it is a key pathological event. In order to precisely detect stable synaptic changes, we have developed methods for flow cytometry analysis of synaptosomes prepared from cryopreserved AD samples, and have previously shown that amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulates in surviving presynaptic terminals in AD cortex. In the present experiments we have examined amyloid-containing terminals in more detail, first dual labeling synaptosomes from AD cortex for Abeta and a series of markers, and then using quadrant analysis to compare amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative terminals. Amyloid-positive synaptosomes were larger in size than amyloid-negatives (p<0.007), and significant increases were observed in mean fluorescence for the lipid raft markers cholesterol (27%; p<0.0005) and GM1 ganglioside (24%; p<0.005). SNAP-25 immunofluorescence was increased by 31% (p<0.0001) in amyloid-bearing terminals, consistent with a sprouting response to amyloid accumulation. These results suggest that Abeta accumulation in synaptic terminals may underly dysfunction prior to or independent of extracellular amyloid deposition.",Remaining,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,In-vitro study
322,32594193,Experimental brain research,Dopamine boosts intention and action awareness in Parkinson's disease.,"Dopaminergic deficiency in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with underactivation of the supplementary motor area and a reduction of voluntary actions. In these patients, awareness of intention to act has been shown to be delayed. However, delayed awareness of intention to act has also been shown in patients with hyperdopaminergic states and an excess of unwilled movements, as in Tourette's, and in patients with functional movement disorders. Hence, the role of dopamine in the awareness of intention and action remains unclear. 36 PD patients were tested ON and OFF dopaminergic medication and compared with 35 healthy age-matched controls. In addition, 17 PD patients with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) were tested ON medication and ON and OFF stimulation. Participants judged either the moment a self-generated action was performed, or the moment the urge to perform the action was felt, using the 'Libet method'. Temporal judgments of intention and action awareness were comparable between unmedicated PD patients and controls. Dopaminergic medication boosted anticipatory awareness of both intentions and actions in PD patients, relative to an unmedicated condition. The difference between ON/OFF DBS was not statistically reliable. Functional improvement of motor ability in PD through dopaminergic supplementation leads to earlier awareness of both intention, and of voluntary action.",Remaining,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,"Human, non-RCT drug-intervention"

119,23594430,Neurological research,Effects of comprehensive education protocol in decreasing pre-hospital stroke delay among Chinese urban community population.,"Studies have shown that awareness of early stroke symptoms and the use of ambulances are two important factors in decreasing pre-hospital stroke delay. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a comprehensive educational stroke protocol in improving stroke response times.	Two urban communities in Beijing (population ≍50 000), matched in economic status and geography, were enrolled in this study. A comprehensive educational protocol, which included public lectures and distribution of instructive material for the community and its medical staff, was implemented from August 2008 to December 2010. Surveillance of new onset stroke in both communities was carried out during the same period. Pre-hospital delay time and percentage of patients using emergency medical services (EMS) were compared between the two communities.	After comprehensive educational protocol, we found that: (i) pre-hospital delay (time from stroke symptom onset to hospital arrival) decreased from 180 to 79 minutes, (ii) the proportion of patients arriving within three hours of stroke onset increased from 55·8% to 80·4%, (iii) pre-hospital delay of stroke patients with symptoms of paralysis, numbness, and speech impediments was decreased, and (iv) the proportion of stroke patients calling for EMS increased from 50·4% to 60·7%.

305,19491314,Schizophrenia bulletin,Disengagement from mental health treatment among individuals with schizophrenia and strategies for facilitating connections to care: a review of the literature.,"Disengagement from mental health services can lead to devastating consequences for individuals with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses who require ongoing treatment. We review the extent and correlates of dropping out of mental health treatment for individuals with schizophrenia and suggest strategies for facilitating treatment engagement. Although rates vary across studies, reviews of the literature suggest that up to one-third of individuals with serious mental illnesses who have had some contact with the mental health service system disengage from care. Younger age, male gender, ethnic minority background, and low social functioning have been consistently associated with disengagement from mental health treatment. Individuals with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders, as well as those with early-onset psychosis, are at particularly high risk of treatment dropout. Engagement strategies should specifically target these high-risk groups, as well as high-risk periods, including following an emergency room or hospital admission and the initial period of treatment. Interventions to enhance engagement in mental health treatment range from low-intensity interventions, such as appointment reminders, to high-intensity interventions, such as assertive community treatment. Disengagement from treatment may reflect the consumer's perspective that treatment is not necessary, is not meeting their needs, or is not being provided in a collaborative manner. An emerging literature on patient-centered care and shared decision making in psychiatry provides suggestive evidence that efforts to enhance client-centered communication and promote individuals' active involvement in mental health treatment decisions can also improve engagement in treatment.",Non-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,"2.

The present study investigated whether optimism can be increased by imagining a best possible self (BPS). Effects were compared to a control group in which participants imagined their daily activities (DA).	In order to minimize inter-individual differences in content of imagery, participants constructed their BPS according to 3 domains, namely a personal, relational, and professional domain. All participants were instructed to practice their imagery exercise for 5 min per day over a period of two weeks. Effects on optimism and mood were measured after one session, after one week and after two weeks.	Results indicated that BPS imagery led to significantly larger increases in optimism as compared to DA imagery, after one session and over a two week period. Effects on optimism remained after controlling for possible mediation by the change in positive mood.	In order to test the effectiveness of our BPS imagery intervention we relied exclusively on self-report measures.

142,9745353,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,[A study of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in the presenium and senium].,"Recently, with the increase in elderly population, we have had more opportunities to administer neuroleptics to elderly patients for hallucinatory delusional state, delirium, psychomotor excitement, wandering etc. However, little is known about the characteristics of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in elderly patients, which is the most serious side effect of neuroleptics. In this paper, we present the clinical course of five NMS patients in the presenium and senium. Case 1 was 72-year-old male who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with late onset). He showed nocturnal wandering, insomnia, and irritability. Tiapride 60 mg per day had been administered previously. Just after the addition of oxypertine 10 mg per day, NMS occurred, and he died of pneumonia a week later. Case 2 was 75-year-old male who was diagnosed as having vascular dementia. He showed insomnia, hyperactivity and wandering. He had been given levomepromazine (LPZ) 10 mg per day over a long period of time. At first, he had daily episodic fever, however, serum CPK levels did not increase at that time. A month later, all the symptoms of NMS appeared and then the patient's condition suddenly deteriorated and he died three days later. Case 3 was a 64-year-old male who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with early onset). He showed insomnia, irritability and violence. Tiapride 50-125 mg per day was administered along with oxypertine 50-115 mg per day. Almost two months later, NMS occurred. He had daily episodic fever at first, extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic instabilities gradually increased. Soon after symptoms of NMS were completed. In this case, NMS seemed to be induced by bacterial pneumonia after long term administration of LPZ 5 mg per day. Case 4 was a 75-year-old female who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with late onset). She showed hallucinatory delusional state. Although she had autonomic instabilities just after adminstration of haloperidol 1-2 mg per day, NMS itself occurred after discontinuing the neuroleptic. Case 5 was a 61-year-old female who was diagnosed as having schizophrenia at the age of forty. She was given various neuroleptics over a period of time. The neuroimaging in SPECT showed her cerebral cortex was generally hypoactive. She had a tendency to have autonomic instabilities after the administration of relatively high potential neuroleptics. Risperidone 3-6 mg per day was administered, and almost a month later, autonomic instabilities increased and she was diagnosed as having NMS. All the patients would be able to have brain dysfunction, which suggested that such patients may be liable to NMS. In our patients, NMS occurred after the additional administration of oxypertine 10 mg per day or after long time administration of LPZ 5 mg per day. It was suggested that NMS could occur after the administration of low dose and relatively low potential neuroleptics in elderly patients. Our 3 of 5 patients showed the delayed type of NMS, which might be relatively more frequent in senior and presenior patients than in younger patients. In case 3, NMS was induced by the somatic disease (bacterial pneumonia), however in other cases, NMS was not always induced by somatic disease. Our 4 of 5 patients experienced some of the symptoms of NMS--episodic fever, extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic instabilities--before the onset of NMS. Such symptoms may be 'pre-steps' to NMS. Once NMS occurred, the patient's systemic condition tended to deteriorate acutely. Due to the fact that our 2 of 5 patients died, it was suggested that the prognosis of the NMS patients in presenium and senium tends to be much worse. It is important to find the 'pre-steps' to NMS and treat them as soon as possible for better prognosis.",Remaining,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Case report

A statistically significant difference was evident between men (424 +/- 88 ml/min) and women (371 +/- 62 ml/min) (p less than 0.001). The intrasessional variation (S.D./mean) was 13% and the intersessional variation, 16%. No significant difference was seen between the sides. Ninety-two patients who had carotid angiography were studied and the flow rates compared with the degree of ICA stenosis on each side. The flow rate for mild ICA stenosis (1% to 39%) was 404 +/- 109 ml/min, for moderate stenoses (40% to 69%), 390 +/- 91 ml/min, and for severe stenoses (70% to 99%), 351 +/- 109 ml/min. There was a significant difference in flows only between mild and severe grades of stenosis of the ICA (p less than 0.01). With unilateral stenosis, comparison of flow values in the normal and affected sides showed the greatest discriminatory power when the absolute difference of flow values was taken (p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Remaining,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Remaining

311,11725215,"Neuropsychiatry, neuropsychology, and behavioral neurology",Behavioral changes in Huntington Disease.,"This study aimed to gain a better understanding of behavioral abnormalities in Huntington disease (HD) and to develop a method for reliably assessing these changes.	Behavioral changes are a central feature of HD and often cause considerable distress and difficulty to patients and their relatives. However, they have received little attention from research despite their prevalence and clinical significance.	One hundred thirty-four patients with HD were assessed using the Problem Behaviors Assessment for Huntington Disease (PBA-HD), an instrument for rating the presence, severity and frequency of behavioral abnormalities in HD.	The findings confirm that behavioral problems are common among patients with HD. The most common symptoms were loss of energy and initiative, poor perseverance and quality of work, impaired judgment, poor self-care and emotional blunting. Affective symptoms such as depression, anxiety and irritability occurred in around half the patients studied. Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) were rarely reported. Factor analysis distinguished three clusters of behavioral symptoms, which were interpreted respectively as reflecting Apathy, Depression and Irritability. The 'Apathy' factor was highly correlated with duration of illness, whereas no such relationship was observed for the 'Depression' and 'Irritability' factors.	The results suggest that certain behavioral changes are fundamental to the progression of HD, whereas others have a more complex relationship to the disease process. The findings have implications for the choice of behavioral measures used to evaluate efficacy of therapeutic interventions.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-case-report,Human-systematic-review,"Human, non-systematic review"
492,35617623,Journal of patient safety,Lessons Learned in Implementing a Chronic Opioid Therapy Management System.,"Opioid misuse has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in the United States, and safer opioid use represents an important challenge in the primary care setting. This article describes a research collaborative of health service researchers, systems engineers, and clinicians seeking to improve processes for safer chronic opioid therapy management in an academic primary care center. We present implementation results and lessons learned along with an intervention toolkit that others may consider using within their organization.	Using iterative improvement lifecycles and systems engineering principles, we developed a risk-based workflow model for patients on chronic opioids. Two key safe opioid use process metrics-percent of patients with recent opioid treatment agreements and urine drug tests-were identified, and processes to improve these measures were designed, tested, and implemented. Focus groups were conducted after the conclusion of implementation, with barriers and lessons learned identified via thematic analysis.	Initial surveys revealed a lack of knowledge regarding resources available to patients and prescribers in the primary care clinic. In addition, 18 clinicians (69%) reported largely 'inheriting' (rather than initiating) their chronic opioid therapy patients. We tracked 68 patients over a 4-year period. Although process measures improved, full adherence was not achieved for the entire population. Barriers included team structure, the evolving opioid environment, and surveillance challenges, along with disruptions resulting from the 2019 novel coronavirus.	Safe primary care opioid prescribing requires ongoing monitoring and management in a complex environment. The application of a risk-based approach is possible but requires adaptability and redundancies to be reliable.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Non-RCT non-drug-intervention
65,36370926,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,Intermittent fasting protects the nigral dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-mediated dopaminergic neuronal injury in mice.,"Dietary restriction through low-calorie intake or intermittent fasting benefits many organs, including the brain. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of fasting in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We found that fasting every other day rather than weekly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor in the nigrostriatal pathway. Therefore, we maintained the animals on alternate-day fasting for 2 weeks and injected MPTP (30 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) for five days. We observed that alternate-day fasting attenuated MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss and astroglial activation in the substantia nigra and the striatum. Moreover, neurochemical analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography showed that alternate-day fasting reduced MPTP-induced depletion of striatal dopamine. Consistent with these results, behavioral tests showed that fasting suppressed the motor impairment caused by MPTP. Furthermore, fasting increased the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B, which are downstream signaling molecules of neurotrophic factors. Fasting also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein, further supporting the involvement of neurotrophic factors in the observed neuroprotective effects. Hence, our results demonstrated the dopaminergic neuroprotection of intermittent fasting in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, supporting the idea that fasting could be an instrumental tool for preventing neurodegeneration in the brain.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,Animal-drug-intervention,Animal-drug-intervention,Animal-drug-intervention,"Animal, non-drug-intervention"

34,8197410,Schizophrenia bulletin,"Psychometric high-risk paradigm, perceptual aberrations, and schizotypy: an update.","The psychometric high-risk strategy represents a useful methodologic adjunct to the traditional genetic high-risk research approach in the study of the etiology and development of schizophrenia. During the past 15 years, considerable research activity has focused on psychometrically identified individuals hypothesized to be en route to schizophrenia (i.e., putative schizotypes). The Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) has figured prominently in such prediction-oriented psychometric high-risk work. This report examines research using the PAS completed since 1987 that has established the instrument as a valid index for detecting liability for schizophrenia (or schizotypy) and as, arguably, the schizotypy index of choice for research. These results are presented and interpreted in light of Meehl's theoretical framework of schizotypy. Other measures of and assessment devices for schizotypy (schizophrenia-related liability) are identified. Of these other measures, the Chapmans' Magical Ideation Scale and the schizophrenia liability index of Moldin and colleagues are particularly well established. Methodologic suggestions for future psychometric high-risk and other work using objective measures of schizotypic psychopathology are offered. It is strongly recommended that future studies of schizotypy (or those in the planning stages, relying on psychometric detection methods use multiple psychometric indices to tap schizotypy or use a psychometric index in association with other promising biobehavioral markers of schizophrenia liability (e.g., sustained attentional deficits, eye movement dysfunction) for maximum efficiency in both location and definition of schizotypes.",Remaining,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Non-systematic review

There is uncertainty about the prognostic value of EEG background activity after hypothermia was introduced.	Searches were made on Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to March 1, 2018. Pooled sensitivities and specificities were calculated to assess the diagnostic power of burst suppression, low voltage, and flat trace background activities in the prediction of an adverse neurological outcome in the follow-up period in hypothermia-treated neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. I[2] was used to assess heterogeneity, and meta-regression was done to explore the source of heterogeneity.	Eighteen studies with 940 neonates were included. Pooled sensitivities and specificities in predicting the combination of death and neurodevelopmental impairment were burst suppression (sensitivity 0.87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 0.93], specificity 0.60 [95% CI 0.44 to 0.74]), low voltage (sensitivity 0.84 [0.75 to 0.90], specificity 0.80 [0.58 to 0.92]), and flat trace (sensitivity 0.85 [0.75 to 0.92], specificity 0.94 [0.77 to 0.99]). Subgroup analysis revealed the sensitivities of background patterns obtained after 24 hours of life were higher than those within age 24 hours, whereas the specificities were just the reverse. Flat trace performed best on sensitivity 0.93 (0.60 to 0.99) and specificity 0.90 (0.64 to 0.98) in predicting death. Burst suppression demonstrated the highest sensitivity 0.87 (0.58 to 0.97) and flat trace performed best on specificity 0.85 (0.60 to 0.96) in predicting neurodevelopmental impairment.	EEG background activity is predictive of long-term neurological outcome in hypothermia-treated neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

173,20058555,Stapp car crash journal,A finite element model of region-specific response for mild diffuse brain injury.,"It is well known that rotational loading is responsible for a spectrum of diffuse brain injuries spanning from concussion to diffuse axonal trauma. Many experimental studies have been performed to understand the pathological and biomechanical factors associated with diffuse brain injuries. Finite element models have also been developed to correlate experimental findings with intrinsic variables such as strain. However, a paucity of studies exist examining the combined role of the strain-time parameter. Consequently, using the principles of finite element analysis, the present study introduced the concept of sustained maximum principal strain (SMPS) criterion and explored its potential applicability to diffuse brain injury. An algorithm was developed to determine if the principal strain in a finite element of the brain exceeded a specified magnitude over a specific time interval. The anatomical and geometrical details of the rat for the two-dimensional model were obtained from published data. Using material properties from literature and iterative techniques, the model was validated under three distinct rotational loading conditions indicative of non-injury, concussion, and diffuse axonal trauma. Validation results produced a set of material properties to define the model and were deemed appropriate to examine the role of sustained strain as an indicator of the mechanics of mild diffuse brain injury at the local level. Using a separate set of histological data obtained from graded mild diffuse brain injury experimental studies in rats, different formulations of SMPS criterion were evaluated. For the hippocampus and parietal cortex regions, 4-4 SMPS criterion was found to most closely match with the pattern of histological results. This was further verified by correlating the fractional areas to the time of unconsciousness for each animal group. Although not fully conclusive, these results are valuable in the understanding of diffuse brain injury pathologies following rotational loading.",Animal-other,Animal-non-drug-intervention,Animal-non-drug-intervention,Animal-non-drug-intervention,"Animal, non-drug-intervention"

179,28317947,NeuroImage. Clinical,Parietal operculum and motor cortex activities predict motor recovery in moderate to severe stroke.,"While motor recovery following mild stroke has been extensively studied with neuroimaging, mechanisms of recovery after moderate to severe strokes of the types that are often the focus for novel restorative therapies remain obscure. We used fMRI to: 1) characterize reorganization occurring after moderate to severe subacute stroke, 2) identify brain regions associated with motor recovery and 3) to test whether brain activity associated with passive movement measured in the subacute period could predict motor outcome six months later. Because many patients with large strokes involving sensorimotor regions cannot engage in voluntary movement, we used passive flexion-extension of the paretic wrist to compare 21 patients with subacute ischemic stroke to 24 healthy controls one month after stroke. Clinical motor outcome was assessed with Fugl-Meyer motor scores (motor-FMS) six months later. Multiple regression, with predictors including baseline (one-month) motor-FMS and sensorimotor network regional activity (ROI) measures, was used to determine optimal variable selection for motor outcome prediction. Sensorimotor network ROIs were derived from a meta-analysis of arm voluntary movement tasks. Bootstrapping with 1000 replications was used for internal model validation. During passive movement, both control and patient groups exhibited activity increases in multiple bilateral sensorimotor network regions, including the primary motor (MI), premotor and supplementary motor areas (SMA), cerebellar cortex, putamen, thalamus, insula, Brodmann area (BA) 44 and parietal operculum (OP1-OP4). Compared to controls, patients showed: 1) lower task-related activity in ipsilesional MI, SMA and contralesional cerebellum (lobules V-VI) and 2) higher activity in contralesional MI, superior temporal gyrus and OP1-OP4. Using multiple regression, we found that the combination of baseline motor-FMS, activity in ipsilesional MI (BA4a), putamen and ipsilesional OP1 predicted motor outcome measured 6 months later (adjusted-R[2] = 0.85; bootstrap p < 0.001). Baseline motor-FMS alone predicted only 54% of the variance. When baseline motor-FMS was removed, the combination of increased activity in ipsilesional MI-BA4a, ipsilesional thalamus, contralesional mid-cingulum, contralesional OP4 and decreased activity in ipsilesional OP1, predicted better motor outcome (djusted-R[2] = 0.96; bootstrap p < 0.001). In subacute stroke, fMRI brain activity related to passive movement measured in a sensorimotor network defined by activity during voluntary movement predicted motor recovery better than baseline motor-FMS alone. Furthermore, fMRI sensorimotor network activity measures considered alone allowed excellent clinical recovery prediction and may provide reliable biomarkers for assessing new therapies in clinical trial contexts. Our findings suggest that neural reorganization related to motor recovery from moderate to severe stroke results from balanced changes in ipsilesional MI (BA4a) and a set of phylogenetically more archaic sensorimotor regions in the ventral sensorimotor trend, in which OP1 and OP4 processes may complement the ipsilesional dorsal motor cortex in achieving compensatory sensorimotor recovery.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-case-report,Human-systematic-review,"Human, non-RCT non-drug-intervention"

We conducted a meta-analysis of studies on expression and cellular distribution of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) in IE patients to evaluate the contribution of this protein to AED resistance. In addition, we summarize experiments examining MRP1 expression and substrates in animal models of IE.	The literature search based on pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as quality assessment, data extraction and statistical analyses were conducted concurrently by two independent researchers. We identified nine high-quality studies (Jadad score ≥3) published between 2000 and 2014 on the expression and cellular distribution of MRP1 in IE patients. A fixed effect model was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Forest and funnel plots were constructed to assess study heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively.	MRP1 expression was significantly higher in both astrocytes (OR = 17.04, 95% CI: 7.69-37.76, P < 0.00001) and neurons (OR = 22.13, 95% CI: 8.52-57.46, P < 0.00001) of IE patients compared to controls, while there was no significant difference in endothelial cell MRP1 expression (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.09-1.79, P = 0.48). Funnel plot symmetry indicated no substantial publication bias. Most relevant preclinical studies from 2000 to 2014 found higher MRP1 expression in IE model rodents. Furthermore, MRP1 overexpression reduced the extracellular concentration of AEDs in brain, while MRP1 inhibitors enhanced brain AED concentrations.	Pooled results strongly suggest that MRP1 is overexpressed in both neurons and astrocytes of IE patients. Inhibition of MRP1 may enhance AED efficacy by increasing local drug availability.",Non-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,"Human, systematic review"

All 12 studies included in this review found significant associations between sleep disturbance and cognitive dysfunction; however, results varied considerably depending on the assessment method used and the cognitive domain assessed. Self-reported sleep disturbance generally predicted self-report but not objective measures of cognitive dysfunction.

Exposure to stressful life events while engaging in this rescue work can result in developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The study aimed to assess the prevalence of PTSD and explore potential differences between different categories of rescuers.	A cross-sectional study was conducted among 217 rescue workers. Participants were grouped according to affiliation: 'Greek Professionals Rescuers/GPR', 'International Professionals Rescuers/IPR' and 'Volunteer Rescuers/VR'.

GPR demonstrated the highest risk compared to IPR and VR (p < 0.001). Females had approximately two times higher risk. Other significant risk factors included marital status, age, and number of children. Lack of previous experience, longer operation period, longer shift hours, and handling dead refugees and dead children were also considered major risk factors.

An Expected Utility Inspired Approach To Shared decision-making For Supratentorial Ischemic Stroke.,"Patients with large territorial supratentorial infarctions are at high risk of cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, tissue herniation and death. There is strong evidence supporting prompt decompressive craniectomy after large hemispheric ischemic stroke as a means to reduce mortality. Nevertheless, functional outcomes can vary significantly. Clinical trials have traditionally judged these outcomes by a priori dichotomization without taking into account individual patient and caregiver preferences. If these are not incorporated into shared decision-making, there are significant risks in both directions, i.e. producing outcomes that may be judged as unacceptable to survivors, or not offering life-saving treatments to patients that according to their own values could be beneficial. In the absence of decision aids, we explore insights from decision theory and propose an expected utility-inspired approach as a supplementary navigating tool in the decision-making process. Four patient case scenarios are discussed as a demonstration of using individualized rankings of outcome preferences, and deriving expected utilities for interventions such as decompressive craniectomy versus medical therapy. The ultimate aim of the suggested approach is to assure that patient values are elicited and incorporated, and possible range and nature of outcomes are discussed, and by attempting to connect best available means to patient individualized ends.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Study protocol

Using longitudinal data from an epidemiological twin sample (N = 7463), this study tested whether resilience would act as a buffer for stressful life events (SLEs) against risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Resilience, demographics, and psychopathology were measured at Time 1 and recent SLEs and current MDD and GAD were measured at Time 2.	Final models, controlling for demographic covariates and Time 1 diagnosis, examined the impact of Time 1 resilience, recent SLEs, their interaction, and a three-way interaction adding sex on MDD and GAD.	The pattern of findings was the same for MDD and GAD, wherein main effects and two-way interactions of resilience and SLEs were significant, such that greater resilience was protective even in the context of high numbers of past-year SLEs. The three-way interaction was not significant, suggesting that the relationship between SLEs and resilience on psychopathology was the same for both men and women. Findings support the conceptualization of resilience as a buffer against the impact of future life stressors on common internalizing psychopathology. Longitudinal designs and trajectory-based studies that include recurring measures of SLEs could inform conceptualizations of resilience in the context of ongoing adversity and aid in developing interventions aimed at fostering healthy adaptation in the face of stressors.",Remaining,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,"Human, systematic review"

Suggestions have been made to advance psychological understanding of negative symptoms by focusing on the social cognitive processes involved in symptom formation and maintenance.	Following the recommendations by the National Institute of Mental Health workshop on social cognition in schizophrenia, this study investigated associations between negative symptoms and various aspects of social cognition including Theory of Mind (ToM), attribution, empathy, self-esteem, and interpersonal self-concepts in 75 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 75 healthy controls.	Negative symptoms were significantly associated with difficulties in ToM, less readiness to be empathic, lower self-esteem, less self-serving bias, negative self-concepts related to interpersonal abilities, and dysfunctional acceptance beliefs. Different aspects of social cognition were mildly to moderately correlated and interacted in their impact on negative symptoms: Difficulties in ToM were associated with negative symptoms in persons with low but not in persons with medium or high levels of self-esteem. Taken together, the social cognition variables and their hypothesized interaction explained 39% of the variance in negative symptoms after controlling for neurocognition and depression.	The results highlight the relevance of self-concepts related to social abilities, dysfunctional beliefs, and global self-worth alone and in interaction with ToM deficits for negative symptoms and thereby provide a helpful basis for advancing psychosocial interventions.",Remaining,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,"Human, non-systematic review"
326,31075661,Gait & posture,Comparable walking gait performance during executive and non-executive cognitive dual-tasks in chronic stroke: A pilot study.,"Falls are a serious problem among stroke survivors due to subsequent injuries, recovery setbacks, dependence, and mortality. A growing body of dual-task (DT) studies suggests a role of executive functions in gait control and falls, particularly in subacute stroke. However, few studies have compared distinct executive and non-executive tasks, nor their effects on chronic stroke gait.	The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare the effects of distinct working memory (2-back) and inhibition (Stroop) tasks on walking gait performance in chronic stroke survivors.	A pilot sample of chronic stroke survivors (n = 11, 8 males, mean age = 70.91, 6-12months post-stroke event) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 13, 4 male; mean age = 68.46) were tested. Gait performance (speed, stride time, stride time variability, stride length and stride length variability) was measured using 2 wireless inertial measurement sensors under 4 walking conditions: 1) preferred walking (single-task: ST), 2) walking with a 2-back DT, 3) walking with a Stroop DT, and 4) walking with a non-executive motor response DT. The secondary tasks were also carried out in both ST (seated) and DT conditions, to examine bidirectional effects.	While the stroke survivor sample had a slower gait speed across conditions and tasks, there were no significant differences between the groups [F(1, 22) = 1.13, p =.299, η[2]p =  .049] on the spatial or temporal gait characteristics recorded: gait performance was maintained during executive and non-executive DTs. In addition, we did not find a significant effect of group on cognitive task performance (all p > .052). However, we observed a cost in accuracy on the 2-back DT for both groups, suggesting resource overlap and greater cognitive load (all t > 19.72, all p <  .001).

Of 500 sequential specimens screened for cannabinoids by enzyme multiplied immunoassay EMIT, 63 (13%) were initially positive and 58 (12%) were confirmed positive (92%). It was observed that geographic location and race did not correlate with cannabinoid prevalence. Cannabinoid use was observed to be strongly age related, with peak use by the 21- to 25-year-old age group where 22% of the cases were positive. Use of cannabinoids was also closely linked to homicides, which represented nearly half of the positive cases but only 13% of the total cases. When comparing manner of death, the greatest percent of confirmed positives was seen in homicide (26%) and drug-related (17%) deaths. The incidence of cannabinoid use was found to be more than 3 times as great in drug-related (17%) as compared to natural deaths (5%). The percent of cannabinoid-positive cases from vehicle-related accidents was low (6%) and that from nonvehicle-related accidents somewhat higher (10%). Other drugs appeared in cannabinoid-positive cases. Most prevalent was ethanol N = 18, followed by morphine (from heroin, N = 11), quinine N = 11, and cocaine N = 11. Phencyclidine (PCP) occurred twice and several other drugs were reported only once. Of the 25 homicide cases screened for drugs, 64% were positive for some drug including ethyl alcohol. Thus it appears that a high percentage of homicide cases are drug related. Males greatly outnumbered females (56:2) in positive cases, but the number of female specimens received was small.",Remaining,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Remaining
467,33484326,Journal of neurology,"Contribution of nuclear and mitochondrial gene mutations in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome.","Mitochondrial disorders are clinically complex and have highly variable phenotypes among all inherited disorders. Mutations in mitochon drial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear genome or both have been reported in mitochondrial diseases suggesting common pathophysiological pathways. Considering the clinical heterogeneity of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) phenotype including focal neurological deficits, it is important to look beyond mitochondrial gene mutation.	The clinical, histopathological, biochemical analysis for OXPHOS enzyme activity, and electron microscopic, and neuroimaging analysis was performed to diagnose 11 patients with MELAS syndrome with a multisystem presentation. In addition, whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole mitochondrial genome sequencing were performed to identify nuclear and mitochondrial mutations.	Analysis of whole mtDNA sequence identified classical pathogenic mutation m.3243A > G in seven out of 11 patients. Exome sequencing identified pathogenic mutation in several nuclear genes associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes, epilepsy, seizure and cardiomyopathy (POLG, DGUOK, SUCLG2, TRNT1, LOXHD1, KCNQ1, KCNQ2, NEUROD1, MYH7) that may contribute to classical mitochondrial disease phenotype alone or in combination with m.3243A > G mutation.	Individuals with MELAS exhibit clinical phenotypes with varying degree of severity affecting multiple systems including auditory, visual, cardiovascular, endocrine, and nervous system. This is the first report to show that nuclear genetic factors influence the clinical outcomes/manifestations of MELAS subjects alone or in combination with m.3243A > G mutation.",Remaining,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,"Human, systematic review"

330,18519870,Neurology,"Relation of NSAIDs to incident AD, change in cognitive function, and AD pathology.","To examine the relation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to incident Alzheimer disease (AD), change in cognition, and AD pathology.	Participants were 1,019 older Catholic clergy followed up annually for up to 12 years (mean baseline age = 75.0 years, education = 18.1 years, Mini-Mental State Examination score = 28.5), enrolled in the Religious Orders Study, a longitudinal clinical-pathologic study of aging and AD. Clinical evaluations allowed for AD classification and assessment of global cognition and five cognitive domains. NSAIDs were identified by direct medication inspection at baseline and follow-up evaluations. Neuropathologic data were available on 328 deceased participants. AD pathology was summarized as a global measure and as measures of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. We used Cox proportional hazards models and mixed models for incident AD and cognitive decline, respectively, and logistic and linear regression for pathologic outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, and education.	Overall, we found no apparent relation of NSAIDs to incident AD (n = 209 cases), change in cognition, or AD pathology. The hazard ratio of incident AD was 1.19 (95% CI 0.87-1.62) comparing those using NSAIDs with those not using NSAIDs at baseline, and 0.84 (95% CI 0.63-1.11) for specific use of aspirin. Findings were similar in analyses in which we considered NSAID use during follow-up. NSAIDs were not related to change in cognition (all p values > 0.14). There was no relation of NSAIDs to global AD pathology or plaques or tangles.	These data do not support a strong relation between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Alzheimer disease or cognition. Consistent findings across clinical and pathologic outcomes provide additional confidence in these results.",,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Non-RCT non-drug-intervention

This article guides social work practice in the assessment of dementia patients and their families using an ecological-family-centered (EFC) model of practice. A case presentation illustrates how to apply the ECF model while incorporating ethnically sensitive practice principles. The model organizes complex assessment issues that often arise when working with families of dementia patients and illustrates the significance of cultural diversity in case practice. Literature on families of dementia patients is reviewed, an intervention plan for the family system is outlined, and implications for practice are noted.",Non-systematic-review,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Human-systematic-review,Non-systematic review
295,19432386,Dialogues in clinical neuroscience,Multiple rare variants in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders.,"Recent studies in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) support an important role for multiple rare variants in these conditions. This is a clinically important finding, as, with the demonstration that a significant proportion of ASDs are the result of rare, etiological genetic variants, it becomes possible to make use of genetic testing to supplement behavioral analyses for an earlier diagnosis. As it appears that earlier interventions in ASDs will produce better outcomes, the development of genetic testing to augment behaviorally based evaluations in ASDs holds promise for improved treatment. Furthermore, these rare variants involve synaptic and neuronal genes that implicate specific pathways, cells, and subcellular compartments in ASDs, which in turn will suggest novel therapeutic approaches in ASDs. Of particular recent interest are the synaptic cell adhesion and associated molecules, including neurexin 1, neuroligin 3 and 4, and SHANK3, which implicate glutamatergic synapse abnormalities in ASDs. In the current review we will overview the evidence for a genetic etiology for ASDs, and summarize recent genetic findings in these disorders.	Los estudios recientes en los trastornos del espectro autista (TEA) refuerzan el importante papel que tienen múltiples variantes raras en estos cuadros. Este es un hallazgo clínicamente importante, ya que con la demostración de que un porcentaje significativo de TEA son el resultado de una etiología de varían-tes genéticas raras, puede llegar a ser posible el empleo de pruebas genéticas como complemento al análisis de la conducta para un diagnóstico más precoz. Ya que se ha observado que las intervenciones más precoces en los TEA generan mejores evoluciones, el desarrollo de pruebas genéticas complementarías a las evaluaciones basadas en la conducta en los TEA promete un mejor tratamiento. Además estas variantes raras comprenden genes sinápticos y neuronales que incluyen vías específicas, células y compartimentos subcelulares en los TEA, lo que a la vez sugiere nuevas aproximaciones terapéuticas en los TEA, Recientemente ha tenido un especial interés la adhesión celular sináptica y las moléculas asociadas, que incluyen la neurexína 1, las neurolígínas 3 y 4, y SHANK3 lo que se traduce en alteraciones de la sínapsís glutamatérgíca en los TEA, En este artículo se revisa la evidencia de la etiología genética para los TEA y se resumen los hallazgos genéticos recientes en estos trastornos.	Les études récentes plaident en faveur de l'existence de nombreux variants rares dans les troubles du spectre autistique (TSA), Ce résultat est cliniquement important car si une proportion significative de TSA provient de variants génétiques étiologiques rares, il devient possible d'utiliser des tests génétiques pour éviter les analyses comportementales pour effectuer un diagnostic plus précoce. Comme il semble qu'intervenir tôt dans les TSA donne des évolutions plus favorables, le développement de tests génétiques pour enrichir les évaluations basées sur le comportement permet d'espérer un traitement meilleur. De plus, ces variants rares portent sur des gènes synaptiques et neuro-naux qui concernent des voies, des cellules, et des compartiments sous-cellulaires spécifiques des TSA, suggérant en retour de nouvelles approches thérapeutiques référencées dans ce domaine. Les molécules d'adhésion cellulaire synaptique et associées, (comme la neurexine 1, les neuroligines 3 et 4 et SHANK3) qui impliquent les anomalies glutamater-giques de la synapse dans les TSA, sont particulièrement intéressantes selon des données récentes. Dans cet article, nous allons donner une vue d'ensemble des arguments en faveur d'une étiologie génétique des TSA et nous résumerons les résultats génétiques récents les concernant.",Remaining,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,Human-systematic-review,"Human, systematic review"
416,22939118,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts among former users of finasteride with persistent sexual side effects.,"Finasteride, a commonly prescribed medication for male pattern hair loss, has recently been associated with persistent sexual side effects. In addition, depression has recently been added to the product labeling of Propecia (finasteride 1 mg). Finasteride reduces the levels of several neuroactive steroids linked to sexual function and depression. This study assesses depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts in former users of finasteride who developed persistent sexual side effects despite the discontinuation of finasteride.	In 2010-2011, former users of finasteride (n = 61) with persistent sexual side effects for ≥ 3 months were administered standardized interviews that gathered demographic information, medical and psychiatric histories, and information on medication use, sexual function, and alcohol consumption. All former users were otherwise healthy men with no baseline sexual dysfunction, chronic medical conditions, current or past psychiatric conditions, or use of oral prescription medications before or during finasteride use. A control group of men (n = 29), recruited from the community, had male pattern hair loss but had never used finasteride and denied any history of psychiatric conditions or use of psychiatric medications. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of depressive symptoms and the prevalence of suicidal thoughts as determined by the Beck depression inventory II (BDI-II); all subjects self-administered this questionnaire at the time of the interview or up to 10 months later.	Rates of depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥ 14) were significantly higher in the former finasteride users (75%; 46/61) as compared to the controls (10%; 3/29) (P < .0001). Moderate or severe depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥ 20) were present in 64% (39/61) of the finasteride group and 0% of the controls. Suicidal thoughts were present in 44% (27/61) of the former finasteride users and in 3% (1/29) of the controls (P < .0001).	Clinicians and potential users of finasteride should be aware of the potential risk of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts. The preliminary findings of this study warrant further research with controlled studies.",,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,"Human, non-systematic review"
406,24524869,Journal of neuroradiology = Journal de neuroradiologie,Comparison of ADC values of intracranial hemangiopericytomas and angiomatous and anaplastic meningiomas.,"This study aimed to determine whether the use of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values can improve the diagnostic efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate hemangiopericytoma (HPC) from angiomatous and anaplastic meningioma.	Preoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) studies of 38 patients with pathologically proven intracranial HPC (n = 12) and angiomatous (n = 13) or anaplastic meningioma (n = 13) were retrospectively reviewed. ADC values were measured in the tumor parenchyma and peritumoral edema, and used to obtain normalized ADC (NADC) ratios (ADC of tumor/ADC of normal white matter).	Mean ADC values were significantly different between HPC and anaplastic meningioma (1.17 ± 0.30 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s and 0.75 ± 0.11 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively). Mean NADC ratios were also significantly lower in the malignant cases (0.95 ± 0.13) compared with the benign HPCs (1.53 ± 0.39; P < 0.05). Mean ADC values and NADC ratios did not differ significantly between angiomatous meningioma and HPC (P > 0.05), whereas mean ADC values and NADC ratios were lower for anaplastic meningioma than for either angiomatous meningioma or HPC (P < 0.05). Mean ADC value in peritumoral edema in HPC (1.48 ± 0.11 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was lower than in either angiomatous (1.73 ± 0.28 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) or anaplastic (1.72 ± 0.25 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) meningioma (P < 0.05), and there was no significant difference between ADC values in anaplastic versus angiomatous meningioma (P > 0.05).	ADC values in tumor parenchyma and peritumoral edema can provide helpful information that is otherwise not available from conventional MRI to differentiate HPC from angiomatous and anaplastic meningioma.",Remaining,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,Human-case-report,In-vitro study
102,11324179,Journal of palliative care,Demoralization syndrome--a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.,"Hopelessness, loss of meaning, and existential distress are proposed as the core features of the diagnostic category of demoralization syndrome. This syndrome can be differentiated from depression and is recognizable in palliative care settings. It is associated with chronic medical illness, disability, bodily disfigurement, fear of loss of dignity, social isolation, and--where there is a subjective sense of incompetence--feelings of greater dependency on others or the perception of being a burden. Because of the sense of impotence or helplessness, those with the syndrome predictably progress to a desire to die or to commit suicide. A treatment approach is described which has the potential to alleviate the distress caused by this syndrome. Overall, demoralization syndrome has satisfactory face, descriptive, predictive, construct, and divergent validity, suggesting its utility as a diagnostic category in palliative care.",Remaining,Human-systematic-review,Human-case-report,Human-systematic-review,Non-systematic review
