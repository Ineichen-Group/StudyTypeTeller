2,28832188,Future medicinal chemistry,Dual/multitargeted xanthone derivatives for Alzheimer's disease: where do we stand?,"To date, the current therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is only symptomatic, being its efficacy limited. Hence, the recent research has been focused in the development of different pharmacological approaches. Here we discuss the potential of xanthone derivatives as new anti-Alzheimer agents. The interference of xanthone derivatives with acetylcholinesterase and other molecular targets and cellular mechanisms associated with AD have been recently systematically reported. Therefore, we report xanthones with anticholinesterase, monoamine oxidase and amyloid β aggregation inhibitory activities as well as antioxidant properties, emphasizing xanthone derivatives with dual/multitarget activity as potential agents to treat AD. We also propose the structural features for these activities that may guide the design of new, more effective xanthone derivatives.

3,17678496,Expert review of neurotherapeutics,Benefits of occupational therapy in stroke rehabilitation.,"Stroke is the largest single cause of severe physical disability and rehabilitation to reduce functional deficits is the most effective treatment. Occupational therapists play a central role in rehabilitation as members of a multidisciplinary team. Occupational therapy is a client-centered profession that uses meaningful activities across the spectrum of physical and mental domains to reduce limitations after stroke. Where remediation is not possible, occupational therapists implement compensatory strategies to promote independence. Rehabilitation is based on the concept of brain plasticity, which implies that it is possible to modulate or facilitate cerebral reorganization by external inputs. Occupational therapy activities are specifically geared to promote this re-education process and encourage the development of lost skills while accommodating for specific physical, cognitive or affective impairments. Principles of motor, sensory, cognitive and affective rehabilitation are incorporated into effective task-specific activities and environments are adapted to create the optimum conditions for successful rehabilitation.

6,37459647,Journal of drug targeting,A critical review on the role of nanotheranostics mediated approaches for targeting β amyloid in Alzheimer's.,"Alzheimer's is one of the most common neurodegenerative illnesses that affect brain cellular function. In this disease, the neurons in the brain are considered to be decaying steadily but consistently by the accumulation of amyloid mass, particularly the β-amyloids, amyloid proteins, and Tau proteins. The most responsible amyloid-proteins are amyloid-40 and amyloid-42, which have a high probability of accumulating in excess over the brain cell, interfering with normal brain cell function and triggering brain cell death. The advancement of pharmaceutical sciences leads to the development of Nanotheranostics technology, which may be used to diagnose and treat Alzheimer's. They are the colloidal nanoparticles functionalised with the therapeutic moiety as well as a diagnostic moiety. This article discusses the prognosis of Alzheimer's, various nanotheranostics approaches (nanoparticles, quantum dots, aptamers, dendrimers, etc), and their recent advancement in managing Alzheimer's.

9,19491314,Schizophrenia bulletin,Disengagement from mental health treatment among individuals with schizophrenia and strategies for facilitating connections to care: a review of the literature.,"Disengagement from mental health services can lead to devastating consequences for individuals with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses who require ongoing treatment. We review the extent and correlates of dropping out of mental health treatment for individuals with schizophrenia and suggest strategies for facilitating treatment engagement. Although rates vary across studies, reviews of the literature suggest that up to one-third of individuals with serious mental illnesses who have had some contact with the mental health service system disengage from care. Younger age, male gender, ethnic minority background, and low social functioning have been consistently associated with disengagement from mental health treatment. Individuals with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders, as well as those with early-onset psychosis, are at particularly high risk of treatment dropout. Engagement strategies should specifically target these high-risk groups, as well as high-risk periods, including following an emergency room or hospital admission and the initial period of treatment. Interventions to enhance engagement in mental health treatment range from low-intensity interventions, such as appointment reminders, to high-intensity interventions, such as assertive community treatment. Disengagement from treatment may reflect the consumer's perspective that treatment is not necessary, is not meeting their needs, or is not being provided in a collaborative manner. An emerging literature on patient-centered care and shared decision making in psychiatry provides suggestive evidence that efforts to enhance client-centered communication and promote individuals' active involvement in mental health treatment decisions can also improve engagement in treatment.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Schizophrenia bulletin</journal><title>Disengagement from mental health treatment among individuals with schizophrenia and strategies for facilitating connections to care: a review of the literature.</title><abstract>Disengagement from mental health services can lead to devastating consequences for individuals with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses who require ongoing treatment.

10,27638306,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Possible role of mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease.,"Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder that affects the striatum and cortex of patients. HD patients develop progressive motor dysfunction and psychiatric disturbances with gradual dementia. HD is caused by a pathological expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene that codifies for a protein called huntingtin (Htt), which principal function is not completely understood. Accumulative evidence shows that this pathological expansion modifies Htt function affecting different neuronal targets, including mitochondrial function which is an important factor that contributes to HD. Interestingly, several groups have shown mitochondrial disturbances including calcium handling defects, depolarization, decrease of mitochondrial transport, ATP reduction, and increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cellular and murine HD models. Systematic analysis of this evidence indicates that a mitochondrial structure, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), could be responsible for these changes that affect mitochondria. The mPTP plays an important role in apoptosis and neurodegeneration. It has also been reported to have some physiological functions in heart development and synaptic communication. In HD, the presence of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) activates this mechanism producing a significant compromise of mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetics. Considering these findings this review explores the evidence that suggests the important role of mPTP in the mitochondrial impairment induced by mHtt, which leads to calcium derangement and contributes to neuronal dysfunction in HD.",Calcium| Huntington disease| Mitochondria| Mitochondrial permeability pore| Oxidative stress,Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</journal><title>Possible role of mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease.</title><abstract>Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder that affects the striatum and cortex of patients.

12,29063964,Psychopharmacology,Phytocannabinoids modulate emotional memory processing through interactions with the ventral hippocampus and mesolimbic dopamine system: implications for neuropsychiatric pathology.,"Growing clinical and preclinical evidence suggests a potential role for the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) as a pharmacotherapy for various neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, is associated with acute and neurodevelopmental propsychotic side effects through its interaction with central cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs). CB1R stimulation in the ventral hippocampus (VHipp) potentiates affective memory formation through inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, thereby altering emotional salience attribution. These changes in DA activity and salience attribution, evoked by dysfunctional VHipp regulatory actions and THC exposure, could predispose susceptible individuals to psychotic symptoms. Although THC can accelerate the onset of schizophrenia, CBD displays antipsychotic properties, can prevent the acquisition of emotionally irrelevant memories, and reverses amphetamine-induced neuronal sensitization through selective phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) molecular signaling pathway. This review summarizes clinical and preclinical evidence demonstrating that distinct phytocannabinoids act within the VHipp and associated corticolimbic structures to modulate emotional memory processing through changes in mesolimbic DA activity states, salience attribution, and signal transduction pathways associated with schizophrenia-related pathology.",Cannabidiol| Dopamine| Emotional salience| Endocannabinoid| Memory| Psychosis| Rapamycin| Schizophrenia| THC,Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Psychopharmacology</journal><title>Phytocannabinoids modulate emotional memory processing through interactions with the ventral hippocampus and mesolimbic dopamine system: implications for neuropsychiatric pathology.</title><abstract>Growing clinical and preclinical evidence suggests a potential role for the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) as a pharmacotherapy for various neuropsychiatric disorders.

Despite an established role in prevention of thromboembolic events such as stroke, warfarin continues to be underutilized because of its association with serious drug-related adverse events. Lacking alternative therapeutic approaches, intensive research in the past decade has focused on making anticoagulation with warfarin safer. Much emphasis has been placed on defining factors associated with the wide individual variability in warfarin dose. Polymorphic sites in three genes, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, vitamin K 2,3 epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1), and CYP4F2, have been shown to affect stable warfarin dose.

22,32147509,Neuroscience,"Neurobiological Mechanisms of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Epilepsy, Insights from Animal Models","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and epilepsy are two neurodevelopmental disorders that have a high comorbidity rate, suggesting that a common neurodevelopmental mechanism exists. However, to date there is no conclusive way to predict whether a child will develop either syndrome or both and to what degree associated phenotypes will be affected. Failure to consistently identify predictive patterns of ASD and/or epilepsy diagnosis stems from the fact that they are etiologically heterogeneous conditions and research into their neuropathological mechanisms becomes challenging. Whole genome/exome sequencing has advanced our understanding of the genetic causes of ASD and epilepsy to an extent that currently about half of all ASD as well as epilepsy cases are known to have a genetic basis. In fact, a picture is emerging of both conditions as a collection of distinct genetically defined disorders, although the role of environmental factors has also been established. A plethora of animal models, most of them based on identified human genetic mutations and a few on known environmental causes, have been developed. Animal models provide a major experimental avenue for studying the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of human disorders. They also provide invaluable preclinical tools that can be used to test therapeutic approaches. In this review, we first summarize the methods for validating mouse models of ASD and epilepsy.

33,25351111,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Prevention of Alzheimer's disease: a global challenge for next generation neuroscientists.,"The incidence of dementia is rapidly increasing in developed countries due to social and demographic changes. This trend is expected to worsen in the coming decades, with the number of cases possibly even tripling in the next 25 years. Therefore Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention is becoming a global health priority. Our knowledge of the pathophysiological process leading to the development of pathological brain lesions that characterize AD has increased exponentially in recent years. However, the phenotypic expression of AD not only depends on the development of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but other factors also play a role. Thus, over the last few decades, epidemiological studies have revealed several risk factors for developing AD, such as vascular or lifestyle related factors. Having the current knowledge on AD, two different strategies have been developed for the prevention of AD: one is based on primary prevention by acting on modifiable risk factors, the other is a pathophysiology-driven approach aimed to identify individuals in a preclinical stage of the disease and treating them with drugs purporting to act on molecular targets of the amyloid cascade. Several promising trials with these approaches are currently ongoing and results are expected in the next few years. The intrinsic limitations in the design of preventive trials should be overcome through a global effort involving healthy population, healthcare professionals, governments, industry, and scientific institutions. This exertion will be more than compensated if we can make AD a preventable disease.",Alzheimer's disease| anti-amyloid therapy| multidomain approach| preclinical Alzheimer's disease| preventive clinical trials| primary prevention| secondary prevention| vascular risk factors,Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD</journal><title>Prevention of Alzheimer's disease: a global challenge for next generation neuroscientists.</title><abstract>The incidence of dementia is rapidly increasing in developed countries due to social and demographic changes.

35,2744979,The International journal of social psychiatry,A normality for us without confinement for them: notes on the associations of families of the mentally ill.,"Associations of families of the mentally ill arose in Italy in the early 1980s mainly in the country's northern and central regions. They denounced the inadequacies of an extramural service conceived of as an out-patient clinic filling the void left by the shutting down of asylums. The positions elaborated by these associations focus on four main themes: the distribution of the 'burden of care' for the ill between services and families; the ill-conceived interpretation of the families' needs owing to the professional's alleged tendency to 'point the finger of guilt' at the families themselves; the demand for greater power in regard to decisions made by the services; the interaction with the rights and liberties of the mentally ill. Two different ranges of problems are discussed. First, there is the conflict within the family between the interests and rights of its income-producing and its 'dependent' members. This conflict points not to a loss but to an overload of functions shifted to the family at a time of rising expectations for the satisfaction of needs. It therefore calls for services of a new kind, i.e. services capable of making these conflicting interests and rights compatible. Second, extramural services either reject or misinterpret the asylum's labour-saving function. These services thus ascribe care for the material life of the mentally ill to the family's own resources alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>The International journal of social psychiatry</journal><title>A normality for us without confinement for them: notes on the associations of families of the mentally ill.</title><abstract>Associations of families of the mentally ill arose in Italy in the early 1980s mainly in the country's northern and central regions.

Moreover, approximately 23 percent of Americans over age 85 reside in long-term care facilities, and institutionalization is an important risk factor for disordered sleep and for sedative hypnotic prescription.

38,3489155,Medicine,Renal disease from habitual antipyretic analgesic consumption: an assessment of the epidemiologic evidence.,"The quantitative evidence relating habitual antipyretic analgesic consumption to the development of renal disease is reviewed. For purposes of analysis, 'abuse' of analgesics is defined as regular, usually daily consumption. The prevalence of habitual consumption demonstrates marked geographic variation for poorly defined reasons. Prevalence tended to be highest in those populations in which phenacetin was available and popular. The prevalence of nephropathy among habitual consumers also shows marked interpopulation variability. A highly significant linear relationship exists between the prevalence of habitual analgesic consumption in a given population and the prevalence of nephropathy in the subset of that population that habitually consumes analgesics. This relationship may represent a dose-response curve relating amount of analgesic intake to prevalence of nephropathy. Four cross-sectional studies, 1 longitudinal, and 1 case-control study have shown significant differences in prevalence of nephropathy between habitual users of phenacetin-containing analgesics and control populations. Conversely, 2 cross-sectional studies and 1 case control study showed no difference between habitual users of analgesics and control populations. However, those studies showing no difference were performed in populations with low prevalence of habitual consumption of compound analgesics and a lower prevalence of nephropathy than was found in those populations where differences were observed. The relative risk for developing various manifestations of analgesic nephropathy has been estimated in 4 studies and varies depending on which abnormality is considered. Data are available only for subjects consuming phenacetin-containing compound analgesics. The relative risk for elevated serum creatinine is in the range of 8 to 11, about twice that for an abnormal renal concentrating test (approximately 4). The relative risk for clinical papillary necrosis is approximately 18, and for cause-specific death (and by inference for end-stage renal disease) about 4. The difference in risk between most clinical manifestations of analgesic nephropathy and death (or end-stage renal disease) may be due to the fact that most patients with nephropathy do not progress to terminal renal failure. Rheumatology clinic studies indicate that the prevalence of nephropathy in habitual consumers of phenacetin-containing compounds is higher than that for habitual consumers of aspirin alone. Removal of phenacetin from compound analgesics in Scandinavian countries appears to have reduced the prevalence of papillary necrosis and death from interstitial nephritis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Medicine</journal><title>Renal disease from habitual antipyretic analgesic consumption: an assessment of the epidemiologic evidence.</title><abstract>The quantitative evidence relating habitual antipyretic analgesic consumption to the development of renal disease is reviewed.

This drug is currently mainly administered by monthly depot preparations of octreotide and lanreotide. With the innovative transient permeability enhancer, a technology enabling the absorption of drug molecules via transient opening of the tight junctions of the gut epithelium, it is possible to achieve therapeutic octreotide levels after oral ingestion. The present review summarized the preclinical work and the recently reported phase I and III study on oral octreotide capsules in patients with acromegaly. Maintenance of control in 155 participating patients was achieved in 65% at the end of core period. Once controlled on oral octreotide, the response was maintained to the end of the extension phase in 85%. Side effects were comparable to currently available preparations. There was a profound suppression of growth hormone levels, and significant symptom reduction. Currently available parental somatostatin analogs are generally well tolerated and are able to achieve longstanding biochemical control in patients with somatostatin sensitive tumors. Potential advantages of an oral alternative is the lack injection-related side effects, but there will be an ongoing need for a very strict compliance with the 2 daily dose regimen and fasting around drug administrations.

Le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques,Helping Families Cope with the Severe Stress of Dravet Syndrome.,"A child with Dravet syndrome shakes family life to the core. Dravet syndrome usually has three phases: (1) up to 1-1½ years: with episodes of febrile status epilepticus but normal development; (2) age 1½ to ~6-10 years: with frequent seizures of varying types, developmental stagnation, behavioural and sleep problems; (3) after ~10 years: improvement in seizures, deteriorating gait, intellectual disability but some developmental gains. Complete seizure control is rare-simply prescribing medication is inadequate to help families. Based on structured interviews with 24 families and confirmed by more informal discussions with other families, we suggest strategies for coping with this catastrophe. A child with Dravet syndrome usually means that one parent cannot work-financial pressures should be anticipated. In Stage 1, the approach to status should include a written protocol. An indwelling catheter for rapid venous access may be helpful. In Stage 2, assistance finding qualified babysitters is required, and the extended family needs encouragement to help. Appropriate equipment, rescue medication and protocols should travel with the child. Siblings may benefit from a system of one parent 'on call.' An internet support group provides an invaluable lifeline. In Stage 3, family isolation may be extreme-respite care and personal time for parents are important. Death from status, accidents and SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) occurs in 15%. Fear of SUDEP needs to be addressed.

Prospective longitudinal designs were mostly undertaken in MDD studies. Diagnostic interview schedules were utilized in most MDD studies whereas self-report inventories that tend to confound somatic and depressive symptoms were mostly used in CP, SCI, TBI and MI/CABG studies. In longitudinal MDD studies both depression and occupational disability were related to access to enhanced primary care treatment. On the other hand, CP research reported different results concerning the strength of depressive symptoms, cognitive and psychosocial factors in predicting occupational disability. Different trends across diagnostic groups were evident in relation to depression, occupational disability, co-morbidity, socio-demographic factors and psychosocial resources.

Uncertainties remain whether there is a single underlying mechanism for visual hallucinations or they have different disease-dependent causes. However, irrespective of mechanism, visual hallucinations are difficult to treat. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded a research programme to investigate visual hallucinations in the key and high burden areas of eye disease, dementia and Parkinson's disease, culminating in a workshop to develop a unified framework for their clinical management. Here we summarise the evidence base, current practice and consensus guidelines that emerged from the workshop.Irrespective of clinical condition, case ascertainment strategies are required to overcome reporting stigma. Once hallucinations are identified, physical, cognitive and ophthalmological health should be reviewed, with education and self-help techniques provided. Not all hallucinations require intervention but for those that are clinically significant, current evidence supports pharmacological modification of cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic systems, or reduction of cortical excitability. A broad treatment perspective is needed, including carer support. Despite their frequency and clinical significance, there is a paucity of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial evidence where the primary outcome is an improvement in visual hallucinations.

52,21303234,Substance use & misuse,Access to sterile syringes for injecting drug users in New York City: politics and perception (1984-2010).,"In the United States, political and social environments have shaped public health response to injecting drug use, and New York City represents a salient example. The history of 'harm reduction' in New York City is characterized within changing historical periods and in relation to the actions of stakeholders. The expansion is traced over four periods: (i) 1984-1989: emergence, activism, and science; (ii) 1990-1994 reckoning: syringe exchange legislation and consolidation; (iii) 1995-1999: bureaucratization, opposition, and challenges to institutional control; and (iv) 2000-2010 revitalization: expansion of syringe access and harm reduction.

57,23095594,L'Encephale,"[Acute catatonia: Questions, diagnosis and prognostics, and the place of atypical antipsychotics].","Acute catatonia is a non-specific, relatively frequent syndrome, which manifests itself through characteristic motor signs that enables its diagnosis. It occurs in association with mood disorders, psychotic disorders and several somatic or toxic diseases. Its short-term prognosis is of paramount importance. Without effective treatment, it is associated with high mortality. Despite the vital risk inherent in this disorder, it is not recognized as an independent diagnostic category by international rankings, which makes its diagnostic detection difficult and consequently does not allow adequate therapeutic care. However, if benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy have proved effective in the treatment of acute catatonia, the role of atypical antipsychotics remains controversial. In fact, despite the progress made by the DSM-IV-TR and CIM 10 by the recognition of the etiologic diversity of catatonia, we deplore the absence to date of a consensus on clinical management and therapy of catatonia, which constitutes a source of confusion for practitioners in their approach to catatonic patients. To illustrate the difficulty in supporting these patients, we report here a clinical vignette.	Mr. M. aged 21, without psychiatric history, has shown a functional acute psychotic episode involving a delirious and hallucinatory syndrome associated with a marked catatonic dimension. Olanzapine was initiated at a dose of 10mg/d on the nineth day of hospitalization; the clinical picture was complicated by a malignant catatonia justifying the halt of olanzapine and the institution, in intensive units, of 15mg per day of lorazepam. After 72hours, the patient has not responded to this treatment. ECT was expected, but the patient died on the 12th day.	This case raises a threefold question: the crucial issue of immediate vital prognosis, that of the truthfulness of the positive diagnosis of this psychotic table and finally the issue of therapeutic care, primarily the well-founded or otherwise use of an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of this type of psychotic disorder. For Mr. M., the clinical diagnosis that he has shown, according to the DSM IV-TR, is brief psychotic disorder 'temporary diagnosis'. This diagnosis - brief psychotic disorder - does not actually allow for a specific clinical approach to this type of psychotic table. The immediate vital prognosis inherent in the catatonic dimension may not be properly evaluated and the therapeutic conduct may miss the application of the specific treatment of the catatonic syndrome. The proper diagnosis for this type of psychotic disorder would be 'catatonia' as proposed by Taylor and Fink, instead of 'brief psychotic disorder' if the international rankings have included this disorder as a separate and independent diagnosis. The identification by international rankings of the catatonic syndrome as an independent diagnostic category seems essential for clinicians to allow: its clinical detection, the establishment of a syndromic diagnosis of catatonic disorder, appropriate prognostic evaluation and finally, the application of a suitable therapeutic strategy. Conventional treatment, benzodiazepine- and/or ECT-based, can solve the catatonic episode in a few days, irrespective of its etiology and its severity. Moreover, while all authors agree that conventional antipsychotics may induce a catatonic state or worsen a preexisting catatonia into a malignant catatonia and should thus be avoided for catatonic patients or with prior catatonic episodes, recent data from the literature emphasize the frequent and successful use of atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, in various clinical forms of benign catatonia. However, our patient did not respond to treatment with olanzapine and got even more complicated. Was the malignant catatonia that this patient has shown induced by olanzapine ? The answer to this question seems difficult since some authors report the efficacy of olanzapine in malignant catatonia. We wonder if we should have kept olanzapine and strengthen its dosage like Cassidy et al. in 2001 and Suzuki et al. in 2010 for the treatment of the malignant form constituted in this patient rather than having stopped it and used lorazepam as indicated by Taylor and Fink in 2003.

60,29450726,Cell and tissue research,C9orf72-associated neurodegeneration in ALS-FTD: breaking new ground in ribosomal RNA and nucleolar dysfunction.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) are neurodegenerative diseases with distinct clinical appearance. However, both share as major genetic risk factor a C9orf72 locus intronic hexanucleotide expansion. The pathogenic pathways associated with the expansion-dependent neuronal toxicity are still poorly understood. Recent efforts to identify common threads of neuronal dysfunction have pointed towards deficits of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis and loss of nucleolar integrity, a condition known as nucleolar stress that is an emerging shared feature among neurodegenerative diseases. Intriguingly, the C9orf72 mutation in ALS-FTD interferes with the function of the nucleolus by transcripts and dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced by the hexanucleotide expansion. Experimental discrepancies have given rise to different hypotheses with regard to the connection of C9orf72 and nucleolar activity. In this review, we present and discuss emerging concepts concerning the impact of C9orf72 expansion on nucleolar biology. Moreover, we discuss the 'nucleolar stress hypothesis,' according to which nucleolar malfunction accompanies, exacerbates, or potentially triggers a degenerative phenotype. Upcoming awareness of the involvement of nucleolar stress in C9orf72 ALS-FTD could shed light into its pathogenesis, enabling potential treatment options aimed at shielding an 'Achilles' heel' of neurons.",Dipeptide repeats| Neurodegeneration| Nucleolus| Stress response| rRNA,Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Cell and tissue research</journal><title>C9orf72-associated neurodegeneration in ALS-FTD: breaking new ground in ribosomal RNA and nucleolar dysfunction.</title><abstract>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) are neurodegenerative diseases with distinct clinical appearance.

Beyond geneticfactors, puberty is associated with a significant delay in the circadian phase of sleep, responsible for increasing dificulties with sleep onset at night and thus with awakening in the morning. The prevalence of Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) is high in the adolescent population, affecting up to 16 % of teenagers. As sleep needs remain remarkably stable, adolescent sleep phase delay causes chronic sleep depriva- tion and subsequently daytime fatigue or even excessive daytime sleepiness, and also metabolic disturbances, neurocognitive problems associated with decreased school perfor- mance, as well as mood disorders. Whereas genetic and biological factors have been investigated by a number of studies, research on social, cognitive-behavioural or psychological factors is still limited to date. Among the latte; the technological revolution of the past decades, most importantly exposure to screens- has significantly modied adolescent behavior.

65,23265360,Medical hypotheses,Angiotensin receptor blockers for bipolar disorder.,"Studies have suggested that the brain renin angiotensin system (RAS) regulates cerebral flow, autonomic and hormonal systems, stress, innate immune response and behavior, being implicated in several brain disorders such as major depression, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R) is distributed in brain regions responsible for the control of stress response through peripheral and central sympathetic hyperactivation as well as in the hypothalamic paraventricular region, areas known for the release of several neurotransmitters related to inflammatory response facilitation. This relationship leads to the assumption that AT1R might be the receptor most related to the central deleterious actions of angiotensin II. New evidences from clinical studies have shown a possible role for RAS in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BD), a multifactorial disorder with acknowledged presence of neuronal damage via oxidative stress in brain areas such as hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum.

66,27040285,Acta neuropathologica,Risk stratification of childhood medulloblastoma in the molecular era: the current consensus.,"Historical risk stratification criteria for medulloblastoma rely primarily on clinicopathological variables pertaining to age, presence of metastases, extent of resection, histological subtypes and in some instances individual genetic aberrations such as MYC and MYCN amplification. In 2010, an international panel of experts established consensus defining four main subgroups of medulloblastoma (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4) delineated by transcriptional profiling. This has led to the current generation of biomarker-driven clinical trials assigning WNT tumors to a favorable prognosis group in addition to clinicopathological criteria including MYC and MYCN gene amplifications. However, outcome prediction of non-WNT subgroups is a challenge due to inconsistent survival reports. In 2015, a consensus conference was convened in Heidelberg with the objective to further refine the risk stratification in the context of subgroups and agree on a definition of risk groups of non-infant, childhood medulloblastoma (ages 3-17). Published and unpublished data over the past 5 years were reviewed, and a consensus was reached regarding the level of evidence for currently available biomarkers. The following risk groups were defined based on current survival rates: low risk (>90 % survival), average (standard) risk (75-90 % survival), high risk (50-75 % survival) and very high risk (<50 % survival) disease. The WNT subgroup and non-metastatic Group 4 tumors with whole chromosome 11 loss or whole chromosome 17 gain were recognized as low-risk tumors that may qualify for reduced therapy. High-risk strata were defined as patients with metastatic SHH or Group 4 tumors, or MYCN-amplified SHH medulloblastomas. Very high-risk patients are Group 3 with metastases or SHH with TP53 mutation. In addition, a number of consensus points were reached that should be standardized across future clinical trials. Although we anticipate new data will emerge from currently ongoing and recently completed clinical trials, this consensus can serve as an outline for prioritization of certain molecular subsets of tumors to define and validate risk groups as a basis for future clinical trials.",Genomics| Group 3| Group 4| Medulloblastoma| Outcomes| SHH| Subgroups| WNT| p53,Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Acta neuropathologica</journal><title>Risk stratification of childhood medulloblastoma in the molecular era: the current consensus.</title><abstract>Historical risk stratification criteria for medulloblastoma rely primarily on clinicopathological variables pertaining to age, presence of metastases, extent of resection, histological subtypes and in some instances individual genetic aberrations such as MYC and MYCN amplification.

70,21885540,Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,Is it safe to stop anticoagulants after successful surgery for atrial fibrillation?,"A best evidence topic in cardiothoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was: is it safe to stop anticoagulants after successful surgery for atrial fibrillation? Altogether, 177 papers were found using the reported search, of which 14 were selected that represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. Selection criteria included study relevance, primary outcome, size of study population and length of follow-up. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The weight of evidence, including over 10,000 patient-years of follow-up, supports the discontinuation of warfarin following atrial fibrillation correction procedures as being safe, with an associated annual thromboembolic stroke rate of 0-3.8% off warfarin, in studies where warfarin was stopped at a mean of 3.6 months (range 0-8 months) after the procedure. However, the confidence of this conclusion suffers from a paucity of high-quality randomized controlled trials in the field, with the main body of evidence coming instead from observational non-randomized studies. The stroke rate also varies with the exact procedure performed; pulmonary vein isolation procedures are the most extensively evaluated and carry the lowest stroke rate following warfarin discontinuation (0-0.4% per annum when performed as an isolated procedure). By contrast, left atrial appendage occlusion by insertion of a transcatheter device has an associated annual stroke rate of 0-3.8% off warfarin. Thus, discontinuation of warfarin following such transcatheter procedures cannot be recommended at this time. Concomitant heart surgeries, such as mitral valve repair have been shown to increase the thromboembolic rate both unpredictably and dramatically, and this review thus identifies concomitant mitral valve surgery as a potentially substantial risk factor for late thromboembolic stroke in patients undergoing corrective surgeries for atrial fibrillation. This review finds in favour of warfarin discontinuation in selected patients at three months post-procedure, emphasizing consideration of the patient's individual risk-factor profile as paramount. This recommendation is in line with the 2010 guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation produced by the European Society of Cardiology.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0,"<journal>Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery</journal><title>Is it safe to stop anticoagulants after successful surgery for atrial fibrillation?</title><abstract>A best evidence topic in cardiothoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol.

Psychiatric consultation was associated with a significant increase in the use of antidepressants in intervention patients compared with controls in the first 6 months after intervention.

78,35287133,Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,Four-Week Mentalizing Imagery Therapy for Family Dementia Caregivers: A Randomized Controlled Trial with Neural Circuit Changes,"INTRODUCTION: Family caregivers of patients with dementia suffer a high burden of depression and reduced positive emotions. Mentalizing imagery therapy (MIT) provides mindfulness and guided imagery skills training to improve balanced mentalizing and emotion regulation. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to test the hypotheses that MIT for family caregivers would reduce depression symptoms and improve positive psychological traits more than a support group (SG), and would increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity and reduce subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) connectivity. METHODS: Forty-six caregivers participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing a 4-week MIT group (n = 24) versus an SG (n = 22). Resting state neuroimaging was obtained at baseline and post-group in 28 caregivers, and questionnaires completed by all participants. The primary outcome was change in depression; secondary measures included anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. Brain networks with participation of DLPFC and sgACC were identified. Connectivity strengths of DLPFC and sgACC with respective networks were determined with dual regression. DLPFC connectivity was correlated with mindfulness and depression outcomes. RESULTS: MIT significantly outperformed SG in improving depression, anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being, with moderate to large effect sizes. Relative to SG, participants in MIT showed significant increases in DLPFC connectivity - exactly replicating pilot study results - but no change in sgACC. DLPFC connectivity change correlated positively with mindfulness and negatively with depression change. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, MIT was superior to SG for reducing depression and anxiety symptoms and improving positive psychological traits.

A shared deficient serotonergic transmission was postulated for both syndromes. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was argued to regulate eating behaviour and to be dysfunctional in eating disorders. METHODS: Fourteen women meeting DSM-IV criteria for BN were included in a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial. In order to exclude patients highly responsive to placebo, all patients were first submitted to a one-week sham treatment. Randomisation was followed by 3 weeks of active treatment or sham stimulation. As the main outcome criterion we defined the change in binges and purges. Secondary outcome variables were the decrease of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) over time. RESULTS: The average number of binges per day declined significantly between baseline and the end of treatment in the two groups. There was no significant difference between sham and active stimulation in terms of purge behaviour, BDI, HDRS and YBOCS over time.

82,36508394,The Gerontologist,A Randomized Control Trial for ReDeSign: A Dementia-Friendly Mobile Microlearning Training for Store Workers in Japan,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dementia-friendly training should be incorporated in neighborhood stores for people living with dementia to maintain engagement in social activities. However, there is a lack of evidence of dementia-friendly training in these workplaces, and existing trainings have time constraints. We developed a mobile microlearning program based on stigma theory and the bystander intervention model. This study aimed to evaluate the microlearning program's effectiveness. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Convenience store workers in Tokyo were recruited for a randomized, waiting-list, and controlled trial. The intervention group completed a 50-min online course. The primary outcome was an attitude toward people living with dementia. The secondary outcomes were knowledge of dementia and helping behavior toward customers suspected of having dementia. Data were collected at baseline, after 1 month, and 4 months following the randomization. RESULTS: Process evaluations confirmed satisfaction and high completion rates of the program. In total, 150 participants were included in the analysis. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in attitude (Hedge's g = 0.70) and knowledge (g = 0.59) after 1 month, compared to the control group. Helping behavior increased in the intervention group, although it did not differ significantly between the groups. All outcomes remained significantly improved after 4 months. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings provide evidence that dementia-friendly training reduces the general public's stigma and increases helping behavior in stores.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of RIC when initiated in the prehospital setting and continued in the hospital on functional outcome in patients with acute stroke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 stroke centers in Denmark that included 1500 patients with prehospital stroke symptoms for less than 4 hours (enrolled March 16, 2018, to November 11, 2022; final follow-up, February 3, 2023). INTERVENTION: The intervention was delivered using an inflatable cuff on 1 upper extremity (RIC cuff pressure, ≤200 mm Hg [n = 749] and sham cuff pressure, 20 mm Hg [n = 751]). Each treatment application consisted of 5 cycles of 5 minutes of cuff inflation followed by 5 minutes of cuff deflation. Treatment was started in the ambulance and repeated at least once in the hospital and then twice daily for 7 days among a subset of participants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was improvement in functional outcome measured as a shift across the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days in the target population with a final diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. RESULTS: Among 1500 patients who were randomized (median age, 71 years; 591 women [41%]), 1433 (96%) completed the trial. Of these, 149 patients (10%) were diagnosed with transient ischemic attack and 382 (27%) with a stroke mimic. In the remaining 902 patients with a target diagnosis of stroke (737 [82%] with ischemic stroke and 165 [18%] with intracerebral hemorrhage), 436 underwent RIC and 466 sham treatment. The median mRS score at 90 days was 2 (IQR, 1-3) in the RIC group and 1 (IQR, 1-3) in the sham group. RIC treatment was not significantly associated with improved functional outcome at 90 days (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.20, P = .67; absolute difference in median mRS score, -1; -1.7 to -0.25). In all randomized patients, there were no significant differences in the number of serious adverse events: 169 patients (23.7%) in the RIC group with 1 or more serious adverse events vs 175 patients (24.3%) in the sham group (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.11; P = .68). Upper extremity pain during treatment and/or skin petechia occurred in 54 (7.2%) in the RIC group and 11 (1.5%) in the sham group.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of RIC when initiated in the prehospital setting and continued in the hospital on functional outcome in patients with acute stroke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 stroke centers in Denmark that included 1500 patients with prehospital stroke symptoms for less than 4 hours (enrolled March 16, 2018, to November 11, 2022; final follow-up, February 3, 2023). INTERVENTION: The intervention was delivered using an inflatable cuff on 1 upper extremity (RIC cuff pressure, ≤200 mm Hg [n = 749] and sham cuff pressure, 20 mm Hg [n = 751]). Each treatment application consisted of 5 cycles of 5 minutes of cuff inflation followed by 5 minutes of cuff deflation. Treatment was started in the ambulance and repeated at least once in the hospital and then twice daily for 7 days among a subset of participants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was improvement in functional outcome measured as a shift across the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days in the target population with a final diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. RESULTS: Among 1500 patients who were randomized (median age, 71 years; 591 women [41%]), 1433 (96%) completed the trial. Of these, 149 patients (10%) were diagnosed with transient ischemic attack and 382 (27%) with a stroke mimic. In the remaining 902 patients with a target diagnosis of stroke (737 [82%] with ischemic stroke and 165 [18%] with intracerebral hemorrhage), 436 underwent RIC and 466 sham treatment. The median mRS score at 90 days was 2 (IQR, 1-3) in the RIC group and 1 (IQR, 1-3) in the sham group. RIC treatment was not significantly associated with improved functional outcome at 90 days (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.20, P = .67; absolute difference in median mRS score, -1; -1.7 to -0.25). In all randomized patients, there were no significant differences in the number of serious adverse events: 169 patients (23.7%) in the RIC group with 1 or more serious adverse events vs 175 patients (24.3%) in the sham group (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.11; P = .68). Upper extremity pain during treatment and/or skin petechia occurred in 54 (7.2%) in the RIC group and 11 (1.5%) in the sham group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: RIC initiated in the prehospital setting and continued in the hospital did not significantly improve functional outcome at 90 days in patients with acute stroke.

In a trial published in 2000, we showed that non-directive counselling and CBT were equally effective in general practice for patients with depression and mixed anxiety and depression. Our results were criticized for including patients not meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. In this reanalysis we aimed to compare the effectiveness of the two therapies for patients with an ICD-10 depressive episode. METHOD: Patients with an ICD-10 depressive episode or mixed anxiety and depression were randomized to counselling, CBT or usual general practitioner (GP) care. Counsellors provided nondirective, interpersonal counselling following a manual that we developed based on the work of Carl Rogers. Cognitive behaviour therapists provided CBT also guided by a manual. Modelling was carried out using generalized estimating equations with the multiply imputed datasets. Outcomes were mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, Brief Symptom Inventory, and Social Adjustment Scale at 4 and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 134 participants were randomized to CBT, 126 to counselling and 67 to usual GP care.

The aim of this study is to identify in a secondary analysis the prognostic factors of success of the support program by comparing characteristics of patients and primary caregivers for whom the support program was effective with those for whom the program was not effective (n = 49 pairs of patients and caregivers). The theoretically based individualized support program which is presented in this article, was most effective with regard to primary caregivers' sense of competence for females sharing a household with the dementia patient. The program was most effective in reducing the number of patient admissions when patients did not receive support from a district nurse and the primary caregivers experienced less emotional support from the informal network. A proactive approach by offering this flexible support before caregivers ask for support may prolong the stage in which they feel able to care for patients at home.

94,1359657,Surgical neurology,Spinal epidural abscess: a report of 40 cases and review.,"Despite modern medical advances, the morbidity and mortality rates associated with spinal epidural abscess remain significant, and the diagnosis often is elusive. A retrospective study was undertaken to define better the incidence and clinical features of this infection, and to establish current diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. Forty cases of spinal epidural abscess were encountered at our institution between July 1979 and March 1991. All medical records and radiological images were reviewed. We report a significant increase in the incidence of epidural abscess after June 1988 (p = 0.0195). Sixteen patients used drugs intravenously, and six had undergone spinal procedures. Twelve patients were misdiagnosed in various emergency rooms or clinics and discharged. Localized back pain, fever, and neurological deficit remained the typical clinical manifestations. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated uniformly when measured (21 cases). Magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic specifically in 23 of 24 instances. The majority of patients underwent surgical drainage, but five selected patients were managed nonoperatively. The highly variable presentation of spinal epidural abscess may confuse the diagnosis and delay indicated surgical intervention. Localized back pain in a febrile patient at significant risk for epidural abscess warrants erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement. The presence of erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevation or evidence of spinal cord compression on physical examination are indications for immediate magnetic resonance imaging examination with contrast enhancement.

98,34006885,Scientific reports,Predictors for affected stroke territory and outcome of acute stroke treatments are different for posterior versus anterior circulation stroke.,"Distinct patient characteristics have been proposed for ischaemic stroke in the anterior versus posterior circulation. However, data on functional outcome according to stroke territory in patients with acute stroke treatment are conflicting and information on outcome predictors is scarce. In this retrospective study, we analysed functional outcome in 517 patients with stroke and thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy treated at the University Hospital Zurich. We compared clinical factors and performed multivariate logistic regression analyses investigating the effect of outcome predictors according to stroke territory. Of the 517 patients included, 80 (15.5%) suffered a posterior circulation stroke (PCS). PCS patients were less often female (32.5% vs. 45.5%, p = 0.031), received thrombectomy less often (28.7% vs. 48.3%, p = 0.001), and had lower median admission NIHSS scores (5 vs. 10, p < 0.001) as well as a better median three months functional outcome (mRS 1 vs. 2, p = 0.010). Predictors for functional outcome were admission NIHSS (OR 0.864, 95% CI 0.790-0.944, p = 0.001) in PCS and age (OR 0.952, 95% CI 0.935-0.970, p < 0.001), known symptom onset (OR 1.869, 95% CI 1.111-3.144, p = 0.018) and admission NIHSS (OR 0.840, 95% CI 0.806-0.876, p < 0.001) in ACS.

VFC starts in the precapillaries/capillaries in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) and expands to the granule cell and polymorphic cell layer of the DG, and to the stratum lacunosum/molecular in the CA1 sector. Vasculopathy spreads from the tail to the body and, in a few cases, to the head of the hippocampal formation. Light and electron microscopy reveal thickening of the vascular wall with fibrosis, calcification, and enforcement of the astrocyte interface with vessels with anchorage densities associated with hemidesmosome-like structures. In moderately and severely affected cases, fragmentation and removal of calcified and occluded vessels result in local reduction of vascular network. In two AD subjects, severe vascular calcification extending from the tail to the head of the hippocampal formation was associated with loss of almost all neurons in the CA1 sector and in the subiculum proper, corresponding to hippocampal sclerosis. The topography of affected vessels and the patterns of neuronal loss reflect the middle hippocampal artery distribution with its precapillary/capillary network. The similar prevalence of vasculopathy in the AD group and in the age-matched control group, and the presence of hippocampal VFC in only one subject in the DS cohort, 96% of which is affected by Alzheimer-type pathology, oppose the link between AD and this form of vasculopathy. However, severe VFC affects the pattern of AD pathology locally by deletion of neurofibrillary degeneration and beta-amyloidosis in the CA1 sector, subiculum proper, and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal VFC appears to be a form of vascular pathology with a unique predilection for the middle hippocampal artery and corresponding capillary network, which results in patchy neuronal loss in moderately affected subjects and in almost total neuronal loss in the area of impaired blood supply in severely affected subjects.

To further examine the role of OPTN in ALS, we sought to identify novel ALS variants in OPTN and examine their potential for pathogenicity in vitro. Whole exome sequence data from 74 familial ALS cases were analysed for the presence of novel OPTN mutations. Pathogenicity was assessed by analysing effects on Golgi fragmentation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-linked CHOP activation, and cellular localization of optineurin in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells expressing mutant optineurin. We identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation in OPTN (c.883G > T, p.Val295Phe) in a single familial ALS case. This mutation induced recognized cellular features of ALS pathogenesis including Golgi fragmentation and ER stress in NSC-34 cells.

A multicenter, retrospective matched cohort in which PPCS symptoms were evaluated in children 8-15-year-old, 6-60 months after being admitted to the emergency department because of mTBI. The control group included children admitted to the emergency department because of uncomplicated distal radius fractures. The children's guardians were interviewed for the presence of PPCS symptoms using the 'Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire'. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of PPCS. Two-hundred and five children were included in the mTBI group and 205 in the control. The median time from the injury was 33.5 months in the mTBI group and 33.8 in the control. The prevalence of PPCS in the mTBI group was 25.3% and PPCS like symptoms in the control was 2.4%, p < 0.001.

This cross-sectional study included 17,828 construction/civil engineering workers (15,837 males and 1991 females) aged 40 to 74 years in Japan. The questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic characteristics, information on work productivity (work performance and absence), respective insomnia symptoms (difficulty initiating sleep; DIS, difficulty maintaining sleep; DMS, and early morning awakening; EMA), bedtime schedule, work-related factors (job type, working hours), and perceived health condition. To identify the associated factors of work productivity, the logistic regression analyses were conducted.	The percentages of workers who reported to be experiencing DIS, DMS, and EMA were 7.9, 16.3, and 13.1%, respectively. Poor work performance was associated with every insomnia symptom in both the blue-collar and white-collar workers. Meanwhile, absence was associated with DIS in blue-collar workers and both DIS and DMS in white-collar workers; however, not with EMA in both the groups.

Items from the Social Responsiveness Scale and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised were mapped to nine a priori symptom dimensions. Multi-group confirmatory factor models, including measurement equivalence and item response theory analyses, examined whether males and females showed measurement or structural differences in autism symptom constructs. Results indicated mean differences in restricted interests that were not due to measurement bias. No other symptom dimension showed evidence of measurement bias and autism symptom structure was highly similar between males and females.

Narrative interviews were conducted with 10 attendees of a phlebotomy service within an acute Trust in the south-west of England. The participants had hepatitis C infection and poor venous access due to current or former drug use. Interview audiotapes were analyzed, and the themes - conflict, emotional responses, the patient as expert, and offering solutions - were identified. In the context of this study, we discuss the difficulties associated with phlebotomy, which might explain why individuals with hepatitis C infection and venous damage disengage from health services and are less likely to undertake antiviral treatment. This research adds to the literature on phlebotomy for vulnerable groups, and recommends hepatitis C virus clinics within drug agencies, the need to review training and policy, and the development of 'phlebotomy passports' to enable continuity of care between services.",hepatitis C| intravenous drug use| nursing| phlebotomy| qualitative research| stigma,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Nursing & health sciences</journal><title>Experiences of UK patients with hepatitis C virus infection accessing phlebotomy: A qualitative analysis.</title><abstract>This study provides an understanding of the experiences and perceptions of phlebotomy in people with infection who have venous damage related to injecting drug use with the aim of improving their care.

113,8264869,Neuroendocrinology,Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is present in the inferior petrosal sinuses in patients with Cushing's disease.,"Plasma ACTH, beta-endorphin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels were evaluated in the inferior petrosal sinuses and in the periphery of 22 patients affected by Cushing's disease, 11 patients with other pituitary diseases subjected to simultaneous and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling and in the peripheral blood of 15 normal subjects. In patients with Cushing's disease ACTH, beta-endorphin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels in the inferior petrosal sinus ipsilateral to the adenoma were significantly higher than in the periphery and in the contralateral inferior petrosal sinus (p < 0.01, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). In patients with other pituitary diseases only ACTH and beta-endorphin, but not alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels in both inferior petrosal sinuses were significantly higher than in the periphery (p < 0.01). Furthermore, no difference was found in the peripheral blood among patients with Cushing's disease, patients with other pituitary diseases and normal subjects for ACTH and beta-endorphin level. By contrast, in patients with Cushing's disease peripheral alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels were significantly higher than in patients with other pituitary diseases and in normal subjects (p < 0.05).

However, little is known about the incidence and risk factors of IC at stroke onset in LHI. Besides, stroke-related complications and clinical outcomes in relation to the development of IC has not been systematically examined. Data of 256 consecutive patients with LHI were collected. IC at stroke onset was retrospectively collected from the initial emergency department and/or admission records. Of the 256 LHI patients enrolled, 93 (36.3%) had IC at stroke onset. LHI patients with IC at stroke onset were older (median age 66 vs. 61, p = 0.041), had shorter prehospital delay (24 vs. 26 h, p < 0.001and higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (19 vs. 12, p < 0.001). Independent risk factors of IC at stroke onset were high NIHSS score (odds ratio, OR 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.23) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.47). Dyslipidemia appeared to protect against IC at stroke onset (adjusted OR 0.416, 95% CI 0.175 to 0.988).

Abnormalities in stress reactivity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) function may be involved in the mechanistic connection between stress and the initiation, development, and/or maintenance of alcohol dependence. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occurs with alcohol dependence and is characterized by HPA axis abnormalities. This study investigated the relationship between subjective and neuroendocrine stress reactivity to the cold pressor task (CPT) and prospective alcohol use among individuals with alcohol dependence, with and without comorbid PTSD.	Participants were 63 individuals with (a) alcohol dependence only (n=35) or (b) comorbid alcohol dependence and PTSD (n=28). Participants completed the CPT, a widely used physical laboratory stressor. Subjective stress, craving, adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), and cortisol were measured before, immediately after, and at 5, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the CPT. Alcohol use during 1 month following testing was also assessed.	For the alcohol-only group, change in craving immediately following the CPT and craving during the 120-minute recovery phase were predictive of follow-up alcohol use. For the alcohol/PTSD group, change in craving was not predictive of follow-up use. Baseline drinking was, however, predictive of followup alcohol use for the alcohol/PTSD group. For the alcohol-only group, a blunted ACTH response coupled with a higher change in craving following the CPT was associated with significantly greater frequency and intensity of drinking during the follow-up phase.	These preliminary findings demonstrate significant differences between the alcohol-only and the alcohol/PTSD group in predictors of relapse. For the alcohol-only group, reactivity to an acute laboratory stressor may be predictive of subsequent alcohol use. This was not true for the alcohol/PTSD group.

126,27035548,Journal of neurosurgery. Pediatrics,Toward a better understanding of the cellular basis for cerebrospinal fluid shunt obstruction: report on the construction of a bank of explanted hydrocephalus devices.,"OBJECTIVE Shunt obstruction by cells and/or tissue is the most common cause of shunt failure. Ventricular catheter obstruction alone accounts for more than 50% of shunt failures in pediatric patients. The authors sought to systematically collect explanted ventricular catheters from the Seattle Children's Hospital with a focus on elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying obstruction. METHODS In the operating room, explanted hardware was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Weekly, samples were transferred to buffer solution and stored at 4°C. After consent was obtained for their use, catheters were labeled using cell-specific markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1), and choroid plexus (transthyretin) in conjunction with a nuclear stain (Hoechst). Catheters were mounted in custom polycarbonate imaging chambers. Three-dimensional, multispectral, spinning-disk confocal microscopy was used to image catheter cerebrospinal fluid-intake holes (10× objective, 499.2-μm-thick z-stack, 2.4-μm step size, Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with motorized stage and charge-coupled device camera). Values are reported as the mean ± standard error of the mean and were compared using a 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. Significance was defined at p < 0.05. RESULTS Thirty-six ventricular catheters have been imaged to date, resulting in the following observations: 1) Astrocytes and microglia are the dominant cell types bound directly to catheter surfaces; 2) cellular binding to catheters is ubiquitous even if no grossly visible tissue is apparent; and 3) immunohistochemical techniques are of limited utility when a catheter has been exposed to Bugbee wire electrocautery. Statistical analysis of 24 catheters was performed, after excluding 7 catheters exposed to Bugbee wire cautery, 3 that were poorly fixed, and 2 that demonstrated pronounced autofluorescence. This analysis revealed that catheters with a microglia-dominant cellular response tended to be implanted for shorter durations (24.7 ± 6.7 days) than those with an astrocyte-dominant response (1183 ± 642 days; p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Ventricular catheter occlusion remains a significant source of shunt morbidity in the pediatric population, and given their ability to intimately associate with catheter surfaces, astrocytes and microglia appear to be critical to this pathophysiology. Microglia tend to be the dominant cell type on catheters implanted for less than 2 months, while astrocytes tend to be the most prevalent cell type on catheters implanted for longer time courses and are noted to serve as an interface for the secondary attachment of ependymal cells and choroid plexus.",CSF = cerebrospinal fluid| GFAP = glial fibrillary acidic protein| HBHS = HEPES-buffered Hanks solution| HIPAA = Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act| IHC = immunohistochemical| IRB = institutional review board| PDMS = poly(dimethylsiloxane)| PFA = paraformaldehyde| RT = room temperature| SCH = Seattle Children's Hospital| TTR = transthyretin| astrocyte| hydrocephalus| microglia| shunt failure| shunt obstruction| ventriculoperitoneal shunt,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Journal of neurosurgery.

128,29040911,Medical image analysis,A deep learning model integrating FCNNs and CRFs for brain tumor segmentation.,"Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation is a critical component in cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and treatment outcome evaluation. Build upon successful deep learning techniques, a novel brain tumor segmentation method is developed by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in a unified framework to obtain segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency. We train a deep learning based segmentation model using 2D image patches and image slices in following steps: 1) training FCNNs using image patches; 2) training CRFs as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) using image slices with parameters of FCNNs fixed; and 3) fine-tuning the FCNNs and the CRF-RNN using image slices. Particularly, we train 3 segmentation models using 2D image patches and slices obtained in axial, coronal and sagittal views respectively, and combine them to segment brain tumors using a voting based fusion strategy. Our method could segment brain images slice-by-slice, much faster than those based on image patches. We have evaluated our method based on imaging data provided by the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) 2013, BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016.

129,15221931,The Journal of pathology,Prevalence of lymphoreticular prion protein accumulation in UK tissue samples.,"This study aims to provide an estimate of the number of individuals in the UK who may be incubating variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and at risk of causing iatrogenic spread of the disease. Lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein is a consistent feature of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob at autopsy and has also been demonstrated in the pre-clinical phase. Immunohistochemical accumulation of prion protein in the lymphoreticular system remains the only technique that has been shown to predict neurological disease reliably in animal prion disorders. In this study, immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate the presence of prion protein, with monoclonal antibodies KG9 and 3F4, in surgically removed tonsillectomy and appendicectomy specimens. The samples were collected from histopathology departments across the UK and anonymised prior to testing. Samples were tested from 16 703 patients (14 964 appendectomies, 1739 tonsillectomies), approximately 60% of whom were from the age group 20-29 years at operation. Twenty-five per cent of the samples were excluded from the final analyses because they contained inadequate amounts of lymphoid tissue. Three appendicectomy samples showed lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein, giving an estimated prevalence of 3/12 674 or 237 per million (95% CI 49-692 per million). The pattern of lymphoreticular accumulation in two of these samples was dissimilar from that seen in known cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Although it is uncertain whether immunohistochemical accumulation of prion protein in the lymphoreticular system is specific for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, it has not been described in any other disease, including other forms of human prion disease or a range of inflammatory and infective conditions. These findings reinforce the importance of measures taken by the UK Department of Health to reduce the risk of spread of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob via blood products and surgical instruments, and of the urgency to proceed with large-scale screening of fresh tonsil specimens for the presence of prion protein.",,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>The Journal of pathology</journal><title>Prevalence of lymphoreticular prion protein accumulation in UK tissue samples.</title><abstract>This study aims to provide an estimate of the number of individuals in the UK who may be incubating variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and at risk of causing iatrogenic spread of the disease.

130,30468246,Headache,Clinical Features Contributing to Cortical Thickness Changes in Chronic Migraine - A Pilot Study.,"The objectives of this cross-sectional pilot study were threefold: to identify regions of cortical thickness that differentiate chronic migraine (CM) from controls, to assess group differences in interregional cortical thickness covariance, and to determine group differences in associations between clinical variables and cortical thickness.	Cortical thickness alterations in relation to clinical features have not been adequately explored in CM. Assessment of this relationship can be useful to describe cortical substrates for disease progression in migraine and to identify clinical variables that warrant management emphasis.	Thirty CM cases (mean age 40 years; male-to-female 1:4) and 30 sex-matched healthy controls (mean age 40 years) were enrolled. Participants completed self-administered and standardized questionnaires assessing headache-related clinical features and common psychological comorbidities. T1-weighted brain images were acquired on a 3T MRI. A whole-brain cortical thickness analysis was performed. Additionally, correlations between all brain regions were assessed to examine interregional cortical thickness covariance. Interactions were analyzed to identify clinical variables that were significantly associated with cortical thickness.	The whole brain cortical thickness analysis revealed no significant differences between CM patients and controls. However, significant associations between clinical features and cortical thickness were observed for the patients only. These associations included the right superior temporal sulcus (R[2]  = 0.72, P = .001) and the right insula (R[2]  = 0.71, P = .002) with distinct clinical variables ie, longer history of CM, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep quality, pain self-efficacy, and somatic symptoms. Higher interregional cortical covariance was found in CM compared to controls (OR = 3.1, CI 2.10-4.56, P < .0001), such that cortical thickness between regions tended to be more correlated in patients, particularly in the temporal and frontal lobes.	CM patients have significantly greater cortical covariance compared to controls. Cortical thickness in CM patients was predominantly accounted for by CM duration, PTSD, and poor sleep quality, while improved pain self-efficacy buffered cortical thickness. While it is important to address all CM features and comorbidities, it may be useful to emphasize optimizing the management of certain clinical features that contribute to cortical abnormalities including managing PTSD, early management to shorten duration of CM, and improving pain self-efficacy and sleep quality.",chronic migraine| cortical thickness| depression| migraine duration| posttraumatic stress disorder| self-efficacy,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Headache</journal><title>Clinical Features Contributing to Cortical Thickness Changes in Chronic Migraine - A Pilot Study.</title><abstract>The objectives of this cross-sectional pilot study were threefold: to identify regions of cortical thickness that differentiate chronic migraine (CM) from controls, to assess group differences in interregional cortical thickness covariance, and to determine group differences in associations between clinical variables and cortical thickness.

134,21954106,Human brain mapping,Functional connectivity changes in multiple sclerosis patients: a graph analytical study of MEG resting state data.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by extensive damage in the central nervous system. Within this field, there is a strong need for more advanced, functional imaging measures, as abnormalities measured with structural imaging insufficiently explain clinicocognitive decline in MS. In this study we investigated functional connectivity changes in MS using resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Data from 34 MS patients and 28 age and gender-matched controls was assessed using synchronization likelihood (SL) as a measure of functional interaction strength between brain regions, and graph analysis to characterize topological patterns of connectivity changes. Cognition was assessed using extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Structural measures included brain and lesion volumes, using MRI. Results show SL increases in MS patients in theta, lower alpha and beta bands, with decreases in the upper alpha band. Graph analysis revealed a more regular topology in the lower alpha band in patients, indicated by an increased path length (λ) and clustering coefficient (γ). Attention and working memory domains were impaired, with decreased brain volumes. A stepwise linear regression model using clinical, MRI and MEG parameters as predictors revealed that only increases in lower alpha band γ predicted impaired cognition. Cognitive impairments and related altered connectivity patterns were found to be especially predominant in male patients. These results show specific functional changes in MS as measured with MEG. Only changes in network topology were related to poorer cognitive outcome. This indicates the value of graph analysis beyond traditional structural and functional measures, with possible implications for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes in MS.",,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Human brain mapping</journal><title>Functional connectivity changes in multiple sclerosis patients: a graph analytical study of MEG resting state data.</title><abstract>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by extensive damage in the central nervous system.

Loss-of-function mutations in GEMIN5 lead to a neurodevelopmental syndrome among patients presenting with developmental delay, motor dysfunction, and cerebellar atrophy by perturbing SMN complex protein expression and assembly. Currently, molecular determinants of GEMIN5-mediated disease have yet to be explored. Here, we identified SMN as a genetic suppressor of GEMIN5-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo. We discovered that an increase in SMN expression by either SMN gene therapy replacement or the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), Nusinersen, significantly upregulated the endogenous levels of GEMIN5 in mammalian cells and mutant GEMIN5-derived iPSC neurons. Further, we identified a strong functional association between the expression patterns of SMN and GEMIN5 in patient Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)-derived motor neurons harboring loss-of-function mutations in the SMN gene. Interestingly, SMN binds to the C-terminus of GEMIN5 and requires the Tudor domain for GEMIN5 binding and expression regulation. Finally, we show that SMN upregulation ameliorates defective snRNP biogenesis and alternative splicing defects caused by loss of GEMIN5 in iPSC neurons and in vivo.

140,32563266,BMC public health,Correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.,"In Korea, higher education has rapidly grown influenced by sociocultural tradition. Parents invest a significant portion of their household income in their children's education. Private education has been considered to greatly affect students' psychology and behavior. However, past research has largely neglected to study parents who pay these costs. Since household income and education level are important determinants of socioeconomic status (SES), education expenditures are likely to cause depressive symptoms. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.	Data were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS, 2015, 2018). The sample analyzed consisted of 397 and 337 fathers and 403 and 370 mothers in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The independent variable in this study was the proportion of private education cost. This proportion was calculated by dividing each household's private education costs by its equivalized household disposable income (EHDI) and multiplying this number by 100. The main dependent variable was parental responses to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-11 (CESD-11). Using a generalized linear model, we investigated the effects of the proportion of private education cost on parental depression.	The results showed that fathers with higher proportions of private education cost exhibited higher CESD-11 scores compared to fathers with lower proportions cost (moderate: β = 0.419, S. E = 0.164, p = 0.0105; high: β = 0.476, S. E = 0.178, p = 0.0076), indicating that a higher ratio of private education cost may negatively affect depression in fathers. However, there was no discernable correlation between mothers' CESD-11 scores and the proportion of private education cost (moderate: β = - 0.078, S. E = 0.250, p = 0.7555; high: β = 0.003, S. E = 0.215, p = 0.9882).	These results may be explained by the tendency for fathers to experience greater economic burdens than mothers in patriarchal Korean society.",Age| Education-obsessed Korean society| Equivalized household disposable income| Korea welfare panel study| Parental depression| Private education cost,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>BMC public health</journal><title>Correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.</title><abstract>In Korea, higher education has rapidly grown influenced by sociocultural tradition.

E = 0.164, p = 0.0105; high: β = 0.476, S. E = 0.178, p = 0.0076), indicating that a higher ratio of private education cost may negatively affect depression in fathers. However, there was no discernable correlation between mothers' CESD-11 scores and the proportion of private education cost (moderate: β = - 0.078, S. E = 0.250, p = 0.7555; high: β = 0.003, S.

These results may be explained by the tendency for fathers to experience greater economic burdens than mothers in patriarchal Korean society.</abstract>","<title>Correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.</title><abstract>In Korea, higher education has rapidly grown influenced by sociocultural tradition. Parents invest a significant portion of their household income in their children's education. Private education has been considered to greatly affect students' psychology and behavior. However, past research has largely neglected to study parents who pay these costs. Since household income and education level are important determinants of socioeconomic status (SES), education expenditures are likely to cause depressive symptoms. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.	Data were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS, 2015, 2018). The sample analyzed consisted of 397 and 337 fathers and 403 and 370 mothers in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The independent variable in this study was the proportion of private education cost. This proportion was calculated by dividing each household's private education costs by its equivalized household disposable income (EHDI) and multiplying this number by 100. The main dependent variable was parental responses to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-11 (CESD-11). Using a generalized linear model, we investigated the effects of the proportion of private education cost on parental depression.	The results showed that fathers with higher proportions of private education cost exhibited higher CESD-11 scores compared to fathers with lower proportions cost (moderate: β = 0.419, S. E = 0.164, p = 0.0105; high: β = 0.476, S. E = 0.178, p = 0.0076), indicating that a higher ratio of private education cost may negatively affect depression in fathers.

However, associations between family-level variables (maternal hostility, maternal depressive symptoms) and child behaviors (developmental course of ADHD and aggression) may be explained by genes that are shared by biologically related parents and children. Furthermore, ADHD symptoms and aggression commonly co-occur: it is important to consider both simultaneously to have a better understanding of processes underlying the developmental course of ADHD and aggression. To addresses these issues, we employed a longitudinal genetically sensitive parent-offspring adoption design.

Therefore, we examined the association of different APOE alleles with common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), carotid plaques, incident myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. We analyzed data from 3327 participants aged 20-79 years of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) from Northeast Germany with a median follow-up time of 14.5 years. Linear, logistic, and Cox-regression models were used to assess the associations of the APOE polymorphism with CCA-IMT, carotid plaques, incident MI and stroke, respectively. In our study, the APOE E2 allele was associated with lower CCA-IMT at baseline compared to E3 homozygotes (β: - 0.02 [95% CI - 0.04, - 0.004]).

Against this background in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, an evaluation of all clinical and complementary institutions engaged in psychiatry was realized. 83.5 % of the institutions took part in the study and 137 (5.21 %) persons were identified as critical. 59.4 % of the institutions, especially therapeutic living groups, remarked that they had treated critical persons during the last year. Sociodemographically, the critical persons could be characterized by comparatively limited interpersonal relationships und a high unemployed status.

We studied 100 African-American CHF patients (aged 55-87 years) in New York Heart Association classes II-IV, who are enrolled in an ongoing, randomized, controlled trial, evaluating the effectiveness of a telemonitoring intervention to improve access to ambulatory care for heart failure patients. These CHF patients were recruited from an inner-city practice, rural physician practices and an urban physician practice in Atlanta. The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used to measure cognition. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MMSE score of less than 24. The crude prevalence of cognitive impairment was 10% in this population of African Americans with CHF. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated an increase in odds of cognitive impairment with increasing age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10 and 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.20; p=0.042].

149,28693402,Clinical child psychology and psychiatry,Fix my child: The importance of including siblings in clinical assessments.,"This study examined concordance in the attachment strategies of school-aged siblings with reference to environmental risk in terms of poverty and maltreatment. It also investigated the effect of child maltreatment and maternal mental illness on children's psychosocial functioning in terms of the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM) including unresolved trauma and the DMM Depressed modifier.	The attachment strategies of 30 sibling pairs, aged 5-14 years, were assessed using the School-age Assessment of Attachment (SAA). Unlike most previous studies, this study included siblings from large families of two to six children.	The main finding was that as environmental risk increases, the diversity of sibling attachment strategies decreases with greater recourse to the DMM Type A3-6 and A/C strategies. Unlike previous studies, the highest level of concordance was found in sibling pairs with the opposite gender. Boys whose mothers had a history of mental illness were significantly more likely than girls to be assessed with the DMM-depression modifier.	As danger increases, children in the same family experience more of the same childhood. Further research should focus on single case, intra-familial studies to build a systemic model of the shared environment. Research should also evaluate the effects of environmental risk compared with size of the sibling group on children's attachment strategies.

150,29039020,Molecular neurobiology,Systemic Inflammation and Multimodal Biomarkers in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"There is increasing evidence suggesting that one of the most relevant pathophysiological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuroinflammation, which plays an important role in the production and regulation of AD-related proteins (amyloid beta (Aβ) and Tau) and exacerbates AD pathology. Neuroinflammation can also be induced by systemic influences (factors from outside the central nervous system). However, the role of systemic inflammation in AD pathophysiology is much less understood. Thus, our main objective in this study was to verify whether the presence of serum cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α) affects different AD biomarkers: Aβ1-42 and Tau protein levels, hippocampal volumes (HV), and default mode network functional connectivity (DMN FC) in healthy elderly controls, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients due to AD, and mild AD patients. To accomplish this, we acquired 3-T MRI, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 42 healthy controls, 55 aMCI patients due to AD, and 33 mild AD patients. Comparing the groups, we found that the mild AD patients presented smaller HV, disrupted DMN FC, and proportionally less IL-1β than the controls. The aMCI patients only differed from the controls in DMN FC. In intra-group comparison, aMCI and mild AD with detectable levels of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-12) had decreased DMN FC. On the other hand, patients with detectable levels of IL-10 and IL-12 presented a more favorable AD biomarkers profile (larger HV, more CSF Aβ1-42, and less p-Tau), indicating a possible protective role of these ILs.

Participants (mean age 71, 34% with disability and 21% from ethnic minorities) were surveyed 1 and/or 6 months after the trial ended by postal and/or telephone questionnaire.	Of 237 potential participants, 53 (22%) declined, 16 (6%) were lost and 9 (4%) died during follow-up. Overall, reported monthly use of the monitor without nurse support was 47% [54/114, 95% confidence interval (CI) 38.2-56.5] at 6 months and 50% (57/114, 95% CI 40.8-59.2) at 18 months. Participants who monitored weekly after 1 month were more likely than the remainder to have no disability [Rankin score ≤ 1; relative risk (RR) 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5] and low anxiety levels (FEAR score = 0; RR 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.0).	Around half of hypertensive stroke patients offered a blood pressure monitor but no support continued to use it after 6 and 18 months. Monitoring in the first month was common in those who were not anxious or disabled.</abstract>","{

154,28428190,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,In Vivo Detection of EGFRvIII in Glioblastoma via Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signature Consistent with Deep Peritumoral Infiltration: The φ-Index.,"Purpose: The epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) mutation has been considered a driver mutation and therapeutic target in glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain cancer. Currently, detecting EGFRvIII requires postoperative tissue analyses, which are ex vivo and unable to capture the tumor's spatial heterogeneity. Considering the increasing evidence of in vivo imaging signatures capturing molecular characteristics of cancer, this study aims to detect EGFRvIII in primary glioblastoma noninvasively, using routine clinically acquired imaging.Experimental Design: We found peritumoral infiltration and vascularization patterns being related to EGFRvIII status. We therefore constructed a quantitative within-patient peritumoral heterogeneity index (PHI/φ-index), by contrasting perfusion patterns of immediate and distant peritumoral edema. Application of φ-index in preoperative perfusion scans of independent discovery (n = 64) and validation (n = 78) cohorts, revealed the generalizability of this EGFRvIII imaging signature.Results: Analysis in both cohorts demonstrated that the obtained signature is highly accurate (89.92%), specific (92.35%), and sensitive (83.77%), with significantly distinctive ability (P = 4.0033 × 10[-10], AUC = 0.8869). Findings indicated a highly infiltrative-migratory phenotype for EGFRvIII[+] tumors, which displayed similar perfusion patterns throughout peritumoral edema. Contrarily, EGFRvIII[-] tumors displayed perfusion dynamics consistent with peritumorally confined vascularization, suggesting potential benefit from extensive peritumoral resection/radiation.Conclusions: This EGFRvIII signature is potentially suitable for clinical translation, since obtained from analysis of clinically acquired images. Use of within-patient heterogeneity measures, rather than population-based associations, renders φ-index potentially resistant to inter-scanner variations. Overall, our findings enable noninvasive evaluation of EGFRvIII for patient selection for targeted therapy, stratification into clinical trials, personalized treatment planning, and potentially treatment-response evaluation.

There are many factors, including social and cultural, that promote longer DUP. To date, there have been no studies to evaluate religion's effect on DUP. In this study, we evaluated the effect of certain religious affiliations and degree of religious practice on the DUP.	A total of 195 patients were recruited aged 18 to 45 years with the presence of at least 1 psychotic symptom (delusions, hallucinations, or prominent thought disorder). Patients were evaluated on their religious practice prior to the index episode using a Likert-style scale. Using a similar scale, patients were asked about their religious affiliation categorized as Catholic, Protestant, or neither.	Correlational analysis revealed that the time to first treatment and time to first hospitalization were both was negatively related to degree of religious practice (r = -0.15, N = 161, p < 0.05 and r = -0.18, N = 161, p < 0.05, respectively). Between-group comparisons revealed longer DUP in the Protestant group compared to the no affiliation and Catholic groups (p = 0.05).	From our results, it appears that the degree of religious practice does not affect length of time to treatment in psychotic patients.

Before entering the ciliary compartment, IFT complexes and transported cargoes accumulate at or near the base of the cilium. The spatial organization of IFT proteins at the cilia base is key for understanding cilia formation and function. Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and computational averaging, we show that seven TZ, nine IFT, three Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and one centrosomal protein, form 9-clustered rings at the cilium base of a ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In the axial dimension, analyzed TZ proteins localize to a narrow region of about 30 nm while IFT proteins dock approximately 80 nm proximal to TZ. Moreover, the IFT-A subcomplex is positioned peripheral to the IFT-B subcomplex and the investigated BBS proteins localize near the ciliary membrane.

Plasma histaminase activity was determined using Gordon and Peters spectrophotometric method, and the results were expressed in mumoles of H2O2 transformed/hour/litre of plasma at 25 degrees C. Plasmatic histaminase, using histamine as substrate, was significantly increased in schizophrenic patients as a whole compared with the healthy controls. On the other hand, when cadaverine was used as substrate plasma histaminase was significantly reduced in female schizophrenics but not in males. When patients were divided according to 17 clinical characteristics it was found that the following subgroups were significantly associated to high levels of plasma histaminase (using histamine as substrate): the non mentally deteriorated schizophrenic patients compared with mentally deteriorated schizophrenic patients and those with thymic symptoms as opposed to those without thymic symptoms.

On the other hand, when cadaverine was used as substrate plasma histaminase was significantly reduced in female schizophrenics but not in males. When patients were divided according to 17 clinical characteristics it was found that the following subgroups were significantly associated to high levels of plasma histaminase (using histamine as substrate): the non mentally deteriorated schizophrenic patients compared with mentally deteriorated schizophrenic patients and those with thymic symptoms as opposed to those without thymic symptoms. An extension of this series and a prospective analysis are required to further define the clinical and biological significance of the alteration of this biochemical parameter in schizophrenia, and particularly in relation with a subgroup of schizophrenia with a more favourable course.</abstract>","<title>[An analysis of plasma histaminase in schizophrenic patients and its relationship to clinical parameters].</title><abstract>Previous studies have investigated putative alterations in histamine and histamine receptors in schizophrenia, and evidence in favour of the role of this amine as a neurotransmitter or as a neuromodulator was found.

162,7775177,Headache,Is abdominal pain a feature of adult migraine?,"Recurrent abdominal pain in children, frequently diagnosed as 'abdominal migraine,' is thought to evolve into more typical migraine headache during the teens and twenties. If this transformation occurred, we would expect some adult migraineurs to retain abdominal pain; but we could not recall this symptom being mentioned by patients. However, without direct questioning the absence cannot be assumed. We, therefore, asked 100 migraineurs about abdominal symptoms during migraine attacks: only one experienced unexplained abdominal pain. We conclude that abdominal pain is not a feature in adult migraineurs, leading us to support the notions that: (1) recurrent abdominal pain of childhood has a number of causes; (2) abdominal migraine may be an incorrect attribution and is liable to be over diagnosed; (3) abdominal migraine requires more precise definition; (4) the transition from childhood abdominal migraine to adult migraine needs precise prospective study.",,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Headache</journal><title>Is abdominal pain a feature of adult migraine?</title><abstract>Recurrent abdominal pain in children, frequently diagnosed as 'abdominal migraine,' is thought to evolve into more typical migraine headache during the teens and twenties.

Thus, visual testing could be used as an aid to the clinical diagnosis of dementia. In the present study, exploratory eye movement was measured to evaluate visual cognitive function in elderly subjects, including those with dementia.	We analyzed responsive search scores (RSS) from exploratory eye movements of 300 subjects who were examined with an eye mark recorder while viewing S shaped figures. Subjects were divided into three groups (dementia, intermediate, healthy) from the values of the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating. We further divided the intermediate groups into two subgroups, the high score and low score groups, based on RSS. In 202 subjects, Z-scores of voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	RSS of the dementia group were significantly lower than those in the intermediate and healthy groups, in order: dementia < intermediate < healthy groups. RSS of the low score intermediate group was significantly lower than that of the high score intermediate group. There was no significant difference between the low score intermediate and dementia groups, or between the high score intermediate and healthy groups. No significant differences of either HSD-R or MMSE were observed between the low score and the high score intermediate groups.

Model 3a resulted in a good fit as well as a significantly better fit than Model 2. Model 3a was also equivalent across treatment status, gender, and age groupings for the most part. Though Models 3b and 4 provided a statistically better fit than Model 3a, the improvement in fit was small and other model selection criteria argued against these more complex models.</abstract>","{

The physical and mental health of a group of 433 patients with current panic disorder and 9,839 outpatients with psychiatric or medical disorders were assessed with the 20- and 36-item short-form surveys of the Medical Outcomes Study.

176,29067401,Journal of vision,Motion-generated optical information allows event perception despite blurry vision in AMD and amblyopic patients.,"Events consist of objects in motion. When objects move, their opaque surfaces reflect light and produce both static image structure and dynamic optic flow. The static and dynamic optical information co-specify events. Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and amblyopia cannot identify static objects because of weakened image structure. However, optic flow is detectable despite blurry vision because visual motion measurement uses low spatial frequencies. When motion ceases, image structure persists and might preserve properties specified by optic flow. We tested whether optic flow and image structure interact to allow event perception with poor static vision. AMD (Experiment 1), amblyopic (Experiments 2 and 3), and normally sighted observers identified common events from either blurry (Experiments 1 and 2) or clear images (Experiment 3), when either single image frames were presented, a sequence of frames was presented with motion masks, or a sequence of frames was presented with detectable motion. Results showed that with static images, but no motion, events were not perceived well by participants other than controls in Experiment 3. However, with detectable motion, events were perceived. Immediately following this and again after five days, participants were able to identify events from the original static images. So, when image structure information is weak, optic flow compensates for it and enables event perception.

We created a retrospective multicenter cohort of patients with (1) GCA diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria between 1995 and 2015, and (2) stroke occurring at the time of GCA diagnosis or occurring within 4 weeks of starting GCA therapy. The control group consisted of GCA patients without stroke.	Forty patients [21 women (53%), median age 78 (60-91) yrs] with GCA-related stroke were included and were compared with 200 control patients. Stroke occurred at GCA diagnosis in 29 patients (73%), whereas it occurred after diagnosis in 11 patients. Vertebrobasilar territory was involved in 29 patients (73%). Seven patients died within a few hours or days following stroke. Compared with the control group, stroke patients had more ophthalmic ischemic symptoms [25 (63%) vs 50 (25%), p < 0.001]. Conversely, they demonstrated lower biological inflammatory variables [C-reactive protein: 61 (28-185) mg/l vs 99 (6-400) mg/l, p = 0.04] and less anemia [22/37 (59%) vs 137/167 (79%), p = 0.03] than patients without stroke. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the best predictors for the occurrence of stroke were the presence of ophthalmic ischemic symptoms at diagnosis (OR 5, 95% CI 2.14-12.33, p = 0.0002) and the absence of anemia (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.99, p = 0.04).

The control group consisted of GCA patients without stroke.	Forty patients [21 women (53%), median age 78 (60-91) yrs] with GCA-related stroke were included and were compared with 200 control patients. Stroke occurred at GCA diagnosis in 29 patients (73%), whereas it occurred after diagnosis in 11 patients. Vertebrobasilar territory was involved in 29 patients (73%). Seven patients died within a few hours or days following stroke. Compared with the control group, stroke patients had more ophthalmic ischemic symptoms [25 (63%) vs 50 (25%), p < 0.001]. Conversely, they demonstrated lower biological inflammatory variables [C-reactive protein: 61 (28-185) mg/l vs 99 (6-400) mg/l, p = 0.04] and less anemia [22/37 (59%) vs 137/167 (79%), p = 0.03] than patients without stroke.

180,30700595,Neurology,Histopathology of diffusion imaging abnormalities in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"We sought to determine the underlying mechanism for altered white matter diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures at the histopathologic level in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).	Formalin-fixed intact hemispheres from 9 CAA cases and 2 elderly controls were scanned at 3-tesla MRI, including a diffusion-weighted sequence. DTI measures (i.e., fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) and histopathology measures were obtained from 2 tracts: the anterior thalamic radiation and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.	FA was reduced in both tracts and MD was increased in cases with CAA compared to controls. Regional FA was significantly correlated with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, axonal density, and white matter microinfarcts. MD correlated significantly with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, and white matter microinfarcts, but not axonal density. FA and MD did not correlate with oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or gliosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that tissue rarefaction (β = -0.32 ± 0.12, p = 0.009) and axonal density (β = 0.25 ± 0.12, p = 0.04) were both independently associated with FA, whereas myelin density was independently associated with MD (β = -0.32 ± 0.12, p = 0.013). Finally, we found an association between increased MD in the frontal white matter and CAA severity in the frontal cortex (p = 0.035).	These results suggest that overall tissue loss, and in particular axonal and myelin loss, are major components underlying CAA-related alterations in DTI properties observed in living patients. The findings allow for a more mechanistic interpretation of DTI parameters in small vessel disease and for mechanism-based selection of candidate treatments to prevent vascular cognitive impairment.",,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Neurology</journal><title>Histopathology of diffusion imaging abnormalities in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.</title><abstract>We sought to determine the underlying mechanism for altered white matter diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures at the histopathologic level in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).

181,21280167,European eating disorders review : the journal of the Eating Disorders Association,Understanding your own and other's minds: the relationship to eating disorder related symptoms.,"A study using a cross-sectional survey design examined whether eating disorder (ED) related symptoms are associated with understanding one's own and others' minds. A non-clinical sample of 145 women completed self-report questionnaires and recorded their emotional, cognitive and behavioural responses to descriptions of scenarios (vignettes). Responses to scenarios were made from the perspective of self, an attachment figure and a same sex acquaintance. Data were analysed using multiple regression statistics with ED related symptoms as the dependent variable. High levels of ED related symptoms were associated with 'concretised' understanding of own emotions (i.e. a greater number of food related responses), but sophisticated understanding of same sex acquaintance's emotions. They were associated with fewer positive thoughts for self, fewer negative emotions about their own behaviour, and more food responses for same sex acquaintance's behaviour. Similarities and differences were observed in the different perspectives. Limitations are discussed. Implications for further research related to this topic and relevant to EDs are briefly summarised.",eating disorders| theory of mind,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>European eating disorders review : the journal of the Eating Disorders Association</journal><title>Understanding your own and other's minds: the relationship to eating disorder related symptoms.</title><abstract>A study using a cross-sectional survey design examined whether eating disorder (ED) related symptoms are associated with understanding one's own and others' minds.

Selected studies included cross-sectional and cohort studies that addressed either prevalence of hepatitis C in the United States or clinical outcomes (for example, hepatocellular carcinoma and serious adverse events) among treated patients and systematic reviews of trials that assessed effectiveness of brief screening interventions for alcohol consumption. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework was used to assess quality of the evidence. RECOMMENDATION 1: Adults born during 1945-1965 should receive 1-time testing for HCV without prior ascertainment of HCV risk. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: All persons with identified HCV infection should receive a brief alcohol screening and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by referral to appropriate care and treatment services for HCV infection and related conditions (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).</abstract>","{

188,25080285,Brain : a journal of neurology,Genetic impact on cognition and brain function in newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: ICICLE-PD study.,"Parkinson's disease is associated with multiple cognitive impairments and increased risk of dementia, but the extent of these deficits varies widely among patients. The ICICLE-PD study was established to define the characteristics and prevalence of cognitive change soon after diagnosis, in a representative cohort of patients, using a multimodal approach. Specifically, we tested the 'Dual Syndrome' hypothesis for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, which distinguishes an executive syndrome (affecting the frontostriatal regions due to dopaminergic deficits) from a posterior cortical syndrome (affecting visuospatial, mnemonic and semantic functions related to Lewy body pathology and secondary cholinergic loss). An incident Parkinson's disease cohort (n = 168, median 8 months from diagnosis to participation) and matched control group (n = 85) were recruited to a neuroimaging study at two sites in the UK. All participants underwent clinical, neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments. The three neuroimaging tasks (Tower of London, Spatial Rotations and Memory Encoding Tasks) were designed to probe executive, visuospatial and memory encoding domains, respectively. Patients were also genotyped for three polymorphisms associated with cognitive change in Parkinson's disease and related disorders: (i) rs4680 for COMT Val158Met polymorphism; (ii) rs9468 for MAPT H1 versus H2 haplotype; and (iii) rs429358 for APOE-ε2, 3, 4. We identified performance deficits in all three cognitive domains, which were associated with regionally specific changes in cortical activation. Task-specific regional activations in Parkinson's disease were linked with genetic variation: the rs4680 polymorphism modulated the effect of levodopa therapy on planning-related activations in the frontoparietal network; the MAPT haplotype modulated parietal activations associated with spatial rotations; and APOE allelic variation influenced the magnitude of activation associated with memory encoding. This study demonstrates that neurocognitive deficits are common even in recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease, and that the associated regional brain activations are influenced by genotype. These data further support the dual syndrome hypothesis of cognitive change in Parkinson's disease. Longitudinal data will confirm the extent to which these early neurocognitive changes, and their genetic factors, influence the long-term risk of dementia in Parkinson's disease. The combination of genetics and functional neuroimaging provides a potentially useful method for stratification and identification of candidate markers, in future clinical trials against cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease.",Parkinson’s disease| cognition| functional MRI| genetics,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Brain : a journal of neurology</journal><title>Genetic impact on cognition and brain function in newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: ICICLE-PD study.</title><abstract>Parkinson's disease is associated with multiple cognitive impairments and increased risk of dementia, but the extent of these deficits varies widely among patients.

Previous research has supported the model that people tend initially to look for external or environmental explanations for bodily sensations (normalizing attributions) and only if this process fails do they search for attributions internal to themselves (somatic or psychological attributions). This study tested two hypotheses about frequent general practice attenders: (1) compared with others, they are more likely to make somatic attributions and less likely to make normalizing ones; and (2) given a bodily symptom together with a somatic explanation, frequent attenders will have greater difficulty than others in finding reasons why the given (pathological) explanation is untrue. The frequent attenders' group had themselves initiated an average of 12 general practice visits in the 12 months before assessment, while a control group of infrequent attenders had not made appointments to see their general practitioner for an average of 24 months. The results provide partial support for the hypotheses. Frequent attenders generated significantly fewer normalizing explanations for a series of common bodily sensations than the comparison group, although the two groups did not differ in their somatic attributions.

We surveyed New York State parents of children with DDs to ascertain willingness and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines.	An online survey was distributed to statewide DD networks from June to September 2021 (vaccines were authorized for adolescents in May 2021). We report associations between vaccine willingness and concerns and race/ethnicity, child age, in-person schooling, routine/flu vaccinations, and DD diagnoses.

In addition, the role of the visual system in relation to visual hallucinations was examined.	102 consecutive patients diagnosed with strictly defined Parkinson's disease were examined for the presence of hallucinations and delusions and assessed for visual acuity, cognition, depression using the geriatric depression scale, disease severity as measured by the UPDRS, and other clinical variables.	Of 102 consecutive patients, 29.4% (n=30) had hallucinations or delusions, four (3.9%) were determined to be psychotic due solely to delirium and were excluded from further analysis. Of the 98 remaining patients, 26.5% (n=26) had visual hallucinations. Among these, one patient also had delusions, two had auditory hallucinations, and one had gustatory hallucinations. Visual hallucinations were significantly associated with worse visual acuity, lower cognitive score, higher depression score, and worse disease severity. Hallucinations were not associated with history of psychiatric disease, dose or duration of levodopa or other antiparkinsonian medication treatment, or duration of illness.	Visual hallucinations are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease and are most likely of multifactorial origin. Although higher doses of levodopa are known to be related clinically to hallucinations in individual patients, the results suggest that several underlying characteristics of patients with Parkinson's disease (disease severity, dementia, depression, worse visual acuity) may be more important determinants of which patients experience hallucinations.

Our aim was to investigate the relationships between IR, inflammation, oxidative stress and stroke severity in acute ischemic stroke patients.	We examined the relationships between inflammation, oxidative stress and stroke severity in 75 acute stroke patients with and without IR. Serum levels of oxidative stress markers (nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH)) were measured as well as the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10).	The levels of IL-10 (13.7±19.11 vs 51.20±89.32 pg/ml, p<0.00) in IR group were significantly reduced. Patients with IR had higher levels of NO (30.26±17.63 vs 22.57±14.5 µmol/L, p=0.04) and IL6 (27.44±57.13 vs 8.68±11.8 pg/ml, p<0.00) and higher NIHSS scores (11.40±5.35 vs 8.81±5.76, p=0.04) when compared with noninsulin resistant group. IL-10 was found negatively correlated with HOMA. Additionally, the parameters with positive correlations with HOMA were NIHSS, IL-6 and NO.	Inflammation and oxidative stress are more evident in acute stoke patients with insulin resistance which may cause worse stroke severity.

Semi-structured interviews of between 40 and 60 min were conducted with three men and one woman, with spinal injuries at C7 or higher, within 6 months of discharge from inpatient spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. Data were subject to an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).	Participants described their injuries as more than a biological impairment that limited certain functional abilities.

Interviews uncovered three key themes essential to an individual's ability to restore feelings of self-agency and biographical continuity: The importance of information, regaining control, and restoring a sense of personal narrative.	Findings from studies using IPA have much to contribute to discussion and debate at the level of rehabilitation theory and can guide future research directions. The findings of the present study support a growing body of literature that argues that rehabilitation research needs to focus more intensely on the biographical disruption caused by SCI. Implications for Rehabilitation Participants in the present study experienced a significant disruption to their biographical narratives following a SCI as they entered an unknown and uncertain world.

The role of tumour grading as independent prognostic factor in these group of tumours remains matter of debate. The aim of this study was to determine if grade is an independent prognostic factor and not somehow associated to IDH mutation and 1p/19q status of the tumour.	We analysed 399 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, histologically proven World Health Organisation (WHO) 2016 grade II or grade III IDH-mut gliomas, assessed by polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry or next-generation sequencing (NGS).	The analysis included 399 patients with grade II (n = 250, 62.7%) or grade III (n = 149, 37.3%) diffuse gliomas. Median follow-up time was 105.3 months. Median survival was 148.1 months.

The difference in survival remained significant (p = 0.006 in astrocytomas, p = 0.014 in oligodendrogliomas) when adjusted for histological subtype.

In our study, histopathological grade still affects survival in IDH-mutant WHO grade II and III diffuse gliomas.

In multivariate analysis, grade II (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.342, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.221-0.531; P < 0.001) and 1p/19q codeletion (HR = 0.440, 95% CI: 0.290-0.668; P < 0.001) were independently associated with a lower risk for death. The difference in survival remained significant (p = 0.006 in astrocytomas, p = 0.014 in oligodendrogliomas) when adjusted for histological subtype. Residual disease after surgery (or biopsy) negatively affected survival (HR: 2.151, 95% CI: 1.375-3.367, P = 0.001). Post-surgical treatment with radiotherapy + adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival compared with follow-up and other treatments (HR: 0.316, 95% CI: 0.156-0.641, P = 0.001).	In our study, histopathological grade still affects survival in IDH-mutant WHO grade II and III diffuse gliomas. This effect appears to be independent from molecular features, extension of surgical resection and post-surgical treatments. Therefore, physicians should continue to take into account tumour grade, along their molecular characteristics, for a better clinical and therapeutic management of the patients.</abstract>","{

Conventional MR imaging provides useful information in AS but depends on a subjective evaluation by the neuroradiologist. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the support of the phase-contrast MR imaging (PC-MR imaging) technique (sensitive to CSF flows) for the diagnosis of AS.	We retrospectively considered 17 patients who underwent PC-MR imaging to explore hydrocephalus, with the absence of CSF flow at the aqueductal level.

None of the usually reported direct or indirect signs of aqueductal obstruction were seen in 7 patients in whom the clinical suggestion of AS was confirmed by PC-MR imaging results. Seven patients in this population had a third ventriculostomy, and 5 of them were among those in whom conventional MR imaging failed to reveal signs of aqueductal obstruction. All of these 7 patients had a positive postsurgical outcomes. The analysis of CSF and vascular dynamic data in this population was compared with an aged-matched population, and these data were found similar except for the fourth ventricular CSF flush flow latency.	PC-MR imaging supports the diagnosis of CSF flow blockage at the aqueductal level in a reliable, reproducible, and rapid way, which aids in the diagnosis of AS in patients with clinical and/or radiologic suggestion of obstructive hydrocephalus.

203,27349722,Scientific reports,Central tendency effects in time interval reproduction in autism.,"Central tendency, the tendency of judgements of quantities (lengths, durations etc.) to gravitate towards their mean, is one of the most robust perceptual effects. A Bayesian account has recently suggested that central tendency reflects the integration of noisy sensory estimates with prior knowledge representations of a mean stimulus, serving to improve performance. The process is flexible, so prior knowledge is weighted more heavily when sensory estimates are imprecise, requiring more integration to reduce noise. In this study we measure central tendency in autism to evaluate a recent theoretical hypothesis suggesting that autistic perception relies less on prior knowledge representations than typical perception. If true, autistic children should show reduced central tendency than theoretically predicted from their temporal resolution. We tested autistic and age- and ability-matched typical children in two child-friendly tasks: (1) a time interval reproduction task, measuring central tendency in the temporal domain; and (2) a time discrimination task, assessing temporal resolution. Central tendency reduced with age in typical development, while temporal resolution improved. Autistic children performed far worse in temporal discrimination than the matched controls. Computational simulations suggested that central tendency was much less in autistic children than predicted by theoretical modelling, given their poor temporal resolution.",,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Scientific reports</journal><title>Central tendency effects in time interval reproduction in autism.</title><abstract>Central tendency, the tendency of judgements of quantities (lengths, durations etc.) to gravitate towards their mean, is one of the most robust perceptual effects.

The patients were selected from a group of epileptic subjects with seizure onset in infancy or early childhood. Inclusion criteria were the presence of photic-induced myoclonic seizures and a favorable outcome. Cases with less than 24 month follow up were excluded from the analysis.	Eight patients were identified (4 males, 4 females). Personal history was uneventful. All of them had familial antecedents of epilepsy. Psychomotor development was normal in 6 cases, both before and after seizure onset. One patient showed a mild mental retardation and a further patient showed some behavioral disturbances. Neuroradiological investigations, when performed (5 cases), gave normal results. The clinical manifestations were typical and could vary from upward movements of the eyes to myoclonic jerks of the head and shoulders, isolated or briefly repetitive, never causing a fall. Age of onset was between 11 months and 3 years and 2 months. Characteristically, the seizures were always triggered by photic stimulation. Non photo-induced spontaneous myoclonic attacks were reported in 2 cases during the follow-up. Other types of seizures were present at follow-up in 2 cases. The outcome was favorable, even if, usually, seizure control required high AED plasma levels.

208,2018095,American journal of medical genetics,Cognitive profiles of the carrier fragile X woman.,"Cognitive deficits in females with fragile X [fra(X)] syndrome have been reported, but studies have rarely focused on women with normal intelligence, nor have they separated fra(X)-negative carriers from fra(X)-positive carriers. Questions specifically addressed here are: 1) is the degree of fragility predictive of IQ? 2) are cognitive patterns consistent across fragility levels? and 3) do consistent individual profiles exist? These questions were addressed with the help of 74 heterozygous women, 38 of whom were fra(X)-negative carriers. All women completed the WAIS-R, and full-scale IQ was normally distributed (mean = 99.65). A strong inverse relationship between IQ and fragility levels was found. Also, the group of fra(X)-positive women had a significantly different subtest pattern from that of the fra(X)-negative women. However, when results were analyzed individually, no consistent patterns emerged. The cognitive performance of fra(X)-negative carriers has probably been underestimated due to the lack of differentiation between positive and negative carrier females in previous studies. These women appear to be cognitively unimpaired and should be considered separately from fra(X)-positive women. Since consistent WAIS-R patterns are not observable on an individual basis, their use as a diagnostic/predictive tool appears to be inappropriate.",,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>American journal of medical genetics</journal><title>Cognitive profiles of the carrier fragile X woman.</title><abstract>Cognitive deficits in females with fragile X [fra(X)] syndrome have been reported, but studies have rarely focused on women with normal intelligence, nor have they separated fra(X)-negative carriers from fra(X)-positive carriers.

The neural basis of apathy in bvFTD is not completely understood. Previous neuroimaging studies have poorly considered executive impairment and dementia severity as possible confounding factors. Herein we investigated the neural basis of apathy in bvFTD through structural neuroimaging taking into account these factors.	We included patients with probable bvFTD (n = 21) and cognitively healthy controls (HC, n = 22). Participants were matched for age, sex and schooling. All subjects underwent a thorough neuropsychological examination, including tests for executive functions and social cognition. Apathy was assessed with the Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS). All subjects underwent 3T brain MRI. We investigated correlations between SAS scores and gray matter atrophy within the bvFTD group. Executive function (Frontal Assessment Battery) and disease severity were considered as covariates in neuroimaging analyses.	Compared to HC, bvFTD patients had lower scores on global cognitive efficiency, executive functions and social cognition. All bvFTD had clinically relevant apathy (scores greater than 14 in the SAS). Performance in executive function tests did not correlate with apathy scores. The severity of apathy was negatively correlated with gray matter volumes in midline prefrontal regions, namely orbitofrontal cortex and both anterior and dorsal regions of cingulate cortex.

Data on perceived parental burden and specific effects on daily life is scarce. We performed a structured interview, consecutively talking to all parents of pediatric outpatients of our university hospital diagnosed with seizure or developmental disorder. Three hundred seven parents (of 317 affected children: 53 with seizure disorder, 44 with specific developmental disorder, 35 with learning disorder, 71 with intellectual disability, 15 with seizure + specific developmental disorder, 23 with seizure + learning disorder, 76 with seizure disorder + intellectual disability) were interviewed. Parents of children with both seizure disorder and intellectual disability stated the highest constraints in daily life, regarding friends, hobbies, emotional pressure, occupation, partnership, habitation, and financial burden. Due to diagnosis of seizure or developmental disorder, 155/307 (51%) parents reduced their working hours/stopped working, 62/307 (20%) changed their habitation, and 46/307 (15%) broke up. As judged by parents, 148/317 (47%) children are being discriminated against, even own family/friends and educators are held responsible.	Parents perceive changes in their daily life and discrimination of their children due to their children's seizure and developmental disorders. An intellectual disability combined with seizure disorder caused the highest constraint. What is Known: • Seizure and/or developmental disorders of children may adversely influence quality of life for affected parents. • Caring for a child with special health care needs can take complete attention and own parental needs may therefore be difficult to meet.

214,27527755,European journal of internal medicine,Blood cultures in the evaluation of uncomplicated cellulitis.,"The frequency of bacteremia and the array of microorganisms involved in cellulitis vary greatly among studies. Although current guidelines do not recommend routine blood culture in uncomplicated cellulitis, their implementation in clinical practice remains challenging. We therefore aimed to assess the frequency, determinants and microbiology of bacteremia in hospitalized patients with uncomplicated cellulitis.	We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all adult patients admitted at a primary-care hospital with a diagnosis of community-acquired uncomplicated cellulitis during a 4-year period. We looked at the factors associated with blood cultures sampling and at the incidence, determinants and microbiology of bacteremia in this population.	Among the 476 patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of cellulitis, 250 (52.5%) had blood cultures.

215,36314672,Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology,Effects of woody plant encroachment by eastern redcedar on mosquito communities in Oklahoma.,"Woody plant encroachment into grasslands is occurring worldwide, affecting ecosystems in ways that likely influence mosquito-borne disease transmission. In the U.S. Great Plains, encroachment by eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) (ERC) may be expanding conducive habitat for mosquitoes and their hosts, but few studies have evaluated associations between ERC encroachment and West Nile virus (WNV). To test the hypotheses that mosquito abundance and WNV-infected mosquitoes increase with increasing ERC cover, we collected mosquitoes in 32 sites in Oklahoma reflecting various ERC encroachment stages. We found support for our first hypothesis, as mean abundance of Aedes albopictus increased significantly with ERC cover. However, Psorophora columbiae and Anopheles quadrimaculatus abundance decreased with increasing ERC. There was no significant association with ERC for other mosquito species. We could not test our second hypothesis due to low WNV prevalence, but the only detected WNV-infected pool of mosquitoes (Cx. tarsalis) was collected in ERC. Our results suggest ERC encroachment increases abundance of at least one medically important mosquito species, but further research is needed to clarify how encroachment affects ecology of the entire WNV disease system through changes to vector and host communities, vector-host interactions, and thus disease transmission and prevalence. Understanding relationships between woody plant encroachment and the nidus of infection for mosquito-borne diseases will be crucial for targeting public health efforts, including land management activities that limit and/or eradicate woody plant encroachment, particularly in areas with high levels of disease risk.",Aedes albopictus| Culex tarsalis| West Nile virus| Woody plant encroachment,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology</journal><title>Effects of woody plant encroachment by eastern redcedar on mosquito communities in Oklahoma.</title><abstract>Woody plant encroachment into grasslands is occurring worldwide, affecting ecosystems in ways that likely influence mosquito-borne disease transmission.

While disease-modifying treatment, such as hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), may decrease this risk, it has not been systematically investigated in children with SCD. We screened neurocognitive functioning in 103 adolescents with SCD (16-17 years, 50% female) and compared outcomes between patients with a history of exposure to hydroxycarbamide (n = 12 HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia; n = 52 HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia) and those never treated with hydroxycarbamide (n = 31 HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia; n = 8 HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia). Demographic distributions were similar between the groups. After adjusting for socioeconomic status, the hydroxycarbamide group had significantly higher scores on nonverbal IQ (HbSC/HbSβ thalassaemia: P = 0·036, effect size [d] = 0·65), reaction speed (HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia: P = 0·002, d = 1·70), sustained attention (HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia: P = 0·014, d = 1·30), working memory (HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia: P = 0·034, d = 0·71) and verbal memory (HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia: P = 0·038, d = 0·84) when compared to those who did not receive hydroxycarbamide. In patients with HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia, longer treatment duration with hydroxycarbamide was associated with better verbal memory (P = 0·009) and reading (P = 0·002).

ICs were transcribed and content was categorized by 13 emergent themes. The most commonly reported ICs were of injury or death (48.2%) and combat (43.5%), and soldiers with probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n = 187) were more likely to report the presence of these ICs, χ(2) s(1) = 35.27, ps < .001, φs < .16 than those without probable PTSD (n = 1,331). Other domains also emerged frequently, including ICs about friends (31.0%), family (15.8%), and leadership concerns (13.8%). IC content was a small, but significant correlate of distress after adjusting for combat exposure (ΔR(2) ≥ .02, ps ≤ .001).

223,3060558,Journal of forensic sciences,Incidence of cannabinoids in medical examiner urine specimens.,"Cannabinoid use was studied in a nonspecific population of postmortem urine specimens in the State of Maryland. Of 500 sequential specimens screened for cannabinoids by enzyme multiplied immunoassay EMIT, 63 (13%) were initially positive and 58 (12%) were confirmed positive (92%). It was observed that geographic location and race did not correlate with cannabinoid prevalence. Cannabinoid use was observed to be strongly age related, with peak use by the 21- to 25-year-old age group where 22% of the cases were positive. Use of cannabinoids was also closely linked to homicides, which represented nearly half of the positive cases but only 13% of the total cases. When comparing manner of death, the greatest percent of confirmed positives was seen in homicide (26%) and drug-related (17%) deaths. The incidence of cannabinoid use was found to be more than 3 times as great in drug-related (17%) as compared to natural deaths (5%). The percent of cannabinoid-positive cases from vehicle-related accidents was low (6%) and that from nonvehicle-related accidents somewhat higher (10%). Other drugs appeared in cannabinoid-positive cases. Most prevalent was ethanol N = 18, followed by morphine (from heroin, N = 11), quinine N = 11, and cocaine N = 11. Phencyclidine (PCP) occurred twice and several other drugs were reported only once. Of the 25 homicide cases screened for drugs, 64% were positive for some drug including ethyl alcohol.

225,29531139,Diabetes,Altered Brain Dynamics in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes During Working Memory Processing.,"It is now generally accepted that diabetes increases the risk for cognitive impairment, but the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. A critical problem in linking diabetes to cognitive impairment is that patients often have multiple comorbidities (e.g., obesity, hypertension) that have been independently linked to cognitive deficits. In the study reported here we focused on young adults with and without type 1 diabetes who were virtually free of such comorbidities. The two groups were matched on major health and demographic factors, and all participants completed a verbal working memory task during magnetoencephalographic brain imaging. We hypothesized that patients would have altered neural dynamics in verbal working memory processing and that these differences would directly relate to clinical disease measures. Accordingly, we found that patients had significantly stronger neural responses in the superior parietal cortices during memory encoding and significantly weaker activity in parietal-occipital regions during maintenance compared with control subjects. Moreover, disease duration and glycemic control were both significantly correlated with neural responses in various brain regions. In conclusion, young healthy adults with type 1 diabetes already have aberrant neural processing relative to their peers without diabetes, using compensatory responses to perform the task, and glucose management and duration may play a central role.",,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Diabetes</journal><title>Altered Brain Dynamics in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes During Working Memory Processing.</title><abstract>It is now generally accepted that diabetes increases the risk for cognitive impairment, but the precise mechanisms are poorly understood.

Accordingly, impairments in context processing are thought to underlie cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, a clinical disorder that has been linked to PFC dysfunction (Servan-Schreiber et al., 1996). However, task switching, a cognitive ability linked to PFC function, has not been consistently impaired in schizophrenia. In this experiment, we assessed whether task-switching performance would be selectively impaired for patients when context demands were high. In the rule-switching condition, a switch required the updating of the relevant task response rules whereas perceptual switching did not entail a switching of contextual information. Instead, a perceptual switch entailed a shift of visuospatial attention to the relevant feature. A second goal was to determine whether potential deficits in context switching would be observed in schizophrenia even in situations when these patients do not need to overcome a prepotent response. Studies of context processing have typically required patients with schizophrenia to use contextual rules to overcome prepotent response tendencies whereas our switching paradigm did not require the inhibition of a competing response. Patients were much slower to switch tasks than controls when contextual rules switched from one trial to the next whereas their performance was intact when the switch occurred between different feature sets and contextual demands were low. Our results demonstrate that context processing deficits are observable in schizophrenia even when there is no prepotent response tendency to inhibit. Moreover, our results suggest that PFC impairments influence performance primarily when patients are required to switch the application of one explicit rule to another.",,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Schizophrenia research</journal><title>The impact of context processing deficits on task-switching performance in schizophrenia.</title><abstract>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been described as important for maintaining and implementing contextual information in the service of goal-oriented behavior.

231,15957200,Schizophrenia bulletin,Reduced red blood cell membrane essential polyunsaturated fatty acids in first episode schizophrenia at neuroleptic-naive baseline.,"There is emerging evidence in schizophrenia of membrane abnormalities, primarily reductions in the essential omega-3 and omega-6 series of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Because previous studies have largely been in chronic patients, it is not known whether these membrane abnormalities also occur early in illness. In the present study, red blood cell membrane fatty acid levels were determined by capillary gas chromatography from 24 neuroleptic-naive patients with first episode schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 31 age-matched normal controls. Relative to normal subjects, patients had significant reductions in total PUFA (-13%) but not in monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids. Specifically, significant reductions were found in arachidonic acid (-18%), docosapentaenoic acid (-36%), and docosahexaenoic acid (-26%) concentrations. These reductions were not related to age, gender, smoking status, or cotinine levels. These results confirm previous findings of membrane deficits in schizophrenia and show that significant PUFA reductions occur early in the illness, prior to initiation of treatment, raising the possibility that these deficits are trait related. The findings also suggest that membrane fatty acid losses are quite specific to the highly unsaturated fatty acids.",,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Schizophrenia bulletin</journal><title>Reduced red blood cell membrane essential polyunsaturated fatty acids in first episode schizophrenia at neuroleptic-naive baseline.</title><abstract>There is emerging evidence in schizophrenia of membrane abnormalities, primarily reductions in the essential omega-3 and omega-6 series of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).

This study aims to compare SBIs, deep white matter lesions (DWMLs), and periventricular white matter lesions (PWMLs) in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres to internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, and investigate their association with stenosis grade in patients with asymptomatic ≥ 50% unilateral extracranial ICA stenosis. Patients without previous history of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack who had ≥ 50% stenosis in unilateral ICA on carotid color Doppler ultrasound were enrolled in the study. Patient demographics, vascular risk factors and ICA stenosis grades; number, location, and size of SBIs, DWMLs, and PWMLs in ICA territory were evaluated in both hemispheres using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Of the 69 patients, 53 had 50-69% (76.8%) and 16 had ≥ 70% (23.2%) unilateral ICA stenosis. There was no statistically significant difference in SBIs between ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres to ≥ 50% ICA stenosis. Comparison of ICA stenoses as 50-69% and ≥ 70% revealed a greater number of patients with SBI in ipsilateral hemisphere to ≥ 70% stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.025). The number of SBIs was also higher in ipsilateral hemisphere to ≥ 70% stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.022). While DWMLs and PWMLs did not differ between hemispheres, frequency of Fazekas grade 1 DWMLs was lower in ipsilateral hemisphere to either 50-69% or ≥ 70% ICA stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.035 and p = 0.025, respectively).

All inborn patients at Southmead Hospital between January 2012 and March 2014 at ≥36 weeks gestation with a pH <7 or BE >16 on cord or baby's blood within one hour of birth or 10-minute Apgar score ≤5 or requiring intermittent positive pressure ventilation at 10 minutes were eligible for inclusion.	ROC curves were derived for the perinatal clinical and biochemical measures to establish their predictive values for the development of HIE and the area under the curve (AUC) used as the measure of prediction.	We identified 79 eligible babies.

Thus, hypoxia imaging would be a valuable tool for pre-therapeutic assessment of tumor malignancy. However, there is no standard validated technique for clinical application available yet. Therefore, we performed a study in 12 patients with high-grade glioma, where we directly compared the two currently most promising techniques, namely the MR-based relative oxygen extraction fraction (MR-rOEF) and the PET hypoxia marker H-1-(3-[[18] F]-fluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)-2-nitroimidazole ([[18] F]-FMISO). MR-rOEF was determined from separate measurements of T2 , T2 * and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) employing a multi-parametric approach for quantification of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect. With respect to [[18] F]-FMISO-PET, besides the commonly used late uptake between 120 and 130 min ([[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min), we also analyzed the hypoxia specific uptake rate [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , as obtained by pharmacokinetic modeling of dynamic uptake data. Since pharmacokinetic modeling of partially acquired dynamic [[18] F]-FMISO data was sensitive to a low signal-to-noise-ratio, analysis was restricted to high-uptake tumor regions. Individual spatial analyses of deoxygenation and hypoxia-related parameter maps revealed that high MR-rOEF values clustered in (edematous) peritumoral tissue, while areas with high [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min concentrated in and around active tumor with disrupted blood-brain barrier, i.e. contrast enhancement in T1 -weighted MRI. Volume-of-interest-based correlations between MR-rOEF and [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min as well as [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , and voxel-wise analyses in individual patients, yielded limited correlations, supporting the notion that [[18] F]-FMISO uptake, even after 2 h, might still be influenced by perfusion while [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 was severely hampered by noise. According to these results, vascular deoxygenation, as measured by MR-rOEF, and severe tissue hypoxia, as measured by [[18] F]-FMISO, show a poor spatial correspondence.

It is a complex condition that develops over many decades in the human brain. For such apparently intractable diseases, mathematical models can offer an additional means of investigation.

We studied cognitive functioning in four domains at baseline and change over time in fifty-seven cognitively intact individuals from the EMIF-AD 90+ study. Predictors were Aβ status determined by [[18] F]-flutemetamol PET (normal = Aβ - vs. abnormal = Aβ+), cortical thickness in 34 regions and hippocampal volume. Mediation analyses were performed to test whether effects of Aβ on cognitive decline were mediated by atrophy of specific anatomical brain areas.	Subjects had a mean age of 92.7 ± 2.9 years, of whom 19 (33%) were Aβ+. Compared to Aβ-, Aβ+ individuals showed steeper decline on memory (β ± SE = -0.26 ± 0.09), and processing speed (β ± SE = -0.18 ± 0.08) performance over 1.5 years (P < 0.05).

245,2125805,Acta neurochirurgica,Haemodynamic aspects of clinical cerebral angiography. Concurrent two vessel monitoring using transcranial Doppler ultrasound.,"To overcome the technical limitations which have precluded noninvasive Doppler ultrasound in investigation of rapid cerebral haemodynamic responses in two cerebrovascular beds at the same time, we have modified a commercial 2 MHz pulsed Doppler instrument with online spectrum analysis. Two probes are activated intermittently, recording eight averaged Doppler-shifted spectra from each probe sequentially. Concurrent recordings of blood velocity in both middle cerebral arteries were performed during 25 selective iohexol carotid angiography runs in 13 patients with near normal cerebral vasculature. The technique permitted the differentiation between the specific responses confined to the recipient vascular bed, and the general responses occurring in remote brain areas as well. The specific response to iohexol was biphasic; a significant decrease in blood velocity occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, probably due to the high viscocity of iohexol. Between 4 and 12 s. blood velocity was significantly increased, reflecting the cerebrovascular response to hypertonic solutions. The blood velocity on the opposite side increased from less than 4 s through 45 s after iohexol. This concurs with studies using electromagnetic flowmetry, and suggests that these general responses are elicited by anxiety, discomfort and pain. Thus, no general responses were seen during angiography under general anaesthesia. Eight patients investigated during catheter flushing with normal saline showed a biphasic specific response reciprocal to that due to iohexol. A significant blood velocity peak occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, followed by a decrease between 4 and 60 s. The saline injections produced no pain and evoked no significant general response.",,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Acta neurochirurgica</journal><title>Haemodynamic aspects of clinical cerebral angiography.

Both Children With and Without Autism Commonly Align Their Language With That of Their Caregivers.,"Linguistic repetitions in children are conceptualized as negative in children with autism - echolalia, without communicative purpose - and positive in typically developing (TD) children - linguistic alignment involved in shared engagement, common ground and language acquisition. To investigate this apparent contradiction we analyzed spontaneous speech in 67 parent-child dyads from a longitudinal corpus (30 minutes of play activities at 6 visits over 2 years). We included 32 children with autism and 35 linguistically matched TD children (mean age at recruitment 32.76 and 20.27 months). We found a small number of exact repetitions in both groups (roughly 1% of utterances across visits), which increased over time in children with autism and decreased in the TD group. Partial repetitions were much more frequent: children reused caregivers' words at high rates regardless of diagnostic group (24% of utterances at first visit), and this increased in frequency (but not level) over time, faster for TD children (at final visit: 33% for autism, 40% for TD). The same happened for partial repetition of syntax and semantic alignment. However, chance alignment (as measured by surrogate pairs) also increased and findings for developmental changes were reliable only for syntactic and semantic alignment. Children with richer linguistic abilities also displayed a higher tendency to partially re-use their caregivers' language (alignment rates and semantic alignment). This highlights that all children commonly re-used the words, syntax, and topics of their caregivers, albeit with some quantitative differences, and that most repetition was at least potentially productive, with repeated language being re-contextualized and integrated with non-repeated language. The salience of echolalia in ASD might be partially explained by slight differences in frequency, amplified by lower semantic alignment, persistence over time, and expectations of echolalia.

Among the patients studied, 22 had been acutely exposed to CO while 8 were chronically exposed. One month after CO poisoning, 12 of the 22 patients with acute intoxication showed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities: 6 also had neurological sequelae and 6 were asymptomatic. The remaining 10 patients showed neither MRI abnormalities nor neurological sequelae. During the 3-year follow-up, 4 of the patients with both MRI abnormalities and neurological sequelae improved in both clinical features and MRI findings. One of the 6 asymptomatic patients with MRI abnormalities developed a progressive cognitive impairment 2 months after acute intoxication, with a concomitant severe worsening of the MRI lesions. Among the 10 patients with neither MRI abnormalities nor neurological sequelae, only 1 developed neurological sequelae after a clear period of 4 months. In the group of patients who experienced chronic CO intoxication, only 1 presented with a neuropsychiatric syndrome which improved at follow-up. Brain MRI showed white matter lesions which remained unchanged at control scan after 1 year. In conclusion, we observed that some patients with severe CO poisoning and neurological sequelae may fully regain normal functions after approximately 1 year.

The questionnaire contained a scale focusing on fulfillment of adolescent needs, the Children's Depression Inventory, and items on current substance use. The results of t-tests indicated that the higher the adolescent is on the Need scale, the greater the likelihood of engaging in substance use (p < .05). Further, results indicated that cigarette smoking, drinking alcohol, and smoking marijuana are associated with significantly higher scores on the Need scale for both males and females.

253,23149030,Psychiatry research,Predicting dementia development in Parkinson's disease using Bayesian network classifiers.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) has broadly been associated with mild cognitive impairment (PDMCI) and dementia (PDD). Researchers have studied surrogate, neuroanatomic biomarkers provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that may help in the early diagnosis of this condition. In this article, four classification models (naïve Bayes, multivariate filter-based naïve Bayes, filter selective naïve Bayes and support vector machines, SVM) have been applied to evaluate their capacity to discriminate between cognitively intact patients with Parkinson's disease (PDCI), PDMCI and PDD. For this purpose, the MRI studies of 45 subjects (16 PDCI, 15 PDMCI and 14 PDD) were acquired and post-processed with Freesurfer, obtaining 112 variables (volumes of subcortical structures and thickness of cortical parcels) per subject. A multivariate filter-based naïve Bayes model was found to be the best classifier, having the highest cross-validated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

254,33764656,Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,Age differences in broader autism phenotype traits from young adulthood to older adulthood.,"Much of past research has been dedicated to refining the operationalization and correlates of the broader autism phenotype (BAP) and less on how the BAP differs by socio-demographic characteristics, like age-particularly after midlife. This gap is important because other nonclinical trait-like characteristics (e.g., personality) have shown considerable age differences, leading to work assessing the malleability of psychological characteristics and improving outcomes for individuals and their significant others. In the current study, we examined cross-sectional age differences in the BAP in a large sample of adults ranging in age from 18 to 85. We recruited a sample of 2966 adults ranging in age from 18 to 85 (Mage = 36.53, SD = 12.61; 58.9% Female; 1.1% with an ASD diagnosis) recruited from an online survey service. We found that total BAP scores were higher in younger adults and lower among older adults. These differences were particularly true for pragmatic language difficulties, with this component of the BAP showing the most dramatic age differences. Aloofness showed similar negative associations with age, albeit much smaller. Rigidity was not significantly associated with age. The results are consistent with other research showing an abatement of symptoms among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) across early life and theories predicting changes in other psychological characteristics (e.g., personality). The results are discussed in the context of the malleability of ASD and BAP traits across life, the clinical implications of these changes, and the origins and consequences for lifespan differences in BAP. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about how subclinical autistic-like traits among middle-aged and older adults compare to younger adults. We found that these subclinical traits were highest in young adults and lowest in older adults. Knowing how these traits differ by age can provide researchers and clinicians with a sense of how much these traits might change across life, if the traits might be sensitive to interventions, and when in development it might be best to intervene.",age differences| autism spectrum disorders| broader autism phenotype| lifespan development| personality,Remaining,0,0,"<journal>Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research</journal><title>Age differences in broader autism phenotype traits from young adulthood to older adulthood.</title><abstract>Much of past research has been dedicated to refining the operationalization and correlates of the broader autism phenotype (BAP) and less on how the BAP differs by socio-demographic characteristics, like age-particularly after midlife.

Socio-demographic, familial and clinical characteristics were compared in patients with (ADHD + ) and without (ADHD-) comorbid ADHD.	Sixty-one patients (2.2%) met criteria for ADHD. ADHD was associated with a higher number of (hypo)manic symptoms during depression. Mixed depression was more represented in ADHD + patients than in ADHD- using both DSM-5 and experimental criteria. Differences were maintained after removing overlapping symptoms between (hypo)mania and ADHD. ADHD in MDE was also associated with a variety of clinical and course features such as onset before the age of 20, first-degree family history of (hypo)mania, past history of antidepressant-induced (hypo)manic switches, higher number of depressive and affective episodes, atypical depressive features, higher rates of bipolarity specifier, psychiatric comorbidities with eating, anxiety and borderline personality disorders.	The study was primarily designed to address mixed features in ADHD, with slightly reduced sensitivity to the diagnosis of ADHD. Other possible diagnostic biases due to heterogeneity of participating clinicians.	In a sample of major depressive patients, the comorbid diagnosis of current ADHD is associated with bipolar diathesis, mixed features, multiple psychiatric comorbidity and a more unstable course. Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm the possible mediating role of temperamental mood instability and emotional dysregulation in such a complex clinical presentation.</abstract>","{

For stress detection algorithms focused on short-duration time windows, there is potential benefit in including HRV features derived from the detection of smaller peaks within the ECG waveform: the P, Q, S, and T waves. However, the potential drawback of using these small peaks is their smaller magnitude and subsequent susceptibility to noise, making them more difficult to reliably detect. In this work, we demonstrate the potential benefits of including smaller waves within binary stress classification using a pre-existing data set of ECG recordings from 57 participants (aged 18-40) with a self-reported fear of spiders during exposure to videos of spiders. We also present an analysis of the performance of an automated peak detection algorithm and the reliability of detection for each of the smaller parts of the ECG waveform. We compared two models, one with only R peak features and one with small peak features. They were similar in precision, recall, F1, area under ROC curve (AUC), and accuracy, with the greatest differences less than the standard deviations of each metric. There was a significant difference in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which represented the information loss of the model. The inclusion of novel small peak features made the model 4.29×1028 times more probable to minimize the information loss, and the small peak features showed higher regression coefficients than the R peak features, indicating a stronger relationship with acute psychological stress.

The study included 200 hypertensive older males without previous cardiovascular diseases. Clinic blood pressure (BP) was measured using a standard approach. Cerebrovascular health was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging in the following four aspects: Intracranial atherosclerosis as determined by vessel wall imaging; Vascular rarefaction (defined as less discernible vessels on angiography) was evaluated using a custom-developed technique. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) were assessed using arterial spin-labeling imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, respectively.	A total of 189 subjects had MRI scans. The mean age was 64.9 (± 7.2) years. For intracranial atherosclerosis, there was a significant association between uncontrolled hypertension and presence of intracranial plaque. When systolic and diastolic BP were analyzed separately, the association remained significant for both. For vascular rarefaction, uncontrolled hypertension was associated with less discernible vessel branches or shorter vessel length on angiography. Further analysis revealed that this is due to uncontrolled diastolic BP, but not uncontrolled systolic BP. There was an association between uncontrolled hypertension and reduced CBF, which was also mainly driven by uncontrolled diastolic BP. We also found that uncontrolled diastolic BP, but not uncontrolled systolic BP, was associated with increased WMH volume.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Homer1 knockdown on MPP(+) induced neuronal injury in cultured dopamine (DA) neurons. We found that down-regulating Homer1 expression with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly suppressed LDH release, reduced Propidium iodide (PI) or Hoechst staining, increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells and DA uptake, and attenuated apoptotic and necrotic cell death after MPP(+) injury. Homer1 knockdown decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation through inhibition of intracellular calcium overload, but did not affect the endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities. Calcium imaging was used to examine the changes of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]cyt) and Ca(2+) in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ([Ca(2+)]ER), and the results showed that Homer1 siRNA transfection attenuated ER Ca(2+) release up to 120min after MPP(+) injury. Furthermore, decrease of [Ca(2+)]cyt induced by Homer1 knockdown in MPP(+) treated neurons was further enhanced by NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 and AP-5, but not canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channel antagonist SKF-96365. l-type calcium antagonist isradipine but not nimodipine further inhibited intracellular calcium overload after MPP(+) insult in Homer1 down-regulated neurons. These results suggest that Homer1 knockdown has protective effects against neuronal injury in in vitro PD model by reducing calcium overload mediated ROS generation, and this protection may be dependent at least in part on the regulatory effects on the function of calcium channels in both plasma membrane and ER.",Calcium channel| Endoplasmic reticulum| Homer| Parkinson's disease,In-vitro-study,8,0,"<journal>Cellular signalling</journal><title>Homer1 knockdown protects dopamine neurons through regulating calcium homeostasis in an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease</title><abstract>Homer1 protein is an important scaffold protein at postsynaptic density and has been demonstrated to play a central role in calcium signaling in the central nervous system.

Primary oligodendrocyte pro-genitor cells (OPCs) were separated from rats and differentiated to OLs. Immunofluorescent labeling showed positive expression of A2B5 in OPCs and Olig2 in OLs, suggesting the successful separation of OPCs and OLs. Three Fyn siRNAs (si-Fyn) and Fyn siRNA negative control (NC) were transfected into OLs. Western blot showed that among three si-Fyn groups, si-Fyn3 caused the lowest Fyn expression, so si-Fyn3 was chosen for following experiment. Cells were divided into four groups: Control, Model, NC and si-Fyn. In the Model group, cells were cultured in Mg-free extracellular fluid for 3 h. The morphology of control cells was normal. However, the migration of neurons, the aggregation of cell bodies and the 'grid-like' changes of neural networks were observed in the model cells. OLs apoptosis in various groups was assessed by flow cytometry. Expression of Fyn, ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in OLs of various groups was evaluated by western blot. Compared with the Control group, the apoptotic rates, the Fyn expression and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 ratio in the Model and NC groups increased significantly (p < .05). However, the apoptotic rate, the Fyn expression and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 ratio in the si-Fyn group were remarkably smaller than those in the Model group (p < .05).

Three Fyn siRNAs (si-Fyn) and Fyn siRNA negative control (NC) were transfected into OLs.

Here, we examined signaling events in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and searched for therapeutic agents that could overcome TRAIL resistance in glioma cells. TRAIL induced apoptosis through death receptor 5 (DR5) and was mediated by caspase-8-initiated extrinsic and intrinsic mitochondrial pathways in sensitive glioma cell lines. TRAIL also triggered apoptosis in resistant glioma cell lines through the same pathways, but only if the cells were pretreated with chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin, camptothecin and etoposide. Previous studies suggested that this was due to an increase in DR5 expression in wild-type TP53 cells, but this mechanism did not account for cells with mutant TP53. Here, we show that a more general effect of these agents is to downregulate caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP(S) (the short form of cellular Fas-associated death domain-fike interleukin-1-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein) and up-regulate Bak, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, independently of cell's TP53 status.

270,34477946,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,Selective induction of rapid cytotoxic effect in glioblastoma cells by oscillating magnetic fields,"PURPOSE: The mechanisms underlying anticancer effects of electromagnetic fields are poorly understood. An alternating electric field-generating therapeutic device called Optune™ device has been approved for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). We have developed a new device that generates oscillating magnetic fields (OMF) by rapid rotation of strong permanent magnets in specially designed patterns of frequency and timing and have used it to treat an end-stage recurrent GBM patient under an expanded access/compassionate use treatment protocol. Here, we ask whether OMF causes selective cytotoxic effects in GBM and whether it is through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). METHODS: We stimulated patient derived GBM cells, lung cancer cells, normal human cortical neurons, astrocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells using OMF generators (oncoscillators) of our Oncomagnetic Device and compared the results to those obtained under unstimulated or sham-stimulated control conditions. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy was used to assess cell morphology, viability, and ROS production mechanisms. RESULTS: We find that OMF induces highly selective cell death of patient derived GBM cells associated with activation of caspase 3, while leaving normal tissue cells undamaged. The cytotoxic effect of OMF is also seen in pulmonary cancer cells. The underlying mechanism is a marked increase in ROS in the mitochondria, possibly in part through perturbation of the electron flow in the respiratory chain. CONCLUSION: Rotating magnetic fields produced by a new noninvasive device selectively kill cultured human glioblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer cells by raising intracellular reactive oxygen species, but not normal human tissue cells.",Brain tumor| Cell culture| Noninvasive treatment| Oncomagnetic device| Reactive oxygen species,In-vitro-study,8,0,"<journal>Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology</journal><title>Selective induction of rapid cytotoxic effect in glioblastoma cells by oscillating magnetic fields</title><abstract>PURPOSE: The mechanisms underlying anticancer effects of electromagnetic fields are poorly understood.

Analysis of docked conformations revealed monoamine oxidase-B as most promising, while N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor was recognized as the least favorable target for catechins. Benzopyran skeleton with a phenyl group substituted at the 2-position and a hydroxyl (or ester) function at the 3-position has been identified as common structural requirements at majority of the targets.

We evaluated the effects of sera from patients with MMN, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and control subjects on the expression of tight junction proteins and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and on the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) in human peripheral nerve microvascular endothelial cells (PnMECs).	The sera from patients with MMN decreased the claudin-5 protein expression and the TEER in PnMECs. However, this effect was reversed after application of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) neutralising antibody. The VEGF secreted by PnMECs was significantly increased after exposure to the sera from patients with MMN. The sera from patients with MMN also increased the VCAM-1 protein expression by upregulating the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signalling. The immunoglobulin G purified from MMN sera decreased the expression of claudin-5 and increased the VCAM-1 expression in PnMECs.	The sera from MMN patients may disrupt the BNB function via the autocrine secretion of VEGF in PnMECs, or the exposure to autoantibodies against PnMECs that are contained in the MMN sera. Autoantibodies against PnMECs in MMN sera may activate the BNB by upregulating the VCAM-1 expression, thereby allowing for the entry of a large number of circulating inflammatory cells into the peripheral nervous system.</abstract>","{

275,22975132,Brain research,Expression of CD200 in alternative activation of microglia following an excitotoxic lesion in the mouse hippocampus,"CD200 is a glycoprotein that is expressed on the surfaces of neurons and other cells. It interacts with its receptor, CD200R, which is expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage, including microglia. The interaction of CD200 with its receptor plays a significant role in maintaining microglia in a quiescent state; thus, a decrease in CD200 expression in the brain is associated with evidence of microglial activation. However, their roles in pathological progression remain unclear. We examined the expression of CD200 in kainic acid (KA)-induced neurodegeneration of the mouse hippocampus. Our quantitative analysis revealed that CD200 was constitutively expressed in the normal brain and transiently upregulated by KA treatment. At the cellular level, CD200 was expressed in neurons in control, and was upregulated primarily in the microglia of KA-treated mouse hippocampi. We examined the contribution of CD200 to both the classical and alternative activation of microglia in vitro using an adult microglia culture, which was exposed to interleukin-4 (IL-4) with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CD200 expression was increased after exposure to IL-4, but not to LPS. These in vivo experiments demonstrated that CD200 was transiently expressed in microglia in a process mediated by the inflammatory response. Based on CD200R expression in microglia, it suggests that microglia is maintained in an activated state with autocrine signaling by interactions between microglial CD200 and its CD200R. Moreover, we suggest that CD200 may be expressed in the alternative activation of microglia and play a beneficial role in neuroinflammation.",,In-vitro-study,8,0,"<journal>Brain research</journal><title>Expression of CD200 in alternative activation of microglia following an excitotoxic lesion in the mouse hippocampus</title><abstract>CD200 is a glycoprotein that is expressed on the surfaces of neurons and other cells.

To directly examine the Rab5-mediated endosomal trafficking in ALS2(-/-) neurons, we introduced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Rab5 into cultured hippocampal neurons to monitor the morphology and motility of Rab5-associated early endosomes. Here we report that Rab5-mediated endocytosis was severely altered in ALS2(-/-) neurons. Excessive accumulation of Rab5-positive vesicles was observed in ALS2(-/-) neurons, which correlated with a significant reduction in endosomal motility and augmentation in endosomal conversion to lysosomes. Consequently, a significant increase in endosome/lysosome-dependent degradation of internalized glutamate receptors was observed in ALS2(-/-) neurons. These phenotypes closely resembled the endosomal trafficking abnormalities induced by a constitutively active form of Rab5 in wild-type neurons.

Activated microglia are widely believed to be the principal source of inflammation-induced neuronal degeneration in these disorders. To investigate the neurotoxic potential of human astrocytes, we exposed them and human astrocytic U-373 MG cells to a variety of inflammatory stimulants. We then assessed the effects of their supernatants on human SH-SY5 cells. When astrocytes and U-373 MG cells were stimulated with interferon (IFN)-gamma (150U/ml), their supernatants significantly reduced SH-SY5Y cell viability. Other powerful inflammatory stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide (0.5mug/ml), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (10ng/ml) and interleukin-1beta (10ng/ml), alone or in combination, were without effect. These combinations were also unable to enhance the IFN-gamma effect. The induced cytotoxicities were reversed by JAK inhibitor I, a potent and specific inhibitor of JAKs. This result indicates that the neurotoxic effect was proceeding through the IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR)-JAK-STAT intracellular pathway. To establish that the IFNGR is expressed on both cultured astrocytes and U-373 MG cells, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA extracts to identify a specific IFNGR product. We showed the protein product on these cultured cells by immunocytochemistry using an antibody to IFNGR. Finally, using human postmortem material, we showed sharp upregulation of the IFNGR on activated astrocytes in affected areas in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis.

The individual features of the cells sensitivity of primary cultures in respect to protocol-approved chemotherapy drugs and changes in the Interleukin-6 (Il-6) level in the culture medium after the application of chemotherapy were established. The initial level of Il-6 exceeded 600.0 pg/ml in the cultural medium with histologically verified pilomyxoid astrocytoma cells, and ranged from 100.0 to 200.0 pg/ml in the medium at cultivation of ganglioneuroblastoma and pilocytic astrocytoma. A decrease in the Il-6 level in the medium culture of primary tumors cells was observed after the application of chemotherapeutic agents on the cells of pilomyxoid astrocytoma, astrocytomas, and pilocytic desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma. The production of Il-6 increased after application of cytostatic drugs on the cells of oligoastrocytomas. A decrease in Il-6 level after application of Cisplatin and Methotrexate and a 5-10 fold increase in the level of Il-6 after application of Etoposide, Carboplatin, Cytarabine, and Gemcitabine were registered in the medium with ganglioneuroblastoma. To improve the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic agents, the combined application of cytostatics with heterocyclic compounds was carried out. A computer modeling of ligand-protein complexes of carbamide using the Dock 6.4 and USF Chimera program packages was performed with molecular mechanics method. Special attention was drawn to the ability of several isoxazole heterocycles and isothiazolyl to inhibit the tyrosine kinase. It was proved in vitro that the joint application of chemotherapeutic agents and heterocyclic compounds could reduce the concentration of the cytostatic factor by 10 or more times, having maintained the maximum cytotoxic effect.

Therefore, we have examined a brain nerve cell line that is spontaneously neuritogenic for possible expression of AD-type tau epitopes. The neuritogenic rat brain cell line B103 was found to constitutively produce two-AD related epitopes of tau, detected by cellular immunofluorescence studies with the PHF-1 and Alz-50 monoclonal antibodies. Biochemical studies showed that the antibodies bound to proteins within the molecular, weight range expected for phosphorylated tau isoforms. Further verification was established by use of tau antisense oligomers, which eliminated cellular immunofluorescence due to the AD-related monoclonals and polyclonal anti-tau but did not eliminate fluorescence due to anti-tubulin.

AD-type tau phosphoepitopes, detected by various monoclonal antibodies, are absent from normal adult neurons, but recent studies have shown that their expression may contribute to neuritogenesis and axon differentiation in the developing nervous system. Therefore, we have examined a brain nerve cell line that is spontaneously neuritogenic for possible expression of AD-type tau epitopes. The neuritogenic rat brain cell line B103 was found to constitutively produce two-AD related epitopes of tau, detected by cellular immunofluorescence studies with the PHF-1 and Alz-50 monoclonal antibodies. Biochemical studies showed that the antibodies bound to proteins within the molecular, weight range expected for phosphorylated tau isoforms. Further verification was established by use of tau antisense oligomers, which eliminated cellular immunofluorescence due to the AD-related monoclonals and polyclonal anti-tau but did not eliminate fluorescence due to anti-tubulin. Cells treated with tau antisense were not neurite-free. Neurites that remained, however, were abnormal, generally short and wavy in appearance. Cellular distribution of the tau epitopes was found to be particularly interesting. Alz-50 recognized only cytoplasmic tau whereas PHF-1 recognized nuclear tau as well as cytoplasmic. Thus, the two epitopes, are morphologically segregated within the cell. Because subcellular segregation of tau is compromised in Alzheimer's disease, mechanisms that segregate AD-type phosphotau epitopes in B103 cells may have relevance to this neurodegenerative disorder.</abstract>","{

281,19222703,Journal of neurochemistry,In vitro glutaminase regulation and mechanisms of glutamate generation in HIV-1-infected macrophage.,"Mononuclear phagocyte (MP, macrophages and microglia) dysfunction plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD) through the production and release of soluble neurotoxic factors including glutamate. Glutamate production is greatly increased following HIV-1 infection of cultured MP, a process dependent upon the glutamate-generating enzyme glutaminase. Glutaminase inhibition was previously found to significantly decrease macrophage-mediated neurotoxicity. Potential mechanisms of glutaminase-mediated excitotoxicity including enzyme up-regulation, increased enzyme activity and glutaminase localization were investigated in this report. RNA and protein analysis of HIV-infected human primary macrophage revealed up-regulation of the glutaminase isoform GAC, yet identified no changes in the kidney-type glutaminase isoform over the course of infection. Glutaminase is a mitochondrial protein, but was found to be released into the cytosol and extracellular space following infection. This released enzyme is capable of rapidly converting the abundant extracellular amino acid glutamine into excitotoxic levels of glutamate in an energetically favorable process.

The latter association is intensively disputed, as L-BMAA concentrations required for toxic effects exceed those assumed to occur via food. The question thus was raised whether L-BMAA leads to neurodegeneration at nonexcitotoxic conditions. Using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, L-BMAA-transport, incorporation into proteins, and subsequent impairment of cellular protein homeostasis were investigated. Binding of L-BMAA to intracellular proteins, but no clear protein incorporation was detected in response to (14)C-L-BMAA exposures. Nevertheless, low L-BMAA concentrations (≥ 0.1mM, 48 h) increased protein ubiquitination, 20S proteasomal and caspase 12 activity, expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker CHOP, and enhanced phosphorylation of elf2α in SH-SY5Y cells. In contrast, high L-BMAA concentrations (≥ 1mM, 48 h) increased reactive oxygen species and protein oxidization, which were partially ameliorated by coincubation with vitamin E. L-BMAA-mediated cytotoxicity was observable 48 h following ≥ 2mM L-BMAA treatment. Consequently, the data presented here suggest that low L-BMAA concentrations result in a dysregulation of the cellular protein homeostasis with ensuing ER stress that is independent from high-concentration effects such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress.

Cathepsin B activity and protein content levels were higher in glioblastoma cell lines than in anaplastic astrocytoma or low-grade glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B transcripts were overexpressed in glioblastoma cell lines relative to their expression in anaplastic astrocytoma and low-grade glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B promoter activity and amount of SP-1 complexes were much higher in glioblastoma cell lines than in anaplastic astrocytoma or low-grade glioma cell lines.

288,34193113,BMC psychiatry,Low intensity technology-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis.,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for people suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and technology-based CBT applications are an emerging treatment option for people with OCD. These applications involve treatment protocols with automated content delivery and relatively low clinical contact. Whilst such CBT applications are promising, however, further investigation is needed to establish the efficacy of this treatment approach for individuals with OCD. The aim of the present study was to review the efficacy of technology-delivered CBT with minimal clinician support for OCD using a meta-analytic approach.	Randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified through PsycINFO, Medline and Scopus resulting in 18 eligible studies (n = 1707). Control conditions comprised both passive (namely no treatment, other treatments and waitlist controls) and active. Measurement of OCD symptoms improvement was the outcome in each study.	Participants in the technology-delivered CBT group scored lower on Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) (g = - 0.59, 95% CI = [- 0.99, - 0.18], p = 0.01), Y-BOCS and Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS) combined (g = - 0.55, 95% CI = [- 0.87, - 0.24], p = 0.003) and Obsessive-Compulsive-Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) (g = - 0.36, 95% CI = [- 0.62, - 0.09], p = 0.02) at post-treatment than passive control groups. There were no significant findings when compared to controls with other treatments.

We examined seven major journals in psychiatry from 1980 through 1990, inclusive, and selected those investigations of imipramine, trazodone, bupropion, and fluoxetine that met our minimal criteria for interpretability. These criteria included: (1) the presence of a placebo control, (2) double-blind status, (3) the use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression as a dependent variable measure, (4) the use of nongeriatric adults with a diagnosis of major depression by DSM or RDC standards, and (5) the presence of reported means and standard deviations in the investigation, or sufficient data that allowed such to be computed. Each study of four antidepressants was analyzed for an effect size of the drug investigated. The effect size allows for a determination of the efficacy of a particular drug as compared with placebo, measured in standard deviation units.	The data indicated that all four agents are effective as compared with placebo. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the newer heterocyclic agents are less effective than imipramine, as an ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference between the effect sizes of the four antidepressants.

292,35968702,Stroke,Lithium and Stroke Recovery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Stroke Models in Rodents and Human Data,"BACKGROUND: Lithium has neuroprotective effects in animal models of stroke, but benefits in humans remain uncertain. This article aims to systematically review the available evidence of the neuroprotective and regenerative effects of lithium in animal models of stroke, as well as in observational and trial stroke studies in humans. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO for preclinical and clinical studies published between January 2000 and September 2021. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted from observational studies. RESULTS: From 1625 retrieved studies, 42 were included in the systematic review. Of those, we identified 36 rodent models of stroke using preinsult or postinsult treatment with lithium, and 6 studies were conducted in human samples, of which 4 could be meta-analyzed. The review of animal models was stratified according to the type of stroke and outcomes. Human data were subdivided into observational and intervention studies. Treatment of rodents with lithium was associated with smaller stroke volumes, decreased apoptosis, and improved poststroke function. In humans, exposure to lithium was associated with a lower risk of stroke among adults with bipolar disorder in 2 of 4 studies. Two small trials showed equivocal clinical benefits of lithium poststroke. CONCLUSIONS: Animal models of stroke show consistent biological and functional evidence of benefits associated with lithium treatment, whereas human evidence remains sparse and inconclusive.

RESULTS: We included 91 studies with a total of 34,362 stroke cases. The one-month pooled stroke case-fatality rate was 24.1% [95% CI: 21.5-27.0] and 33.2% [95% CI: 23.6-44.5] at one year. At three and five years, the case-fatality rates were respectively 40.1% [95% CI: 20.8-63.0] and 39.4% [95% CI: 14.3-71.5] with high heterogeneity. Hemorrhagic stroke was associated with a higher risk of mortality at one month, but ischemic stroke increased the risk of mortality over six months. Diabetes was associated with poor prognosis at 6 and 12 months with odds ratios of 1.64 [95% CI: 1.22-2.20] and 1.85 [1.25-2.75], respectively. CONCLUSION: The stroke case fatality over one month was very high, compared to case fatalities reported in Western countries and can be explained by a weak healthcare systems and vascular risk factors.</abstract>","{

295,37564014,The International journal of eating disorders,An intervention mapping adaptation framework to develop a self-help intervention for athletes with eating disorder symptoms.,"This research forum describes the use of the intervention mapping for adaptation (IMA) framework to develop and evaluate a novel intervention for athletes with mild eating disorder (ED) symptoms.	The six IMA steps were followed. In step 1 (needs assessment), we conducted a systematic review of athlete ED interventions and held interviews/focus groups with athletes and sports professionals to inform intervention format and delivery. In step 2 (intervention search), needs assessment information guided the search for an evidence-based intervention suitable for adaptation to athletes. In steps 3 and 4 (intervention development), the identified intervention was adapted and feedback sought from athletes and sport professionals. In steps 5 and 6 (implementation and evaluation), a feasibility study was conducted with athletes (n = 35; females: n = 27; Mage  = 27.1).	The review highlighted poor evidence for the acceptability and relative efficacy of existing interventions, which were all delivered face-to-face in groups. Interview/focus group data suggested a need for more accessible intervention formats (e.g., self-help). One non-athlete self-help intervention was determined suitable for adaptation to athletes, and adaptations were made. Initial feedback suggested the adapted intervention was relevant within sport settings. The feasibility study revealed that the intervention (MOPED-A: Motivational and Psycho-Educational Self-Help Programme for Athletes with Mild Eating Disorder Symptoms) can be feasibly implemented, is acceptable to athletes and shows potential for reducing ED symptoms.	IMA is a useful framework for developing participant-centered and evidence-based interventions. The findings and approach taken provide a framework for other researchers and clinicians in developing similar interventions in the ED domain.	The novel self-help intervention described in this article was developed using intervention mapping and provides promise as a tool for reducing eating disorder symptoms in athletes.

297,12917950,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Memantine for dementia,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease, vascular and mixed dementia are the three commonest forms of dementia affecting older people. There is evidence that the excitatory activity of L-glutamate plays a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and in the damage from an ischaemic stroke. A low affinity antagonist to N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type receptors, such as memantine, may prevent excitatory amino acid neurotoxicity without interfering with the physiological actions of glutamate required for memory and learning. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of memantine for people with Alzheimer's disease, or vascular or mixed dementia. SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 15 April 2003 using the terms: memantin*, D-145, DMAA, DRG-0267. All major health care databases and trial databases within the scope of the group are searched regularly to keep this Register up to date. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, randomized and unconfounded trials in which memantine was administered to people with dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted, pooled where possible, and weighted mean differences, standardized mean differences or odds ratios were estimated. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and observed cases (OC) analyses are reported, where data were available. MAIN RESULTS: Effect of memantine in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease: analysis of the change from baseline at 28 weeks gave statistically significant results in favour of memantine for 20 mg/day on cognition (MD: 6.1. 95% CI 2.99 to 9.21, P=0.0001) activities of daily living (MD 2.10, 95% CI 0.46 to 3.74, p=0.01) and in the global clinical impression of change measured by the CIBIC-Plus at 28 weeks (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.02, p=0.04), in all cases the analysis was the ITT-LOCF population (Reisberg 2000). There were no significant differences between memantine and placebo for the number of drop-outs and total number of adverse effects, but a significant difference in favour of memantine for the number who suffer agitation. Effect of memantine in patients with mild to moderate vascular dementia: analysis of the change from baseline at 28 weeks gave statistically significant results in favour of memantine ( 20 mg/day ) for cognition (MD -2.19, 95% CI -3.16 to -1.21, P<0.0001) but there was no benefit for the clinical impression of change, or for global measures of dementia (MMM300, and MMM500). There were no significant differences between memantine and placebo for the number of drop-outs and total number of adverse effects, but a significant difference in favour of memantine for the number who suffer agitation. Effect of memantine in patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia at 12 weeks: there was no statistically significant difference between memantine (10 mg/day) and placebo in activities of daily living. There was a benefit in favour of memantine (10 mg/day) compared with placebo at 12 weeks, for the numbers improved in terms of clinical impression of change (60/82 compared with 38/84 - OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.72 to 6.33, P=0.0003) (Winblad 1999). Effect of memantine in patients with vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease and dementia of non-specified type at 6 weeks: there were beneficial effects on cognition (Ditzler 1991), activities of daily living (Ditzler 1991, Pantev 1993), behaviour (Pantev 1993) and global scales (Gortelmeyer 1992; Pantev 1993; Ditzler 1991) and in global impression of change (Gortelmeyer 1992; Ditzler 1991). There were no significant differences between memantine and placebo for the number of drop-outs and total number of adverse effects, but a significant difference in favour of placebo for the number who suffer restlessness. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is a beneficial effect of memantine (20 mg/day) for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease on cognition and functional decline but not in the clinical impression of change. Patifor patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease on cognition and functional decline but not in the clinical impression of change. Patients with mild to moderate vascular dementia receiving memantine 20 mg/day had less cognitive deterioration at 28 weeks but again this effect was not clinically discernible. There is a possible beneficial effect on cognition, function and global scales for memantine at 6 weeks in mixed populations. The drug is well tolerated and the incidence of adverse effects is low.

There was a benefit in favour of memantine (10 mg/day) compared with placebo at 12 weeks, for the numbers improved in terms of clinical impression of change (60/82 compared with 38/84 - OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.72 to 6.33, P=0.0003) (Winblad 1999). Effect of memantine in patients with vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease and dementia of non-specified type at 6 weeks: there were beneficial effects on cognition (Ditzler 1991), activities of daily living (Ditzler 1991, Pantev 1993), behaviour (Pantev 1993) and global scales (Gortelmeyer 1992; Pantev 1993; Ditzler 1991) and in global impression of change (Gortelmeyer 1992; Ditzler 1991). There were no significant differences between memantine and placebo for the number of drop-outs and total number of adverse effects, but a significant difference in favour of placebo for the number who suffer restlessness. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is a beneficial effect of memantine (20 mg/day) for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease on cognition and functional decline but not in the clinical impression of change. Patifor patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer disease on cognition and functional decline but not in the clinical impression of change. Patients with mild to moderate vascular dementia receiving memantine 20 mg/day had less cognitive deterioration at 28 weeks but again this effect was not clinically discernible. There is a possible beneficial effect on cognition, function and global scales for memantine at 6 weeks in mixed populations. The drug is well tolerated and the incidence of adverse effects is low. More studies are needed.</abstract>","<title>Memantine for dementia</title><abstract>BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease, vascular and mixed dementia are the three commonest forms of dementia affecting older people. There is evidence that the excitatory activity of L-glutamate plays a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and in the damage from an ischaemic stroke. A low affinity antagonist to N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type receptors, such as memantine, may prevent excitatory amino acid neurotoxicity without interfering with the physiological actions of glutamate required for memory and learning. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of memantine for people with Alzheimer's disease, or vascular or mixed dementia. SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 15 April 2003 using the terms: memantin*, D-145, DMAA, DRG-0267. All major health care databases and trial databases within the scope of the group are searched regularly to keep this Register up to date. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, randomized and unconfounded trials in which memantine was administered to people with dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted, pooled where possible, and weighted mean differences, standardized mean differences or odds ratios were estimated. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and observed cases (OC) analyses are reported, where data were available. MAIN RESULTS: Effect of memantine in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease: analysis of the change from baseline at 28 weeks gave statistically significant results in favour of memantine for 20 mg/day on cognition (MD: 6.1. 95% CI 2.99 to 9.21, P=0.0001) activities of daily living (MD 2.10, 95% CI 0.46 to 3.74, p=0.01) and in the global clinical impression of change measured by the CIBIC-Plus at 28 weeks (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.02, p=0.04), in all cases the analysis was the ITT-LOCF population (Reisberg 2000). There were no significant differences between memantine and placebo for the number of drop-outs and total number of adverse effects, but a significant difference in favour of memantine for the number who suffer agitation. Effect of memantine in patients with mild to moderate vascular dementia: analysis of the change from baseline at 28 weeks gave statistically significant results in favour of memantine ( 20 mg/day ) for cognition (MD -2.19, 95% CI -3.16 to -1.21, P<0.0001) but there was no benefit for the clinical impression of change, or for global measures of dementia (MMM300, and MMM500). There were no significant differences between memantine and placebo for the number of drop-outs and total number of adverse effects, but a significant difference in favour of memantine for the number who suffer agitation. Effect of memantine in patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia at 12 weeks: there was no statistically significant difference between memantine (10 mg/day) and placebo in activities of daily living. There was a benefit in favour of memantine (10 mg/day) compared with placebo at 12 weeks, for the numbers improved in terms of clinical impression of change (60/82 compared with 38/84 - OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.72 to 6.33, P=0.0003) (Winblad 1999).

298,32047067,Neurology,Biological subtypes of Alzheimer disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that distinct subtypes of Alzheimer disease (AD) exist and underlie the heterogeneity within AD, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on AD subtype studies based on postmortem and neuroimaging data. METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were consulted until July 2019. RESULTS: Neuropathology and neuroimaging studies have consistently identified 3 subtypes of AD based on the distribution of tau-related pathology and regional brain atrophy: typical, limbic-predominant, and hippocampal-sparing AD. A fourth subtype, minimal atrophy AD, has been identified in several neuroimaging studies. Typical AD displays tau-related pathology and atrophy both in hippocampus and association cortex and has a pooled frequency of 55%. Limbic-predominant, hippocampal-sparing, and minimal atrophy AD had a pooled frequency of 21%, 17%, and 15%, respectively. Between-subtype differences were found in age at onset, age at assessment, sex distribution, years of education, global cognitive status, disease duration, APOE ε4 genotype, and CSF biomarker levels. CONCLUSION: We identified 2 core dimensions of heterogeneity: typicality and severity. We propose that these 2 dimensions determine individuals' belonging to one of the AD subtypes based on the combination of protective factors, risk factors, and concomitant non-AD brain pathologies. This model is envisioned to aid with framing hypotheses, study design, interpretation of results, and understanding mechanisms in future subtype studies. Our model can be used along the A/T/N classification scheme for AD biomarkers.

300,34569865,International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,Predicting post-stroke cognitive impairment using acute CT neuroimaging: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Identifying whether acute stroke patients are at risk of cognitive decline could improve prognostic discussions and management. Structural computed tomography neuroimaging is routine in acute stroke, and may identify those at risk of post-stroke dementia or post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). AIM: To systematically review the literature to identify which stroke or pre-stroke features on brain computed tomography scans, performed at the time of stroke, are associated with post-stroke dementia or PSCI. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: We searched electronic databases to December 2020. We included studies reporting acute stroke brain computed tomography, and later diagnosis of a cognitive syndrome. We created summary estimates of size of unadjusted association between computed tomography features and cognition. Of 9536 citations, 28 studies (41 papers) were eligible (N = 7078, mean age 59.8-78.6 years). Cognitive outcomes were post-stroke dementia (10 studies), PSCI (17 studies), and one study analyzed both. Fifteen studies (N = 2952) reported data suitable for meta-analyses. White matter lesions (WML) (six studies, N = 1054, OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.25-4.84), cerebral atrophy (four studies, N = 558, OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.21-6.51), and pre-existing stroke lesions (three studies, N = 352, OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.06-5.32) were associated with post-stroke dementia. WML (four studies, N = 473, OR = 3.46, 95% CI = 2.17-5.52) were associated with PSCI. Other computed tomography features were either not associated with cognitive outcome, or there were insufficient data. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment following stroke is of great concern to patients and carers.

RESULTS: A total of 4315 articles were screened. Sixteen articles were eligible for this review and 11 randomized controlled studies were included in the meta-analysis. Light therapy had a significant effect on reducing the number of awakenings in sleep (n = 4; 95% CI = -.56, -.05; I(2) = 0%; SMD = -.31) but was not significant in reducing the wake after sleep onset (n = 3; 95% CI = -.14, .59; I(2) = 0%; SMD = .23), agitation (n = 4; 95% CI = -1.02, .45; I(2) = 87%; SMD = -.28) and depression (n = 6; 95% CI = -.80, .40, I(2) = 85%; SMD = -.20). CONCLUSION: Light therapy appeared to be more effective in terms of alleviating sleep disturbances, rather than reducing agitation and depression, but its long-term effects remain unclear.</abstract>","{

303,25740785,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the detection of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a progressive global cognitive impairment syndrome. In 2010, more than 35 million people worldwide were estimated to be living with dementia. Some people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to dementia but others remain stable or recover full function. There is great interest in finding good predictors of dementia in people with MCI. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the best-known and the most often used short screening tool for providing an overall measure of cognitive impairment in clinical, research and community settings. OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the MMSE at various thresholds for detecting individuals with baseline MCI who would clinically convert to dementia in general, Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia at follow-up. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Specialized Register of diagnostic and intervention studies (inception to May 2014); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to May 2014); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to May 2014); BIOSIS (Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); Web of Science Core Collection, including the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) (inception to May 2014); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (inception to May 2014), and LILACS (BIREME) (1982 to May 2014). We also searched specialized sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews, most recently in May 2014: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven, www.mediondatabase.nl), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, via the Cochrane Library), HTA Database (Health Technology Assessment Database, via the Cochrane Library), and ARIF (University of Birmingham, UK, www.arif.bham.ac.uk). No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used as a method to restrict the search overall so as to maximize sensitivity. We also checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews, tracked citations in Scopus and Science Citation Index, used searches of known relevant studies in PubMed to track related articles, and contacted research groups conducting work on MMSE for dementia diagnosis to try to locate possibly relevant but unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered longitudinal studies in which results of the MMSE administered to MCI participants at baseline were obtained and the reference standard was obtained by follow-up over time. We included participants recruited and clinically classified as individuals with MCI under Petersen and revised Petersen criteria, Matthews criteria, or a Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5. We used acceptable and commonly used reference standards for dementia in general, Alzheimer's dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. We assessed the identified full papers for eligibility and extracted data to create two by two tables for dementia in general and other dementias. Two authors independently performed quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Due to high heterogeneity and scarcity of data, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. MAIN RESULTS: In this review, we included 11 heterogeneous studies with a total number of 1569 MCI patients followed for conversion to dementia. Four studies assessed the role of baseline scores of the MMSE in conversion from MCI to all-cause dementia and eight studies assessed this test in conversion from MCI to Alzheimer´s disease dementia. Only one study provided information about the MMSE and conversion from MCI to vascular dementia. For conversion from MCI to dementia in general, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 23% to 76% and specificities from 40% to 94%. In relationship to conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia, the accuracy of baseline MMSE scores ranged from sensitivities of 27% to 89% and specificities from 32% to 90%. Only one study provided information about conversion from MCI to vascular dementia, presenting a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 80% with an incidence of vascular dementia of 6.2%. Although we had planned to explore possible sources of heterogeneity, this was not undertaken due to the scarcity of studies included in our analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review did not find evidence supporting a substantial role of MMSE as a stand-alone single-administration test in the identification of MCI patients who could develop dementia. Clinicians could prefer to request additional and extensive tests to be sure about the management of these patients. An important aspect to assess in future updates is if conversion to dementia from MCI stages could be predicted better by MMSE changes over time instead of single measurements. It is also important to assess if a set of tests, rather than an isolated one, may be more successful in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0,"<journal>The Cochrane database of systematic reviews</journal><title>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the detection of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)</title><abstract>BACKGROUND: Dementia is a progressive global cognitive impairment syndrome.

Interventions to support smoking cessation may differ in effectiveness in this population from Western populations usually studied. This review assessed evidence of effectiveness of clinical smoking interventions in Arab smokers. METHODS: A systematic search for comparative trials evaluating tobacco cessation interventions in Arab populations was conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyschINFO, CINHAL and Web of Science databases. Behavioural, pharmacological and combined interventions were included. Reference lists of included studies were hand searched. The outcome measure was self- reported tobacco abstinence at the final follow-up, with biochemical verification where available. Assessment of evidence for effectiveness was undertaken using Bayes Factors. RESULTS: A total of 659 titles and abstracts were identified. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Four of these were randomized controlled trials and one was a non-randomized comparative trial. Differences between study features precluded meaningful aggregation for a meta-analysis. The four randomized trials all yielded Bayes Factors <1, suggesting no effect of the intervention compared with the control condition. The non-randomized trial, conducted in tuberculosis clinics in Sudan, yielded an extremely high Bayes Factor (>1000), supporting the hypothesis of effectiveness; however, the study was judged to have a high risk of bias.

306,32967293,Genes,Unveiling Sex-Based Differences in the Effects of Alcohol Abuse: A Comprehensive Functional Meta-Analysis of Transcriptomic Studies.,"The abuse of alcohol, one of the most popular psychoactive substances, can cause several pathological and psychological consequences, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). An impaired ability to stop or control alcohol intake despite adverse health or social consequences characterize AUD. While AUDs predominantly occur in men, growing evidence suggests the existence of distinct cognitive and biological consequences of alcohol dependence in women. The molecular and physiological mechanisms participating in these differential effects remain unknown. Transcriptomic technology permits the detection of the biological mechanisms responsible for such sex-based differences, which supports the subsequent development of novel personalized therapeutics to treat AUD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of transcriptomics studies regarding alcohol dependence in humans with representation from both sexes. For each study, we processed and analyzed transcriptomic data to obtain a functional profile of pathways and biological functions and then integrated the resulting data by meta-analysis to characterize any sex-based transcriptomic differences associated with AUD. Global results of the transcriptomic analysis revealed the association of decreased tissue regeneration, embryo malformations, altered intracellular transport, and increased rate of RNA and protein replacement with female AUD patients. Meanwhile, our analysis indicated that increased inflammatory response and blood pressure and a reduction in DNA repair capabilities are associated with male AUD patients.

We assessed study quality and extracted data on study design, patient characteristics, and outcomes. After screening 2292 citations, 43 articles met our inclusion criteria (61 unique cohorts; n>11,374 fistulas). Median complication rates per 1000 patient days were as follows: 0.04 aneurysms (14 unique cohorts; n=1827 fistulas), 0.11 infections (16 cohorts; n>6439 fistulas), 0.05 steal events (15 cohorts; n>2543 fistulas), 0.24 thrombotic events (26 cohorts; n=4232 fistulas), and 0.03 venous hypertensive events (1 cohort; n=350 fistulas). Risk of bias was high in many studies and event rates were variable, thus we could not present pooled results. Studies generally did not report variables associated with fistula complications, patient comorbidities, vessel characteristics, surgeon experience, or nursing cannulation skill. Overall, we found marked variability in complication rates, partly due to poor quality studies, significant heterogeneity of study populations, and inconsistent definitions.

This systematic review aimed to summarize current literature on fistula risks, including rates of complications, to assist with patient-centered decision making. We searched Medline from 2000 to 2014 for English-language studies with prospectively captured data on ≥100 fistulas. We assessed study quality and extracted data on study design, patient characteristics, and outcomes. After screening 2292 citations, 43 articles met our inclusion criteria (61 unique cohorts; n>11,374 fistulas). Median complication rates per 1000 patient days were as follows: 0.04 aneurysms (14 unique cohorts; n=1827 fistulas), 0.11 infections (16 cohorts; n>6439 fistulas), 0.05 steal events (15 cohorts; n>2543 fistulas), 0.24 thrombotic events (26 cohorts; n=4232 fistulas), and 0.03 venous hypertensive events (1 cohort; n=350 fistulas). Risk of bias was high in many studies and event rates were variable, thus we could not present pooled results. Studies generally did not report variables associated with fistula complications, patient comorbidities, vessel characteristics, surgeon experience, or nursing cannulation skill. Overall, we found marked variability in complication rates, partly due to poor quality studies, significant heterogeneity of study populations, and inconsistent definitions. There is an urgent need to standardize reporting of methods and definitions of vascular access complications in future clinical studies to better inform patient and provider decision making.</abstract>","{

308,35288967,The International journal of eating disorders,A systematic review of sociodemographic reporting and representation in eating disorder psychotherapy treatment trials in the United States.,"Eating disorders (EDs) were once conceptualized as primarily affecting affluent, White women, a misconception that informed research and practice for many years. Abundant evidence now discredits this stereotype, but it is unclear if prevailing 'evidence-based' treatments have been evaluated in samples representative of the diversity of individuals affected by EDs. Our goal was to evaluate the reporting, inclusion, and analysis of sociodemographic variables in ED psychotherapeutic treatment randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the US through 2020.	We conducted a systematic review of ED psychotherapeutic treatment RCTs in the US and examined the reporting and inclusion of gender identity, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status (SES) of enrolled participants, as well as recruitment methods, power analyses, and discussion of limitations and generalizability.	Our search yielded 58 studies meeting inclusion criteria dating back to 1985. Reporting was at times incomplete, absent, or centered on the racial/gender majority group. No studies reported gender diverse participants, and men and people of color were underrepresented generally, with differences noted across diagnoses. A minority of papers considered sociodemographic variables in analyses or acknowledged limitations related to sample characteristics. Some progress was made across the decades, with studies increasingly providing full racial and ethnic data, and more men included over time. Although racial and ethnic diversity improved somewhat, progress appeared to stall in the last decade.	We summarize findings, consider context and challenges for RCT researchers, and offer suggestions for researchers, journal editors, and reviewers on improving representation, reporting, and analytic practices.	Randomized controlled trials of eating disorder psychotherapeutic treatment in the US are increasingly reporting full race/ethnicity data, but information on SES is inconsistent and sexual orientation absent. White women still comprise the overwhelming majority of participants, with few men and people of color, and no gender-diverse individuals. Findings underscore the need to improve reporting and increase representation to ensure evidence-based treatments are effective across and within diverse groups.

310,18586813,Clinical rehabilitation,A controlled clinical trial on the effects of motor intervention on balance and cognition in institutionalized elderly patients with dementia,"PURPOSE: To analyse the effects of two interventions on the cognition and balance of institutionalized elderly people with mixed dementia. METHODS: Fifty-four participants were allocated into three groups. Group 1 was assisted by an interdisciplinary programme comprising physiotherapy, occupational therapy and physical education. A physiotherapist alone carried out the intervention in group 2. Group 3 was considered as control. Assessors were blinded to guarantee the absence of bias. Cognitive functions were analysed with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Brief Cognitive Screening Battery. Balance was assessed with the Berg Balance Scale and the Timed Get-Up-and-Go Test. Multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test possible main effects of the interventions. RESULTS: The results showed benefits on the balance of subjects in both groups 1 (F=3.9, P<0.05) and 2 (F=3.1, P<0.05), compared with group 3. MANOVA did not indicate benefits on the cognitive functions between groups 1 and 3 (F=1.1, P>0.05) and groups 2 and 3 (F=1.6, P>0.05). However, univariate analysis indicated some benefits of the interdisciplinary intervention on two specific domains measured by the Brief Cognitive Screening Battery (F=26.5, P<0.05; F=4.4, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Six months of multidisciplinary or physiotherapeutic intervention were able to improve a person's balance. Although global cognition did not improve through treatment, when the intervention was carried out on a multidisciplinary basis we observed an attenuation in the decline of global cognition on two specific cognitive domains.

In these low-resource settings, effective triage of patients with TBI-including the decision of whether or not to perform neurosurgery-is critical in optimizing patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. Machine learning may allow for effective predictions of patient outcomes both with and without surgery. Data from patients with TBI was collected prospectively at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, from 2016 to 2019. One linear and six non-linear machine learning models were designed to predict good versus poor outcome near hospital discharge and internally validated using nested five-fold cross-validation. The 13 predictors included clinical variables easily acquired on admission and whether or not the patient received surgery. Using an elastic-net regularized logistic regression model (GLMnet), with predictions calibrated using Platt scaling, the probability of poor outcome was calculated for each patient both with and without surgery (with the difference quantifying the 'individual treatment effect,' ITE). Relative ITE represents the percent reduction in chance of poor outcome, equaling this ITE divided by the probability of poor outcome with no surgery. Ultimately, 1766 patients were included. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) ranged from 83.1% (single C5.0 ruleset) to 88.5% (random forest), with the GLMnet at 87.5%. The two variables promoting good outcomes in the GLMnet model were high Glasgow Coma Scale score and receiving surgery. For the subgroup not receiving surgery, the median relative ITE was 42.9% (interquartile range [IQR], 32.7% to 53.5%); similarly, in those receiving surgery, it was 43.2% (IQR, 32.9% to 54.3%). We provide the first machine learning-based model to predict TBI outcomes with and without surgery in LMICs, thus enabling more effective surgical decision making in the resource-limited setting. Predicted ITE similarity between surgical and non-surgical groups suggests that, currently, patients are not being chosen optimally for neurosurgical intervention.

315,9141543,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Circulating non-22-kilodalton growth hormone isoforms in acromegalic men before and after transsphenoidal surgery.,"GH represents several molecular isoforms in addition to the main 22-kDa (22K) GH. There have been reports suggesting that circulating non-22K GH isoforms are increased in acromegaly, but the possible implications of such observations in the management of the disease have not been addressed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proportion of circulating non-22K GH isoforms in acromegaly. In addition, the relationships between the amount of non-22K GH and tumor size, biochemical measurements, and body composition also were investigated. Samples with different GH levels were selected from 24-h GH profiles from 15 acromegalic men evaluated before and 1 yr after transsphenoidal surgery and from 13 healthy men. The serum non-22K GH levels, expressed as percentage of total GH concentration, were determined by the 22K GH exclusion assay, which is based on immunomagnetic extraction of 22K GH from serum and quantitation of non-22K GH using a polyclonal GH assay. The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was fairly constant in different samples from the same patient, regardless of the GH level. However, a wide variation of values was observed among acromegalics, both before (14-51%) and after surgery (8-62%). The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was increased in untreated patients, compared with controls (26.6 vs. 17.4%; P < 0.01), and the values correlated significantly to tumor size, mean 24-h GH concentration, serum PRL, and extracellular water. After surgery, patients not truly cured, with mean 24-h GH concentration of 1 microg/L or more, had an increased proportion of non-22K GH, compared with those with levels less than 1 microg/L (P < 0.01). In the former group, the median values were similar than those in untreated acromegalics (34 vs. 26.6%, respectively), whereas in the latter, they were comparable with those in the controls (15.2 vs. 17.4%, respectively). We conclude that acromegalics have an increased proportion of circulating non-22K GH isoforms. The values are fairly constant in different samples from an individual, regardless of GH level, but a large spectrum can be observed among patients. This variability suggests that different pituitary adenomas secrete GH isoforms in variable amounts. Our observation that a higher proportion of non-22K GH isoforms is present in patients not truly cured after surgery suggests that the evaluation of non-22K GH isoforms can be useful in the follow-up of acromegalic patients.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0,"<journal>The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism</journal><title>Circulating non-22-kilodalton growth hormone isoforms in acromegalic men before and after transsphenoidal surgery.</title><abstract>GH represents several molecular isoforms in addition to the main 22-kDa (22K) GH.

If this is the case, one would expect that there is a relationship between the pattern of neuropsychological and magnetic resonance imaging deficits and that both may indicate cerebellar abnormalities.	To investigate the profiles of neuropsychological functions and the morphologic features of the cerebellum, using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging planimetry in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with radiation and chemotherapy.	Thirteen survivors of childhood ALL with onset at age 2 to 5 years and a uniform protocol of treatment involving cranial radiation of 24 Gy and five doses of intrathecal methotrexate sodium participated in the study. Ten controls matched the patients in age and socioeconomic status. Each child was assessed with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests and with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.	The neuropsychological scores were transformed into z scores and clustered into right and left hemisphere measures. Planimetric measures of the cerebellar vermis and pons were collected in the midsagittal plane.

320,22120272,World neurosurgery,Neurocognitive changes in pituitary adenoma patients after gamma knife radiosurgery: a preliminary study.,"We evaluated the effects of gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS) on the cognitive functioning of patients with a pituitary adenoma.	A total of 14 patients with pituitary adenomas were enrolled in this neurocognitive study. Nine patients had Cushing disease, and five had nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Five patients underwent GKRS for their pituitary adenomas. Other treatment modalities included transsphenoidal resection and conservative management. Comparisons were made between treatment groups and between those with Cushing disease versus those with a nonfunctioning adenoma by the use of psychometric tests of general intellectual functioning, memory, and current mood state. These tests were the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised, Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, Wechsler Memory Scale-third edition, selected subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-third edition, and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System.	When analyzed collectively, the patient group showed deficits in immediate memory (t=-2.70, P=0.02) and high levels of psychological distress (46% of patients) in the presence of intact general intellectual functioning. No neurocognitive differences were found between the GKRS treated group versus participants not treated with GKRS (t≤0.70, P≥0.39). Similarly, no appreciable neurocognitive differences were demonstrated between those with nonfunctioning adenomas as compared with those with Cushing disease (t≤1.56, P≥0.15).	We found no evidence that GKRS impairs the neurocognitive functioning of patients with pituitary disease above any impairment caused by the disease itself. Further studies will require approximately 20 patients in each comparison group to confirm this result.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0,"<journal>World neurosurgery</journal><title>Neurocognitive changes in pituitary adenoma patients after gamma knife radiosurgery: a preliminary study.</title><abstract>We evaluated the effects of gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS) on the cognitive functioning of patients with a pituitary adenoma.

A technical description and initial results.,"This study aimed to propose an alternative treatment for carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) using the balloon-assisted sinus coiling (BASC) technique and to describe this procedure in detail. Under general anesthesia, we performed the BASC procedure to treat five patients with traumatic CCF. Percutaneous access was obtained via the right femoral artery, and a 7F sheath was inserted, or alternatively, a bifemoral 6F approach was accomplished. A microcatheter was inserted into the cavernous sinus over a 0.014-inch microwire through the fistulous point; the microcatheter was placed distal from the fistula point, and a 'U-turn' maneuver was performed. Through the same carotid access, a compliant balloon was advanced to cross the point of the fistula and cover the whole carotid tear. Large coils were inserted using the microcatheter in the cavernous sinus. Coils filled the adjacent cavernous sinus, respecting the balloon. Immediate complete angiographic resolution was achieved, and an early angiographic control (mean = 2.6 months) indicated complete stability without recanalization. The clinical follow-up has been uneventful without any recurrence (mean = 15.2 months). An endovascular approach is optimal for direct CCF. Because the detachable balloon has been withdrawn from the market, covered stenting requires antiplatelet therapy and its patency is unconfirmed, but cavernous sinus coiling remains an excellent treatment option. Currently, there is no detailed description of the BASC procedure. We provide detailed angiograms with suitable descriptions of the exact fistula point, and venous drainage pathways.

327,34894769,Acupuncture in medicine : journal of the British Medical Acupuncture Society,Ear acupuncture as an adjunct in a treatment protocol for anorexia nervosa: utilization rate and nurses' experience,"BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening illness. Sometimes long inpatient treatment is necessary, increasing the anxiety that comes with hospitalization and the necessary weight gain. Safe, non-pharmacological adjunctive therapies that improve subjective health are called for. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this non-randomized, mixed-methods observational study was to describe the utilization rate and nurses' experiences of ear acupuncture in a highly specialized clinic for eating disorders in Sweden, in which acupuncture had been implemented as part of routine clinical care. Twenty-five patients with AN-treated voluntarily or by law were included. The semi-standardized National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) ear acupuncture protocol, sometimes combined with needling at 2 traditional acupuncture point locations on the body, had been implemented as a voluntary adjunct to usual care, twice weekly. To evaluate the acceptance of acupuncture, the study examined how often patients chose acupuncture when offered on schedule, and how often they asked for extra acupuncture sessions. Patients rated their subjective health using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and visual analogue scale (VAS), treatment satisfaction with usual care and acupuncture, and health-related quality of life with the RAND36 instrument. A credibility/expectancy questionnaire (CEQ) was used to measure confidence in treatment. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated to follow the patients' recovery. Nurses' experiences of giving acupuncture as a part of routine care were captured in interviews, and analysed with content analysis. Ethical approval was obtained. RESULTS: Despite an initially moderate level of trust in acupuncture, the utilization rate of the scheduled acupuncture was 89% and patients asked for extra acupuncture sessions on 28 occasions. No serious side effects were reported. Nurses' experiences of providing acupuncture were positive. They were generally enthusiastic, although they reported finding it difficult to organize group treatments and to find time for acupuncture sessions if they were not scheduled. CONCLUSION: Further research into the effectiveness and costs of acupuncture in psychiatric care is needed. This study provides relevant information for clinicians as well as researchers planning future randomized controlled trials.",NADA| anorexia nervosa| ear acupuncture| eating disturbances| nurses’ experience| utilization rate,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0,"<journal>Acupuncture in medicine : journal of the British Medical Acupuncture Society</journal><title>Ear acupuncture as an adjunct in a treatment protocol for anorexia nervosa: utilization rate and nurses' experience</title><abstract>BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening illness.

Patients rated their subjective health using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and visual analogue scale (VAS), treatment satisfaction with usual care and acupuncture, and health-related quality of life with the RAND36 instrument. A credibility/expectancy questionnaire (CEQ) was used to measure confidence in treatment. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated to follow the patients' recovery. Nurses' experiences of giving acupuncture as a part of routine care were captured in interviews, and analysed with content analysis. Ethical approval was obtained. RESULTS: Despite an initially moderate level of trust in acupuncture, the utilization rate of the scheduled acupuncture was 89% and patients asked for extra acupuncture sessions on 28 occasions. No serious side effects were reported. Nurses' experiences of providing acupuncture were positive. They were generally enthusiastic, although they reported finding it difficult to organize group treatments and to find time for acupuncture sessions if they were not scheduled. CONCLUSION: Further research into the effectiveness and costs of acupuncture in psychiatric care is needed. This study provides relevant information for clinicians as well as researchers planning future randomized controlled trials.</abstract>","<title>Ear acupuncture as an adjunct in a treatment protocol for anorexia nervosa: utilization rate and nurses' experience</title><abstract>BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening illness. Sometimes long inpatient treatment is necessary, increasing the anxiety that comes with hospitalization and the necessary weight gain. Safe, non-pharmacological adjunctive therapies that improve subjective health are called for. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this non-randomized, mixed-methods observational study was to describe the utilization rate and nurses' experiences of ear acupuncture in a highly specialized clinic for eating disorders in Sweden, in which acupuncture had been implemented as part of routine clinical care. Twenty-five patients with AN-treated voluntarily or by law were included. The semi-standardized National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) ear acupuncture protocol, sometimes combined with needling at 2 traditional acupuncture point locations on the body, had been implemented as a voluntary adjunct to usual care, twice weekly.

Three paraplegic subjects with the lesion at level T12 and three able-bodied subjects were included in this study. Hip and pelvis range of motion and vertical ground reaction force were evaluated using the Qualysis motion analyzer system and a Kistler force plate. Energy consumption was measured with the Polar heart rate monitoring system. The differences between SCI individuals when walking with a Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis (KAFO) and the new RGO, and the differences between able-bodied and paraplegic subjects were evaluated by the use of paired sample and two sample t test, respectively.	The results showed that energy consumption and gait analysis outcomes with new RGO orthosis were better than the KAFO. However, there was a large difference between paraplegic and able-bodied subjects while walking with the new orthosis.	The new RGO design performed better than a KAFO in terms of energy consumption, walking style and vertical ground reaction force.

333,23909246,Journal of neurosurgery,"Transsylvian hippocampal transection for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: surgical indications, procedure, and postoperative seizure and memory outcomes.","Amygdalohippocampectomy is a well-established, standard surgery for medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). However, in the case of MTLE without hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, amygdalohippocampectomy is associated with decreased postoperative memory function. Hippocampal transection (HT) has been developed to overcome this problem. In HT the hippocampus is not removed; rather, the longitudinal hippocampal circuits of epileptic activities are disrupted by transection of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus. The present study describes a less invasive modification of HT (transsylvian HT) and presents the seizure and memory outcomes for this procedure.	Thirty-seven patients with MTLE (18 men and 19 women; age range 9-63 years; 19 with surgery on the right side and 18 with surgery on the left side; seizure onset from 3 to 34 years) who were treated with transsylvian HT were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had left-side language dominance, and follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 94 months (median 49 months). Seizure outcomes were evaluated for all patients by using the Engel classification. Memory function was evaluated for 22 patients based on 3 indices (verbal memory, nonverbal memory, and delayed recall), with those scores obtained using the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Patients underwent evaluation of the memory function before and after surgery (6 months-1 year).	Engel Class I (completely seizure free) was achieved in 25 patients (67.6%). Class II and Class III designation was achieved in 10 (27%) and 2 patients (5.4%), respectively. There were differences in memory outcome between the sides of operation. On the right side, verbal memory significantly increased postoperatively (p = 0.003) but nonverbal memory and delayed recall showed no significant change after the operation (p = 0.718 and p = 0.210, respectively). On the left side, all 3 indices (verbal memory, nonverbal memory, and delayed recall) showed no significant change (p = 0.331, p = 0.458, and p = 0.366, respectively).

The present study describes a less invasive modification of HT (transsylvian HT) and presents the seizure and memory outcomes for this procedure.	Thirty-seven patients with MTLE (18 men and 19 women; age range 9-63 years; 19 with surgery on the right side and 18 with surgery on the left side; seizure onset from 3 to 34 years) who were treated with transsylvian HT were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had left-side language dominance, and follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 94 months (median 49 months). Seizure outcomes were evaluated for all patients by using the Engel classification. Memory function was evaluated for 22 patients based on 3 indices (verbal memory, nonverbal memory, and delayed recall), with those scores obtained using the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Patients underwent evaluation of the memory function before and after surgery (6 months-1 year).	Engel Class I (completely seizure free) was achieved in 25 patients (67.6%). Class II and Class III designation was achieved in 10 (27%) and 2 patients (5.4%), respectively. There were differences in memory outcome between the sides of operation. On the right side, verbal memory significantly increased postoperatively (p = 0.003) but nonverbal memory and delayed recall showed no significant change after the operation (p = 0.718 and p = 0.210, respectively). On the left side, all 3 indices (verbal memory, nonverbal memory, and delayed recall) showed no significant change (p = 0.331, p = 0.458, and p = 0.366, respectively).	Favorable seizure outcome and preservation of verbal memory were achieved with transsylvian HT for the treatment of MTLE without hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis.</abstract>","<title>Transsylvian hippocampal transection for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: surgical indications, procedure, and postoperative seizure and memory outcomes.</title><abstract>Amygdalohippocampectomy is a well-established, standard surgery for medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).

This study followed all cases of localized PC diagnosed between 2008 and 2009 in men aged≤65years old and still alive two years after treatment. In total, 437 men were recruited. Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and by cross-checking with data from the cancer registry. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed to evaluate persisting UI and SD at 2years.	At two years after treatment, UI was persistent in 48.8%; 41.2% had used urinary protections, and 39.2% had used at least 1 pad/day; 55.2% reported financial difficulties for purchasing protective pads. In total, 22.7% did not consult a specialist for UI. SD was persistent in 82.8%; 30.4% did not consult a specialist for SD. SD had a negative impact on the sex life of patients and their partners. After adjustment for cancer stage, prostatectomy was significantly associated with persisting UI and SD at two years.	Two years after treatment, rates of persisting UI and/or SD remain high.

We evaluated the outcomes of re-irradiation combined with bevacizumab for patients refractory to bevacizumab.	Between January 2015 and September 2019, patients with progression after bevacizumab treatment were treated with re-irradiation combined with bevacizumab (25 Gy in five fractions).	Fourteen patients [glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type (N = 6), glioblastoma, IDH mutant (N = 4), anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH wild type (N = 1), anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH mutant (N = 1), glioblastoma, not otherwise specified (N = 1) and radiologically diagnosed brainstem glioma (N = 1)] were included in this study. The median survival and progression-free survival times after re-irradiation combined with bevacizumab were 6.1 and 3.8 months, respectively. The 6-month survival and progression-free survival rates were 54.5 and 15.7%, respectively. Patients with a Karnofsky performance status of ≥70 tended to have longer median survival time (9.3 vs. 5.4 months, respectively; P = 0.058) and had a significantly longer median progression-free survival time (4.2 vs. 3.7 months, respectively; P = 0.046) than those with a Karnofsky performance status of <70.

342,24021522,Gait & posture,Effects of two different exercise programs on gait parameters in individuals with Parkinson's disease: a pilot study.,"To date, little attempt has been made to compare or evaluate the effects of different physical exercise programs on gait disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). This pilot study is aimed at obtaining preliminary data of the effects of two different exercise programs on gait parameters in people with PD by means of a biomechanical three-dimensional motion analysis. Twenty-five individuals with idiopathic PD participated either in a land-based (LB) or in a LB plus water-based (LWB) exercise program for 16 weeks. The efficacy of both exercise programs was quantified by means of a biomechanical gait analysis from which spatiotemporal and sagittal plane kinetic (gait speed, stride length, cadence, stride time, simple support time, double support time) and kinematic (angles of the hip, knee, and ankle joints) variables were recorded. Once the intervention ended, significant changes were observed in stride length and single/double support time variables in all the patients. The intergroup analysis revealed the existence of significant differences only in the gait Speed and hip Angle parameters. Few significant improvements in the amplitude of lower limb joints were found. These results suggest that land-based and land-plus-water-based exercise programs can be considered as a useful physical rehabilitation alternative, both equally capable of improving gait impairment on Parkinson's disease.",Gait disturbances| Parkinson's disease| Physical exercise,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0,"<journal>Gait & posture</journal><title>Effects of two different exercise programs on gait parameters in individuals with Parkinson's disease: a pilot study.</title><abstract>To date, little attempt has been made to compare or evaluate the effects of different physical exercise programs on gait disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).

343,33689536,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",Survival impact of incidental subventricular zone irradiation in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.,"The subventricular zone (SVZ) is an important niche for neural stem cells but probably also for brain tumor propagating cells, including the glioblastoma stem cell. The SVZ may become a target for radiation therapy in glioblastoma patients. However, reports studying the effect of irradiation of the SVZ on glioblastoma patient survival show conflicting results. We studied the correlation between incidental SVZ radiation dose and survival in a cohort of isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDHwt) glioblastoma patients with inclusion of important survival prognosticators.	In this retrospective analysis, only adult patients with supratentorial IDHwt glioblastoma were included who were treated with temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy after surgery. The SVZ was contoured on the radiotherapy planning imaging. Cox proportional regression overall survival (OS) analysis was used to study the correlation between SVZ dose and survival. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score, extent of resection and O[6]-methylguanine-methyl-DNA-transferase gene promoter (MGMTp) methylation were used as covariates in multivariate analysis.	In total, 137 patients were included. Median OS was 13.3 months. The MGMTp methylation was present in 40% of cases. Ipsilateral SVZ (iSVZ) mean dose was 44.4 Gy and 27.2 Gy for the contralateral SVZ (cSVZ). Univariate survival analysis showed an inverse relationship between cSVZ mean dose and OS (HR 1.029 (1.003-1.057); p= .032). However, there was no correlation between cSVZ mean dose and OS in multivariate analysis. iSVZ dose did not correlate with survival.	In this cohort of 137 IDHwt glioblastoma patients, iSVZ did not correlate with OS. Higher cSVZ dose was inversely correlated with OS in univariate survival analysis but lost its significance in multivariate analysis, including MGMTp-methylation. Hence, the correlation between SVZ radiation and glioblastoma patient survival remains unclear.

Volumes of tissue activation were generated around active lead contacts with a finite-element model. Twelve months after surgery, voxel-based morphometry was used to identify voxels associated with higher reduction in headache load. Probabilistic tractography was used to identify the brain connectivity of the activation volumes in responders, defined as patients with a reduction of ≥30% in headache load.	There was no surgical morbidity. Average follow-up was 34 ± 14 months. Patients showed reductions of 76 ± 33% in headache load, 46 ± 41% in attack severity, 58 ± 41% in headache frequency, and 51 ± 46% in attack duration at the last follow-up.

346,28927961,Brain stimulation,Clinical and electrophysiological outcomes of deep TMS over the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in OCD patients,"BACKGROUND: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling disorder with poor response to pharmacological treatments. Converging evidences suggest that OCD patients suffer from dysfunction of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, including in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). OBJECTIVE: To examine whether modulation of mPFC-ACC activity by deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) affects OCD symptoms. METHODS: Treatment resistant OCD participants were treated with either high-frequency (HF; 20 Hz), low-frequency (LF; 1 Hz), or sham DTMS of the mPFC and ACC for five weeks, in a double-blinded manner. All treatments were administered following symptoms provocation, and EEG measurements during a Stroop task were acquired to examine changes in error-related activity. Clinical response to treatment was determined using the Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). RESULTS: Interim analysis revealed that YBOCS scores were significantly improved following HF (n = 7), but not LF stimulation (n = 8), compared to sham (n = 8), and thus recruitment for the LF group was terminated. Following completion of the study, the response rate in the HF group (n = 18) was significantly higher than that of the sham group (n = 15) for at least one month following the end of the treatment. Notably, the clinical response in the HF group correlated with increased Error Related Negativity (ERN) in the Stroop task, an electrophysiological component that is attributed to ACC activity. CONCLUSION: HF DTMS over the mPFC-ACC alleviates OCD symptoms and may be used as a novel therapeutic intervention. Notwithstanding alternative explanations, this may stem from DTMS ability to directly modify ACC activity.",ACC| ERN| OCD| dTMS,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0,"<journal>Brain stimulation</journal><title>Clinical and electrophysiological outcomes of deep TMS over the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in OCD patients</title><abstract>BACKGROUND: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling disorder with poor response to pharmacological treatments.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether modulation of mPFC-ACC activity by deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) affects OCD symptoms. METHODS: Treatment resistant OCD participants were treated with either high-frequency (HF; 20 Hz), low-frequency (LF; 1 Hz), or sham DTMS of the mPFC and ACC for five weeks, in a double-blinded manner. All treatments were administered following symptoms provocation, and EEG measurements during a Stroop task were acquired to examine changes in error-related activity. Clinical response to treatment was determined using the Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). RESULTS: Interim analysis revealed that YBOCS scores were significantly improved following HF (n = 7), but not LF stimulation (n = 8), compared to sham (n = 8), and thus recruitment for the LF group was terminated. Following completion of the study, the response rate in the HF group (n = 18) was significantly higher than that of the sham group (n = 15) for at least one month following the end of the treatment. Notably, the clinical response in the HF group correlated with increased Error Related Negativity (ERN) in the Stroop task, an electrophysiological component that is attributed to ACC activity. CONCLUSION: HF DTMS over the mPFC-ACC alleviates OCD symptoms and may be used as a novel therapeutic intervention. Notwithstanding alternative explanations, this may stem from DTMS ability to directly modify ACC activity.</abstract>","{

352,33243690,The journal of sexual medicine,"Oral Administration of the p75 Neurotrophin Receptor Modulator, LM11A-31, Improves Erectile Function in a Mouse Model of Cavernous Nerve Injury","BACKGROUND: Radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer can not only induce cavernous nerve injury (CNI), but also causes cavernous hypoxia and cavernous structural changes, which lead to a poor response to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors. AIM: To investigate the therapeutic effect of oral administration of LM11A-31, a small molecule p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) ligand and proNGF antagonist, in a mouse model of bilateral CNI, which mimics nerve injury-induced erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy. METHODS: 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into sham operation and CNI groups. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups: phosphate-buffered saline and LM11A-31 (50 mg/kg/day) being administered once daily starting 3 days before CNI via oral gavage. 2 weeks after CNI, we measured erectile function by electrical stimulation of the bilateral cavernous nerve. The penis was harvested for histologic examination and Western blot analysis. The major pelvic ganglia was harvested and cultured for assays of ex vivo neurite outgrowth. OUTCOMES: Intracavernous pressure, neurovascular regeneration in the penis, in vivo or ex vivo functional evaluation, and cell survival signaling were measured. RESULTS: Erectile function was decreased in the CNI group (44% of the sham operation group), while administration of LM11A-31 led to a significant improvement of erectile function (70% of the sham operation group) in association with increased neurovascular content, including cavernous endothelial cells, pericytes, and neuronal processes. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses showed significantly increased p75(NTR) expression in the dorsal nerve of CNI mice, which was attenuated by LM11A-31 treatment. Protein expression of active PI3K, AKT, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was increased, and cell death and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling was significantly attenuated after LM11A-31 treatment. Furthermore, LM11A-31 promoted neurite sprouting in cultured major pelvic ganglia after lipopolysaccharide exposure. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: LM11A-31 may be used as a strategy to treat erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy or in men with neurovascular diseases. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Unlike biological therapeutics, such as proteins, gene therapies, or stem cells, the clinical application of LM11A-31 would likely be relatively less complex and low cost. Our study has some limitations. Future studies will assess the optimal dosing and duration of the compound. Given its plasma half-life of approximately 1 hour, it is possible that dosing more than once per day will provide added efficacy. CONCLUSION: Specific inhibition of the proNGF-p75(NTR) degenerative signaling via oral administration of LM11A-31 represents a novel therapeutic strategy for erectile dysfunction induced by nerve injury.

OUTCOMES: Intracavernous pressure, neurovascular regeneration in the penis, in vivo or ex vivo functional evaluation, and cell survival signaling were measured. RESULTS: Erectile function was decreased in the CNI group (44% of the sham operation group), while administration of LM11A-31 led to a significant improvement of erectile function (70% of the sham operation group) in association with increased neurovascular content, including cavernous endothelial cells, pericytes, and neuronal processes. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses showed significantly increased p75(NTR) expression in the dorsal nerve of CNI mice, which was attenuated by LM11A-31 treatment. Protein expression of active PI3K, AKT, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was increased, and cell death and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling was significantly attenuated after LM11A-31 treatment. Furthermore, LM11A-31 promoted neurite sprouting in cultured major pelvic ganglia after lipopolysaccharide exposure. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: LM11A-31 may be used as a strategy to treat erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy or in men with neurovascular diseases. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Unlike biological therapeutics, such as proteins, gene therapies, or stem cells, the clinical application of LM11A-31 would likely be relatively less complex and low cost. Our study has some limitations. Future studies will assess the optimal dosing and duration of the compound. Given its plasma half-life of approximately 1 hour, it is possible that dosing more than once per day will provide added efficacy. CONCLUSION: Specific inhibition of the proNGF-p75(NTR) degenerative signaling via oral administration of LM11A-31 represents a novel therapeutic strategy for erectile dysfunction induced by nerve injury.

We treated N171-82Q and YAC128 mice, two mouse models of HD varying in genetic backgrounds and pathological progressions, with a diet containing therapeutic doses of lithium, VPA, or both. Untreated, these transgenic mice displayed a decrease in levels of GSK-3β serine 9 phosphorylation and histone H3 acetylation in the striatum and cerebral cortex around the onset of behavioral deficits, indicating a hyperactivity of GSK-3β and HDACs. Using multiple well-validated behavioral tests, we found that co-treatment with lithium and VPA more effectively alleviated spontaneous locomotor deficits and depressive-like behaviors in both models of HD mice. Furthermore, compared with monotherapy with either drug alone, co-treatment more successfully improved motor skill learning and coordination in N171-82Q mice, and suppressed anxiety-like behaviors in YAC128 mice.

In this study, we explored the effects of urate on dopaminergic neurons in nigrostriatal pathway in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilaterally lesioned rats. Uric acid (UA), when given twice daily at 200 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 10 consecutive days, elevated urate (the anionic form of UA) in plasma and striatum by 55% and 36.8%, respectively, as compared with vehicle group. This regimen of UA was found to ameliorate the behavioral deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss as well as dopamine depletion in the nigrostriatal system. Moreover, UA administration was capable of increasing glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity while decreasing malondialdehyde accumulation in striatum. In addition, the phosphorylation of both protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) in the lesioned striata of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was dramatically reduced as compared with sham-operated rats. This reduction was attenuated in the Parkinsonian rats receiving UA treatment. Similarly, in vitro findings showed that UA alleviated the decrease in Akt activation and the increase in GSK3β activity caused by 6-OHDA. Furthermore, neuroprotection by urate and its regulation on GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9 was found to be abolished in the presence of PI3K inhibitor.

361,26520066,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,Effect of systemic high dose enzyme replacement therapy on the improvement of CNS defects in a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type II,"BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome), is caused by a deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS). Despite the therapeutic effect of intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), the central nervous system (CNS) defects persist because the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). There have been several trials of direct infusion to the cerebrospinal space showing promising results; however, this approach may have limitations in clinical situations such as CNS infection. The objective of this study was to improve the CNS defect with systemic high-dose ERT. METHODS: Systemic ERT was performed using three doses (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg weekly) of IDS for three different durations (1, 3, and 6 months) in IDS knock out (KO) mice of two age groups (2 months, 8 months). GAG measurement in tissues, brain pathology, and behavioral assessment were analyzed. RESULTS: Brain IDS activities increased in parallel with the concentrations of IDS injected. The glycosaminoglycan (GAG) level and histopathology in the brains of the young mice improved in a dose- and duration-dependent manner; however, those were not improved in the old mice, even at higher doses of IDS. The spontaneous alternation behavior was recovered in young KO mice treated with ≥ 5 mg/kg IDS; however, no significant improvement was observed in old KO mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high-dose ERT given to mice of earlier ages may play a role in preventing GAG accumulation and preventing CNS damage in IDS KO mice. Therefore, ERT above the present standard dose, starting in early childhood, could be a promising treatment regimen for reducing neurological impairment in Hunter syndrome.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,"<journal>Orphanet journal of rare diseases</journal><title>Effect of systemic high dose enzyme replacement therapy on the improvement of CNS defects in a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type II</title><abstract>BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II, Hunter syndrome), is caused by a deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS).

Activation of melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in several neurological diseases. In the present study, we have explored the role of MC1R activation on neuroinflammation and the potential underlying mechanisms after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats.	A total of 169 post-natal day 10 unsexed rat pups were used. HI was induced by right common carotid artery ligation followed by 2.5 h of hypoxia. BMS-470539, a specific selective MC1R agonist, was administered intranasally at 1 h after HI induction. To elucidate the potential underlying mechanism, MC1R CRISPR KO plasmid or Nurr1 CRISPR KO plasmid was administered via intracerebroventricular injection at 48 h before HI induction. Percent brain infarct area, short- and long-term neurobehavioral tests, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot were conducted.	The expression levels of MC1R and Nurr1 increased over time post-HI. MC1R and Nurr1 were expressed on microglia at 48 h post-HI. Activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 significantly reduced the percent infarct area, brain atrophy, and inflammation, and improved short- and long-term neurological deficits at 48 h and 28 days post-HI. MC1R activation increased the expression of CD206 (a microglial M2 marker) and reduced the expression of MPO. Moreover, activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 significantly increased the expression levels of MC1R, cAMP, p-PKA, and Nurr1, while downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β) at 48 h post-HI. However, knockout of MC1R or Nurr1 by specific CRISPR reversed the neuroprotective effects of MC1R activation post-HI.	Our study demonstrated that activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 attenuated neuroinflammation, and improved neurological deficits after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats. Such anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects were mediated, at least in part, via the cAMP/PKA/Nurr1 signaling pathway. Therefore, MC1R activation might be a promising therapeutic target for infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).",BMS-470539| Melanocortin-1 receptor| Microglial polarization| Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia| Neuroinflammation| Nurr1,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,"<journal>Journal of neuroinflammation</journal><title>Activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 attenuates neuroinflammation via cAMP/PKA/Nurr1 pathway after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats.</title><abstract>Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic (HI)-induced brain injury.

Aluminum, a well-known neurotoxin, has been suggested to be a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease. In this study we investigated the possible effect of memantine on aluminum-induced cognitive impairment in rats. Rats were exposed to aluminum chloride (100mg/kg/day) and memantine (5, 10 and 20mg/kg/day) for 60 days. Cognitive functions were evaluated using three tests: Morris water maze, radial arm maze and passive avoidance tests. Results showed that memantine failed at low doses to have any significant influence on aluminum-induced memory deficit, but the 20mg/kg dose was found to cause significant enhancement of memory in the aluminum-exposed rats. This is the first study to demonstrate the protective role of memantine against aluminum-induced neuronal dysfunction. Biochemical and histological investigations are highly indicated to clarify the possible pharmacodynamic basis.</abstract>","{

Despite its high morbidity and mortality, its underlying pathogenic mechanisms still remain poorly understood. Although there is increasing evidence for significant changes in the structure and function of synapses on motor neurons, there is a need for a systematic investigation of the role of each synapse subtype in the course of the disease. Here, we focus on large cholinergic synapses on motor neurons, known as C boutons, and investigate their role during ALS progression. We implement a genetic strategy for inactivation of the cholinergic output of C boutons in the SOD1[G93A] transgenic mouse model of ALS. We demonstrate that although C bouton cholinergic inactivation does not alter mouse survival, it exerts a beneficial effect on motor performance in the rotarod motor task, as evidenced by an increased latency to fall in SOD1[G93A] mice lacking C bouton cholinergic output.

Recently, we reported that peucedanocoumarin III (PCiii) is a promising therapeutic compound with the ability to disaggregate α-synuclein inclusion and protect dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we found that trans-4'-acetyl-3'-tigloylkhellactone (racemic peucedanocoumarin IV [PCiv]), a structural isomer of PCiii with a higher synthetic yield presented a strong anti-aggregate activity to a degree comparable to that of PCiii. PCiv retained effective inhibitory function against β-sheet aggregate-mimic β23 cytotoxicities and potently prevented α-synucleinopathy in α-synuclein preformed fibril (PFF)-treated mice cortical neurons. In detailed pharmacokinetic profiling of PCiv, oral administration of PCiv in rats exhibited an approximately 97-min half-life and 10% bioavailability. Moreover, tissue distribution analysis revealed favorable profiles of brain penetration with a 6.4 brain-to-plasma concentration ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of PCiv was further evaluated in a sporadic PD mouse model with a combinatorial co-injection of α-synuclein preformed fibril and recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing α-synuclein. Motor dysfunctions induced in this combinatorial α-synucleinopathy PD mouse model was almost completely rescued by PCiv diet administration, and this therapeutic effect is consistent with the marked prevention of dopaminergic neuron loss and suppression of α-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our translational study suggests that PCiv is advantageous as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, especially with its good synthetic yield, high brain distribution, and anti-aggregate activity. PCiv may be useful in the management of α-synuclein inclusion formation and propagation at different stages of PD.",Parkinson’s disease| dopaminergic cell loss| organic synthesis| peucedanocoumarin IV| pharmacokinetics| α-synuclein preformed fibril,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,"<journal>International journal of molecular sciences</journal><title>Synthetic Peucedanocoumarin IV Prevents α-Synuclein Neurotoxicity in an Animal Model of Parkinson's Disease.</title><abstract>Pathological protein inclusion formation and propagation are the main causes of neuronal dysfunction in diverse neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, current disease-modifying therapeutic strategies have targeted this disease protein aggregation process.

Recently, we reported that peucedanocoumarin III (PCiii) is a promising therapeutic compound with the ability to disaggregate α-synuclein inclusion and protect dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we found that trans-4'-acetyl-3'-tigloylkhellactone (racemic peucedanocoumarin IV [PCiv]), a structural isomer of PCiii with a higher synthetic yield presented a strong anti-aggregate activity to a degree comparable to that of PCiii. PCiv retained effective inhibitory function against β-sheet aggregate-mimic β23 cytotoxicities and potently prevented α-synucleinopathy in α-synuclein preformed fibril (PFF)-treated mice cortical neurons. In detailed pharmacokinetic profiling of PCiv, oral administration of PCiv in rats exhibited an approximately 97-min half-life and 10% bioavailability. Moreover, tissue distribution analysis revealed favorable profiles of brain penetration with a 6.4 brain-to-plasma concentration ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of PCiv was further evaluated in a sporadic PD mouse model with a combinatorial co-injection of α-synuclein preformed fibril and recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing α-synuclein. Motor dysfunctions induced in this combinatorial α-synucleinopathy PD mouse model was almost completely rescued by PCiv diet administration, and this therapeutic effect is consistent with the marked prevention of dopaminergic neuron loss and suppression of α-synuclein aggregation.

The long-term effects of the drug are not yet known, and it is speculated that repeated exposure may produce drug dependence. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of repeated methylphenidate treatment on methylphenidate self-administration and reinstatement in the most validated animal model of ADHD, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), and Wistar rat, strain representing the ""normal"" heterogeneous population. METHODS: Rats were administered intraperitoneally with saline or methylphenidate (2 mg/kg) for 14 days, prior to experiments. Thereafter, responses for intravenous methylphenidate under the fixed ratio (FR1 and FR3) and progressive ratio (PR) schedules were assessed. Extinction experiments followed, as well as tests to determine the ability of intraperitoneal administration of methylphenidate (2 and 5 mg/kg) to reinstate extinguished drug-seeking behaviors in rats. RESULTS: Previous exposure to methylphenidate enhanced methylphenidate self-administration in Wistar rats but not in SHR (FR3). Methylphenidate pretreatment reduced responding for methylphenidate in SHR but did not affect self-administration behaviors of Wistar rats (PR).

380,15787692,The European journal of neuroscience,A combination drug therapy improves cognition and reverses gene expression changes in a mouse model of Huntington's disease,"Huntington's disease is a genetic disease caused by a single mutation. It is characterized by progressive movement, emotional and cognitive deficits. R6/2 mice transgenic for exon 1 of the HD gene with 150+ CAG repeats have a progressive neurological phenotype, including deterioration in cognitive function. The mechanism underlying the cognitive deficits in R6/2 mice is unknown, but dysregulated gene expression, reduced neurotransmitter levels and abnormal synaptic function are present before the cognitive decline becomes pronounced. Our goal here was to ameliorate the cognitive phenotype in R6/2 mice using a combination drug therapy (tacrine, moclobemide and creatine) aimed at boosting neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Treatment from 5 weeks of age prevented deterioration in two different cognitive tasks until at least 12 weeks. However, motor deterioration continued unabated.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a dissociation between neuropathologic findings with normal cognition in a woman with severe Alzheimer disease with the APOE epsilon2/epsilon2 genotype. DESIGN: Case report from a community-based prospective study of persons 90 years or older (The 90+ Study). PARTICIPANT: A 92-year-old woman without dementia with the APOE epsilon2/epsilon2 genotype who lived independently without significant cognitive or functional loss and was a participant in The 90+ Study. She died in December 2004, and postmortem examination of her brain was performed. INTERVENTION: Neurologic examination and a battery of neuropsychological tests were performed 6 months and 1 month before death. Neuropathologic examination included Braak and Braak staging for senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. RESULTS: Neuropathologic examination of the brain revealed advanced senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangle disease consistent with a high likelihood of Alzheimer disease. At clinical evaluation, the participant demonstrated no dementia and only mild cognitive deficits.

When the personality changes become noticeable, involuntary movements (chorea) also develop. The disease is caused by the CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the HTT gene, and the diagnosis is based on the presence of this expansion. However, there is currently no effective treatment for the progression of Huntington's disease and its involuntary motor symptoms. Herein, we present a case in which memantine was effective in treating the chorea movements of Huntington's disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old Japanese woman presented to the hospital with involuntary movements of Huntington's disease that began when she was 73 years old. In a cerebral blood flow test (N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single-photon emission computed tomography), decreased blood flow was observed in the precuneus (anterior wedge) and posterior cingulate gyrus. Usually, such areas of decreased blood flow are observed in patients with Alzheimer's-type dementia. So, we administered memantine for Alzheimer's-type dementia, and this treatment suppressed the involuntary movements of Huntington's disease, and the symptoms progressed slowly for 7 years after the onset of senility. In contrast, her brother died of complications of pneumonia during the course of Huntington's disease. CONCLUSIONS: We recorded changes in parameters such as the results of the N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single-photon emission computed tomography and gait videos over 7 years.

390,10025430,Archives of neurology,Serial brain SPECT images in a case of Sydenham chorea.,"The pathophysiological nature of Sydenham chorea (SC) has been presumed to be an autoimmune-mediated inflammatory process. Positron emission tomography in SC has revealed a striatal hypermetabolism that might explain the transient neuronal dysfunction.

To investigate the cerebral perfusion patterns of the subcortical structures by using serial technetium Tc 99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer SPECT in a case of SC, which may provide a clue for the pathophysiological mechanisms.	A case report and serial SPECT studies.	A girl aged 4 years 3 months showed severe generalized choreic movements with concomitant signs of acute pharyngitis. Results of a laboratory study taken 7 days after the onset of chorea showed elevated antistreptolysin O titer, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Other laboratory data, throat culture, echocardiography, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalography did not reveal any abnormalities. Five days after treatment with haloperidol and penicillin, the chorea began to improve slowly, and completely resolved in 2 months.	Three serial SPECT images and semiquantitative analysis of cerebral perfusion were obtained. Cerebral perfusion in the striatum and thalamus was markedly increased bilaterally during the stage of active chorea and then returned nearly to its baseline level during the convalescent phase. These cerebral perfusion patterns were concordant with semiquantitative analysis.

391,26847429,European journal of pediatrics,The long-term treatment of a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus and glutaric aciduria type 1: the effect of insulin.,"The coexistence of two diseases associated with different metabolic disorders is a very rare event. Some associations, although sporadic, can be particularly challenging both in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management and in terms of theoretical perspective. Here, we report a child affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). The child was diagnosed with classical T1DM at 15 months of age, with a tendency toward hypoglycemia. A few months later, during an acute intercurrent infective episode, the child displayed acute hypotonia of the lower limbs and limbs dystonia. A brain MRI showed bilateral striatal necrosis, suggesting GA1 diagnosis. Treatment with a low-lysine dietary regimen and carnitine supplementation was started and resulted in an improvement in metabolic control and a reduction of hypoglycemic episodes along with an increasing in insulin daily dose. After 2 years, the neurological outcome consisted of a reduction in dystonic movements and a metabolic stability of both diseases.	This case provides some insight into the reciprocal interconnections between the two metabolic disorders. Similar pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the neuronal injury might have impacted each other, and a strict relationship between a specific aspect of GA1-impaired metabolism and glucose homeostasis might explain how the tailored management of GA1 was not only effective in controlling the disease, but it also resulted in an improvement in the control of the glycemic profile. What in known: • Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) usually presents in childhood with severe and possibly irreversible neuronal damage, triggered by a catabolic stress • The association of GA1 with other diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), is a rare event, complicating the treatment management What is new: • Insulin treatment has a role in preventing GA1 metabolic decompensation, even in the catabolic condition of hypoglycemia • Promoting GA1 metabolic equilibrium by tailoring drug and dietary treatment in our patient affect by T1DM has a positive impact also in improving glycemic balance.",Glutaric acid 3-hydroxyglutaric acid| Glutaric aciduria type 1| Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase| Insulin treatment dystonia| Type 1 diabetes mellitus,Human-case-report,4,0,"<journal>European journal of pediatrics</journal><title>The long-term treatment of a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus and glutaric aciduria type 1: the effect of insulin.</title><abstract>The coexistence of two diseases associated with different metabolic disorders is a very rare event.

METHODS: We report a case of CJD mimicking acute stroke and review all similar cases in the magnetic resonance imaging era reported in English, identified through a PubMed and SCOPUS search. RESULTS: A 68-year-old woman presented with an acute left parietal syndrome, initially referred as a left middle cerebral artery territory stroke. Structural imaging was unremarkable and focal electroencephalogram changes suggested nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Subsequent clinical progression, with the development of cortical high signal on diffusion-weighted imaging and positive 14-3-3 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, confirmed a diagnosis of CJD. Review of the literature identified 14 further cases mimicking both anterior and posterior stroke syndromes.

A 53-year-old man presented with a 1.5-year history of gait unsteadiness and vertigo and a few-week history of headache, emesis, and neurogenic dysphagia. A brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large, heterogeneously contrast enhancing mass located within the fourth ventricle, compressing the brainstem and causing supratentorial ventricle enlargement. A suboccipital craniotomy and a telovelar approach were performed to resect the tumor. The ventricular system was repermeabilized at the end of the operation.	A postoperative magnetic resonance imaging confirmed complete tumor removal. There was an initial worsening of the preoperative deficits, which progressively improved. The tumor was classified as a fourth ventricle schwannoma. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence during the 6 years of follow-up. At present, the patient is ambulatory and reports an intermittent diplopia on conjugated gaze.	This case report intends to reveal the eighth case of a fourth ventricle schwannoma since 1957.

Neuroimaging studies have highlighted an association between the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms and an increased activity of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in patients with OCD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a powerful and easy-to-use tool to modulate brain activity. Cathodal tDCS (c-tDCS) is assumed to decrease cortical excitability in the targeted brain region. We hypothesized that c-tDCS applied over the left OFC alleviates symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. We report here the case of a patient who received 10 sessions (2 mA, 20 minutes) of c-tDCS. The tDCS sessions were delivered twice a day with a 2-hour interval, with the cathode (35 cm[2]) placed over the left OFC and the anode (100 cm[2]) placed over the contralateral occipital region. No adverse event was reported. One month after the completion of the tDCS sessions, we observed a 26% reduction in severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores. These findings are consistent with a previous study reporting a similar reduction in obsessive and compulsive symptoms after a low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was given to the left OFC. Our results indicate that c-tDCS applied over the left OFC may be a suitable and safe treatment in patients with treatment-resistant OCD.",,Human-case-report,4,0,"<journal>The journal of ECT</journal><title>Efficacy of Cathodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Over the Left Orbitofrontal Cortex in a Patient With Treatment-Resistant Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.</title><abstract>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling and frequent neuropsychiatric disorder.

Plasmacytomas that involve the nervous system can give rise to diffuse symptoms depending on their location. Patients with confusion or dementia might be difficult to neurologically assess in an acute setting and the subtle symptoms of neurological pathology caused by rare malignancies might go undiagnosed. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is an 80 year old man presenting to the ER with walking difficulties, pain, and confusion. He underwent neurological evaluation for dementia and was eventually diagnosed with possible Alzheimer's disease and a malignant plasmacytoma causing spinal cord compression. His CSF sample showed normal amyloid rate and very low Aβ. Following rehabilitation and oncological treatment, his walking ability and confusion improved. CONCLUSION: This case is unique as we demonstrate that spinal cord compression by plasmacytoma can lead to abnormal CSF levels of several known pathology markers for Alzheimer's disease and neuronal damage. We suggest that highly divergent amyloid CSF levels could be indicative of spinal pathologies affecting CSF circulation.

The aim of this paper is to stress the importance of a complete neuropsychological assessment, even at the initial stage of the disease, when instrumental examinations are not able to show cortical involvement and daily life activities have not been affected. The neuropsychological tests examined general cognition, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial and constructional ability, language, executive function, depression and functional autonomy. Results showed cognitive deficits in executive functions, above all in the control and inhibition of automatic response, planning and reasoning abilities, memory and visuoconstructional functions. However, these problems did not affect the patient's autonomy in everyday life. MRI scan showed the involvement of the cerebellum and the fibers of the pons and raphe, with normal cerebral ventricles and sulci. The cognitive deficits in our patient could be explained by a disruption in cerebrocerebellum connections between the frontal areas and the cerebellar structures.

This cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out in routine clinical practice using the Questionnaire of Memory Efficiency (QME) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	Six hundred sixty-one patients were recruited. The time since epilepsy diagnosis was 17.3 years (SD=12.5); the number of seizures in the past year 13.8 (SD=4.8); the proportion of patients free of seizures in the last year 42.5%; the proportion of patients with partial seizures 73.2%; and the proportion of patients on monotherapy 56.3%. Total QME score was 110.0 (SD=18.6). Depression and anxiety scores and polytherapy explained 38.7% of the QME variance.	Subjective memory functioning in this cohort of patients with epilepsy was relatively good.

Binge-eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating that are not associated with regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors. Overweight and obesity may be common complications. To explore the effectiveness and tolerability of topiramate in binge-eating disorder, we describe the response of 13 consecutive outpatients with binge-eating disorder to naturalistic, open-label treatment with topiramate. METHOD: The response of 13 female outpatients with binge-eating disorder by DSM-IV criteria to naturalistic, open-label treatment with topiramate (100-1400 mg/day) was reviewed. Response of binge-eating disorder symptoms was clinically assessed as none, mild, moderate, marked, or remission. Weight and side effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: All 13 patients had comorbid Axis I psychiatric disorders along with binge-eating disorder and were receiving psychotropic medications at the time of topiramate administration. After beginning topiramate treatment, 9 patients displayed a moderate or better response of binge-eating disorder symptoms that was maintained for periods ranging from 3 to 30 months (mean +/- SD = 18.7+/-8.0 months). Two other patients displayed moderate or marked responses that subsequently diminished. The remaining 2 patients had a mild or no response.

418,11379844,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,An open-label study of the treatment efficacy of olanzapine for Tourette's disorder,"BACKGROUND: An open-label trial was performed to explore efficacy and safety of olanzapine, an atypical neuroleptic with diverse receptor activity including both dopamine-2 and serotonin-2A and -2C antagonism, for treatment of Tourette's disorder. METHOD: Ten adult patients aged 20 to 44 years with Tourette's disorder were treated using an open-label, flexible dosing schedule for 8 weeks. Three patients who continued olanzapine were reevaluated after 6 months. Three subjects were psychotropic medication naive, 5 patients experienced intolerable side effects with conventional neuroleptics, and 2 patients had remote (> or = 10 years) successful response to conventional neuroleptics. Tic severity was rated by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale; weight, vital signs, and adverse effects were assessed weekly. Electrocardiogram, laboratory studies, and comorbid symptoms, assessed by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and ADHD Behavior Checklist for Adults, were measured at baseline and at week 8. RESULTS: Two of 10 patients prematurely discontinued olanzapine owing to excessive sedation. Of 8 patients who completed the 8-week trial, 4 (50%) demonstrated reduction of global tic severity scores by > or = 20 points, and 6 (75%) demonstrated reductions by > or = 10 points. No significant changes in comorbid symptoms were demonstrated. Sedation, weight gain, increased appetite, dry mouth, and transient asymptomatic hypoglycemia were the most common side effects. Tic improvements were maintained in 3 patients reassessed 6 months later. Final olanzapine dosages ranged from 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily (mean = 10.9 mg/day).

419,34477852,JAMA network open,Safety and Tolerability of Transdermal Cannabidiol Gel in Children With Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial,"IMPORTANCE: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are the most severe group of drug-resistant epilepsies. Alternatives to oral therapies are urgently needed to reduce seizures and improve developmental outcomes and comorbidities in this medically complex population. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol (CBD) transdermal gel in children with DEEs and to evaluate seizure frequency, sleep, and quality of life. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted in 2 centers in Australia and New Zealand from April 2018 to July 2019. Children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years with DEEs who were receiving a stable regimen of 1 to 4 antiseizure medications were eligible for this study. After 1-month baseline and titration periods, patients entered a 5.5-month flexible-dosing maintenance period for a total of 6.5 months of treatment. Data were analyzed throughout the 6.5-month treatment period. INTERVENTIONS: Twice-daily applications of CBD transdermal gel at doses of 125 to 500 mg for 6.5 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events (AEs) and examination of skin. The outcome for seizures was the median percentage change from baseline in monthly (28-day) seizure frequency of focal impaired awareness seizures (FIAS) and tonic-clonic seizures (TCS) over 6.5 months. RESULTS: Of 48 patients (mean [SD] age, 10.5 [3.8] years; 26 [54%] boys), 29 (60%) had at least 1 treatment-related AE over 6.5 months; 44 of 46 treatment-related AEs (96%) were mild or moderate. Treatment-related AEs that occurred in at least 5% of patients were application-site dryness, application-site pain, and somnolence (each reported by 4 patients [8%]). The only treatment-related gastrointestinal AE was diarrhea, reported in a single patient. CBD treatment was associated with reductions in FIAS and TCS frequency. Analysis of the 33 patients with FIAS and TCS showed a median (interquartile range) monthly reduction in seizures of 58% (-5.3% to 81.8%) at 5 months and 43.5% (-23.8% to 57.5%) over the entire 6.5-month study period. Parents and caregivers noted improvements in social or interpersonal engagement and irritability (33 of 43 [77%] participants); alertness, energy, and sleep (23 of 43 [53%]); and cognition or concentration (20 of 43 [47%]).

To assess the associations of tramadol, compared with codeine, with mortality and other adverse clinical outcomes as used in outpatient settings.	Retrospective, population-based, propensity score-matched cohort study using a primary care database with routinely collected medical records and pharmacy dispensations covering more than 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain (≈6 million people). Patients 18 years or older with 1 or more year of available data and dispensation of tramadol or codeine (2007-2017) were included and followed up to December 31, 2017.	New prescription dispensation of tramadol or codeine (no dispensation in the previous year).	Outcomes studied were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, constipation, delirium, falls, opioid abuse/dependence, and sleep disorders within 1 year after the first dispensation. Absolute rate differences (ARDs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using cause-specific Cox models.	Of the 1 093 064 patients with a tramadol or codeine dispensation during the study period (326 921 for tramadol, 762 492 for codeine, 3651 for both drugs concomitantly), a total of 368 960 patients (184 480 propensity score-matched pairs) were included after study exclusions and propensity score matching (mean age, 53.1 [SD, 16.1] years; 57.3% women). Compared with codeine, tramadol dispensation was significantly associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (incidence, 13.00 vs 5.61 per 1000 person-years; HR, 2.31 [95% CI, 2.08-2.56]; ARD, 7.37 [95% CI, 6.09-8.78] per 1000 person-years), cardiovascular events (incidence, 10.03 vs 8.67 per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.05-1.27]; ARD, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.45-2.36] per 1000 person-years), and fractures (incidence, 12.26 vs 8.13 per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.37-1.65]; ARD, 4.10 [95% CI, 3.02-5.29] per 1000 person-years). No significant difference was observed for the risk of falls, delirium, constipation, opioid abuse/dependence, or sleep disorders.

Deferoxamine metabolite analysis of urine for 24 hours after deferoxamine injection from sensitive and nonsensitive patients showed marked differences. Occurrence of side effects correlated with increased formation of a monoamine oxidase catalyzed (major) metabolite, MFO1.

Deferoxamine metabolite analysis of urine for 24 hours after deferoxamine injection from sensitive and nonsensitive patients showed marked differences. Occurrence of side effects correlated with increased formation of a monoamine oxidase catalyzed (major) metabolite, MFO1. The metabolite ratio, MFO1/total metabolites, plus parent drug (TOT) showed a bimodal distribution with a mean +/- SD value of 0.68 +/- 0.06 for the nonsensitive and 0.79 +/- 0.04 for sensitive patients. The MFO1/TOT ratio discriminates between sensitive and nonsensitive patients, and we suggest that the half difference mark between the two mean values (0.735) can be used as a predictor of side effects. Patients with a MFO1/TOT ratio of greater than 0.70 would be considered at risk and observed for onset of side effects. Patients with a MFO1/TOT ratio greater than 0.80 would be considered for immediate adjunct treatment with isoniazid or other monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</abstract>","{

428,21873835,The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,Differences in verbal memory performance in postmenopausal women receiving hormone therapy: 17β-estradiol versus conjugated equine estrogens,"OBJECTIVE: Much controversy exists and many questions remain unanswered about the effects of hormone therapy (HT) on cognition in postmenopausal women. There is growing evidence suggesting that HT compounds containing conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) have negative effects on cognition whereas 17β-estradiol (17β-E) either has positive or neutral effects. The present study sought to further examine this issue in a sample of postmenopausal women with risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional neuropsychological evaluation. SETTING: Academic research clinic. PARTICIPANTS: 68 healthy postmenopausal women (aged 49-68) receiving either 17β-E or CEE for at least one year with increased risk for AD. MEASUREMENTS: Neuropsychological test battery of the cognitive domains of attention/working memory/processing speed, verbal memory, visual memory, and executive functioning. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) showed significantly better verbal memory performance in women receiving 17β-E compared to women receiving CEE regardless of age, IQ, years of education, risk factors for AD (including APOE-ε4 carriership), duration of endogenous and exogenous estrogen exposure, concurrent progesterone use, or natural versus surgical menopause status. CONCLUSIONS: Verbal memory performance was better in postmenopausal women receiving 17β-E compared to CEE in a sample population of women with risk factors for AD. Genetic risk for AD as well as other confounds did not affect this finding. The results suggest a differential effect of HT type on verbal memory, with 17β-E being a preferential compound.

We hypothesized that low rates of lithium efflux (a potential manifestation of strong transport inhibition) would be associated with better clinical outcome of maintenance pharmacotherapy.

Outcome was categorized according to whether subjects completed 1 year of successful maintenance treatment (n = 10), experienced a recurrent affective episode (n = 8), or dropped out (n = 4). The kexch at the outset of the study was significantly lower (potentially because of greater transport inhibition) in 1-year completers than in patients with recurrences or those who dropped out (median kexch = 0.09, 0.24, and 0.27 h-1, respectively; P < .03).

433,31132877,Foot & ankle international,New Persistent Opioid Use and Associated Risk Factors Following Treatment of Ankle Fractures.,"The aim of this study was to define the rate of new persistent opioid use and risk factors for persistent opioid use after operative and nonoperative treatment of ankle fractures.	Using a nationwide insurance claims database, Clinformatics DataMart Database, we identified opioid-naïve patients who underwent surgical treatment of unstable ankle fracture patterns between January 2009 and June 2016. Patients who underwent closed treatment of a distal fibula fracture served as a comparative group. We evaluated peritreatment and posttreatment opioid prescription fills. The primary outcome, new persistent opioid use, was defined as opioid prescription fulfillment between 91 and 180 days after the procedure. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of patient factors, and the differences of the effect were tested using Wald statistics. The adjusted persistent use rates were calculated. A total of 13 088 patients underwent treatment of an ankle fracture and filled a peritreatment opioid prescription.	When compared with closed treatment of a distal fibula fracture, only 2 surgical treatment subtypes demonstrated significantly increased rates of persistent use compared with the closed treatment group: open treatment of bimalleolar ankle fracture (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.58; P = .002) and open treatment of trimalleolar ankle fracture with fixation of posterior lip (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04-2.07; P = .027). Rates were significantly increased (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.34-1.82; P < .001) among patients who received a total peritreatment opioid dose that was in the top 25th percentile of total oral morphine equivalents. Factors independently associated with new persistent opioid use included mental health disorders, comorbid conditions, tobacco use, and female sex.	All ankle fracture treatment groups demonstrated high rates of new persistent opioid use, and persistent use was not directly linked to injury severity. Instead, we identified patient factors that demonstrated increased risk of persistent opioid use. Limiting the peritreatment opioid dose was the largest modifiable risk factor related to new persistent opioid use in this privately insured cohort.

Cognition was investigated by means of objective assessment of executive functions (EpiTrack®) and verbal memory and by subjective ratings of self-perceived side effects (cognition, mood, and vegetative). Quality of life was assessed using the QOLIE-10 questionnaire. Patients underwent assessment at baseline and after a median follow-up interval of 32 weeks. Forty-four patients were treated with LCM, 11 with LTG, and 15 with TPM. Treatment arms differed with regard to the age at onset of epilepsy (LTG>TPM) and to seizure control from baseline to follow-up, which was best in patients whose seizures were treated with LTG (55% vs. 16% in patients whose seizures were treated with LCM and 13% in patients whose seizures were treated with TPM). Groups did not differ in the type of epilepsy, daily drug load or drug load change, nor in baseline seizure frequency. Repeated measures statistics controlling for epilepsy onset and seizure outcome showed deteriorated executive functions with TPM (F=7.5, p=0.001). On an individual level (reliable change indices), 53% of the patients whose seizures were treated with TPM showed losses in this domain (LCM 14%, LTG 27%) and none of the patients showed improvement (LCM 23%, LTG 27%; χ(2)=11.8, p=0.019). No differences in memory, quality of life, or mood were noted among patients in the three treatment arms. Subjective cognitive complaints increased in 5 of the 9 patients whose seizures were treated with TPM (LCM 1/9, LTG 0/9; χ(2)=11.9, p=0.025). The findings of this study demonstrate for the first time that the cognitive side effect profile of LCM is comparable to that of LTG and superior to that of TPM. This is indicated by both subjective and objective measures.

To explore factors associated with (a) intravenous OMT misuse, (b) repeated misuse, (c) emergency room (ER) admission, (d) misuse of different OMT types and (e) concurrent benzodiazepine misuse.	We recruited 3,620 patients in 27 addiction units in Italy and collected data on the self-reported rate of intravenous injection of methadone (MET), buprenorphine (BUP), BUP-naloxone (NLX), OMT dosage and type, experience of and reason for misuse, concurrent intravenous benzodiazepine misuse, pattern of -misuse in relation to admission to the addiction unit and ER -admissions because of misuse. According to inclusion/exclusion criteria, 2,585 patients were included.	Intravenous misuse of OMT substances was found in 28% of patients with no difference between OMT types and was associated with gender, age, type of previous opioid abuse and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. Repeated OMT misuse was reported by 20% (i.e., 71% of misusers) of patients and was associated with positive OMT misuse experience and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. Admission to the ER because of misuse complications was reported by 34% of patients, this outcome being associated with gender, employment, type of previous opioid abuse and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. OMT dosage was lower than the recommended maintenance dosage.	We offered new information on factors associated with intravenous OMT misuse, repeated misuse and ER admission in Italian patients under OMT. Our data indicate that BUP-NLX misuse is not different from that of BUP or MET. Choosing the more expensive BUP-NLX over MET will likely not lead to the expected reduction of the risk of injection misuse of the OMT. Instead of prescribing new and expensive OMT formulations, addiction unit physicians and medical personnel should better focus on patient's features that are associated with a higher likelihood of misuse. Care should be paid to concurrent benzodiazepine and OMT misuse.</abstract>","{

441,26513639,Forensic science international,Methadone related deaths compared to all prescription related deaths.,"Methadone is increasingly implicated in unintentional overdose deaths. Despite major interventions, rates continue to remain high. One primary intervention, Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) are limited in their ability to impact this epidemic due to federal law restricting Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) from sharing data to PDMPs, despite being a major source of Methadone dispensing.	This retrospective, observational study analyzed all prescription-related deaths occurring in San Diego County during the year 2013 with a specific focus on methadone-related deaths. All patients designated by medical examiner to have died by unintentional prescription were then referenced in the California PDMP, the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES).	As a whole, patients who died had a high number of average prescriptions, 21, and averaged 4.5 different providers, and three different pharmacies. Methadone-related deaths (MRD) accounted for 46 out of the 254 total patient deaths (18.1%). Methadone prescriptions were found in 14 patients with PDMP reports, 10 of who had methadone on toxicology report. Notably, 100% of methadone prescribed by primary care specialists. MRD patients were less likely to have toxicology reports matching PDMP data compared to other related drug deaths (20.6 vs. 61.2%, p<0.0001). Of the 46 methadone deaths, only 10 (29.4%) had prescriptions for methadone recorded in the database. Out of the 51 patients with only one drug recorded at death, methadone was most common (n=12; 23.5%). While all deaths had a notably high rate of chronic prescriptions at death (68.8% compared to 2% for all patients in CURES), there was no significant difference between MRD and other drug-related deaths (73.5 vs. 67.8%, p=0.68, respectively). MRD patients were less likely than other drug patients to have matching PDMP data without any illicit substance or alcohol (14.7 vs. 41.4%, p=0.003, respectively).	Methadone is a long-acting opioid that carries a higher risk profile than other opioids. In San Diego, the great majority of MRD had no data on methadone in the statewide PDMP database, bringing to question the restriction of OTP clinics from uploading information into the database.

Twenty female patients who underwent GONB with lidocaine were included in the study. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale (RLSSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and headache diary results before and after the treatment of the patients were compared.	We included 20 patients (all females) in our study. The mean age was 35.80 ± 8.82 years (range 24-50).

We reviewed patients with SIH who underwent EBP at a single hospital. Patients were assigned to group R (response after EBP) or group N (no response after EBP). We then analyzed the demographics, clinical characteristics, leakage site, leakage length, EBP injection level and distance from leakage site, and injected EBP volume.	Sixty-two patients were included in the analysis. The overall response rate to EBP was 59.7% (37 patients). The leakage length and injection distance from the leakage site did not differ between the two groups. Age, gender, body mass index, leakage site, and EBP volume did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Retrospective clinical data from 81 adult and paediatric epileptic patients with one trough VPA serum concentration per patient were analysed using NONMEM to estimate drug CL and determine the influence of different covariates. A qualification group of 20 epileptic children (3-13 years old) was used to evaluate the final model.	The population CL as estimated by base model (no covariates) was 0.581 l h(-1) with inter-individual variability (C.V. %) of 17.4% and SD of residual error was 6.82 mg l(-1). Univariate selection and backward deletion of different covariates led to the development of the final regression model of CL as follows: CL(Lh-1) = 0.101 + 0.151 * CBZ + 0.000248 * VPADD + 0.0968 * age/20 + 0.0803 * INDI, in which CBZ indicates co-administration of carbamazepine, VPADD the daily dose of VPA and INDI uncontrolled epilepsy.

Little is known about treatment outcomes in patients receiving RLAI in clinical practice. METHOD: All prescribers in the South London and Maudsley Trust, London, United Kingdom, were informed that RLAI could be ordered for suitable patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder: those known to be noncompliant with oral atypical antipsychotics and those intolerant of the adverse effects of conventional depot antipsychotics. Prescribers provided treatment and clinical progress data at the time of each prescription. Data collected included reason for prescribing RLAI, Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) score, inpatient or out-patient status, and details of all medications prescribed. All treatment discontinuations were investigated. The study was conducted from August 2002 to August 2003. RESULTS: Outcome could be determined for 100 subjects. Seventy-nine subjects (79%) were hospitalized when RLAI was initially prescribed. Mean duration of stay before RLAI initiation was 97 days (range, 0-1492 days). Most subjects were switched to RLAI from oral atypical (58%) or conventional depot (28%) antipsychotics. The main reason given for prescribing RLAI was poor patient acceptability of previous treatments (79%). Overall, 51% of the subjects discontinued RLAI. The main reason for discontinuation was lack of effect (24 subjects). No patient-related factor predicted outcome. CGI scores improved from a mean of 4.7 to 3.6 over the study period (p <.001). Overall, 61 subjects (61%) showed an improvement in CGI scores between baseline and endpoint. Antipsychotic coprescriptions were reduced from 71% of subjects to 8%. In completers, 23 (61%) of 38 subjects beginning RLAI as inpatients were discharged. The modal dose of RLAI was 25 mg every 2 weeks.

Standardized behavioral assays that measure the preference of mice for initiating social interactions with novel conspecifics would be of great value for mutant mouse models of autism. We developed a new procedure to assess sociability and the preference for social novelty in mice. To quantitate sociability, each mouse was scored on measures of exploration in a central habituated area, a side chamber containing an unfamiliar conspecific (stranger 1) in a wire cage, or an empty side chamber. In a secondary test, preference for social novelty was quantitated by presenting the test mouse with a choice between the first, now-familiar, conspecific (stranger 1) in one side chamber, and a second unfamiliar mouse (stranger 2) in the other side chamber. Parameters scored included time spent in each chamber and number of entries into the chambers. Five inbred strains of mice were tested, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, A/J and B6129PF2/J hybrids.

Selective involvement of restricted neuronal populations is highly unusual in ceroid lipofuscinoses. It remains to be determined if the present neurodegenerative disease is caused by a primary or secondary neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.</abstract>","{

454,36724557,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,"Human MECP2 transgenic rats show increased anxiety, severe social deficits, and abnormal prefrontal neural oscillation stability","Methylated CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) plays an important role in the development and normal function of the neural system. Abnormally high expression of MECP2 leads to a subtype of autism called MECP2 duplication syndrome and MECP2 is considered one of the key pathogenic genes for autism spectrum disorders. However, the effect of MECP2 overexpression on neural activity is still not fully understood. Thus, transgenic (TG) animals that abnormally overexpress MeCP2 are important disease models in research on neurological function and autism. To create an animal model with a stronger and more stable autism phenotype, this study established a human MECP2 TG rat model and evaluated its movement ability, anxiety, and social behavior through behavioral tests. The results showed that MECP2 TG rats had an abnormally increased anxiety phenotype and social deficits in terms of abnormal social approach and social novelty preference, but no movement disorder. These autism-like behavioral phenotypes suggest that human MECP2 TG rats are suitable models for studying autism as they show more severe social deficit phenotypes and without interference from movement disorders affecting other phenotypes, which is an issue for mouse models with MECP2 duplication. In addition, this study performed preliminary exploration of the influence of the human MECP2 transgene on neural oscillation stability of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which is an important brain region for social interactions. Oscillation stability in MECP2 TG rats showed abnormal responses to social conditions. Overall, the results of this study provide a new research tool for understanding the mechanism of social impairment and treatment of autism. The results also provide evidence for the influence of MECP2 duplication on mPFC neural activity.",Axiety| MECP2| Neural oscillation| Social deficit| Transgenic rat,Animal-other,5,1,"<journal>Biochemical and biophysical research communications</journal><title>Human MECP2 transgenic rats show increased anxiety, severe social deficits, and abnormal prefrontal neural oscillation stability</title><abstract>Methylated CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) plays an important role in the development and normal function of the neural system.

Although several AD mouse models have been developed representing relevant pathologies, only a fraction of available mouse models, like the Tg4-42 mouse model, display hippocampal atrophy caused by the death of neurons as the key feature of AD. The Tg4-42 mouse model is therefore very valuable for use in preclinical research. Furthermore, metabolic biomarkers which have the potential to detect biochemical changes, are crucial to gain deeper insights into the pathways, the underlying pathological mechanisms and disease progression. OBJECTIVE: We thus performed an in-depth characterization of Tg4-42 mice by using an integrated approach to analyze alterations of complex biological networks in this AD in vivo model. METHODS: Therefore, untargeted NMR-based metabolomic phenotyping was combined with behavioral tests and immunohistological and biochemical analyses. RESULTS: Our in vivo experiments demonstrate a loss of body weight increase in homozygous Tg4-42 mice over time as well as severe impaired learning behavior and memory deficits in the Morris water maze behavioral test. Furthermore, we found significantly altered metabolites in two different brain regions and metabolic changes of the glutamate/4-aminobutyrate-glutamine axis. Based on these results, downstream effects were analyzed showing increased Aβ42 levels, increased neuroinflammation as indicated by increased astro- and microgliosis as well as neuronal degeneration and neuronal loss in homozygous Tg4-42 mice. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive characterization of the Tg4-42 mouse model which could lead to a deeper understanding of pathological features of AD.

456,37578236,Journal of virology,The La Crosse virus class II fusion glycoprotein ij loop contributes to infectivity and replication in vitro and in vivo.,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are an emerging and evolving global public health threat, with limited antiviral treatments or vaccines available. La Crosse virus (LACV) from the Bunyavirales order is responsible for pediatric encephalitis cases in the United States, yet little is known about the infectivity of LACV. Given the structural similarities between class II fusion glycoproteins of LACV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus from the Togaviridae family, we hypothesized that LACV would share similar entry mechanisms with CHIKV. To test this hypothesis, we performed cholesterol-depletion and repletion assays and used cholesterol-modulating compounds to study LACV entry and replication. We found that LACV entry was cholesterol dependent, while replication was less affected by cholesterol manipulation. In addition, we generated single-point mutants in the LACV Gc ij loop that corresponded to known CHIKV residues important for virus entry. We found that a conserved histidine and alanine residue in the Gc ij loop impaired virus infectivity and attenuated LACV replication in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we took an evolution-based approach to explore how the LACV glycoprotein evolves in mosquitoes and mice. We found multiple variants that cluster in the Gc glycoprotein head domain, providing evidence for the Gc glycoprotein as a contributor to LACV adaptation. Together, these results begin to characterize the mechanisms of LACV infectivity and how the LACV glycoprotein contributes to replication and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Vector-borne viruses are significant health threats that lead to devastating disease worldwide. The emergence of arboviruses, in addition to the lack of effective antivirals or vaccines, highlights the need to study how arboviruses replicate at the molecular level. One potential antiviral target is the class II fusion glycoprotein. Alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and bunyaviruses encode a class II fusion glycoprotein that contains strong structural similarities at the tip of domain II. Here, we show that the bunyavirus La Crosse virus uses a cholesterol-dependent entry pathway similar to the alphavirus chikungunya virus, and residues in the ij loop are important for virus infectivity in vitro and replication in mice. These studies show that genetically diverse viruses may use similar pathways through conserved structure domains, suggesting that these viruses may be targets for broad-spectrum antivirals in multiple arboviral families.",La Crosse| adaptation| bunyavirus| entry| glycoprotein,Animal-other,5,1,"<journal>Journal of virology</journal><title>The La Crosse virus class II fusion glycoprotein ij loop contributes to infectivity and replication in vitro and in vivo.</title><abstract>Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are an emerging and evolving global public health threat, with limited antiviral treatments or vaccines available.

RESULTS: Data from the biochemical and behavioral studies showed that DE models were successful induced in streptozotocin treatment animals and KK-Ay mice. Gnao1 was down regulated in the brain tissues of these two diabetes animal models with significant cognition deficiency. It suggested that the changes in DE are also related to dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study also showed that the expression of adrenergic α2 receptor (Adr-α2R), the upstream protein of Gnao1, was decreased in DE animal models. Furthermore, many downstream proteins of Gnao1 also altered, among which cAMP and PKA proteins were increased, CREB and BDNF proteins were decreased both in animal models and in the cell levels. In addition, Gnao1 silencing leads to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the decreased proliferation in cultured primary astrocytes, which means that the deficiency of Gnao1 might not be benefit for DE.

The suggested roles of noncoding RNAs in pathology led us to perform a comparative analysis of the microRNAs expressed in the serum of human ASD patients. The analysis of a cohort of 45 children with ASD revealed that six microRNAs (miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-3613-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-499a-5p) were expressed at low to very low levels compared to those in healthy controls. A similar but less pronounced decrease was registered in the clinically unaffected parents of the sick children and in their siblings but never in any genetically unrelated control. Results consistent with these observations were obtained in the blood, hypothalamus and sperm of two of the established mouse models of ASD: valproic acid-treated animals and Cc2d1a[+/-] heterozygotes. In both instances, the same characteristic miRNA profile was evidenced in the affected individuals and inherited together with disease symptoms in the progeny of crosses with healthy animals. The consistent association of these genetic regulatory changes with the disease provides a starting point for evaluating the changes in the activity of the target genes and, thus, the underlying mechanism(s).

460,35410629,Acta neuropathologica communications,Mapping of neuroinflammation-induced hypoxia in the spinal cord using optoacoustic imaging.,"Recent studies suggest that metabolic changes and oxygen deficiency in the central nervous system play an important role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). In our present study, we investigated the changes in oxygenation and analyzed the vascular perfusion of the spinal cord in a rodent model of MS. We performed multispectral optoacoustic tomography of the lumbar spinal cord before and after an oxygen enhancement challenge in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. In addition, mice were transcardially perfused with lectin to label the vasculature and their spinal columns were optically cleared, followed by light sheet fluorescence microscopy. To analyze the angioarchitecture of the intact spine, we used VesSAP, a novel deep learning-based framework. In EAE mice, the spinal cord had lower oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration compared to healthy mice, indicating compromised perfusion of the spinal cord. Oxygen administration reversed hypoxia in the spinal cord of EAE mice, although the ventral region remained hypoxic.

461,28552947,PloS one,Relationship of mechanical impact magnitude to neurologic dysfunction severity in a rat traumatic brain injury model.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major brain injury type commonly caused by traffic accidents, falls, violence, or sports injuries. To obtain mechanistic insights about TBI, experimental animal models such as weight-drop-induced TBI in rats have been developed to mimic closed-head injury in humans. However, the relationship between the mechanical impact level and neurological severity following weight-drop-induced TBI remains uncertain. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the relationship between physical impact and graded severity at various weight-drop heights.	The acceleration, impact force, and displacement during the impact were accurately measured using an accelerometer, a pressure sensor, and a high-speed camera, respectively. In addition, the longitudinal changes in neurological deficits and balance function were investigated at 1, 4, and 7 days post TBI lesion. The inflammatory expression markers tested by Western blot analysis, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, beta-amyloid precursor protein, and bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X, in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were investigated at 1 and 7 days post-lesion.	Gradations in impact pressure produced progressive degrees of injury severity in the neurological score and balance function. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all inflammatory expression markers were increased at 1 and 7 days post-impact injury when compared to the sham control rats. The severity of neurologic dysfunction and induction in inflammatory markers strongly correlated with the graded mechanical impact levels.

As rodents do not normally develop Aβ pathology, various transgenic animal models of AD were designed to overexpress human APP with mutations favouring its amyloidogenic processing. However, these mouse models display tremendous differences in the spatial and temporal appearance of Aβ deposits, synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration and the manifestation of learning deficits which may be caused by age-related and brain region-specific differences in APP transgene levels. Consequentially, a comparative temporal and regional analysis of the pathological effects of Aβ in mouse brains is difficult complicating the validation of therapeutic AD treatment strategies in different mouse models. To date, no antibodies are available that properly discriminate endogenous rodent and transgenic human APP in brains of APP-transgenic animals. Here, we developed and characterized rat monoclonal antibodies by immunohistochemistry and Western blot that detect human but not murine APP in brains of three APP-transgenic mouse and one APP-transgenic rat model. We observed remarkable differences in expression levels and brain region-specific expression of human APP among the investigated transgenic mouse lines. This may explain the differences between APP-transgenic models mentioned above.

Using mouse tissue qPCR assays we observe changes in the expression levels of 41 lncRNAs in AD mice of which only 7 genes happen to have both human orthologs and AD associations. Post validation of these 7 human lncRNA genes, MEG3 and MALAT1 shows consistent and significant decrease in AD cell, animal models and human AD brain tissues, but MALAT1 showed a more pronounced decrease.

We confirm and extend previous observations of virus persistence in the brain, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, thyroid and reticuloendothelial system. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time persistence of viral nucleic acid in specific cell types in the thymus, lymph nodes, testes and bladder, and the adrenal, parathyroid and salivary glands; the cell types infected were observed in several animals.

The relationships between the initial changes of myocardial workload, hemodynamic deterioration, and myocardial histological changes caused by acute induction of brain death are unclear. Cats (n = 15) were submitted to brain death by rapid inflation of an intracranial balloon. A further 12 cats served as a sham-operated control group. The changes in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, LV dP/dtmax, rate-pressure product (RPP), and circulating noradrenaline and adrenaline were studied during 240 min after the induction of brain death. Central venous pressure was kept constant. The hearts were histologically examined afterward. Electrocerebral activity disappeared within 30 sec after balloon inflation. At 3 min, noradrenaline and adrenaline levels had increased 75- and 40-fold, respectively, compared to pre-induction levels. The hemodynamic response was characterized by an early and rapid increase of hemodynamic variables at 2.9 +/- 0.2 min. This was followed by a second phase of normalization or deterioration. Two distinct subgroups (n = 9) became hemodynamically unstable (HDU), characterized by a systolic arterial blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, at 108 +/- 29 min, and progressively deteriorated to 67 +/- 8 mm Hg at 240 min after inflation of the balloon. The hemodynamic variables of the other, hemodynamically stable (HDS), subgroup (n = 6) normalized at 60 min after inflation. Hemodynamic deterioration of the HDU subgroup compared to the HDS subgroup was significant at 10 min after induction of brain death. The maximum values of RPP were similar in the two subgroups.

474,15680341,Brain research,The effect of central cholinergic and noradrenergic denervation on hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth and apoptosis-like reactivity in the rat.,"In this study, the effect of intraseptal injection of specific cholinotoxin 192-IgG saporin (SAP) +/- intraperitoneal injection of N-[chloroethyl]-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) (noradrenergic fiber neurotoxin) was examined in rat hippocampus. Medial septal lesions resulted not only in selective cholinergic denervation of hippocampus (Medial septal lesion + ganglionectomy; SAP + Gx) but also in hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth (IG) of adrenergic fibers (Medial septal lesion + sham ganglionectomy; SAP + IG). Saporin-induced septal lesions produced a significant reduction in hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity in all tested groups (SAP + IG +/- DSP-4 and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4), and an increase in noradrenaline concentration in the SAP + IG group. Visualization of noradrenergic fibers by histofluorescence revealed a mixture of fine and thick varicosities in the SAP + IG but only fine fibers in control and SAP + Gx animals. SAP + IG + DSP-4 lesions produced significant reduction in noradrenaline concentration in all groups with a concomitant decrease in visualization of central noradrenergic fibers in dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Treatment of SAP + IG animals with DSP-4 left mostly thick fibers, probably derived from peripheral sympathetic ingrowth. No fluorescence was seen in either the control + DSP-4 or SAP + Gx + DSP-4 animals. Apoptotic-like changes, using in situ oligonucleotide ligation techniques, were also assessed. Proapoptotic changes were seen in the SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 group as compared to CON +/- DSP-4 groups. SAP + IG regardless of DSP-4 treatment protected hippocampal cells from apoptotic cell death when compared to positive control and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 groups. In summary, elevated noradrenaline concentration following specific cholinergic denervation probably reflects compensatory hippocampal ingrowth originating from the peripheral sympathetic system which may be responsible for neuroprotective effects, i.e., antiapoptosis-like effect. Since cholinergic and noradrenergic systems are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive function, knowing how these neurotransmitters work after specific lesions may be of importance as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease and as a potential target for Alzheimer's disease drug therapies.",,Animal-other,5,1,"<journal>Brain research</journal><title>The effect of central cholinergic and noradrenergic denervation on hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth and apoptosis-like reactivity in the rat.</title><abstract>In this study, the effect of intraseptal injection of specific cholinotoxin 192-IgG saporin (SAP) +/- intraperitoneal injection of N-[chloroethyl]-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) (noradrenergic fiber neurotoxin) was examined in rat hippocampus.

Saporin-induced septal lesions produced a significant reduction in hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity in all tested groups (SAP + IG +/- DSP-4 and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4), and an increase in noradrenaline concentration in the SAP + IG group. Visualization of noradrenergic fibers by histofluorescence revealed a mixture of fine and thick varicosities in the SAP + IG but only fine fibers in control and SAP + Gx animals. SAP + IG + DSP-4 lesions produced significant reduction in noradrenaline concentration in all groups with a concomitant decrease in visualization of central noradrenergic fibers in dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Treatment of SAP + IG animals with DSP-4 left mostly thick fibers, probably derived from peripheral sympathetic ingrowth. No fluorescence was seen in either the control + DSP-4 or SAP + Gx + DSP-4 animals. Apoptotic-like changes, using in situ oligonucleotide ligation techniques, were also assessed. Proapoptotic changes were seen in the SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 group as compared to CON +/- DSP-4 groups. SAP + IG regardless of DSP-4 treatment protected hippocampal cells from apoptotic cell death when compared to positive control and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 groups. In summary, elevated noradrenaline concentration following specific cholinergic denervation probably reflects compensatory hippocampal ingrowth originating from the peripheral sympathetic system which may be responsible for neuroprotective effects, i.e., antiapoptosis-like effect. Since cholinergic and noradrenergic systems are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive function, knowing how these neurotransmitters work after specific lesions may be of importance as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease and as a potential target for Alzheimer's disease drug therapies.</abstract>","{

In this study, C57Bl/6J mice were injected intracerebrally with [3H]inositol, and poly-PI turnover in brain was assessed by determining the levels of labeled inositol monophosphates (IP1) accumulated after intraperitoneal injection of LiCl (6 meq/kg body weight) 4 hr before killing. Using this experimental protocol, acute ethanol administration (by gavage) resulted in time- and dose-dependent decreases in the levels of labeled IP1 in both cerebrum and cerebellum as compared with controls. The ethanol-induced decrease in labeled IP1 correlated well with the decrease in levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (as measured by the radioreceptor assay) and the increase in blood ethanol concentration. Despite a 4-fold higher accumulation of labeled IP1 in the cerebrum compared with the cerebellum, there were no major differences in the steady-state levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (based on tissue weight) in either brain region. Intraperitoneal injection of atropine (50 mg/kg) (a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist) to the lithium-treated mice resulted in a 34% decrease in labeled IP1 as compared with controls. This result suggests that a substantial proportion of the signals transduced were due to activation of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor.

Although reduced cerebral blood flow is an early and persistent symptom that precedes the loss of cognitive function in AD, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. The present study investigated whether capillary endothelial inward rectifier potassium 2 (Kir2.1) expression is reduced in TgF344-AD (AD) rats and contributes to neurovascular uncoupling and cognitive deficits in AD. Three- to fourteen-month-old AD rats expressing mutant human APP and PS1 and age-matched wild-type (WT) F344 rats were studied. AD rats exhibited higher amyloid beta (Aβ) expression in the brain as early as 3 months of age and amyloid plaques by 4 months of age. Functional hyperemic responses induced by whisker stimulation were impaired at 4 months of age, which were exacerbated in 6-month- and 14-month-old AD rats.

The working memory error decreased significantly in the mice grafted with neurospheres. In contrast, the ES cells developed into teratomas in all of the control mice and expressed no neurons, and the working memory deteriorated remarkably. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of neurospheres, but not ES cells, into the prefrontal and parietal cortices, dramatically alleviated the cholinergic deficits and recent memory disruption in the NBM lesioned mice.</abstract>","{

482,36370926,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,Intermittent fasting protects the nigral dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-mediated dopaminergic neuronal injury in mice.,"Dietary restriction through low-calorie intake or intermittent fasting benefits many organs, including the brain. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of fasting in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We found that fasting every other day rather than weekly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor in the nigrostriatal pathway. Therefore, we maintained the animals on alternate-day fasting for 2 weeks and injected MPTP (30 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) for five days. We observed that alternate-day fasting attenuated MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss and astroglial activation in the substantia nigra and the striatum. Moreover, neurochemical analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography showed that alternate-day fasting reduced MPTP-induced depletion of striatal dopamine. Consistent with these results, behavioral tests showed that fasting suppressed the motor impairment caused by MPTP. Furthermore, fasting increased the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B, which are downstream signaling molecules of neurotrophic factors. Fasting also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein, further supporting the involvement of neurotrophic factors in the observed neuroprotective effects. Hence, our results demonstrated the dopaminergic neuroprotection of intermittent fasting in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, supporting the idea that fasting could be an instrumental tool for preventing neurodegeneration in the brain.","1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine| Fasting| Parkinson's disease| brain-derived neurotrophic factor| glial-derived neurotrophic factor",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1,"<journal>The Journal of nutritional biochemistry</journal><title>Intermittent fasting protects the nigral dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-mediated dopaminergic neuronal injury in mice.</title><abstract>Dietary restriction through low-calorie intake or intermittent fasting benefits many organs, including the brain.

A focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model on Macaca mulatta was performed with a modified middle cerebral artery occlusion method.

Major altered genes were upregulated, including signal transduction-, cell-cycle-, metabolism-, stress response-, DNA repair-related genes. One of the representative upregulated genes encodes insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was confirmed using in situ hybridization. Results showed that after ischemia/reperfusion injury, IGF-1 mRNA expression decreased in ipsilateral striatum, whereas increased in ipsilateral hippocampus. No expression changes were observed in cortex. EA treatment could obviously upregulate the IGF-1 mRNA expression in striatum, and further enhance its expression in hippocampus. Therefore, the data presented suggest a possible mediator underlying the mechanisms of anti-ischemic effect of acupuncture.

Results showed that after ischemia/reperfusion injury, IGF-1 mRNA expression decreased in ipsilateral striatum, whereas increased in ipsilateral hippocampus. No expression changes were observed in cortex. EA treatment could obviously upregulate the IGF-1 mRNA expression in striatum, and further enhance its expression in hippocampus. Therefore, the data presented suggest a possible mediator underlying the mechanisms of anti-ischemic effect of acupuncture. In conclusion, the protective mechanisms of EA against stroke include several related pathways and gene expressions. Microarray analysis may provide a framework for understanding these complicated mechanisms and yield valuable, clinically relevant insights and potentially therapeutic targets of stroke.</abstract>","{

490,23939879,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",Transplants of adult mesenchymal and neural stem cells provide neuroprotection and behavioral sparing in a transgenic rat model of Huntington's disease,"Stem cells have gained significant interest as a potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). One source of these cells is adult neural stem cells (aNSCs), which differentiate easily into neuronal lineages. However, these cells are vulnerable to immune responses following transplantation. Another source is bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release neurotrophic factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines following transplantation, and are less vulnerable to rejection. The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of transplants of MSCs, aNSCs, or cotransplants of MSCs and aNSCs for reducing deficits in a transgenic rat model of HD. HD rats received intrastriatal transplantations of 400,000 MSCs, aNSCs, or a combination of MSCs/aNSCs, while wild-type and HD controls were given vehicle. Rats were tested on the rotarod over the course of 20 weeks. The results indicated that transplants of: (a) aNSCs produced a strong immune response and conferred short-term behavioral benefits; (b) MSCs elicited a relatively weak immune response, and provided a longer term behavioral benefit; and (c) combined MSCs and aNSCs conferred long-term behavioral benefits and increased survival of the transplanted aNSCs. The finding that cotransplanting MSCs with aNSCs can prolong aNSC survival and provide greater behavioral sparing than when the transplants contains only aNSCs suggests that MSCs are capable of creating a more suitable microenvironment for aNSC survival. This cotransplantation strategy may be useful as a future therapeutic option for treating HD, especially if long-term survival of differentiated cells proves to be critically important for preserving lasting functional outcomes.",Mesenchymal stem cells| Neural stem cells| Rat model| Stem cell microenvironment interactions| Stem cell transplantation,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1,"<journal>Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)</journal><title>Transplants of adult mesenchymal and neural stem cells provide neuroprotection and behavioral sparing in a transgenic rat model of Huntington's disease</title><abstract>Stem cells have gained significant interest as a potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD).

Here, we used in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy to track changes in β-amyloid plaque sizes in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease after one focused ultrasound treatment. We found that one treatment reduced plaques to 62 ± 16% (p ≤ 0.001) of their original volume two days post-sonication; this decrease in size persisted for two weeks. We then sought to evaluate the effectiveness of biweekly focused ultrasound treatments using magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatments. Three to five biweekly treatments resulted in a 27 ± 7% (p ≤ 0.01) decrease in plaque number and 40 ± 10% (p ≤ 0.01) decrease in plaque surface area compared to untreated littermates.

496,25402009,Developmental neuroscience,Spontaneous pre-existing hypoxia does not affect brain damage after global cerebral ischaemia in late-gestation fetal sheep.,"There is considerable evidence that a mild, non-injurious insult can protect (precondition) against a subsequent injurious insult. Typically, protection is seen when the gap between insults is several days to a week. However, the effect of mild but persistent hypoxia is unknown.

497,25037206,Neurology,Naltrexone for impulse control disorders in Parkinson disease: a placebo-controlled study,"OBJECTIVE: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson disease (PD) are common and can be difficult to manage. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, for the treatment of ICDs in PD. METHODS: Patients with PD (n = 50) and an ICD were enrolled in an 8-week, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study of naltrexone 50-100 mg/d (flexible dosing). The primary outcome measure was response based on the Clinical Global Impression-Change score, and the secondary outcome measure was change in symptom severity using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) ICD score. RESULTS: Forty-five patients (90%) completed the study. The Clinical Global Impression-Change response rate difference favoring naltrexone in completers was 19.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] -8.7% to 44.2%). While this difference was not significant (odds ratio=1.6, 95% CI 0.5-5.2, Wald χ2 [df]=0.5 [1], p=0.5), naltrexone treatment led to a significantly greater decrease in QUIP-RS ICD score over time compared with placebo (regression coefficient for interaction term in linear mixed-effects model=-7.37, F[df]=4.3 [1, 49], p=0.04). The estimated changes in QUIP-RS ICD scores from baseline to week 8 were 14.9 points (95% CI 9.9-19.9) for naltrexone and 7.5 points (95% CI 2.5-12.6) for placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Naltrexone treatment was not efficacious for the treatment of ICDs in PD using a global assessment of response, but findings using a PD-specific ICD rating scale support further evaluation of opioid antagonists for the treatment of ICD symptoms in PD. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with PD and an ICD, naltrexone does not significantly increase the probability of achieving response.

The HGEU Study Group","BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) commonly exhibit psychosis and behavioral disturbances that impair patient functioning, create caregiver distress, and lead to institutionalization. This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in treating psychosis and/or agitation/aggression in patients with AD. METHODS: A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week study was conducted in 206 elderly US nursing home residents with AD who exhibited psychotic and/or behavioral symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or a fixed dose of 5, 10, or 15 mg/d of olanzapine. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of the Agitation/Aggression, Hallucinations, and Delusions items (Core Total) of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version. RESULTS: Low-dose olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/d) produced significant improvement compared with placebo on the Core Total (-7.6 vs -3.7 [P<.001] and -6.1 vs -3. 7 [P =.006], respectively). Core Total improvement with olanzapine, 15 mg/d, was not significantly greater than placebo. The Occupational Disruptiveness score, reflecting the impact of patients' psychosis and behavioral disturbances on the caregiver, was significantly reduced in the 5-mg/d olanzapine group compared with placebo (-2.7 vs -1.5; P =.008). Somnolence was significantly more common among patients receiving olanzapine (25.0%-35.8%), and gait disturbance occurred in those receiving 5 or 15 mg/d (19.6% and 17.0%, respectively). No significant cognitive impairment, increase in extrapyramidal symptoms, or central anticholinergic effects were found at any olanzapine dose relative to placebo.

METHODS: In a double-blind, cross-over trial, patients with HD were randomly assigned to start treatment on either (-)-OSU6162 or placebo. After 4 weeks, those patients who initially received active drug were switched to placebo for another 4 weeks, and vice versa. During the first week the (-)-OSU6162 dose was 15 mg twice daily, during the second week 30 mg twice daily, and during the last 2 weeks 45 mg twice daily.

The aetiology of EDS is probably multifactorial but is probably exacerbated by dopaminergic medications. Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent approved for use in narcolepsy, but it is often used to treat a variety of somnolent conditions. METHOD: A double blind, placebo controlled parallel design trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of modafinil (200-400 mg/day) for the treatment of EDS in PD. The primary efficacy measure was the Epworth Sleepiness (ES) scale score.

A total of 88 children, 5-14 years old, diagnosed with PMNE were enrolled in this randomized control trial (RCT) from June 2017 to June 2020. After informed written consent patients were randomized to one of the two therapeutic groups. Group 1 received one puff of desmopressin nasal spray 1 h before bedtime every night. Group 2 received one pill of solifenacin 5 mg plus one puff of desmopressin nasal spray 1 h before bedtime every night. All patients were evaluated after three months for their response to treatment and drug side effects.

508,24994555,Schizophrenia research,"Efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in Chinese Han schizophrenia subjects: a randomized, double-blind, active parallel-controlled, multicenter clinical trial","OBJECTIVE: Antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole and risperidone, are often used to treat individuals with schizophrenia. The efficacy as well as safety of aripiprazole in Western populations has been described. The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole and risperidone in Chinese Han schizophrenia subjects in mainland China. METHOD: The 6-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel study was conducted in 5 medical centers in mainland China from November 2007 to March 2011. A total of 279 subjects with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were randomly assigned (with a randomization ratio of 1:1) to aripiprazole (n=139) or risperidone (n=140). Efficacy measurements included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, positive, negative and general psychopathology subscale scores, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and Improvement scale scores. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), weight gain, serum prolactin level, QTc interval, and self-reported adverse events were also assessed as measures of safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Both the aripiprazole and risperidone groups showed statistically significant improvement of PANSS total, positive, negative, general psychopathology subscale scores, and CGI-S scores from baseline to the endpoint (all p<0.01). Significant improvement was noted in the first week for both treatment groups. There were no significant differences in efficacy measurements between the two treatment groups. Mean change of PANSS total scores from baseline to the endpoint was -26.8±18.1 for aripiprazole and -30.0±17.7 for risperidone, (p=0.1475). The responder rate was 71% (n=99) and 76% (n=107) for aripiprazole and risperidone, respectively, (p=0.323). The incidences of EPS were similar in the aripiprazole (25%, n=35) and risperidone groups (24%, n=34), respectively (p=0.757). No clinically meaningful effects on QTc interval, QRS duration, or PR interval were observed in either treatment groups. However, the incidence of clinically significant weight gain (p=0.0118) and hyperprolactinemia (p<0.001) in the aripiprazole group was significantly lower than in the risperidone group. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that aripiprazole, as well as risperidone, had rapid and persistent efficacy for psychotic symptoms from the first week of therapy. There may be poor efficacy for aripiprazole compared with risperidone for overall improvement, but there were no significant differences in this study. Aripiprazole showed good tolerability with less weight gain and hyperprolactinemia compared with risperidone.

METHODS: 12 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and six controls were studied. The patients underwent ADAS-COG psychometric assessment and SPECT brain imaging with (123)I quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), to demonstrate the postsynaptic muscarinic M1 receptor, before being randomised in a double blind study to receive either an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil) or placebo for four months. Following this, the ADAS-COG and the (123)I-QNB receptor scan were repeated. The controls were imaged on one occasion only. All image analyses were undertaken using SPM99. RESULTS: (123)I-QNB imaging showed a significant relation between baseline psychometric impairment and deficits on scanning. Both placebo and actively treated groups had reductions in (123)I-QNB uptake. Greater reductions in receptor binding were demonstrated in the placebo group than in those receiving active treatment. Intraindividual reproducibility of the (123)I-QNB imaging technique appeared highly robust.

511,15960563,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Double-blind comparison of sertraline and placebo in stroke patients with minor depression and less severe major depression,"BACKGROUND: Poststroke depression is a frequent condition and important to treat. The aim of this trial was to study the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline. METHOD: In 4 Swedish stroke centers, 123 patients (aged 70.7 +/- 9.9 years) were enrolled during the period September 1998 to January 2001 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 26-week trial, at a mean of 128 +/- 97 days (range, 3-375 days) after stroke, if they fulfilled DSM-IV criteria of major depressive episode (N = 76) or minor depressive disorder (N = 47). The primary efficacy variable was a change in depression assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. The Emotional Distress Scale (EDS) was administered and the occurrence of emotionalism and quality of life (QoL) were assessed, as well as neurologic recovery. Efficacy analyses were intention-to-treat, short-term (week 6) and long-term (week 26). RESULTS: Of the 123 patients, 62 were treated with sertraline (50-100 mg/day) and 61 with placebo. Both groups improved substantially, with no differences between the treatments, either for major depressive episode or minor depressive disorder, or for short- or long-term antidepressant effect and neurologic outcome. EDS revealed a better outcome with sertraline at week 6 (p < .05). At week 26, the improvement in QoL was better in sertraline patients (p < .05) and there was a trend for emotionalism (p = .07). No serious side effects were seen. CONCLUSION: Poststroke depression as measured by a conventional depression rating scale improved over time irrespective of treatment.

512,27965787,Pilot and feasibility studies,CanWalk: study protocol for a randomized feasibility trial of a walking intervention for people with recurrent or metastatic cancer,"BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of people in the UK are living with recurrent or metastatic cancer, many of whom experience reduced quality of life resulting from the physical and psychosocial consequences of cancer and its treatment. While drug treatments are important at alleviating some symptoms, there is increasing evidence of the benefits of exercise in enhancing quality of life and health outcomes. Walking is an inexpensive and accessible form of exercise. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated whether a walking intervention is sufficient to enhance quality of life and alleviate symptoms in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer across a range of tumor types. This paper describes the CanWalk study protocol, which aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of undertaking a randomized controlled trial of a community-based walking program to enhance quality of life and well-being in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer. METHODS: A mixed methods feasibility study includes an exploratory two-center randomized controlled trial and qualitative interviews. A minimum of 60 participants will be recruited from two London NHS Trusts and randomized 1:1 between the walking intervention and standard care using minimization. The walking intervention consists of the initial provision of written/online information followed by a short motivational interview. Participants are instructed to walk for 30 min on alternate days and attend an organized volunteer-led walk once a week. Half of all participants will be asked to use a pedometer. Postal questionnaires will be completed at baseline (pre-randomization) and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks. A subsample of participants and stakeholders will be interviewed at the end of the study. RESULTS: Primary outcomes will be the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and trial. A range of secondary outcome assessments needed to design a main study, including estimates of recruitment, adherence and variability in quality of life, will be evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study will be used to refine the walking intervention, investigate the acceptability of the intervention and study design, and determine the most appropriate outcome measures thereby providing estimates of the factors needed to design the main study.

While drug treatments are important at alleviating some symptoms, there is increasing evidence of the benefits of exercise in enhancing quality of life and health outcomes. Walking is an inexpensive and accessible form of exercise. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated whether a walking intervention is sufficient to enhance quality of life and alleviate symptoms in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer across a range of tumor types. This paper describes the CanWalk study protocol, which aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of undertaking a randomized controlled trial of a community-based walking program to enhance quality of life and well-being in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer. METHODS: A mixed methods feasibility study includes an exploratory two-center randomized controlled trial and qualitative interviews. A minimum of 60 participants will be recruited from two London NHS Trusts and randomized 1:1 between the walking intervention and standard care using minimization. The walking intervention consists of the initial provision of written/online information followed by a short motivational interview.

513,27756441,Trials,"Study protocol for a multi-center, randomized controlled trial to develop Japanese denture adhesive guidelines for patients with complete dentures: the Denture Adhesive Guideline trial: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Denture adhesives, characterized as medical products in 1935 by the American Dental Association, have been considered useful adjuncts for improving denture retention and stability. However, many dentists in Japan are hesitant to acknowledge denture adhesives in daily practice because of the stereotype that dentures should be inherently stable, without the aid of adhesives. The aim of this study is to verify the efficacy of denture adhesives to establish guidelines for Japanese users. The null hypothesis is that the application of denture adhesives, including the cream and powder types, or a control (isotonic sodium chloride solution) would not produce different outcomes nor would they differentially improve the set outcomes between baseline and day 4 post-application. METHODS: This ten-center, randomized controlled trial with parallel groups is ongoing. Three hundred edentulous patients with complete dentures will be allocated to three groups (cream-type adhesive, powder-type adhesive, and control groups). The participants will wear their dentures with the denture adhesive for 4 days, including during eight meals (three breakfasts, two lunches, and three dinners). The baseline measurements and final measurements for the denture adhesives will be performed on the first day and after breakfast on the fourth day. The primary outcome is a general satisfaction rating for the denture. The secondary outcomes are denture satisfaction ratings for various denture functions, occlusal bite force, resistance to dislodgement, masticatory performance, perceived chewing ability, and oral health-related quality of life. Between-subjects comparisons among the three groups and within-subjects comparisons of the pre- and post-intervention measurements will be performed. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis will be performed. The main analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. A sample size of 100 subjects per group, including an assumed dropout rate of 10 %, will be required to achieve 80 % power with a 5 % alpha level. DISCUSSION: This randomized clinical trial will provide information about denture adhesives to complete denture wearers, prosthodontic educators, and dentists in Japan. We believe this new evidence on denture adhesive use from Japan will aid dentists in their daily practice even in other countries. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01712802 .

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of electrical stimulation-augmented virtual reality training in improving balance in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Individuals with iSCI often face significant balance and mobility impairments affecting their quality of life. Scientific studies focusing on standing balance training in the iSCI population are limited. Virtual reality-based balance training has shown positive results in several neurological populations. Electrical stimulation has also proved to be effective in improving voluntary muscle strength in partially paralyzed muscles after iSCI as well as promoting neuroplasticity. METHODS: Forty-eight iSCI participants will be recruited based on the inclusion criteria. The participants will be randomly assigned to any of the three groups: virtual reality-based balance training along with the electrical stimulation group, virtual reality-based balance training along with sham stimulation group, or virtual reality-based balance training group. The intervention will be delivered as 60-minute sessions, thrice a week for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The performance of the participants will be assessed using the lower extremity motor score, static and dynamic balance assessment using TechnoBody ProKin tilting platform and Berg Balance Scale, Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF at pre-intervention, after 4 weeks post-intervention, and at 1-month follow-up.

518,35002831,Frontiers in psychology,Transdiagnostic Mechanisms of Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Adults and Families in Germany: Study Protocol of a Cross-Sectional and 1-Year Longitudinal Study,"Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, psychological distress is increased. Transdiagnostic mechanisms, including trauma, personality functioning, mentalizing and emotion regulation are considered relevant to the development and maintenance of mental health problems and therefore may play a role in individuals' reactions to the pandemic. Aim: To identify moderating and mediating factors associated with pandemic-related distress and mental health problems in adults and families, we aim to investigate the interactions of interpersonal trauma (childhood trauma and domestic violence), psychological capacities (personality functioning, mentalizing and emotion regulation) and pandemic-related adversity on psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we aim to investigate behavioral and cognitive consequences of the pandemic (e.g., media consumption, vaccination status, conspiracy beliefs). Methods: Using an online-based cross-sectional and longitudinal design, we will investigate a sample of adult participants recruited via online platforms in German-speaking countries over the course of 1 year with four measurements points via self-report instruments (personality functioning: PID5BF +; mentalizing: MentS, PRFQ; emotion regulation: DERS-SF; mental health problems: PHQ-9, GAD-7; a composite pandemic-related stress score). Structural equation and multi-level modeling will be performed for data analyses. Implications: This study will provide data on the moderating and mediating effects of trauma, personality functioning and mentalizing during the pandemic in a large community sample, particularly on vulnerable groups like families. Identifying transdiagnostic mechanisms of psychopathology in the course of a pandemic crisis may provide valuable insight for the development of pre- and intervention measures for potential psychological distress during and post the pandemic.",crisis| emotion regulation| family| mentalizing| pandemic (COVID-19)| personality functioning| reflective functioning| trauma,Clinical-study-protocol,12,0,"<journal>Frontiers in psychology</journal><title>Transdiagnostic Mechanisms of Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Adults and Families in Germany: Study Protocol of a Cross-Sectional and 1-Year Longitudinal Study</title><abstract>Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, psychological distress is increased.

519,34598981,BMJ open,Evaluation of an interactive web-based programme on relapse management for people with multiple sclerosis (POWER@MS2): study protocol for a process evaluation accompanying a randomised controlled trial,"INTRODUCTION: Process evaluations accompanying complex interventions examine the implementation process of the underlying intervention, identify mechanisms of impact and assess contextual factors. This paper presents the protocol for a process evaluation conducted alongside the randomised controlled trial POWER@MS2. The trial comprises the evaluation of a web-based complex intervention on relapse management in 188 people with multiple sclerosis conducted in 20 centres. The web-based intervention programme focuses on relapse treatment decision making and includes a decision aid, a nurse-led webinar and an online chat. With the process evaluation presented here, we aim to assess participants' responses to and interactions with the intervention to understand how and why the intervention produces change. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed methods design is used to explore the acceptance of the intervention as well as its use and impact on participants. Participants are people with multiple sclerosis, neurologists, nurses and stakeholders. Quantitative semistandardised evaluation forms will be collected throughout the study. Qualitative semistructured telephone interviews will be conducted at the end of the study with selected participants, especially people with multiple sclerosis and neurologists. Quantitative data will be collected and analysed descriptively. Based on the results, the qualitative interviews will be conducted and analysed thematically, and the results will be merged in a joint display table. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The process evaluation has received ethical approval from the Ethical Committee of the University of Lübeck (reference 19-024).

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are a potential vehicle to achieve this. A recent systematic review of implementation strategies of guideline dissemination concluded that there was a lack of evidence regarding effective strategies to promote the uptake of guidelines. Recommendations from this review, and other studies, have suggested the use of interventions that are theoretically based because these may be more effective than those that are not. An evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of acute low back pain was recently developed in Australia. This provides an opportunity to develop and test a theory-based implementation intervention for a condition which is common, has a high burden, and for which there is an evidence-practice gap in the primary care setting. AIM: This study aims to test the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention for implementing a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain in general practice in Victoria, Australia. Specifically, our primary objectives are to establish if the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of patients who are referred for a plain x-ray, and improving mean level of disability for patients three months post-consultation. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol describes the details of a cluster randomised controlled trial. Ninety-two general practices (clusters), which include at least one consenting general practitioner, will be randomised to an intervention or control arm using restricted randomisation. Patients aged 18 years or older who visit a participating practitioner for acute non-specific low back pain of less than three months duration will be eligible for inclusion. An average of twenty-five patients per general practice will be recruited, providing a total of 2,300 patient participants.

521,18495031,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,Correcting non cephalic presentation with moxibustion: study protocol for a multi-centre randomised controlled trial in general practice,"BACKGROUND: Non cephalic presentation in childbirth involves various risks to both the mother and the foetus. The incidence in Spain is 3.8% of all full-term pregnancies. The most common technique used to end the gestation in cases of non cephalic presentation is that of caesarian section, and although it provokes a lower rate of morbi-mortality than does vaginal delivery in such situations, there remains the possibility of traumatic injury to the foetal head and neck, while maternal morbidity is also increased. The application of heat (moxibustion) to an acupuncture point, in order to correct non cephalic presentation, has been practised in China since ancient times, but as yet there is insufficient evidence of its real effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: The experimental design consists of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial with three parallel arms, used to compare real moxibustion, sham moxibustion and the natural course of events, among pregnant women with a non cephalic presentation and a gestational duration of 33-35 weeks (estimated by echography). The participants in the trial will be blinded to both interventions. The results obtained will be analyzed by professionals, blinded with respect to the allocation to the different types of intervention. In addition, we intend to carry out a economic analysis. DISCUSSION: This trial will contribute to the development of evidence concerning moxibustion in the correction of non cephalic presentations. The primary outcome variable is the proportion of cephalic presentations at term. As secondary outcomes, we will evaluate the proportion of cephalic presentations at week 38 of gestation, determined by echography, together with the safety of the technique, the specificity of moxibustion and the control of the blinding process.

522,26582408,JMIR research protocols,Western Australian Public Opinions of a Minimum Pricing Policy for Alcohol: Study Protocol,"BACKGROUND: Excessive alcohol consumption has significant adverse economic, social, and health outcomes. Recent estimates suggest that the annual economic costs of alcohol in Australia are up to AUD $36 billion. Policies influencing price have been demonstrated to be very effective in reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms. Interest in minimum pricing has gained traction in recent years. However, there has been little research investigating the level of support for the public interest case of minimum pricing in Australia. OBJECTIVE: This article describes protocol for a study exploring Western Australian (WA) public knowledge, understanding, and reaction to a proposed minimum price policy per standard drink. METHODS: The study will employ a qualitative methodological design. Participants will be recruited from a wide variety of backgrounds, including ethnic minorities, blue and white collar workers, unemployed, students, and elderly/retired populations to participate in focus groups. Focus group participants will be asked about their knowledge of, and initial reactions to, the proposed policy and encouraged to discuss how such a proposal may affect their own alcohol use and alcohol consumption at the population level. Participants will also be asked to discuss potential avenues for increasing acceptability of the policy. The focus groups will adopt a semi-structured, open-ended approach guided by a question schedule. The schedule will be based on feedback from pilot samples, previous research, and a steering group comprising experts in alcohol policy and pricing. RESULTS: The study is expected to take approximately 14 months to complete.

523,37369561,BMJ paediatrics open,A study protocol for investigating the sonographic characteristics of neonates with critical illness: an observational cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Haemodynamic instability and hypoxaemia are common and serious threats to the survival of neonates. A growing body of literature indicates that critical care ultrasound has become the optimal evaluation tool for sick neonates. However, few studies have described sonographic characteristics of haemodynamics systematically in the neonates with critical illness. This protocol describes a prospective observational cohort study aimed at (1) characterising the sonographic characteristics of the neonates with critical diseases; and (2) assessing the mortality, significant morbidity, utility of vasoactive medications, fluid resuscitation, duration of ventilation, etc. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre, prospective and observational study conducted in Chengdu Women's and Children's Central Hospital from 1 December 2022 to 31 December 2027. Neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit will be recruited. After inclusion, the neonates will undergo the neonatal critical care ultrasound. The data collected via case report forms include clinical variables and sonographic measures. The primary outcome is to identify the sonographic characteristics of sick neonates with different diseases, and the secondary outcome is to describe the mortality, significant morbidity, utility of vasoactive medications, fluid resuscitation and duration of ventilation. DISCUSSION: Our study provided an organised neonatal critical care ultrasound workflow, which can be applied in practice. Accordingly, this study will first set up large data on the sonographic description of the neonates with critical illness, which can help to understand the pathophysiology of the critical illness, potentially titrating the treatment.

BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines recommend prenatal genetic counselling for pregnant women before participation in the tests. METHODS: A total of 210 pregnant women participated in the study by completing the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-I, Decisional Conflict Scale, SURE Scale, Knowledge Assessment Forms, Decision Satisfaction Form and Attitudes Scale between June 2017 and March 2018. In the first stage, pregnant women were evaluated who had only prenatal genetic screening tests and in the second stage, pregnant women who had been recommended to receive diagnostic tests. The intervention group received face-to-face individual education and counselling about prenatal genetic tests. Independent samples t test, t tests and Pearson correlation tests were used. RESULTS: Education and counselling for prenatal screening tests and diagnostic tests from the first weeks of pregnancy were effective in decreasing anxiety, decisional conflict, increasing attitudes towards tests and had positive effects on pregnant women's knowledge level and decision satisfaction (P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Prenatal genetic counselling and education are more effective if provided from the first weeks of pregnancy.

525,18586994,"Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)",A clinical trial comparing interviewer and computer-assisted assessment among clients with severe mental illness,"OBJECTIVE: Demographic, behavioral, and diagnostic information should routinely be collected from clients with severe mental illness, and data gathering should employ the most efficient techniques available. Surveys are increasingly conducted via Web-based computer-assisted interviewing (CAI), but this technique is not well validated for patients with severe mental illness. A randomized clinical trial of 245 clients was carried out to compare face-to face and computer-assisted interviewing (233 clients completed two surveys). METHODS: Self-report data were collected on demographic characteristics, substance abuse, risk behaviors for blood-borne diseases, trauma history, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Each client was assessed twice and randomly assigned to one of the four possible combinations of interviewer and computer (computer and computer, N=53; computer and interviewer, N=56; interviewer and computer, N=59; and interviewer and interviewer, N=65). The two formats were compared on feasibility, client preference, cost, reliability, convergent validity, and criterion validity. RESULTS: This study demonstrated the feasibility of CAI across a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings. All participants who began the CAI process completed the interview and responded to over 95% of the survey items. Participants liked using the computers as well as they liked face-to-face interviews, and they completed the CAI as quickly. CAI produced data as reliable and valid as face-to-face interviews produced and was less expensive, and results were available more quickly. The two formats were similar in criterion validity.

The authors conducted a positron emission tomography (PET) study to characterize the simultaneous effects of aripiprazole at the D(2), 5-HT(2), and 5-HT(1A) receptors in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. METHOD: Twelve patients who had previously received antipsychotic treatment were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg of aripiprazole. After at least 14 days of treatment, participants underwent high-resolution PET scans using [(11)C]raclopride, [(18)F]setoperone, and [(11)C]WAY100635. RESULTS: Very high occupancy was observed at striatal D(2) receptors (average putamen, 87%; caudate, 93%; and ventral striatum, 91%), lower occupancy at 5-HT(2) receptors (54%-60%), and even lower occupancy at 5-HT(1A) receptors (16%).

528,24920862,Neurology,Variations in EEG discharges predict ADHD severity within individual Smith-Lemli-Opitz patients,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the prevalence of EEG abnormalities in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) as well as the relationship between interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and within-subject variations in attentional symptom severity. METHODS: In the context of a clinical trial for SLOS, we performed cross-sectional and repeated-measure observational studies of the relationship between EEG findings and cognitive/behavioral factors on 23 children (aged 4-17 years). EEGs were reviewed for clinical abnormalities, including IEDs, by readers blinded to participants' behavioral symptoms. Between-group differences in baseline characteristics of participants with and without IEDs were analyzed. Within-subject analyses examined the association between the presence of IEDs and changes in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. RESULTS: Of 85 EEGs, 43 (51%) were abnormal, predominantly because of IEDs. Only one subject had documented clinical seizures. IEDs clustered in 13 subjects (57%), whereas 9 subjects (39%) had EEGs consistently free of IEDs. While there were no significant group differences in sex, age, intellectual disability, language level, or baseline ADHD symptoms, autistic symptoms tended to be more prevalent in the ""IED"" group (according to Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 criteria). Within individuals, the presence of IEDs on a particular EEG predicted, on average, a 27% increase in ADHD symptom severity.

529,31615771,Clinical chemistry,Clinical Utility of Procalcitonin in the Diagnosis of Pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of procalcitonin in the diagnosis and management of pneumonia remains controversial. METHODS: We assessed the clinical utility of procalcitonin in 2 prospective studies: first, a multicenter diagnostic study in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute dyspnea to directly compare the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin with that of interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the diagnosis of pneumonia; second, a randomized management study of procalcitonin guidance in patients with acute heart failure and suspected pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia as centrally adjudicated by 2 independent experts was quantified with the area under the ROC curve (AUC). RESULTS: Among 690 patients in the diagnostic study, 178 (25.8%) had an adjudicated final diagnosis of pneumonia. Procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and CRP were significantly higher in patients with pneumonia than in those without. When compared to procalcitonin (AUC = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.71-0.78), interleukin 6 (AUC = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77-0.83) and CRP (AUC = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85) had significantly higher diagnostic accuracy (P = 0.010 and P < 0.001, respectively). The management study was stopped early owing to the unexpectedly low AUC of procalcitonin in the diagnostic study. Among 45 randomized patients, the number of days on antibiotic therapy and the length of hospital stay were similar (both P = 0.39) in patients randomized to the procalcitonin-guided group (n = 25) and usual-care group (n = 20). CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting with dyspnea, diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin for pneumonia is only moderate and lower than that of interleukin 6 and CRP. The clinical utility of procalcitonin was lower than expected. SUMMARY: Pneumonia has diverse and often unspecific symptoms. As the role of biomarkers in the diagnosis of pneumonia remains controversial, it is often difficult to distinguish pneumonia from other illnesses causing shortness of breath. The current study prospectively enrolled unselected patients presenting with acute dyspnea and directly compared the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and CRP for the diagnosis of pneumonia. In this setting, diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin for pneumonia was lower as compared to interleukin 6 and CRP. The clinical utility of procalcitonin was lower than expected.

When compared to procalcitonin (AUC = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.71-0.78), interleukin 6 (AUC = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77-0.83) and CRP (AUC = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79-0.85) had significantly higher diagnostic accuracy (P = 0.010 and P < 0.001, respectively). The management study was stopped early owing to the unexpectedly low AUC of procalcitonin in the diagnostic study. Among 45 randomized patients, the number of days on antibiotic therapy and the length of hospital stay were similar (both P = 0.39) in patients randomized to the procalcitonin-guided group (n = 25) and usual-care group (n = 20). CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting with dyspnea, diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin for pneumonia is only moderate and lower than that of interleukin 6 and CRP. The clinical utility of procalcitonin was lower than expected. SUMMARY: Pneumonia has diverse and often unspecific symptoms. As the role of biomarkers in the diagnosis of pneumonia remains controversial, it is often difficult to distinguish pneumonia from other illnesses causing shortness of breath. The current study prospectively enrolled unselected patients presenting with acute dyspnea and directly compared the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and CRP for the diagnosis of pneumonia. In this setting, diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin for pneumonia was lower as compared to interleukin 6 and CRP. The clinical utility of procalcitonin was lower than expected.

METHODS: We assessed the clinical utility of procalcitonin in 2 prospective studies: first, a multicenter diagnostic study in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute dyspnea to directly compare the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin with that of interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the diagnosis of pneumonia; second, a randomized management study of procalcitonin guidance in patients with acute heart failure and suspected pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia as centrally adjudicated by 2 independent experts was quantified with the area under the ROC curve (AUC).

Patients and healthy controls were recruited from two hospitals between July and October 2012. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to test criterion validity. Convergent validity was assessed via correlations between NUCOG and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Reliability was measured by internal consistency (Cronbach's α). Patients with epilepsy (n=144), neurological diseases (n=81), dementia (n=44), and controls (n=260) completed the NUCOG and the MMSE. Overall, both NUCOG and MMSE scores differed significantly across the four groups with the highest scores in the control group and the lowest in the dementia group (p<0.0001). The NUCOG scores could differentiate between patients with certain seizure types, stroke and transient ischemic attack. Compared to the MMSE, the NUCOG exhibited a higher area under the ROC curve. The convergent validity was substantially correlated, and internal consistency was very high (0.922). The Chinese version of NUCOG was demonstrated to be a sensitive and reliable screening tool for cognitive impairment in a Chinese-speaking population not only in China, but also in countries where there is a sizeable population of ethnic Chinese.

Data for the effect of new diagnostic tools when used for community-based intensified case finding are not available, so we investigated whether the use of sputum Xpert-MTB/RIF and the Determine TB LAM urine test in two African communities could be effective. METHODS: In a pragmatic, randomised, parallel-group trial with individual randomisation stratified by country, we compared sputum Xpert-MTB/RIF, and if HIV-infected, the Determine TB LAM urine test (novel diagnostic group), with laboratory-based sputum smear microscopy (routine diagnostic group) for intensified case finding in communities with high tuberculosis and HIV prevalence in Cape Town, South Africa, and Harare, Zimbabwe. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to these groups with computer-generated allocation lists, using culture as the reference standard. In Cape Town, participants were randomised and tested at an Xpert-equipped mobile van, while in Harare, participants were driven to a local clinic where the same diagnostic tests were done. The primary endpoint was the proportion of culture-positive tuberculosis cases initiating tuberculosis treatment in each study group at 60 days. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01990274. FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2013, and March 31, 2015, 2261 individuals were screened and 875 (39%) of these met the criteria for diagnostic testing. 439 participants were randomly assigned to the novel group and 436 to the routine group. 74 (9%) of 875 participants had confirmed tuberculosis. If late culture-based treatment initiation was excluded, more patients with culture-positive tuberculosis were initiated on treatment in the novel group at 60 days (36 [86%] of 42 in the novel group vs 18 [56%] of 32 in the routine group). Thus the difference in the proportion initiating treatment between groups was 29% (95% CI 9-50, p=0·0047) and 53% more patients initiated therapy in the novel diagnostic group than in the routine diagnostic group. One culture-positive patient was treated based only on a positive LAM test. INTERPRETATION: Compared with traditional tools, Xpert-MTB/RIF for community-based intensified case finding in HIV and tuberculosis-endemic settings increased the proportion of patients initiating treatment.

532,35488938,European child & adolescent psychiatry,The impact of school-based screening on service use in adolescents at risk for mental health problems and risk-behaviour,"Early detection and intervention can counteract mental disorders and risk behaviours among adolescents. However, help-seeking rates are low. School-based screenings are a promising tool to detect adolescents at risk for mental problems and to improve help-seeking behaviour. We assessed associations between the intervention ""Screening by Professionals"" (ProfScreen) and the use of mental health services and at-risk state at 12 month follow-up compared to a control group. School students (aged 15 ± 0.9 years) from 11 European countries participating in the ""Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe"" (SEYLE) study completed a self-report questionnaire on mental health problems and risk behaviours. ProfScreen students considered ""at-risk"" for mental illness or risk behaviour based on the screening were invited for a clinical interview with a mental health professional and, if necessary, referred for subsequent treatment. At follow-up, students completed another self-report, additionally reporting on service use. Of the total sample (N = 4,172), 61.9% were considered at-risk. 40.7% of the ProfScreen at-risk participants invited for the clinical interview attended the interview, and 10.1% of subsequently referred ProfScreen participants engaged in professional treatment. There were no differences between the ProfScreen and control group regarding follow-up service use and at-risk state. Attending the ProfScreen interview was positively associated with follow-up service use (OR = 1.783, 95% CI = 1.038-3.064), but had no effect on follow-up at-risk state.

METHODS: DemTect results were compared to the clinical diagnosis and to FDG-PET as a reference method for the early in vivo detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: 38 patients (age 65.2 +/- 9.8 years, 16 men, 22 women) were investigated using clinical standard examination, FDG-PET, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging. According to NINCDS-ADRDA and Petersen's criteria, 18 patients had dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and 13 patients received the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Compared to the clinical diagnosis, a DemTect cutoff score of < or =11 points demonstrated good sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (70.0%) for the detection of DAT, whereas the best cutoff score for MCI was < or =13 points with comparable sensitivity (84.6%) and specificity (85.7%). With regard to FDG-PET, the DemTect demonstrated excellent sensitivity (93%) and low specificity (50%) for the detection of AD-typical patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism (cutoff < or =13 points).

534,24075291,Journal of clinical epidemiology,The Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment screen correlated with the Standardized Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section in clinical trials,"OBJECTIVES: The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section and its standardized version (SADAS-cog) are the current standard for assessing cognitive outcomes in clinical trials of dementia. This study compares a shorter cognitive instrument, the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen, with the SADAS-cog as outcome measures in clinical trials. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The SADAS-cog, Qmci, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and the Lawton-Brady activities of daily living (ADL) scale were assessed at multiple time points, over 1 year in a multicenter randomized clinical trial of 406 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia. Correlations were estimated using regression at each time point, all time points, and mean values across time. Responsiveness was assessed using the standardized response mean (SRM). RESULTS: Regression for pooled time points showed strong and significant correlation between the SADAS-cog and Qmci (r = -0.75, P < 0.001). Correlations remained strong for mean values across time and at each time point. The SADAS-cog and Qmci also correlated with CDR and ADL scores. There was no difference in SRMs between the SADAS-cog and Qmci [t(357) = -0.32, P = 0.75].

This study compares a shorter cognitive instrument, the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen, with the SADAS-cog as outcome measures in clinical trials. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The SADAS-cog, Qmci, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and the Lawton-Brady activities of daily living (ADL) scale were assessed at multiple time points, over 1 year in a multicenter randomized clinical trial of 406 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia. Correlations were estimated using regression at each time point, all time points, and mean values across time. Responsiveness was assessed using the standardized response mean (SRM). RESULTS: Regression for pooled time points showed strong and significant correlation between the SADAS-cog and Qmci (r = -0.75, P < 0.001). Correlations remained strong for mean values across time and at each time point. The SADAS-cog and Qmci also correlated with CDR and ADL scores. There was no difference in SRMs between the SADAS-cog and Qmci [t(357) = -0.32, P = 0.75]. CONCLUSION: The Qmci correlated strongly with the SADAS-cog and both were equally responsive to deterioration.
