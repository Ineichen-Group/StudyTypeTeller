	  "text_other": "Classify the following text by choosing the most appropriate of theses labels while adhering to the list of annotation guidelines below: Clinical-study-protocol, Human-systematic-review, Non-systematic-review, Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention, Human-RCT-drug-intervention, Human-RCT-non-intervention, Human-case-report, Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention, Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention, In-vitro-study, Remaining. Respond in JSON format with the key: gpt_label.\n\nInformation for Classification:\n1. Definition of ‘intervention’, ‘drug-intervention’ and ‘non-drug-intervention’: The working definition for ‘intervention’ is the following: An ‘intervention’ includes a treatment, pro- cedure, or other action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways. We separate ‘non-drug-interventions’ from ‘drug-interventions’ according to the following definition: For the annotation on drug-based, respective chemical-based therapies, we follow the guidelines of the CHEMDNER corpus for annotating chemical mentions. The basic rule for chemical entity annotation is that the chemical should have a specific structure. Non-drug-interventions include any therapeutic intervention not classifiable as drug, e.g., radiation therapy, physical therapy or complex diets. This also includes other substances, that cannot be associated to a clear molecular structure, such as olive oil, herbal extracts, cannabis, tea and nanoparticles (and others).\n2. Guidelines for annotation of clinical trials: Studies which re-analyze data from former clinical trials shall be labeled as the respecitve clinical trial. Pharmakokinetic studies shall be labeled as the respective drug-intervention study.Studies on long-term adverse events of therapies shall be labeled as the respective clinical trial. This applies only if the therapy is mentioned specifically. E.g., a study on dementia after aspirin-intake in humans would be labeled as ‘non-RCT drug-intervention’ whereas a study on carotid sclerosis after irradiation would be labeled as ‘remaining’ as ‘irradiation’ is an unspecific description of a therpay (see below). \n3. General guidelines for annotation: The labels are presented in a hierarchical order. Furthermore, their respective levels of significance are illustrated in the accompanying list of ‘Labels and Guidelines’. Specifically, when multiple labels were applicable to an abstract, only the label with the highest position in the table or the lowest hierarchical number, respectively, was assigned. An exception applies for studies which are nevertheless outside the realm of neuroscience/psychiatry, and clinical trials with unspecific mention of therapies: They are always labeled ‘remaining’.The guidelines for the study labels displayed in the list ‘Labels and Guidelines’ shall be understood as such and not as necessary criteria that must be fulfilled for labeling.\n\nLabels and Guidelines:\n1. Study protocol: A publication outlining the design, objectives, methodology, statistical considerations or ethical considerations of a clinical research study or a systematic review/meta-analysis. Explicit mention of ‘protocol’.\n2. Human, systematic review: A structured and reproducible research summary of human participants. This also includes systematic reviews covering both human subjects and animals. An explicit mention of ‘systematic review’, ‘we systematically review’, ‘meta-analysis’ and/or ‘we meta-analyze’ in the title or abstract. Alternatively, the mention of at least 2 biomedical literature databases such as ‘PubMed’, ‘Embase’, ’Cochrane Library’, ‘Web of Scienc’, ‘Scopus’ (or others) in the abstract and at least 2 authors would qualify as a systematic review.\n3. Non-systematic review: A text reviewing/discussing a certain topic, can be very broad and includes editorials, perspectives and other types of texts with the goal to discuss any matter related to neuroscience/psychiatry. Does not generate original data but discusses previously published data. An explicit mention of ‘review’, ‘expert review’, ‘traditional review’, ‘literature review’, ‘review of literature’ or ‘we summarize’.\n4. Human, RCT non-drug-intervention: A scientific experiment in the form of a clinical trial with the distinguishing feature that participants are randomized into experimental groups. This study type needs a specific mention of randomization of a human population. Concretely, the aim of the study must be to test a non-drug treatment (e.g., radiation therapy, surgery, physical therapy, nanoparticles) in randomized fashion.\n5. Human, RCT drug-intervention: A scientific experiment in the form of a clinical trial with the distinguishing feature that participants are randomized into experimental groups. This study type needs a specific mention of randomization of a human population.\n\n Concretely, the aim of the study must be to test a drug (e.g., aspirin, risperdal, lorazepam) in randomized fashion.\n6. Human, RCT non-intervention: A scientific experiment in the form of a clinical trial with the distinguishing feature that participants are randomized into experimental groups. This study type needs a specific mention of randomization of a human population. Any RCT not annotated as ‘RCT drug-intervention’ or ‘RCT non-drug-intervention’ should be classified under this category.\n7. Human, case report: A study type reporting clinical/imaging findings of one single human individual, e.g., by explicit mentioning of ‘case’ or ‘case report’. Case series with more than 1 participants shall not be classified under this category.\n8. Human, Non-RCT non-drug-intervention: A clinical study without explicit mention of randomization testing a non-drug intervention, e.g., observational or cohort studies. Also includes studies assessing participants which were sampled from a previous RCT.\n9. Human, Non-RCT drug-intervention: A clinical study without explicit mention of randomization testing a drug intervention, e.g., observational or cohort studies. Also includes studies assessing participants which were sampled from a previous RCT.\n13. In-vitro study: Any experimental research conducted outside a living organism, i.e., on isolated cells, tissues, organs, enteroids or organoids under controlled conditions. This excludes genetic studies and pathological studies in tissue from a clearly defined patient/control cohort.\n14. Remaining: Any other study which does not fit in any of the categories defined above. E.g., studies about medical history, epidemiology or other. Also includes studies which raters were uncertain how to label, clinical trials with unspecific mention of therapies (e.g., ‘antiepileptica’), studies published in the ‘Journal of Visualized Experiments’ (JoVE) and studies which are outside the realm of neuroscience/psychiatry.\n\nYour task is to read the journal name, title and abstract provided, apply these guidelines, and determine the most accurate classification for the study.
