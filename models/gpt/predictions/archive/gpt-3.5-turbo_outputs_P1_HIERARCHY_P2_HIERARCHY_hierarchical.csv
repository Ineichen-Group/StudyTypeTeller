We report that late intervention with a recently discovered aminopyridazine suppressor of glial activation, developed to inhibit both oxidative and inflammatory cytokine pathways, attenuates human amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced glial activation in a murine model. Peripheral administration of the aminopyridazine MW01-070C, beginning 3 weeks after the start of intracerebroventricular infusion of human Abeta1-42, decreased the number of activated astrocytes and microglia and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and S100B in the hippocampus. Inhibition of neuroinflammation correlated with a decreased neuron loss, restoration towards control levels of synaptic dysfunction biomarkers in the hippocampus, and diminished amyloid plaque deposition. The results from this in vivo chemical biology approach provide a proof of concept that targeting of key glia inflammatory cytokine pathways can suppress Abeta-induced neuroinflammation in vivo, with resultant attenuation of neuronal damage.</abstract>",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,ANIMAL,"{

The long-term effects of the drug are not yet known, and it is speculated that repeated exposure may produce drug dependence. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of repeated methylphenidate treatment on methylphenidate self-administration and reinstatement in the most validated animal model of ADHD, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), and Wistar rat, strain representing the ""normal"" heterogeneous population. METHODS: Rats were administered intraperitoneally with saline or methylphenidate (2 mg/kg) for 14 days, prior to experiments. Thereafter, responses for intravenous methylphenidate under the fixed ratio (FR1 and FR3) and progressive ratio (PR) schedules were assessed. Extinction experiments followed, as well as tests to determine the ability of intraperitoneal administration of methylphenidate (2 and 5 mg/kg) to reinstate extinguished drug-seeking behaviors in rats. RESULTS: Previous exposure to methylphenidate enhanced methylphenidate self-administration in Wistar rats but not in SHR (FR3). Methylphenidate pretreatment reduced responding for methylphenidate in SHR but did not affect self-administration behaviors of Wistar rats (PR). Methylphenidate pre-exposure robustly reinstated drug-seeking behaviors in Wistar rats, but not in SHR. CONCLUSION: The contrasting effects of repeated methylphenidate treatment in methylphenidate self-administration and reinstatement in Wistar and SHR, and the increased susceptibility of the Wistar rat strain to the reinforcing effects of methylphenidate indicate that ""normal"" individuals are more likely to develop psychological dependence to the drug and experience relapse. Meanwhile, the clinical use of methylphenidate may not produce drug dependence or relapse in ADHD patients.</abstract>",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,ANIMAL,"{

PDE10A is selectively expressed in medium spiny neurons in the striatum, suggesting the potential of PDE10A inhibitors in the treatment of schizophrenia. This study presents the pharmacological profile of a novel PDE10A inhibitor, 2-[(E)-2-(7-fluoro-3-methylquinoxalin-2-yl)vinyl]-6-pyrrolidin-1-yl-N-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)pyrimidin-4-amine hydrochloride (T-251) in rodent models of schizophrenia. T-251 showed a potent inhibitory activity against human PDE10A (IC(50) = 0.050 nmol/L) and showed high selectivity over other PDE families which have over 10,000-fold IC(50) values. Oral administration of T-251 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) increased cAMP and cGMP in the striatum in a dose-dependent manner. Oral administration of T-251 attenuated MK-801 induced hyperactivity (ED(50) = 0.68 mg/kg) and suppressed conditioned avoidance response (ID(50) = 0.87 mg/kg) in rats in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, T-251 significantly attenuated MK-801 induced prepulse inhibition deficits and cognitive deficits in rats. Unlike haloperidol and olanzapine, T-251 (1.0-30 mg/kg) did not cause catalepsy in rats. Moreover, T-251 (0.6 and 6.0 mg/kg) did not increase plasma levels of prolactin at 1 h after administration, whereas haloperidol and olanzapine significantly increased them. The antipsychotic-like effects and cognitive enhancement of T-251 without catalepsy or plasma prolactin elevation observed in rats suggests that T-251 would be a novel antipsychotic with an improved side-effect profile.</abstract>",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,ANIMAL,"{

METHODS: Mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) derived neurospheres were transplanted into the frontal association cortex and barrel field of S1 cortex of C57BL/6 mice 4 weeks after including a lesion of NBM by ibotenic acid, while other healthy mice that received ES cells served as control. Behavioral tests by 8-arm radial maze were conducted 8 weeks after transplantation, and double staining of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), serotonin, amyloid-beta protein (AP) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) 12 weeks after transplantation. We found that the neurospheres transplanted into the mouse cortex survived and produced many ChAT-positive neurons and a few serotonin-positive neurons in and around the grafts. The working memory error decreased significantly in the mice grafted with neurospheres. In contrast, the ES cells developed into teratomas in all of the control mice and expressed no neurons, and the working memory deteriorated remarkably. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of neurospheres, but not ES cells, into the prefrontal and parietal cortices, dramatically alleviated the cholinergic deficits and recent memory disruption in the NBM lesioned mice.</abstract>",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1,ANIMAL,"{

To obtain mechanistic insights about TBI, experimental animal models such as weight-drop-induced TBI in rats have been developed to mimic closed-head injury in humans. However, the relationship between the mechanical impact level and neurological severity following weight-drop-induced TBI remains uncertain. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the relationship between physical impact and graded severity at various weight-drop heights.	The acceleration, impact force, and displacement during the impact were accurately measured using an accelerometer, a pressure sensor, and a high-speed camera, respectively. In addition, the longitudinal changes in neurological deficits and balance function were investigated at 1, 4, and 7 days post TBI lesion. The inflammatory expression markers tested by Western blot analysis, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, beta-amyloid precursor protein, and bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X, in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were investigated at 1 and 7 days post-lesion.	Gradations in impact pressure produced progressive degrees of injury severity in the neurological score and balance function. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all inflammatory expression markers were increased at 1 and 7 days post-impact injury when compared to the sham control rats. The severity of neurologic dysfunction and induction in inflammatory markers strongly correlated with the graded mechanical impact levels.	We conclude that the weight-drop-induced TBI model can produce graded brain injury and induction of neurobehavioral deficits and may have translational relevance to developing therapeutic strategies for TBI.</abstract>",Animal-other,5,1,ANIMAL,"{

RESULTS: Data from the biochemical and behavioral studies showed that DE models were successful induced in streptozotocin treatment animals and KK-Ay mice. Gnao1 was down regulated in the brain tissues of these two diabetes animal models with significant cognition deficiency. It suggested that the changes in DE are also related to dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study also showed that the expression of adrenergic α2 receptor (Adr-α2R), the upstream protein of Gnao1, was decreased in DE animal models. Furthermore, many downstream proteins of Gnao1 also altered, among which cAMP and PKA proteins were increased, CREB and BDNF proteins were decreased both in animal models and in the cell levels. In addition, Gnao1 silencing leads to the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the decreased proliferation in cultured primary astrocytes, which means that the deficiency of Gnao1 might not be benefit for DE. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the importance of Gnao1 in DE and suggested Gnao1 as a novel marker and a promising therapeutic target for DE and dementia in animal models.</abstract>",Animal-other,5,1,ANIMAL,"{

This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of fasting in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We found that fasting every other day rather than weekly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor in the nigrostriatal pathway. Therefore, we maintained the animals on alternate-day fasting for 2 weeks and injected MPTP (30 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) for five days. We observed that alternate-day fasting attenuated MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss and astroglial activation in the substantia nigra and the striatum. Moreover, neurochemical analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography showed that alternate-day fasting reduced MPTP-induced depletion of striatal dopamine. Consistent with these results, behavioral tests showed that fasting suppressed the motor impairment caused by MPTP. Furthermore, fasting increased the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B, which are downstream signaling molecules of neurotrophic factors. Fasting also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein, further supporting the involvement of neurotrophic factors in the observed neuroprotective effects. Hence, our results demonstrated the dopaminergic neuroprotection of intermittent fasting in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, supporting the idea that fasting could be an instrumental tool for preventing neurodegeneration in the brain.</abstract>",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1,ANIMAL,"{

Patients and healthy controls were recruited from two hospitals between July and October 2012. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to test criterion validity. Convergent validity was assessed via correlations between NUCOG and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Reliability was measured by internal consistency (Cronbach's α). Patients with epilepsy (n=144), neurological diseases (n=81), dementia (n=44), and controls (n=260) completed the NUCOG and the MMSE. Overall, both NUCOG and MMSE scores differed significantly across the four groups with the highest scores in the control group and the lowest in the dementia group (p<0.0001). The NUCOG scores could differentiate between patients with certain seizure types, stroke and transient ischemic attack. Compared to the MMSE, the NUCOG exhibited a higher area under the ROC curve. The convergent validity was substantially correlated, and internal consistency was very high (0.922). The Chinese version of NUCOG was demonstrated to be a sensitive and reliable screening tool for cognitive impairment in a Chinese-speaking population not only in China, but also in countries where there is a sizeable population of ethnic Chinese. Additionally, our study also showed the NUCOG could better differentiate cognitive function in patients with certain seizure types, stroke and transient ischemic attack than the MMSE. This potentially expands the clinical usefulness of NUCOG, enabling clinicians to measure the cognitive profile of patients with epilepsy and ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.</abstract>",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0,OTHER,"{

A 64-year-old woman who previously had undergone right axillary artery-bilateral femoral artery anastomosis for abdominal aorta high obstruction had been suffering from chronic dizziness and so visited our department. Findings of the examination included the severe stenosis of the origin of an innominate artery and severe stenosis of bilateral internal carotid artery, causing hemodynamic cerebral ischemia. She underwent stent replacement of the innominate artery and right carotid artery stenting via a right transbrachial approach. Her symptoms were relieved postoperatively.	For the sake of improving the hemodynamic cerebral ischemia, we performed stent replacement for innominate artery stenosis and right carotid artery stenting. Endovascular treatment of subclavian and innominate artery disease is a safe procedure. In addition, for the protection of thromboembolic migration, we performed balloon protection of the external carotid artery and filter protection of the internal carotid artery.	Stent replacement for these lesions can be performed safely with the right approach and protection methods, even when the only accessible route is the right brachial artery.</abstract>",Human-case-report,4,0,OTHER,"{

Therefore, we examined the association of different APOE alleles with common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), carotid plaques, incident myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. We analyzed data from 3327 participants aged 20-79 years of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) from Northeast Germany with a median follow-up time of 14.5 years. Linear, logistic, and Cox-regression models were used to assess the associations of the APOE polymorphism with CCA-IMT, carotid plaques, incident MI and stroke, respectively. In our study, the APOE E2 allele was associated with lower CCA-IMT at baseline compared to E3 homozygotes (β: - 0.02 [95% CI - 0.04, - 0.004]). Over the follow-up, 244 MI events and 218 stroke events were observed. APOE E2 and E4 allele were not associated with incident MI (E2 HR: 1.06 [95% CI 0.68, 1.66]; E4 HR: 1.03 [95% CI 0.73, 1.45]) and incident stroke (E2 HR: 0.79 [95% CI 0.48, 1.30]; E4 HR: 0.96 [95% CI 0.66, 1.38]) in any of the models adjusting for potential confounders. However, the positive association between CCA-IMT and incident MI was more pronounced in E2 carriers than E3 homozygotes. Thus, our study suggests that while APOE E2 allele may predispose individuals to lower CCA-IMT, E2 carriers may be more prone to MI than E3 homozygotes as the CCA-IMT increases.

12,26582408,"<journal>JMIR research protocols</journal><title>Western Australian Public Opinions of a Minimum Pricing Policy for Alcohol: Study Protocol</title><abstract>BACKGROUND: Excessive alcohol consumption has significant adverse economic, social, and health outcomes. Recent estimates suggest that the annual economic costs of alcohol in Australia are up to AUD $36 billion. Policies influencing price have been demonstrated to be very effective in reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms. Interest in minimum pricing has gained traction in recent years. However, there has been little research investigating the level of support for the public interest case of minimum pricing in Australia. OBJECTIVE: This article describes protocol for a study exploring Western Australian (WA) public knowledge, understanding, and reaction to a proposed minimum price policy per standard drink. METHODS: The study will employ a qualitative methodological design. Participants will be recruited from a wide variety of backgrounds, including ethnic minorities, blue and white collar workers, unemployed, students, and elderly/retired populations to participate in focus groups. Focus group participants will be asked about their knowledge of, and initial reactions to, the proposed policy and encouraged to discuss how such a proposal may affect their own alcohol use and alcohol consumption at the population level. Participants will also be asked to discuss potential avenues for increasing acceptability of the policy. The focus groups will adopt a semi-structured, open-ended approach guided by a question schedule. The schedule will be based on feedback from pilot samples, previous research, and a steering group comprising experts in alcohol policy and pricing. RESULTS: The study is expected to take approximately 14 months to complete. CONCLUSIONS: The findings will be of considerable interest and relevance to government officials, policy makers, researchers, advocacy groups, alcohol retail and licensed establishments and organizations, city and town planners, police, and other stakeholder organizations.</abstract>",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0,OTHER,"{

At present there are few effective interventions for prefrontal cortex dysfunction in ASD. We report on an open-label, pilot study of intermittent TBS (iTBS) to target executive function deficits and restricted, repetitive behaviors in male children and adolescents with ASD. METHODS: Ten right-handed, male participants, aged 9-17 years with ASD were enrolled in an open-label trial of iTBS treatment. Fifteen sessions of neuronavigated iTBS at 100% motor threshold targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were delivered over 3 weeks. RESULTS: Parent report scores on the Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale demonstrated improvements with iTBS treatment. Participants demonstrated improvements in perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and total time for the Stroop test. The iTBS treatments were well tolerated with no serious adverse effects.

There were five deaths in the untreated group during the trial and no deaths in the treated group, although five of 25 treated patients reported anorexia. Deferoxamine metabolite analysis of urine for 24 hours after deferoxamine injection from sensitive and nonsensitive patients showed marked differences. Occurrence of side effects correlated with increased formation of a monoamine oxidase catalyzed (major) metabolite, MFO1. The metabolite ratio, MFO1/total metabolites, plus parent drug (TOT) showed a bimodal distribution with a mean +/- SD value of 0.68 +/- 0.06 for the nonsensitive and 0.79 +/- 0.04 for sensitive patients. The MFO1/TOT ratio discriminates between sensitive and nonsensitive patients, and we suggest that the half difference mark between the two mean values (0.735) can be used as a predictor of side effects. Patients with a MFO1/TOT ratio of greater than 0.70 would be considered at risk and observed for onset of side effects. Patients with a MFO1/TOT ratio greater than 0.80 would be considered for immediate adjunct treatment with isoniazid or other monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</abstract>",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0,OTHER,"{

The aim of this study was to asses the efficacy of probiotics in minimal hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.	Stable cirrhotics with minimal hepatic encephalopathy diagnosed by number connection test and evoked responses were recruited for the study. The patients were randomized to two groups and the drugs were administered in a double blind fashion. Improvement in number connection test score, evoked response time and arterial ammonia levels were noted.	43 patients were recruited for the study; 21 in the probiotics group and 22 in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant change in the parameters like arterial ammonia, evoked responses and number connection test before and after treatment with probiotics when compared to placebo.	Short term administration of probiotics did not produce any significant improvement in the various parameters assessed in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy when compared with placebo.</abstract>",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0,OTHER,"{

To address this challenge, recommendations include integrating tobacco-free policies and tobacco dependency treatment into the behavioral health care delivery system. Currently, little is known regarding levels of such integration. A 65-item Internet survey measuring integration assessed three areas: a) policies addressing the use of tobacco products; b) provision of evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment; and, c) capacity to help employees/volunteers quit tobacco use. The survey was distributed to representatives of all behavioral health programs in Wisconsin. The survey response rate was 27.1%. Programs, on average, were 40% integrated. A significant proportion of programs (20%) were less than 20% integrated. A few programs (4.3%) exceeded 80% integration. Integration of tobacco policies and treatment into the behavioral health care delivery system remains limited and there is a need for technical assistance and training.</abstract>",Remaining,0,0,OTHER,"{

Eleven patients completed both study periods; one patient who died of a heart attack 2 weeks before the end of the study was also included in the analysis. The study was terminated in 3 patients: one developed a grand mal seizure and 2 developed serious intercurrent infections. Body weight of study subjects increased more during the dronabinol treatment than during the placebo periods. Dronabinol treatment decreased severity of disturbed behavior and this effect persisted during the placebo period in patients who received dronabinol first. Adverse reactions observed more commonly during the dronabinol treatment than during placebo periods included euphoria, somnolence and tiredness, but did not require discontinuation of therapy. These results indicate that dronabinol is a promising novel therapeutic agent which may be useful not only for treatment of anorexia but also to improve disturbed behavior in patients with Alzheimer's disease.</abstract>",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0,OTHER,"{

We studied 100 African-American CHF patients (aged 55-87 years) in New York Heart Association classes II-IV, who are enrolled in an ongoing, randomized, controlled trial, evaluating the effectiveness of a telemonitoring intervention to improve access to ambulatory care for heart failure patients. These CHF patients were recruited from an inner-city practice, rural physician practices and an urban physician practice in Atlanta. The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used to measure cognition. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MMSE score of less than 24. The crude prevalence of cognitive impairment was 10% in this population of African Americans with CHF. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated an increase in odds of cognitive impairment with increasing age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10 and 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.20; p=0.042]. There was no significant relationship between cognitive impairment and gender, education status, depression and severity of CHF. This study indicates that cognitive impairment is relatively prevalent among African Americans with CHF, but lower than previously reported among Caucasians with CHF.</abstract>",Remaining,0,0,OTHER,"{

Several proteases released by invading tumor cells seem to participate in the focal degradation of extracellular matrix proteins. Using enzymatic assays, Western blotting, and Northern blotting techniques, we investigated whether cathepsin B level was associated with malignant grade in seven human glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B activity and protein content levels were higher in glioblastoma cell lines than in anaplastic astrocytoma or low-grade glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B transcripts were overexpressed in glioblastoma cell lines relative to their expression in anaplastic astrocytoma and low-grade glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B promoter activity and amount of SP-1 complexes were much higher in glioblastoma cell lines than in anaplastic astrocytoma or low-grade glioma cell lines. Finally, E-64, an inhibitor of cathepsin B, inhibited both cathepsin B enzymatic activity and the invasiveness of glioblastoma cell lines. These results strongly support a role for cathepsin B in glioblastoma cell lines and suggest that inhibition of cathepsin B activity may be proven useful in cancer therapy.</abstract>",In-vitro-study,8,0,OTHER,"{

They denounced the inadequacies of an extramural service conceived of as an out-patient clinic filling the void left by the shutting down of asylums. The positions elaborated by these associations focus on four main themes: the distribution of the 'burden of care' for the ill between services and families; the ill-conceived interpretation of the families' needs owing to the professional's alleged tendency to 'point the finger of guilt' at the families themselves; the demand for greater power in regard to decisions made by the services; the interaction with the rights and liberties of the mentally ill. Two different ranges of problems are discussed. First, there is the conflict within the family between the interests and rights of its income-producing and its 'dependent' members. This conflict points not to a loss but to an overload of functions shifted to the family at a time of rising expectations for the satisfaction of needs. It therefore calls for services of a new kind, i.e. services capable of making these conflicting interests and rights compatible. Second, extramural services either reject or misinterpret the asylum's labour-saving function. These services thus ascribe care for the material life of the mentally ill to the family's own resources alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</abstract>",Non-systematic-review,1,0,OTHER,"{

In an experimental study, participants used a measure of the Big Five personality factors to rate two individuals, each described with either signs of alcohol dependence or not. The ratings of the participants showed that they expected the alcohol-dependent versions of both individuals to be less agreeable and less conscientious. The participants expected the alcohol-dependent college student to be more extraverted and the alcohol-dependent lawyer-father to be more neurotic. The expected personality characteristics of the alcohol-dependent versions of the two described persons were very similar to the actual personality characteristics of alcohol-dependent individuals. The results were consistent with prior findings regarding narrow-band personality traits related to the Big Five. The results help explain prior findings about the social handicap of problem drinking with regard to making friends, dating, marriage, and working.

The latter feature is noted to be identical to the alien hand sign as described in the left arm of commissurotomized patients and patients with callosal neoplasm or infarction.

A shared deficient serotonergic transmission was postulated for both syndromes. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was argued to regulate eating behaviour and to be dysfunctional in eating disorders. METHODS: Fourteen women meeting DSM-IV criteria for BN were included in a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial. In order to exclude patients highly responsive to placebo, all patients were first submitted to a one-week sham treatment. Randomisation was followed by 3 weeks of active treatment or sham stimulation. As the main outcome criterion we defined the change in binges and purges. Secondary outcome variables were the decrease of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) over time. RESULTS: The average number of binges per day declined significantly between baseline and the end of treatment in the two groups. There was no significant difference between sham and active stimulation in terms of purge behaviour, BDI, HDRS and YBOCS over time. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results indicate that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of BN does not exert additional benefit over placebo. A larger number of patients might clarify a further role of rTMS in the treatment of BN.</abstract>",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0,OTHER,"{

This protocol was also originally used for the preparation of cell-free extract containing the MX strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is preferentially propagated by cell-to-cell contact and does not release distinct virions into the medium. In the present study, we compared different approaches to virus isolation. Based on virus yield, we show that deionized water lysis is the fastest and most effective method for releasing LCMV MX infectious viral particles from persistently infected cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that freeze-thaw cycles and sonication do not improve virus isolation. This simple protocol could be used for isolation of other viruses, the life cycle of which is strictly cell-associated and therefore are difficult to release in large amounts from host cells.</abstract>",In-vitro-study,8,0,OTHER,"{

A review of research published since 1994 was carried out concerning depression and occupational disability in five diagnostic groups: Major depressive disorder (MDD), spinal cord injuries (SCI), traumatic brain injuries (TBI), chronic back pain (CP) and myocardial infarction/coronary artery bypass grafting (MI/CABG).	Prospective longitudinal designs were mostly undertaken in MDD studies. Diagnostic interview schedules were utilized in most MDD studies whereas self-report inventories that tend to confound somatic and depressive symptoms were mostly used in CP, SCI, TBI and MI/CABG studies. In longitudinal MDD studies both depression and occupational disability were related to access to enhanced primary care treatment. On the other hand, CP research reported different results concerning the strength of depressive symptoms, cognitive and psychosocial factors in predicting occupational disability. Different trends across diagnostic groups were evident in relation to depression, occupational disability, co-morbidity, socio-demographic factors and psychosocial resources.	Co-morbid, socio-demographic and psychosocial factors provide a framework from which to identify those at greater risk of depression and occupational disability.

The SVZ may become a target for radiation therapy in glioblastoma patients. However, reports studying the effect of irradiation of the SVZ on glioblastoma patient survival show conflicting results. We studied the correlation between incidental SVZ radiation dose and survival in a cohort of isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDHwt) glioblastoma patients with inclusion of important survival prognosticators.	In this retrospective analysis, only adult patients with supratentorial IDHwt glioblastoma were included who were treated with temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy after surgery. The SVZ was contoured on the radiotherapy planning imaging. Cox proportional regression overall survival (OS) analysis was used to study the correlation between SVZ dose and survival. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score, extent of resection and O[6]-methylguanine-methyl-DNA-transferase gene promoter (MGMTp) methylation were used as covariates in multivariate analysis.	In total, 137 patients were included. Median OS was 13.3 months. The MGMTp methylation was present in 40% of cases. Ipsilateral SVZ (iSVZ) mean dose was 44.4 Gy and 27.2 Gy for the contralateral SVZ (cSVZ). Univariate survival analysis showed an inverse relationship between cSVZ mean dose and OS (HR 1.029 (1.003-1.057); p= .032). However, there was no correlation between cSVZ mean dose and OS in multivariate analysis. iSVZ dose did not correlate with survival.	In this cohort of 137 IDHwt glioblastoma patients, iSVZ did not correlate with OS. Higher cSVZ dose was inversely correlated with OS in univariate survival analysis but lost its significance in multivariate analysis, including MGMTp-methylation. Hence, the correlation between SVZ radiation and glioblastoma patient survival remains unclear. Carefully designed prospective studies are needed to provide unequivocal results on this controversial topic.</abstract>",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0,OTHER,"{

PRSS8 upregulation inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, xenograft experiments showed that PRSS8 overexpression suppressed glioma cell growth in vivo. We also found that upregulated PRSS8 reduced the protein expression levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR in glioma cells. Taken together, our study demonstrated that overexpression of PRSS8 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, PRSS8 may act as a novel therapeutic target for glioma.</abstract>",In-vitro-study,8,0,OTHER,"{

An impaired ability to stop or control alcohol intake despite adverse health or social consequences characterize AUD. While AUDs predominantly occur in men, growing evidence suggests the existence of distinct cognitive and biological consequences of alcohol dependence in women. The molecular and physiological mechanisms participating in these differential effects remain unknown. Transcriptomic technology permits the detection of the biological mechanisms responsible for such sex-based differences, which supports the subsequent development of novel personalized therapeutics to treat AUD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of transcriptomics studies regarding alcohol dependence in humans with representation from both sexes. For each study, we processed and analyzed transcriptomic data to obtain a functional profile of pathways and biological functions and then integrated the resulting data by meta-analysis to characterize any sex-based transcriptomic differences associated with AUD. Global results of the transcriptomic analysis revealed the association of decreased tissue regeneration, embryo malformations, altered intracellular transport, and increased rate of RNA and protein replacement with female AUD patients. Meanwhile, our analysis indicated that increased inflammatory response and blood pressure and a reduction in DNA repair capabilities are associated with male AUD patients. In summary, our functional meta-analysis of transcriptomic studies provides evidence for differential biological mechanisms of AUD patients of differing sex.</abstract>",Human-systematic-review,7,0,OTHER,"{

BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines recommend prenatal genetic counselling for pregnant women before participation in the tests. METHODS: A total of 210 pregnant women participated in the study by completing the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-I, Decisional Conflict Scale, SURE Scale, Knowledge Assessment Forms, Decision Satisfaction Form and Attitudes Scale between June 2017 and March 2018. In the first stage, pregnant women were evaluated who had only prenatal genetic screening tests and in the second stage, pregnant women who had been recommended to receive diagnostic tests. The intervention group received face-to-face individual education and counselling about prenatal genetic tests. Independent samples t test, t tests and Pearson correlation tests were used. RESULTS: Education and counselling for prenatal screening tests and diagnostic tests from the first weeks of pregnancy were effective in decreasing anxiety, decisional conflict, increasing attitudes towards tests and had positive effects on pregnant women's knowledge level and decision satisfaction (P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Prenatal genetic counselling and education are more effective if provided from the first weeks of pregnancy.

However, many dentists in Japan are hesitant to acknowledge denture adhesives in daily practice because of the stereotype that dentures should be inherently stable, without the aid of adhesives. The aim of this study is to verify the efficacy of denture adhesives to establish guidelines for Japanese users. The null hypothesis is that the application of denture adhesives, including the cream and powder types, or a control (isotonic sodium chloride solution) would not produce different outcomes nor would they differentially improve the set outcomes between baseline and day 4 post-application. METHODS: This ten-center, randomized controlled trial with parallel groups is ongoing. Three hundred edentulous patients with complete dentures will be allocated to three groups (cream-type adhesive, powder-type adhesive, and control groups). The participants will wear their dentures with the denture adhesive for 4 days, including during eight meals (three breakfasts, two lunches, and three dinners). The baseline measurements and final measurements for the denture adhesives will be performed on the first day and after breakfast on the fourth day. The primary outcome is a general satisfaction rating for the denture. The secondary outcomes are denture satisfaction ratings for various denture functions, occlusal bite force, resistance to dislodgement, masticatory performance, perceived chewing ability, and oral health-related quality of life. Between-subjects comparisons among the three groups and within-subjects comparisons of the pre- and post-intervention measurements will be performed. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis will be performed. The main analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. A sample size of 100 subjects per group, including an assumed dropout rate of 10 %, will be required to achieve 80 % power with a 5 % alpha level. DISCUSSION: This randomized clinical trial will provide information about denture adhesives to complete denture wearers, prosthodontic educators, and dentists in Japan. We believe this new evidence on denture adhesive use from Japan will aid dentists in their daily practice even in other countries. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01712802 .

Maximal intima-media thickness was greater in the study group (mean, 1.28 +/- SE 0.06 mm) than in the control group (mean, 0.90 +/- SE 0.05 mm). Even after the effects of age, hypertension, and tobacco consumption were controlled, these differences remained statistically significant. This study suggests that irradiation may contribute to the development of more severe and extensive carotid atherosclerosis in head and neck cancer patients who receive radiation therapy.</abstract>",Remaining,0,0,OTHER,"{

HLH affecting the CNS mimics several neurological disorders and may be misdiagnosed. The diagnostic and therapeutic problems of this disease are discussed.	We report a case of a 5-year-old girl with a 2-month history of right hemiparesis. The initial magnetic resonance imaging scan mimicked the appearance of malignant glioma or cerebral infarction. By use of neuroimaging alone, it was extremely difficult to reach an appropriate diagnosis.	Pathological examination of a surgical specimen of the lesion revealed histological characteristics typical of HLH. Because of the absence of both physical and blood chemical findings of systemic HLH, the patient was diagnosed as having HLH isolated in the CNS without systemic HLH. Radiotherapy with corticosteroid administration led to complete resolution of the CNS lesions, but the duration of remission was only 3 months. The patient died secondary to refractory progression of the CNS lesion.	Radiotherapy with corticosteroid administration led to a complete resolution of the lesions, although for only a transitory remission. Although HLH is extremely rare, the existence of this disease isolated in the CNS should be documented, and further case accumulation and therapeutic investigations are needed to clarify the pathophysiological characteristics of this disease.</abstract>",Human-case-report,4,0,OTHER,"{

Semi-structured interviews were conducted and all supervisors of the university hospital service were interviewed. Routinely collected case registries were also reviewed. Standardized assessment with content analysis for each category was carried out.	The results showed distortions in the adopted service focus (doctor-patient relationship) and consultant requests. This focus is more on consulting physician-oriented interventions than on patients.	Evaluation of the relevance of service criteria could help promoting quality assessment of the services provided, mainly when objective criteria have not yet been established to assure their suitability.</abstract>",Remaining,0,0,OTHER,"{

Engel (1959) a systematization of the psychodynamic conceptions of pain and pain disorder is given. Four different explanations for the genesis and maintenance of pain states are worked out: (1) The narcissistic mechanism (substitution), (2) the conversion mechanism (symbolization), introduced by S. Freud himself, (3) the psychovegative mechanism (resomatization), and (4) learning principles. These four conceptions are presented. Finally concern is expressed as the conceptual range of three of these explanatory principles is thought to cover a relevant range by far not reached by other pain theories more en vogue.</abstract>",Non-systematic-review,1,0,OTHER,"{

T835M mutation in netrin receptor UNC5C predisposes to the late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases neuronal cell death. However, it remains unclear how this receptor is molecularly regulated in AD. Here, we show that δ-secretase selectively cleaves UNC5C and escalates its proapoptotic activity, facilitating neurodegeneration in AD. Netrin deficiency activates δ-secretase that specifically cuts UNC5C at N467 and N547 residues and enhances subsequent caspase-3 activation, additively augmenting neuronal cell death. Blockade of δ-secretase cleavage of UNC5C diminishes T835M mutant's proapoptotic activity. Viral expression of δ-secretase-truncated UNC5C fragments into APP/PS1 mice strongly accelerates AD pathologies, impairing learning and memory. Conversely, deletion of UNC5C from netrin-1-depleted mice attenuates AD pathologies and rescues cognitive disorders. Hence, δ-secretase truncates UNC5C and elevates its neurotoxicity, contributing to AD pathogenesis.</abstract>",Animal-other,5,1,OTHER,"{

Three of these men also had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The four reported belonging to a social network of transgender persons (i.e., persons who identify with or express a gender and/or sex different from their biologic sex) (1). By October 1998, test results on Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from the four men demonstrated a matching 11-band DNA fingerprint pattern (2), suggesting that these case-patients were epidemiologically linked. This report describes the public health investigation of these TB case-patients to identify contacts in Baltimore and the New York City area (NYC); the findings suggest that an interstate outbreak of TB has occurred within a social network that includes transgender persons.</abstract>",Remaining,0,0,OTHER,"{

Concurrent two vessel monitoring using transcranial Doppler ultrasound.</title><abstract>To overcome the technical limitations which have precluded noninvasive Doppler ultrasound in investigation of rapid cerebral haemodynamic responses in two cerebrovascular beds at the same time, we have modified a commercial 2 MHz pulsed Doppler instrument with online spectrum analysis. Two probes are activated intermittently, recording eight averaged Doppler-shifted spectra from each probe sequentially. Concurrent recordings of blood velocity in both middle cerebral arteries were performed during 25 selective iohexol carotid angiography runs in 13 patients with near normal cerebral vasculature. The technique permitted the differentiation between the specific responses confined to the recipient vascular bed, and the general responses occurring in remote brain areas as well. The specific response to iohexol was biphasic; a significant decrease in blood velocity occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, probably due to the high viscocity of iohexol. Between 4 and 12 s. blood velocity was significantly increased, reflecting the cerebrovascular response to hypertonic solutions. The blood velocity on the opposite side increased from less than 4 s through 45 s after iohexol. This concurs with studies using electromagnetic flowmetry, and suggests that these general responses are elicited by anxiety, discomfort and pain. Thus, no general responses were seen during angiography under general anaesthesia. Eight patients investigated during catheter flushing with normal saline showed a biphasic specific response reciprocal to that due to iohexol. A significant blood velocity peak occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, followed by a decrease between 4 and 60 s. The saline injections produced no pain and evoked no significant general response.</abstract>",Remaining,0,0,OTHER,"{

Items from the Social Responsiveness Scale and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised were mapped to nine a priori symptom dimensions. Multi-group confirmatory factor models, including measurement equivalence and item response theory analyses, examined whether males and females showed measurement or structural differences in autism symptom constructs. Results indicated mean differences in restricted interests that were not due to measurement bias. No other symptom dimension showed evidence of measurement bias and autism symptom structure was highly similar between males and females. Future studies are needed to carefully estimate any sex differences in the content, frequency, or intensity/severity of restricted interests in females and males.</abstract>",Remaining,0,0,OTHER,"{

To investigate the role of metabolic insults in AD, we injected streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetogenic compound if used in the periphery, into the lateral ventricle of the 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice and studied the cognitive function as well as AD-like brain abnormalities, such as tau phosphorylation and Aβ accumulation, 3-6 weeks later. We found that STZ exacerbated impairment of short-term and spatial reference memory in 3xTg-AD mice. We also observed an increase in tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation, a disturbance of brain insulin signaling, and a decrease in synaptic plasticity and amyloid β peptides in the brain after STZ treatment. The expression of 20 AD-related genes, including those involved in the processing of amyloid precursor protein, cytoskeleton, glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, synaptic function, protein kinases, and apoptosis, was altered, suggesting that STZ disturbs multiple metabolic and cell signaling pathways in the brain. These findings provide experimental evidence of the role of metabolic insult in AD.</abstract>",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1,OTHER,"{
