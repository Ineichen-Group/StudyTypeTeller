1266,12570354,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,Prodromal frontal/executive dysfunction predicts incident dementia in Parkinson's disease.,"To identify the cognitive characteristics predictive of incident dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD), we examined the baseline neuropsychological profiles of 18 initially non-demented patients with PD who met diagnostic criteria for dementia (PDD) at one-year follow-up. PDD participants' baseline neuropsychological test scores were compared to the baseline performance of 18 patients with PD who did not meet criteria for dementia at one-year follow-up (PDND) and 18 normal controls (NC). The three groups were matched on baseline demographic and disease variables. Relative to the PDND group, the incident PDD participants demonstrated significantly poorer performance on digits backward (Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised), word list learning and recognition (California Verbal Learning Test), and perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Each of these baseline neuropsychological variables exhibited adequate diagnostic classification accuracy in predicting PDD and PDND group membership at follow-up. These results suggest that subtle frontal/executive dysfunction is evident during the immediate PDD prodrome and may be of prognostic value in identifying PD patients at risk for dementia. Accordingly, neuropsychological evaluation may facilitate early identification of PDD and thereby inform appropriate dispositional planning.",Remaining,"<journal>Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS</journal><title>Prodromal frontal/executive dysfunction predicts incident dementia in Parkinson's disease.</title><abstract>To identify the cognitive characteristics predictive of incident dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD), we examined the baseline neuropsychological profiles of 18 initially non-demented patients with PD who met diagnostic criteria for dementia (PDD) at one-year follow-up.

1271,6799631,The Journal of pathology,"Human pituitary gonadotropic adenoma; histological, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural and hormonal studies in eight cases.","Among 230 surgically removed pituitary adenomas, eight tumours showing immunostaining gonadotropic cells and elevated intratumours gonadotropin concentrations have been detected (frequency: 3.5 per cent.). By light microscopy the tumours were composed of agranular cells and generally PAS negative cytoplasm. The immunofluorescence technique revealed the presence of immunoreactive FSH (beta-subunit) alone in two cases, of both FSH and LH in six cases with immunoreactive beta endorphin in two of them. By electron microscopy, the cells contained an often dilated moderately or well developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, secretory granules measuring 150 nm to 200 nm which varied in electron density, and numerous microtubules. Basal plasma FSH and LH levels were simultaneously elevated in two cases; FSH levels alone were elevated in two cases; in three cases, both FSH and LH plasma values were normal. FSH and LH intratumour concentrations were simultaneously elevated in five cases; FSH alone was elevated in two cases. In all cases, the concentrations of the other hormones were negligible, except in two cases where beta endorphin concentration was elevated. The comparison of the immunocytochemical findings, the hormonal plasma levels and intratumour concentrations showed a good relationship between the immunoreactivity of the tumour and the intratumour RIA. The gonadotropic adenoma is uncommon but not rare. Its diagnosis is possible if immunocytochemical techniques are applied.",Remaining,"<journal>The Journal of pathology</journal><title>Human pituitary gonadotropic adenoma; histological, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural and hormonal studies in eight cases.</title><abstract>Among 230 surgically removed pituitary adenomas, eight tumours showing immunostaining gonadotropic cells and elevated intratumours gonadotropin concentrations have been detected (frequency: 3.5 per cent.).

378,31434803,JCI insight,Transcription factor EB overexpression prevents neurodegeneration in experimental synucleinopathies.,"The synucleinopathies Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple system atrophy (MSA) - characterized by α-synuclein intracytoplasmic inclusions into, respectively, neurons and oligodendrocytes - are associated with impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathways (ALP). Increased expression of the master regulator of ALP, transcription factor EB (TFEB), is hypothesized to promote the clearance of WT α-synuclein and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we explore the efficacy of targeted TFEB overexpression either in neurons or oligodendrocytes to reduce the pathological burden of α-synuclein in a PD rat model and a MSA mouse model. While TFEB neuronal expression was sufficient to prevent neurodegeneration in the PD model, we show that only TFEB oligodendroglial overexpression leads to neuroprotective effects in the MSA model. These beneficial effects were associated with a decreased accumulation of α-synuclein into oligodendrocytes through recovery of the ALP machinery. Our study demonstrates that the cell type where α-synuclein aggregates dictates the target of TFEB overexpression in order to be protective, paving the way for adapted therapies.",Animal-drug-intervention,"<journal>JCI insight</journal><title>Transcription factor EB overexpression prevents neurodegeneration in experimental synucleinopathies.</title><abstract>The synucleinopathies Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple system atrophy (MSA) - characterized by α-synuclein intracytoplasmic inclusions into, respectively, neurons and oligodendrocytes - are associated with impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathways (ALP).

Here we report the analysis of 16 ChG by whole-exome and RNA-sequencing. We found that 15 ChG harbor the same PRKCA [D463H] mutation. PRKCA encodes the Protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme alpha (PKCα) and is mutated in a wide range of human cancers. However the hot spot PRKCA [D463H] mutation was not described in other tumors. PRKCA [D463H] is strongly associated with the activation of protein translation initiation (EIF2) pathway. PKCα[D463H] mRNA levels are more abundant than wild-type PKCα transcripts, while PKCα[D463H] is less stable than the PCKα[WT] protein. Compared to PCKα[WT], the PKCα[D463H] protein is depleted from the cell membrane. The PKCα[D463H] mutant enhances proliferation of astrocytes and tanycytes, the cells of origin of ChG.

1170,32750380,Neuroscience,Genetic Inactivation of Cholinergic C Bouton Output Improves Motor Performance but not Survival in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons and leads to death a few years after symptom onset. Despite its high morbidity and mortality, its underlying pathogenic mechanisms still remain poorly understood. Although there is increasing evidence for significant changes in the structure and function of synapses on motor neurons, there is a need for a systematic investigation of the role of each synapse subtype in the course of the disease. Here, we focus on large cholinergic synapses on motor neurons, known as C boutons, and investigate their role during ALS progression. We implement a genetic strategy for inactivation of the cholinergic output of C boutons in the SOD1[G93A] transgenic mouse model of ALS. We demonstrate that although C bouton cholinergic inactivation does not alter mouse survival, it exerts a beneficial effect on motor performance in the rotarod motor task, as evidenced by an increased latency to fall in SOD1[G93A] mice lacking C bouton cholinergic output. Our results suggest that C bouton cholinergic transmission exerts a negative effect on motor neuron function in ALS, possibly via aberrant excitation, and render C boutons a potential target for future pharmacological intervention.",Animal-drug-intervention,"<journal>Neuroscience</journal><title>Genetic Inactivation of Cholinergic C Bouton Output Improves Motor Performance but not Survival in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.</title><abstract>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons and leads to death a few years after symptom onset.

1188,18580596,Alzheimer disease and associated disorders,Assessing impulsivity changes in Alzheimer disease.,"Impulsive behaviors are common in brain-damaged patients including those with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD). The objective of this study was to develop and validate a short version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale assessing changes on 4 different dimensions of impulsivity, namely urgency, (lack of) premeditation, (lack of) perseverance, and sensation seeking, arising in the course of a neurodegenerative disease. To this end, caregivers of 83 probable AD patients completed a short questionnaire adapted from the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the data were performed and revealed that a model with 4 distinct but related latent variables corresponding to 4 different dimensions of impulsivity fit the data best. Furthermore, the results showed that lack of perseverance, followed by lack of premeditation and urgency, increased after the onset of the disease, whereas sensation seeking decreased. Overall, the multifaceted nature of impulsivity was confirmed in a sample of AD patients, whose caregivers reported significant changes regarding each facet of impulsivity. Consequently, the short version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale opens up interesting prospects for a better comprehension of behavioral symptoms of dementia.",Remaining,"<journal>Alzheimer disease and associated disorders</journal><title>Assessing impulsivity changes in Alzheimer disease.</title><abstract>Impulsive behaviors are common in brain-damaged patients including those with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD).

Redistribution of body heat and heat loss to the environment result in mild hypothermia before cardiopulmonary bypass. Maintenance of normothermia, rather than hypothermia, may facilitate early tracheal extubation. Hypothermia alters the distribution and decreases the metabolism of most drugs, including anesthetic drugs and muscle relaxants, thus prolonging recovery. Postoperative shivering increases metabolic rate and potentially leads to myocardial ischemia; prevention is therefore critical to the success of early tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery. Coagulopathies, increased incidence of surgical wound infection, and perioperative cardiac morbidity are other potential risk factors identified in noncardiac patients.

1754,10211470,Annals of neurology,Hippocampal or neocortical lesions on magnetic resonance imaging do not necessarily indicate site of ictal onsets in partial epilepsy.,"Advances in neuroimaging techniques, particularly high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have proved invaluable in identifying structural brain lesions in patients with epilepsy. The assumption that such focal lesions invariably predict the site of seizure origin may not be correct, however. We report a series of 20 adults with medically intractable partial epilepsy, where high-resolution brain MRI disclosed a unilateral, focal, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion as the only abnormality in each case; nevertheless, based on electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, ictal onsets arose from a completely different location than that of the MRI lesion. All patients underwent epilepsy surgery, with the operations based on ictal EEG findings, and all were followed at least 2 years after the resection. After the most recent follow-up examination, 50% (10/20) of the patients were completely seizure-free, 35% (7/20) had at least a 75% reduction in the number of seizures, and 15% (3/20) had less than a 75% reduction in the number of seizures. We conclude that the identification of a focal, structural, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion on brain MRI is not always indicative of the site of seizure origin in partial epilepsy. Furthermore, in cases of discordance between MRI and EEG data, a good outcome after epilepsy surgery is possible if EEG ictal onsets are definitive.",Remaining,"<journal>Annals of neurology</journal><title>Hippocampal or neocortical lesions on magnetic resonance imaging do not necessarily indicate site of ictal onsets in partial epilepsy.</title><abstract>Advances in neuroimaging techniques, particularly high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have proved invaluable in identifying structural brain lesions in patients with epilepsy.

1420,3418380,Journal of neurosurgery,CSF leukotriene C4 following subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Leukotrienes derive from arachidonic acid metabolism via the lipoxygenase pathway and modulate several cellular events. In the central nervous system, leukotrienes are mainly synthesized in the gray matter and in vascular tissues. Their production is enhanced in ischemic conditions and in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Previous studies have indicated the ability of the leukotrienes C4 and D4 to constrict arterial vessels in vivo and in vitro and have suggested their involvement in the pathogenesis of cerebral arterial spasm. In the present study, the authors measured lumbar and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of leukotriene C4 in 48 patients who had suffered aneurysmal SAH. In 12 of the cases, symptomatic and radiological spasm was evident. The mean lumbar CSF level of immunoreactive-like activity of leukotriene C4 (i-LTC4) was significantly higher (p less than 0.005) than in control cases, while the cisternal CSF level was higher than the lumbar mean concentration (p less than 0.005). Patients presenting with vasospasm had significantly higher levels of i-LTC4 compared to patients without symptomatic vasospasm. This is the first report concerning monitoring of i-LTC4 levels in the CSF after SAH. The results of this study suggest that: 1) metabolism of arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway is enhanced after SAH; 2) the higher cisternal CSF levels of i-LTC4 may be part of the biological response in the perianeurysmal subarachnoid cisterns after the hemorrhage; and 3) the higher CSF levels of i-LTC4 in patients presenting with vasospasm suggest that a relationship exists between this compound and arterial spasm and/or reflect the development of cerebral ischemic damage.",Remaining,"<journal>Journal of neurosurgery</journal><title>CSF leukotriene C4 following subarachnoid hemorrhage.</title><abstract>Leukotrienes derive from arachidonic acid metabolism via the lipoxygenase pathway and modulate several cellular events.

761,20513660,Brain : a journal of neurology,Bone morphogenetic protein-7 release from endogenous neural precursor cells suppresses the tumourigenicity of stem-like glioblastoma cells.,"Glioblastoma cells with stem-like properties control brain tumour growth and recurrence. Here, we show that endogenous neural precursor cells perform an anti-tumour response by specifically targeting stem-like brain tumour cells. In vitro, neural precursor cells predominantly express bone morphogenetic protein-7; bone morphogenetic protein-7 is constitutively released from neurospheres and induces canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells. Exposure of human and murine stem-like brain tumour cells to neurosphere-derived bone morphogenetic protein-7 induces tumour stem cell differentiation, attenuates stem-like marker expression and reduces self-renewal and the ability for tumour initiation. Neurosphere-derived or recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-7 reduces glioblastoma expansion from stem-like cells by down-regulating the transcription factor Olig2. In vivo, large numbers of bone morphogenetic protein-7-expressing neural precursors encircle brain tumours in young mice, induce canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells and can thereby attenuate tumour formation.

However, past pharmacological approaches have failed to resolve whether activation or blockade of this receptor would have greater therapeutic benefit. To address this issue, we generated compound mice expressing a human amyloid precursor protein gene with familial AD mutations in combination with deficiency of amylin receptors produced by hemizygosity for the critical calcitonin receptor subunit of this heterodimeric GPCR. These compound transgenic AD mice demonstrated attenuated responses to human amylin- and Aβ-induced depression of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in keeping with the genetic depletion of amylin receptors. Both the LTP responses and spatial memory (as measured with Morris water maze) in these mice were improved compared to AD mouse controls and, importantly, a reduction in both the amyloid plaque burden and markers of neuroinflammation was observed.

During the 3 month treatment period, mean ± SD PHQ-9 score decreased from 18.7 ± 5.7 to 5.0 ± 5.3, mean ± SD CGI-S score decreased from 4.4 ± 0.7 to 2.2 ± 1.1 and mean ± SD PDQ-D score decreased from 42.1 ± 18.8 to 13.4 ± 13.0. By Month 3, response and remission rates reached 80.8% and 59.0%, respectively. Work productivity loss decreased from 73.6% to 30.5%, while activity impairment decreased from 71.5% to 24.6%. Positive correlations were observed between PHQ-9, PDQ-D, and WPAI work productivity loss and activity impairment. By Month 3, 82.0% of patients were either not depressed or only mildly depressed (PHQ-9 score ≤9).	In real-world clinical settings, vortioxetine was effective in reducing depression severity and improving cognitive function and work productivity in SEA patients with major depression.</abstract>","{

557,34708477,Human brain mapping,Mental health in the UK Biobank: A roadmap to self-report measures and neuroimaging correlates.,"The UK Biobank (UKB) is a highly promising dataset for brain biomarker research into population mental health due to its unprecedented sample size and extensive phenotypic, imaging, and biological measurements. In this study, we aimed to provide a shared foundation for UKB neuroimaging research into mental health with a focus on anxiety and depression. We compared UKB self-report measures and revealed important timing effects between scan acquisition and separate online acquisition of some mental health measures. To overcome these timing effects, we introduced and validated the Recent Depressive Symptoms (RDS-4) score which we recommend for state-dependent and longitudinal research in the UKB. We furthermore tested univariate and multivariate associations between brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and mental health. Our results showed a significant multivariate relationship between IDPs and mental health, which was replicable. Conversely, effect sizes for individual IDPs were small. Test-retest reliability of IDPs was stronger for measures of brain structure than for measures of brain function. Taken together, these results provide benchmarks and guidelines for future UKB research into brain biomarkers of mental health.",Remaining,"<journal>Human brain mapping</journal><title>Mental health in the UK Biobank: A roadmap to self-report measures and neuroimaging correlates.</title><abstract>The UK Biobank (UKB) is a highly promising dataset for brain biomarker research into population mental health due to its unprecedented sample size and extensive phenotypic, imaging, and biological measurements.

Most mutations of PDC are localized in the alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. We have kinetically characterized a patient's missense mutation alphaH44R in E1alpha by creating and purifying three recombinant human E1s (alphaH44R, alphaH44Q, and alphaH44A). Substitutions at histidine-15 resulted in decreased V(max) values (6% alphaH44R; 30% alphaH44Q; 90% alphaH44A) while increasing K(m) values for thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) compared to wild-type (alphaH44R, 3-fold; alphaH44Q, 7-fold; alphaH44A, 10-fold). This suggests that the volume of the residue at site 15 is important for TPP binding and substitution by a residue with a longer side chain disrupts the active site more than the TPP binding site. The rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of alphaH44R E1 by E1-kinase and phospho-E1 phosphatase, respectively, were similar to that of the wild-type E1 protein.

The present series included 39 children (3-17 years of age) who underwent GKS for cerebral AVMs between January 2002 and February 2008. Twenty-five patients presented with hemorrhages. The median AVM volume was 1.5 cm³, and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy. All patients continued to have follow-up for more than 24 months with serial magnetic resonance images (MRIs)/angiograms. Current school performance has been evaluated using a telephone survey answered by the patients' parents.	Follow-up angiograms, available in 34 patients, confirmed complete obliteration in 16 patients. Serial MRIs indicated obliteration of the nidus in one of five patients without angiography. The diffuse nidus structure and low marginal dose were significantly associated with incomplete obliteration. Twelve patients underwent a second GKS, and subsequent angiographies, available in six patients, demonstrated complete obliteration in two of them.

To explore factors associated with (a) intravenous OMT misuse, (b) repeated misuse, (c) emergency room (ER) admission, (d) misuse of different OMT types and (e) concurrent benzodiazepine misuse.	We recruited 3,620 patients in 27 addiction units in Italy and collected data on the self-reported rate of intravenous injection of methadone (MET), buprenorphine (BUP), BUP-naloxone (NLX), OMT dosage and type, experience of and reason for misuse, concurrent intravenous benzodiazepine misuse, pattern of -misuse in relation to admission to the addiction unit and ER -admissions because of misuse. According to inclusion/exclusion criteria, 2,585 patients were included.	Intravenous misuse of OMT substances was found in 28% of patients with no difference between OMT types and was associated with gender, age, type of previous opioid abuse and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. Repeated OMT misuse was reported by 20% (i.e., 71% of misusers) of patients and was associated with positive OMT misuse experience and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. Admission to the ER because of misuse complications was reported by 34% of patients, this outcome being associated with gender, employment, type of previous opioid abuse and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. OMT dosage was lower than the recommended maintenance dosage.	We offered new information on factors associated with intravenous OMT misuse, repeated misuse and ER admission in Italian patients under OMT. Our data indicate that BUP-NLX misuse is not different from that of BUP or MET. Choosing the more expensive BUP-NLX over MET will likely not lead to the expected reduction of the risk of injection misuse of the OMT. Instead of prescribing new and expensive OMT formulations, addiction unit physicians and medical personnel should better focus on patient's features that are associated with a higher likelihood of misuse. Care should be paid to concurrent benzodiazepine and OMT misuse.</abstract>","{

A technical description and initial results.,"This study aimed to propose an alternative treatment for carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) using the balloon-assisted sinus coiling (BASC) technique and to describe this procedure in detail. Under general anesthesia, we performed the BASC procedure to treat five patients with traumatic CCF. Percutaneous access was obtained via the right femoral artery, and a 7F sheath was inserted, or alternatively, a bifemoral 6F approach was accomplished. A microcatheter was inserted into the cavernous sinus over a 0.014-inch microwire through the fistulous point; the microcatheter was placed distal from the fistula point, and a 'U-turn' maneuver was performed. Through the same carotid access, a compliant balloon was advanced to cross the point of the fistula and cover the whole carotid tear. Large coils were inserted using the microcatheter in the cavernous sinus. Coils filled the adjacent cavernous sinus, respecting the balloon. Immediate complete angiographic resolution was achieved, and an early angiographic control (mean = 2.6 months) indicated complete stability without recanalization. The clinical follow-up has been uneventful without any recurrence (mean = 15.2 months). An endovascular approach is optimal for direct CCF. Because the detachable balloon has been withdrawn from the market, covered stenting requires antiplatelet therapy and its patency is unconfirmed, but cavernous sinus coiling remains an excellent treatment option. Currently, there is no detailed description of the BASC procedure. We provide detailed angiograms with suitable descriptions of the exact fistula point, and venous drainage pathways.

1589,19432386,Dialogues in clinical neuroscience,Multiple rare variants in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders.,"Recent studies in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) support an important role for multiple rare variants in these conditions. This is a clinically important finding, as, with the demonstration that a significant proportion of ASDs are the result of rare, etiological genetic variants, it becomes possible to make use of genetic testing to supplement behavioral analyses for an earlier diagnosis. As it appears that earlier interventions in ASDs will produce better outcomes, the development of genetic testing to augment behaviorally based evaluations in ASDs holds promise for improved treatment. Furthermore, these rare variants involve synaptic and neuronal genes that implicate specific pathways, cells, and subcellular compartments in ASDs, which in turn will suggest novel therapeutic approaches in ASDs. Of particular recent interest are the synaptic cell adhesion and associated molecules, including neurexin 1, neuroligin 3 and 4, and SHANK3, which implicate glutamatergic synapse abnormalities in ASDs. In the current review we will overview the evidence for a genetic etiology for ASDs, and summarize recent genetic findings in these disorders.

But the impact of intensive rehabilitation on the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of intensive rehabilitation on the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke using data from the National Health Insurance Service database. This is a register-based, retrospective cohort study. Using data from the National Health Insurance Service database, we included the patients who received rehabilitation for stroke from 2006 to 2013. Of the 14,984 patients diagnosed with stroke, 2483 died within 1 year, and 2866 did not receive rehabilitation; hence, they were also excluded. The final sample included 9635 (49.2% men, 50.8% women) patients. After correcting for covariates, the Cox model was used to evaluate the effects of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) on survival. We estimated the independent contribution of each factor to the risk of death from the initiation of rehabilitation. Significant differences in mortality were observed according to age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), income level, and stroke type. Patients with stroke who received both PT and OT had a better long-term prognosis than those who received either treatment alone. Therapy performed by a physical therapist with more than 120 hours of training effectively improved the patients' long-term prognosis.

1283,30342963,Experimental neurology,Key determinants for morphine withdrawal conditioned context-induced increase in Arc expression in anterior cingulate cortex and withdrawal memory retrieval.,"Addiction memory is subjected to time-dependent shifts toward neocortex in remote period to promote long-term addiction memory storage, which plays an important role in drug relapse. However, how the activity and neuroplasticity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) change after contextual morphine withdrawal conditioning and what factors determine this change remain to be determined. In this paper, using immunohistochemical and single-cell microinjection techniques, combining behavioral assay, we found that (1) contextual withdrawal conditioning increases the expression of c-Fos, but not Arc, in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (2) at the first day after conditioning, conditioned context has no influence on the expression of c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (3) at the 14th day after conditioning, conditioned context increases the expression of both c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (4) the inhibition of dendritic spines of the ACC or projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC attenuates the conditioned context-induced increase of Arc expression in the ACC and abolishes the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning. These results suggest that the ACC may exhibit a change in neuroplasticity at the 14th day after conditioning, and the dendritic spines of the ACC and the projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC are key determinants for conditioned context induced-increase in Arc expression in the ACC and the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning.",Animal-other,"<journal>Experimental neurology</journal><title>Key determinants for morphine withdrawal conditioned context-induced increase in Arc expression in anterior cingulate cortex and withdrawal memory retrieval.</title><abstract>Addiction memory is subjected to time-dependent shifts toward neocortex in remote period to promote long-term addiction memory storage, which plays an important role in drug relapse.

1174,37211337,Brain stimulation,Long-lasting restoration of memory function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity by focused ultrasound in Alzheimer's disease.,"Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a medical technology that non-invasively stimulates the brain and has been applied in thermal ablation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, and neuromodulation. In recent years, numerous experiences and indications for the use of FUS in clinical and preclinical studies have rapidly expanded. Focused ultrasound-mediated BBB opening induces cognitive enhancement and neurogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated.	Here, we investigate the effects of FUS-mediated BBB opening on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive function in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We applied FUS with microbubble to the hippocampus and LTP was measured 6 weeks after BBB opening using FUS. Field recordings were made with a concentric bipolar electrode positioned in the CA1 region using an extracellular glass pipette filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Morris water maze and Y-maze was performed to test cognitive function.	Our results demonstrated that FUS-mediated BBB opening has a significant impact on increasing LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 synapses and rescues cognitive dysfunction and working memory. These effects persisted for up to 7 weeks post-treatment. Also, FUS-mediated BBB opening in the hippocampus increased PKA phosphorylation.	Therefore, it could be a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases as it remarkably increases LTP, thereby improving working memory.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,"<journal>Brain stimulation</journal><title>Long-lasting restoration of memory function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity by focused ultrasound in Alzheimer's disease.</title><abstract>Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a medical technology that non-invasively stimulates the brain and has been applied in thermal ablation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, and neuromodulation.

Cases were classified as alcoholics or narcotics abusers according to the following criteria: any case record report of drinking problems or narcotics abuse, alcoholism or narcotics abuse indicated in the manner or cause of death or autopsy findings of liver change or pancreatitis due to alcoholism, or toxicology findings of narcotics (unless medically prescribed). The age-eligible cases decreased from 710 in year 1 to 691 in year 2 and 643 in year 3. Decedents classified as alcoholics rose from 18% in year 1 to 25% in years 2 and 3. The proportions classified as narcotic abusers and those with both conditions were relatively constant, averaging 7 and 5%, respectively, over the 3 years. Substance abuse itself was the manner of death for alcoholics and most of those with both conditions; 38% of the narcotics abusers were homicide victims.

It is reported to have a lower incidence of CNS side effects than orally administered scopolamine. Although uncommon, such side effects occur more often in the elderly, in those with preexisting psychiatric disease, and in patients concurrently taking other medications with anticholinergic activity.

269,10678495,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,Time-dependent striatal dopamine depletion after injection of 6-hydroxydopamine in the rat. Comparison of single bilateral and double bilateral lesions.,"For future investigation of possible perturbation of circadian rhythm in animal models of Parkinson's disease we needed an animal model providing lasting 80-100% striatal dopaminergic depletion in rats, but without induced mortality. We have thus compared the effects of a single hydroxydopamine bilateral striatal lesion (SB-hydroxydopamine) with those of a double hydroxydopamine bilateral lesion (DB-hydroxydopamine) at the same dose (16 microg/striatum) by HPLC determination of dopamine and 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (dopac) levels in the striatum. Two weeks after neurosurgery, SB-hydroxydopamine and DB-hydroxydopamine induced dopaminergic depletion of at least 81% compared with control groups. After eight weeks striatal dopaminergic depletion was only 60.97% in SB-hydroxydopamine rats, suggesting a compensatory phenomenon, whereas in DB-hydroxydopamine rats dopaminergic loss was stable at 88%. For the DB-hydroxydopamine group the dopac/dopamine ratio was significantly increased at week 2 only, whereas no significant change was observed for other groups. This increase might be explained by increased dopamine turnover. We have demonstrated that striatal DB-hydroxydopamine injection induces lasting 80-100% neuronal loss, close to that observed in the disease in man, without induced mortality, and provides a tool which meets our experimental requirements.",Animal-other,"<journal>The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology</journal><title>Time-dependent striatal dopamine depletion after injection of 6-hydroxydopamine in the rat.
