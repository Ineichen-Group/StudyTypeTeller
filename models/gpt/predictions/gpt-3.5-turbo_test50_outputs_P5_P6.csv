608,18540779,Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology,Triacetyluridine (TAU) decreases depressive symptoms and increases brain pH in bipolar patients.,"Eleven patients with bipolar depression were given doses of up to 18 g per day of triacetyluridine (TAU) over 6 weeks to test the effect of uridine on symptoms of depression via Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; Asberg, Montgomery, Perris, Schalling, & Sedvall, 1978) scores and on cellular bioenergetics using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (31P-MRSI). All patients and comparison participants (n = 9) completed baseline 31P-MRSI scans, and 9 patients completed posttherapy scans. The percentage changes for MADRS scores (Week 2, -23.8; Week 3, -34.9; Week 4, -42.5) and the time effects of TAU on MADRS scores (Week 2, z = -2.07, p = .039; Week 3, z = -4.28, p < .001; Week 4, z = -4.54, p < .001) may reflect TAU effects on early symptom improvement. TAU responders (patients who had a 50% or greater reduction in MADRS scores from baseline at any time) demonstrated a significant difference from nonresponders in pH changes from baseline (effect size = 150).

1695,29052307,Developmental science,Instrumental learning and cognitive flexibility processes are impaired in children exposed to early life stress.,"Children who experience severe early life stress show persistent deficits in many aspects of cognitive and social adaptation. Early stress might be associated with these broad changes in functioning because it impairs general learning mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we examined whether individuals who experienced abusive caregiving in childhood had difficulties with instrumental learning and/or cognitive flexibility as adolescents. Fifty-three 14-17-year-old adolescents (31 exposed to high levels of childhood stress, 22 control) completed an fMRI task that required them to first learn associations in the environment and then update those pairings. Adolescents with histories of early life stress eventually learned to pair stimuli with both positive and negative outcomes, but did so more slowly than their peers. Furthermore, these stress-exposed adolescents showed markedly impaired cognitive flexibility; they were less able than their peers to update those pairings when the contingencies changed. These learning problems were reflected in abnormal activity in learning- and attention-related brain circuitry. Both altered patterns of learning and neural activation were associated with the severity of lifetime stress that the adolescents had experienced. Taken together, the results of this experiment suggest that basic learning processes are impaired in adolescents exposed to early life stress. These general learning mechanisms may help explain the emergence of social problems observed in these individuals.",Remaining,"<journal>Developmental science</journal><title>Instrumental learning and cognitive flexibility processes are impaired in children exposed to early life stress.</title><abstract>Children who experience severe early life stress show persistent deficits in many aspects of cognitive and social adaptation.

Aggregation-prone truncated species of αSyn caused by aberrant cleavage of this fibrillogenic protein are hypothesized to participate in its sequestration into inclusions subsequently leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Here, we investigated the role of calpain cleavage of αSyn in vivo by generating two opposing mouse models.

As anticipated, a reduced calpain activity led to a decreased number of αSyn-positive aggregates, whereas loss of calpastatin led to increased truncation of αSyn in SynCAST(-). Furthermore, overexpression of calpastatin decreased astrogliosis and the calpain-dependent degradation of synaptic proteins, potentially ameliorating the observed neuropathology in [A30P]αSyn and SynCAST(+) mice.

625,19397425,Journal of neurotrauma,Dose and chemical modification considerations for continuous cyclic AMP analog delivery to the injured CNS.,"In this investigation, two cell-permeable synthetic analogs of cAMP, dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) and 8-bromo-cAMP, which are widely used to elevate intracellular cAMP levels under experimental conditions, were investigated for their ability to dose-dependently improve histological and functional outcomes following continuous delivery in two models of incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). The cAMP analogs were delivered via osmotic minipumps at 1-250 mM through an indwelling cortical cannula or by intrathecal infusion for up to 4 weeks after either a T8 unilateral over-hemisection or a C2-3 dorsolateral quadrant lesion, respectively. In both SCI models, continuous db-cAMP delivery was associated with histopathological changes that included sporadic micro-hemorrhage formation and cavitation, enhanced macrophage infiltration and tissue damage at regions beyond the immediate application site; no deleterious or beneficial effect of agent delivery was observed at the spinal injury site. Furthermore, these changes were accompanied by pronounced behavioral deficits that included an absence of progressive locomotor recovery, increased extensor tone, paralysis, and sensory abnormalities. These deleterious effects were not observed in saline-treated animals, in animals in which the db-cAMP dose did not exceed 1 mM, or in those animals that received a high dose (250 mM) of the alternative cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP.

763,30900693,Zhurnal voprosy neirokhirurgii imeni N. N. Burdenko,[Evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in acromegaly using different remission criteria].,"For a long time, surgical removal of somatotropinoma using the transsphenoidal approach has been the first stage of treatment in most acromegaly patients. For the past decades, the efficacy criteria for surgical treatment of acromegaly have significantly changed, which requires appropriate correction.	We aimed to evaluate the results of transsphenoidal adenomectomy in acromegaly patients using various criteria for disease remission.	The study included patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly who underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic adenomectomy performed by a single neurosurgeon. The surgical treatment outcomes were evaluated 6 months after operative intervention based on levels of IGF-1, OGTT, and GH. The obtained data were analyzed using different threshold values for the level of GH nadir during OGTT: criteria A <2.0 ng/ml, criteria B <1.0 ng/ml, and criteria C <0.4 ng/ml to assess acromegaly remission, along with matching of the IGF-1 level to the reference range for a given gender and age.	The study included 70 patients (52 females and 18 males) with a mean age of 52.2±11.5 years (29 to 73 years). The baseline IGF-1 level exceeded the upper limit of the reference range 3.3±1.4 (1.1-7.3)-fold, on average. The baseline mean basal GH level was 34.2±41.7 (1.2-192.0) ng/ml. The mean pituitary adenoma size was 16.7±8.6 (4.3-46.0) mm; 18 (26%) out of 70 patients had pituitary microadenoma, and 52 (74%) patients had macroadenoma. Six months after surgery, acromegaly remission met criteria A in 47 (67%) patients, criteria B in 28 (40%) patients, and criteria C in 18 (26%) patients.	Our findings demonstrate that evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in treatment of acromegaly patients depends on the criteria chosen for assessing remission. This feature should be considered when comparing outcomes of surgical treatment for acromegaly in different years. Probably, introduction of the 2010 criteria should be accompanied by revision of the previous remission indicators.

Цель исследования - оценить результаты транссфеноидальной аденомэктомии у пациентов с акромегалией с использованием различных критериев ремиссии заболевания. Материал и методы. В исследование включили пациентов с впервые выявленной акромегалией, которым была выполнена трансназальная транссфеноидальная эндоскопическая аденомэктомия одним нейрохирургом. Результаты хирургического лечения оценили через 6 мес после оперативного вмешательства путем определения уровня ИФР-1 и ОГТТ с определением ГР. Полученные данные проанализировали, используя различные пороговые значения уровня ГР в ОГТТ: критерии А <2,0 нг/мл, критерии В <1,0 нг/мл, критерии С <0,4 нг/мл для оценки ремиссии акромегалии наряду с соответствием уровня ИФР-1 референсному диапазону для данного пола и возраста. Результаты. В исследование включены 70 пациентов (52 женщины и 18 мужчин), средний возраст которых составил 52,2±11,5 года (от 29 до 73 лет). Исходный уровень ИФР-1 превышал верхнюю границу референсного диапазона в среднем в 3,3±1,4 (1,1-7,3) раза. Исходно средний базальный уровень ГР составил 34,2±41,7 (1,2-192,0) нг/мл. Размер аденомы гипофиза - 16,7±8,6 (4,3-46,0) мм; 18 (26%) из 70 пациентов имели микроаденому гипофиза, 52 (74%) пациента - макроаденому. Через 6 мес после хирургического лечения критериям А ремиссии акромегалии соответствовали 47 (67%) пациентов, критериям В - 28 (40%) пациентов, критериям С - 18 (26%) пациентов. Выводы. Согласно данным нашего исследования, оценка результатов транссфеноидальной аденомэктомии при лечении больных акромегалией зависит от выбранных критериев оценки ремиссии.

В исследование включили пациентов с впервые выявленной акромегалией, которым была выполнена трансназальная транссфеноидальная эндоскопическая аденомэктомия одним нейрохирургом. Результаты хирургического лечения оценили через 6 мес после оперативного вмешательства путем определения уровня ИФР-1 и ОГТТ с определением ГР. Полученные данные проанализировали, используя различные пороговые значения уровня ГР в ОГТТ: критерии А <2,0 нг/мл, критерии В <1,0 нг/мл, критерии С <0,4 нг/мл для оценки ремиссии акромегалии наряду с соответствием уровня ИФР-1 референсному диапазону для данного пола и возраста. Результаты. В исследование включены 70 пациентов (52 женщины и 18 мужчин), средний возраст которых составил 52,2±11,5 года (от 29 до 73 лет). Исходный уровень ИФР-1 превышал верхнюю границу референсного диапазона в среднем в 3,3±1,4 (1,1-7,3) раза. Исходно средний базальный уровень ГР составил 34,2±41,7 (1,2-192,0) нг/мл. Размер аденомы гипофиза - 16,7±8,6 (4,3-46,0) мм; 18 (26%) из 70 пациентов имели микроаденому гипофиза, 52 (74%) пациента - макроаденому.

For the past decades, the efficacy criteria for surgical treatment of acromegaly have significantly changed, which requires appropriate correction.	We aimed to evaluate the results of transsphenoidal adenomectomy in acromegaly patients using various criteria for disease remission.	The study included patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly who underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic adenomectomy performed by a single neurosurgeon. The surgical treatment outcomes were evaluated 6 months after operative intervention based on levels of IGF-1, OGTT, and GH. The obtained data were analyzed using different threshold values for the level of GH nadir during OGTT: criteria A <2.0 ng/ml, criteria B <1.0 ng/ml, and criteria C <0.4 ng/ml to assess acromegaly remission, along with matching of the IGF-1 level to the reference range for a given gender and age.	The study included 70 patients (52 females and 18 males) with a mean age of 52.2±11.5 years (29 to 73 years). The baseline IGF-1 level exceeded the upper limit of the reference range 3.3±1.4 (1.1-7.3)-fold, on average. The baseline mean basal GH level was 34.2±41.7 (1.2-192.0) ng/ml. The mean pituitary adenoma size was 16.7±8.6 (4.3-46.0) mm; 18 (26%) out of 70 patients had pituitary microadenoma, and 52 (74%) patients had macroadenoma. Six months after surgery, acromegaly remission met criteria A in 47 (67%) patients, criteria B in 28 (40%) patients, and criteria C in 18 (26%) patients.	Our findings demonstrate that evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in treatment of acromegaly patients depends on the criteria chosen for assessing remission. This feature should be considered when comparing outcomes of surgical treatment for acromegaly in different years. Probably, introduction of the 2010 criteria should be accompanied by revision of the previous remission indicators.

Injection of human tumour cells into the internal carotid artery of syngeneic or nude mice produces experimental metastases in specific regions of the brain; these are not due to patterns of initial cell arrest, motility, or invasiveness, but rather to the ability of metastatic tumour cells to grow. Whether the progressive growth of brain metastases depends on neovascularisation is not clear. Immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses show that the density of blood vessels within experimental metastases in the brains of nude mice, or within brain metastases derived from human lung cancer, is lower than in the adjacent, tumour-free brain parenchyma. However, blood vessels associated with brain metastases are dilated and contain many dividing endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis also reveals that tumour cells located less than 100 microm from a blood vessel are viable, whereas more distant tumour cells undergo apoptosis. The blood-brain barrier is intact in and around experimental brain metastases smaller than 0.25 mm in diameter, but is leaky in larger metastases.

The fact that wave periods and amplitudes are differentially affected by sleep loss indicates that it is premature to adopt any single wave form characteristic (e.g., power spectral density) to index delta sleep. Our data also confirm a recent report that eye movement density decreases after sleep loss; we hypothesize that this change results from greater depth of sleep; an inverse relation of depth of sleep to eye movement density provides a coherent explanation for a range of otherwise disparate observations.

1702,22810096,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Age-related cognitive decline in hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout mice (LDLr-/-): evidence of antioxidant imbalance and increased acetylcholinesterase activity in the prefrontal cortex.,"There is increasing evidence that hypercholesterolemia during midlife may represent a predictor of subsequent mild cognitive impairments and dementia decades later. However, the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown since plasmatic cholesterol is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that cognitive impairments triggered by hypercholesterolemia during aging may be related to brain oxidative stress and altered brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. We also performed a neuropathological investigation in order to analyze whether the cognitive impairments may be associated with stroke-related features. To address these questions we used three- and fourteen-month-old low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (LDLr-/-). The current findings provide new evidence that aged LDLr-/- mice, exposed to over three-fold cholesterol levels from early life, show working, spatial reference, and procedural memory impairments, without alterations in motor function. Antioxidant imbalance and oxidative damage were evidenced by a marked increase in lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels) and glutathione metabolism (increase in glutathione levels, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase activities) together with a significant increase in the AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex of aged hypercholesterolemic LDLr-/- mice. Notably, hypercholesterolemia was not related to brain infarcts and neurodegeneration in mice, independent of their age. These observations provide new evidence that hypercholesterolemia during aging triggers cognitive impairments on different types of learning and memory, accompanied by antioxidant imbalance, oxidative damage, and alterations of cholinergic signaling in brain areas associated with learning and memory processes, particularly in the prefrontal cortex.",Animal-other,"<journal>Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD</journal><title>Age-related cognitive decline in hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout mice (LDLr-/-): evidence of antioxidant imbalance and increased acetylcholinesterase activity in the prefrontal cortex.</title><abstract>There is increasing evidence that hypercholesterolemia during midlife may represent a predictor of subsequent mild cognitive impairments and dementia decades later.

The current findings provide new evidence that aged LDLr-/- mice, exposed to over three-fold cholesterol levels from early life, show working, spatial reference, and procedural memory impairments, without alterations in motor function. Antioxidant imbalance and oxidative damage were evidenced by a marked increase in lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels) and glutathione metabolism (increase in glutathione levels, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase activities) together with a significant increase in the AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex of aged hypercholesterolemic LDLr-/- mice. Notably, hypercholesterolemia was not related to brain infarcts and neurodegeneration in mice, independent of their age. These observations provide new evidence that hypercholesterolemia during aging triggers cognitive impairments on different types of learning and memory, accompanied by antioxidant imbalance, oxidative damage, and alterations of cholinergic signaling in brain areas associated with learning and memory processes, particularly in the prefrontal cortex.</abstract>","<title>Age-related cognitive decline in hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout mice (LDLr-/-): evidence of antioxidant imbalance and increased acetylcholinesterase activity in the prefrontal cortex.</title><abstract>There is increasing evidence that hypercholesterolemia during midlife may represent a predictor of subsequent mild cognitive impairments and dementia decades later. However, the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown since plasmatic cholesterol is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that cognitive impairments triggered by hypercholesterolemia during aging may be related to brain oxidative stress and altered brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity.

1809,35085001,Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,Association of Lithium and Second-Generation Antipsychotics with Neurocognition in Youth with Bipolar Disorder.,"Objective: Numerous studies have examined the association of antimanic medications with neurocognition in adults with bipolar disorder (BD). However, few studies have examined this topic in youth. Thus, we aimed to examine the association of lithium and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), the first-line antimanic medications for youth with BD, with neurocognition in a relatively large sample of youth with BD. Methods: Participants included 91 youth with BD-I, -II, or -Not Otherwise Specified, aged 13-20 years (n = 14 current lithium use, n = 51 current SGA use). We examined four tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery: Intra/Extra Dimensional Set-Shifting Task (IED), Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP), Stockings of Cambridge Test (SOC), and Affective Go/No-Go (AGN). Within-sample Z-scores were computed, and a global neurocognitive composite score and g factor derived from these tests comprised the primary outcomes. Multivariable analyses controlled for age, sex, and IQ. Results: Current lithium use was significantly associated with poorer cognitive flexibility/set-shifting (IED). After further controlling for lifetime comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and current depression symptoms in sensitivity analyses, the lithium finding was no longer significant. Current SGA use was significantly associated with greater affective processing bias (AGN). No significant findings survived correction for multiple comparisons. All other cognitive outcomes were not significantly associated with current lithium use, current SGA use, or total number of current medications. Conclusions: Treatment with lithium or SGAs was associated with minimal neurocognitive impairments, with small effect sizes in primary multivariable analyses. This study adds to the limited body of literature examining medication use in relation to neurocognition in youth with BD. While the current study cannot rule out associations of smaller effect size, present findings suggest that leading mood-stabilizing medications are not associated with frank neurocognitive impairments in youth with BD.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,"<journal>Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology</journal><title>Association of Lithium and Second-Generation Antipsychotics with Neurocognition in Youth with Bipolar Disorder.</title><abstract>Objective: Numerous studies have examined the association of antimanic medications with neurocognition in adults with bipolar disorder (BD).

Here, we report a case of narcolepsy type 2 caused by hippocampal glioma of the right temporal lobe.	A 44-year-old male farmer complained of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) over the past 3 months and more.	The lesion of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was removed and its pathological examination was carried out.	General examination showed no abnormalities of his heart, lungs, or abdomen. Neurological examination showed no positive sign. The blood routine and biochemical examination were normal. He scored 7 on the Pittsburg sleep quality index, 16 on the Epworth sleepiness scale, 52 on the self-rating anxiety scale, and 48 on the self-rating depression scale. The multiple sleep latency test data showed 2 periods of sleep-onset rapid eyes movement period across 4 successive tests; the average sleep latency was under 8 minutes, and the rapid eyes movement latency was under 7 minutes. Lesion of glioma in hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and histological examination. After surgical removal of the glioma from the hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe, the patient's EDS symptoms disappeared immediately. He scored 3 on the Epworth sleepiness scale. During our follow-up three months later, he remained well with no complications.	We diagnosed the patient with narcolepsy type 2 according to the 3rd Edition of International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3).	The patient suffered from EDS and was diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2. The narcolepsy type 2 was linked to glioma of the hippocampus area. The hippocampus might be another part of regulating the sleep-arousal pathway, and the glioma secretion might interact with the orexin projection system.",Human-case-report,"<journal>Medicine</journal><title>Case report: narcolepsy type 2 due to temporal lobe glioma.</title><abstract>The orexin projection system includes the lateral hypothalamus, reticular activating structure, and ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, and this system is related to the pathogenesis of narcolepsy.

464,34500626,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",Apigenin Ameliorates Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction and Neuronal Damage in Mice.,"We investigated the protective effect and mechanisms of apigenin against cognitive impairments in a scopolamine-injected mouse model. Our results showed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of scopolamine leads to learning and memory dysfunction, whereas the administration of apigenin (synthetic compound, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) improved cognitive ability, which was confirmed by behavioral tests such as the T-maze test, novel objective recognition test, and Morris water maze test in mice. In addition, scopolamine-induced lipid peroxidation in the brain was attenuated by administration of apigenin. To further evaluate the protective mechanisms of apigenin on cognitive and memory function, Western blot analysis was carried out. Administration of apigenin decreased the B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio and suppressed caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. Furthermore, apigenin down-regulated the β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme, along with presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 protein levels. Apigenin-administered mice showed lower protein levels of a receptor for advanced glycation end-products, whereas insulin-degrading enzyme, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression were promoted by treatment with apigenin. Therefore, this study demonstrated that apigenin is an active substance that can improve cognitive and memory functions by regulating apoptosis, amyloidogenesis, and BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways.",Animal-drug-intervention,"<journal>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</journal><title>Apigenin Ameliorates Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction and Neuronal Damage in Mice.</title><abstract>We investigated the protective effect and mechanisms of apigenin against cognitive impairments in a scopolamine-injected mouse model.

However, clinical studies of neural grafting in Parkinson's disease have produced only modest improvements. One of the main reasons for this is the low survival rate of transplanted neurons. The inadequate supply of critical neurotrophic factors in the adult brain is likely to be a major cause of early cell death and restricted outgrowth of fetal grafts placed into the mature striatum. Glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor that is crucial to the survival, outgrowth and maintenance of dopamine neurons, and so is a candidate for protecting grafted fetal dopamine neurons in the adult brain. We found that implantation of adeno-associated virus type 2 encoding GDNF (AAV2-GDNF) in the normal monkey caudate nucleus induced overexpression of GDNF that persisted for at least 6 months after injection. In a 6-month within-animal controlled study, AAV2-GDNF enhanced the survival of fetal dopamine neurons by 4-fold, and increased the outgrowth of grafted fetal dopamine neurons by almost 3-fold in the caudate nucleus of MPTP-treated monkeys, compared with control grafts in the other caudate nucleus.

1676,30094777,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,"Development and internal validation of an aneurysm rupture probability model based on patient characteristics and aneurysm location, morphology, and hemodynamics.","Unruptured cerebral aneurysms pose a dilemma for physicians who need to weigh the risk of a devastating subarachnoid hemorrhage against the risk of surgery or endovascular treatment and their complications when deciding on a treatment strategy. A prediction model could potentially support such treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to develop and internally validate a model for aneurysm rupture based on hemodynamic and geometric parameters, aneurysm location, and patient gender and age.	Cross-sectional data from 1061 patients were used for image-based computational fluid dynamics and shape characterization of 1631 aneurysms for training an aneurysm rupture probability model using logistic group Lasso regression. The model's discrimination and calibration were internally validated based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic and calibration plots.	The final model retained 11 hemodynamic and 12 morphological variables, aneurysm location, as well as patient age and gender. An adverse hemodynamic environment characterized by a higher maximum oscillatory shear index, higher kinetic energy and smaller low shear area as well as a more complex aneurysm shape, male gender and younger age were associated with an increased rupture risk. The corresponding AUC of the model was 0.86 (95% CI [0.85, 0.86], after correction for optimism 0.84).	The model combining variables from various domains was able to discriminate between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms with an AUC of 86%.

1157,22880116,PloS one,The cortical signature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The aim of this study was to explore the pattern of regional cortical thickness in patients with non-familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to investigate whether cortical thinning is associated with disease progression rate. Cortical thickness analysis was performed in 44 ALS patients and 26 healthy controls. Group differences in cortical thickness and the age-by-group effects were assessed using vertex-by-vertex and multivariate linear models. The discriminatory ability of MRI variables in distinguishing patients from controls was estimated using the Concordance Statistics (C-statistic) within logistic regression analyses. Correlations between cortical thickness measures and disease progression rate were tested using the Pearson coefficient. Relative to controls, ALS patients showed a bilateral cortical thinning of the primary motor, prefrontal and ventral frontal cortices, cingulate gyrus, insula, superior and inferior temporal and parietal regions, and medial and lateral occipital areas. There was a significant age-by-group effect in the sensorimotor cortices bilaterally, suggesting a stronger association between age and cortical thinning in ALS patients compared to controls. The mean cortical thickness of the sensorimotor cortices distinguished patients with ALS from controls (C-statistic ≥ 0.74). Cortical thinning of the left sensorimotor cortices was related to a faster clinical progression (r = -0.33, p = 0.03).

Comparisons were made between those youth satisfying diagnostic criteria for ASD and age and sex matched youth without ASD referred to the same clinical program. 9.3% (217/2323) of the referred youth (age range: 3-17 years) met DSM-III-R criteria for ASD. ASD youth suffered from significantly higher number of comorbid disorders than comparisons (6.4 ± 2.7 vs. 5.2 ± 2.9; p < 0.001). Ninety-five percent of the youth with ASD had three or more comorbid psychiatric disorders and 74% had five or more comorbid disorders. ASD youth were also more functionally impaired and required extra-assistance in school and therapeutic interventions at higher rates than age and sex matched non-ASD referred youth. Youth with ASD have high levels of psychiatric comorbidity and dysfunction comparable to the referred population of youth without ASD.

1697,24524869,Journal of neuroradiology = Journal de neuroradiologie,Comparison of ADC values of intracranial hemangiopericytomas and angiomatous and anaplastic meningiomas.,"This study aimed to determine whether the use of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values can improve the diagnostic efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate hemangiopericytoma (HPC) from angiomatous and anaplastic meningioma.	Preoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) studies of 38 patients with pathologically proven intracranial HPC (n = 12) and angiomatous (n = 13) or anaplastic meningioma (n = 13) were retrospectively reviewed. ADC values were measured in the tumor parenchyma and peritumoral edema, and used to obtain normalized ADC (NADC) ratios (ADC of tumor/ADC of normal white matter).	Mean ADC values were significantly different between HPC and anaplastic meningioma (1.17 ± 0.30 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s and 0.75 ± 0.11 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively). Mean NADC ratios were also significantly lower in the malignant cases (0.95 ± 0.13) compared with the benign HPCs (1.53 ± 0.39; P < 0.05). Mean ADC values and NADC ratios did not differ significantly between angiomatous meningioma and HPC (P > 0.05), whereas mean ADC values and NADC ratios were lower for anaplastic meningioma than for either angiomatous meningioma or HPC (P < 0.05). Mean ADC value in peritumoral edema in HPC (1.48 ± 0.11 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was lower than in either angiomatous (1.73 ± 0.28 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) or anaplastic (1.72 ± 0.25 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) meningioma (P < 0.05), and there was no significant difference between ADC values in anaplastic versus angiomatous meningioma (P > 0.05).	ADC values in tumor parenchyma and peritumoral edema can provide helpful information that is otherwise not available from conventional MRI to differentiate HPC from angiomatous and anaplastic meningioma.",Remaining,"<journal>Journal of neuroradiology = Journal de neuroradiologie</journal><title>Comparison of ADC values of intracranial hemangiopericytomas and angiomatous and anaplastic meningiomas.</title><abstract>This study aimed to determine whether the use of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values can improve the diagnostic efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate hemangiopericytoma (HPC) from angiomatous and anaplastic meningioma.

1579,22745378,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",Transcriptional regulator Id2 is required for the CD4 T cell immune response in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,"An effective immune response to Ag challenge is critically dependent on the size of the effector cell population generated from clonal activation of Ag-specific T cells. The transcription network involved in regulating the size of the effector population, particularly for CD4 Th cells, is poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of Id2, an inhibitor of E protein transcription factors, in the generation of CD4 effectors. Using a T cell-specific conditional Id2 knockout mouse model, we show that inhibitor of DNA binding (Id)2 is essential for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Although Ag-specific and IL-17-producing CD4 T cells are produced in these mice, the activated CD4 T cells form a smaller pool of effector cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs, exhibit reduced proliferation and increased cell death, and are largely absent in the CNS. In the absence of Id2, E protein targets, including the proapoptotic protein Bim and SOCS3, are expressed at higher levels among activated CD4 T cells. This study reveals a critical role of Id2 in the control of effector CD4 T cell population size and the development of a Th17-mediated autoimmune disease.",Animal-other,"<journal>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)</journal><title>Transcriptional regulator Id2 is required for the CD4 T cell immune response in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.</title><abstract>An effective immune response to Ag challenge is critically dependent on the size of the effector cell population generated from clonal activation of Ag-specific T cells.

1870,6625984,Archives of neurology,Language in the nondominant right hemisphere.,"Language function was evaluated in the right nondominant hemisphere in three patients undergoing cortical resection for intractable seizures. Three linguistic tests were given during electrical stimulation of the cortex. They represented three different levels of language complexity from lowest to highest as follows: task 1, object naming; task 2, sentence completion; and task 3, responsive naming. The greatest number of linguistic errors occurred with sentence completion. No linguistic errors were made on the most complex task. Wada's test in the right nondominant hemisphere did not impair function, whereas in the left dominant hemisphere it did. To make these seemingly incompatible observations acceptable, we speculate that there is a right nondominant language system that is anatomically and functionally tied to the left dominant system. Under normal conditions it is passively involved and its integrity is not essential to the function of the left dominant language system.",Remaining,"<journal>Archives of neurology</journal><title>Language in the nondominant right hemisphere.</title><abstract>Language function was evaluated in the right nondominant hemisphere in three patients undergoing cortical resection for intractable seizures.
