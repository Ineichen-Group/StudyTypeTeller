Most mutations of PDC are localized in the alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. We have kinetically characterized a patient's missense mutation alphaH44R in E1alpha by creating and purifying three recombinant human E1s (alphaH44R, alphaH44Q, and alphaH44A). Substitutions at histidine-15 resulted in decreased V(max) values (6% alphaH44R; 30% alphaH44Q; 90% alphaH44A) while increasing K(m) values for thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) compared to wild-type (alphaH44R, 3-fold; alphaH44Q, 7-fold; alphaH44A, 10-fold). This suggests that the volume of the residue at site 15 is important for TPP binding and substitution by a residue with a longer side chain disrupts the active site more than the TPP binding site. The rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of alphaH44R E1 by E1-kinase and phospho-E1 phosphatase, respectively, were similar to that of the wild-type E1 protein. These results provide a biochemical basis for altered E1 function in the alphaH44R E1 patient.","_input_hash":484356545,"_task_hash":1188156152,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":492,"end":497,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706712089,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32","_session_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32"}
{"pmid":"31706919","text":"Epilepsy & behavior : E&B^\nThe role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).^\nSudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the major cause of death that affects patients with epilepsy. The risk of SUDEP increases according to the frequency and severity of uncontrolled seizures; therefore, SUDEP risk is higher in patients with refractory epilepsy (RE), in whom most antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are ineffective for both seizure control and SUDEP prevention. Consequently, RE and SUDEP share a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, which is mainly associated with brain overexpression of ABC-transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The activity of P-gp can also contribute to membrane depolarization and affect the normal function of neurons and cardiomyocytes. Other molecular regulators of membrane potential are the inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir), whose genetic variants have been related to both epilepsy and heart dysfunctions. Although it has been suggested that dysfunctions of the cardiac, respiratory, and brainstem arousal systems are the causes of SUDEP, the molecular basis for explaining its dysfunctions remain unknown. In rats, repetitive seizures or status epilepticus induced high expression of P-gp and loss Kir expression in the brain and heart, and promoted membrane depolarization, malignant bradycardia, and the high rate of mortality. Here we reviewed clinical and experimental evidences suggesting that abnormal expression of depolarizing/repolarizing factors as P-gp and Kir could favor persistent depolarization of membranes without any rapid functional recovery capacity. This condition induced by convulsive stress could be the molecular mechanism leading to acquired severe bradycardia, as an ineffective heart response generating the appropriate scenario for SUDEP development.

However, the same test may be used for measuring QoL, well-being or health status in different studies. QoL has been defined as the subjective appraisal of one's current life based primarily on psychological function. The most important in the appraisal of well-being is mental function and concerning health status patients evaluate physical function as most important. To differentiate the effects of GH replacement on psychological variables in patients with GHD we carried out a number of meta-analyses, classifying questionnaires into instruments measuring QoL, psychological well-being and health status.\tWe searched the electronic databases PUBMED and PiCarta from 1985 to 2004. Studies were included that evaluated the effect of GH on patient-reported outcomes in adults with GHD (aged 18 years and above). According to generally accepted definitions we classified the questionnaires as instruments measuring QoL, well-being and health status. By means of meta-analyses the average effect size (d) for QoL, well-being and health status was calculated.\tBased on open studies GH replacement is found to improve QoL with a small effect size (d = 0.18), well-being with a medium effect size (d = 0.47) and health status with a small effect size (d = 0.26). As the effect size of well-being is most pronounced the generally reported effects of GH replacement on QoL may be overestimated and actually reflect the effect on well-being.\tTo get more insight in the specific psychological effects of GH treatment it is recommended that instruments selected for these studies should be more consistently classified as instruments measuring QoL, well-being or health status.","_input_hash":1695653804,"_task_hash":-777627865,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":170,"end":178,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Patients","start":198,"end":206,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"report","start":255,"end":261,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"patients","start":690,"end":698,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":822,"end":830,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 36, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706712143,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32","_session_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32"}

Previously, we found that intravenous administration of the synthetic tetrapeptide Acetyl-His-Ala-Glu-Glu-Amide (HAEE), which is an analogue of the 35-38 region of the \u03b14 subunit of \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and specifically binds to the 11-14 site of A\u03b2, reduced the development of cerebral amyloidogenesis in a mouse model of AD. In the current study on three types of laboratory animals, we determined the biodistribution and tissue localization patterns of HAEE peptide after single intravenous bolus administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters of HAEE were established using uniformly tritium-labeled HAEE. Pharmacokinetic data provided evidence that HAEE goes through the blood-brain barrier. Based on molecular modeling, a role of LRP1 in receptor-mediated transcytosis of HAEE was proposed. Altogether, the results obtained indicate that the anti-amyloid effect of HAEE, previously found in a mouse model of AD, most likely occurs due to its interaction with A\u03b2 species directly in the brain.","_input_hash":-360442627,"_task_hash":1782889100,"spans":[{"text":"mouse","start":646,"end":651,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"study","start":680,"end":685,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"mouse","start":1237,"end":1242,"pattern":-1086236359}],"meta":{"pattern":"81, 2, 81"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706712240,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32","_session_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32"}

{"pmid":"25359445","text":"Pituitary^\nUpdate on radiation therapy in patients with Cushing's disease.^\nRadiation therapy is an important therapy for patients with Cushing's disease who are not in remission or relapse after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery and are not considered surgical candidates. The development of stereotactic radiation therapy, using gamma knife, linear accelerators or proton beam based methods, has enabled selective radiation delivery to the target while minimizing exposure of healthy tissues. In patients whose tumors are sufficiently distant from the optic apparatus, stereotactic radiation therapy can be delivered in a single session, a procedure termed radiosurgery, which significantly improves patient convenience.\tOriginal articles on radiation therapy in Cushing's disease, published during the past 12 months (2013-2014), were identified and pertinent data extracted.\tRecent studies have reported on the outcomes of patients with Cushing's disease who received mostly stereotactic radiation therapy. While tumor control has been excellent, biochemical remission was less consistently achieved. Some studies suggested that stereotactic radiation may lead to biochemical remission faster than conventional radiation therapy. In addition, retrospective data have suggested that withdrawing medical therapy around the time stereotactic radiation therapy is administered might lead to a faster biochemical response. Regardless of the radiation therapy method, biochemical recurrences may develop and these patients are at long-term risk of developing anterior hypopituitarism and require lifelong periodic endocrine follow-up.

Children die early due to either gradual atrophy or an infection of the lungs. Therefore, family members experience anticipatory loss, which causes grief before the actual loss. Family members feel physically and mentally exhausted, which results in a family crisis. Therefore, it is important to explore their experiences related to anticipatory loss to assist with the adjustment of the families to their circumstances.\tThis study applied a phenomenology method and purposive sampling.\tThe 19 parents who participated in this study were referred to us by two medical centers in Taiwan. Their average age was 32-49\u00a0years.\tUsing in-depth interviews, this study explored parents' anticipatory loss. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Meanings were extracted using Giorgi analysis, and precision was assessed according to Guba and Lincoln, which was treated as the evaluation standard.\tFour themes were identified from the parents' interviews. The themes included enduring the helplessness and pressure of care, suffering due to the child's rare and unknown condition, loss of hope and a reinforcement of the parent-child attachment, and avoiding the pressure of death and enriching the child's life.\tThe research findings help nurses identify anticipatory loss among parents of school-age children with type I or II spinal muscular atrophy.

The resulting HSD10 (p.R130C) loses most or all catalytic functions, and the males with this mutation have a much more severe clinical phenotype than those carrying p.V65A, p.L122V, or p.E249Q mutations. We found that the mutated cytosine which is +2259 nucleotide from the ATG of the gene, is >90% methylated in both the active and inactive X chromosomes in two normal females as well as in the X chromosome of a normal male. Since 5-methylcytosine is prone to conversion to thymine by deamination, the methylation of this cytosine in normal X chromosomes provides an explanation for the prevalence of the p.R130C mutation among patients with HSD10 deficiency. The substitution of arginine for cysteine eliminates several hydrogen bonds and reduces the van der Waals interaction between HSD10 subunits. The resulting disruption of protein structure impairs some if not all of the catalytic and non-enzymatic functions of HSD10. A meta-analysis of residual HSD10 activity in eight patients with the p.R130C mutation showed an average 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (MHBD) activity of only 6 (\u00b15) % of the normal control level. This is significantly lower than in cells of patients with other, clinically milder mutations and suggests that the loss of HSD10/MHBD activity is a marker for the disorder.","_input_hash":1897280783,"_task_hash":618987951,"spans":[{"text":"prevalence","start":830,"end":840,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"patients","start":871,"end":879,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1222,"end":1230,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"cells","start":1417,"end":1422,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"patients","start":1426,"end":1434,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"53, 34, 34, 70, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706712416,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32","_session_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32"}

While the condition has been well described in patients with acute hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, post-transplantation and chemotherapy, RPLS has been increasingly identified in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Though experience in the diagnosis and management of RPLS in patients with SLE is likely accumulating, few have systematically worked out the strategy to distinguish RPLS from neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) and lupus-related complications of the central nervous system (CNS). Prompt recognition of, and differentiation between, these conditions is essential since their clinical presentations substantially overlap and yet their management strategy and subsequent outcomes can be entirely different. Indeed, inappropriate treatment such as augmentation of immunosuppression may be detrimental to patients with RPLS. A high index of suspicion of RPLS, prompt magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, including diffusion imaging, exclusion of CNS infection and metabolic derangement, a comprehensive medication review accompanied by timely and aggressive control of blood pressure and seizure are keys to successful management of RPLS. Such treatment strategy ensures a very high chance of total neurological recovery in lupus patients with RPLS.","_input_hash":-1439436180,"_task_hash":-1958591743,"spans":[{"text":"literature","start":253,"end":263,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"patients","start":312,"end":320,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":452,"end":460,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnosis","start":555,"end":564,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"patients","start":591,"end":599,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1124,"end":1132,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"review","start":1337,"end":1343,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"patients","start":1553,"end":1561,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"5, 34, 34, 56, 34, 34, 4, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706712444,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32","_session_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32"}

However, the association between diabetes duration and the prognosis of stroke remains uncertain. We aimed to characterize whether an association exists between diabetes duration and stroke outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).\tBetween 2015 and 2018, 14,674 patients with ischemic stroke or TIA within 7 days and older than 18 years from the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III) were included in this analysis. Diabetes duration at baseline was collected by face-to-face interviews and further categorized into groups of without diabetes, diabetes\u00a0<\u00a04, 4 to\u00a0<8 and \u22658 years. The association between diabetes duration and clinical outcomes, including stroke recurrence, poor function outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6), and all-cause mortality at the 1-year follow-up after stroke onset, was evaluated by a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model, competing risk model and logistic regression model with adjustment for demographic and clinical features.\tAmong the 14,674 patients included, the average age was 62.0 years, and 68.5% were male. There were 1419 (9.7%) patients who had stroke recurrence, 1912 (13.0%) who had poor function outcome, and 478 (3.3%) who had all-cause mortality at the 1-year follow-up. After adjusting for potential covariates, a diabetes duration \u22658 years was associated with an increased risk of 1-year stroke recurrence (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.64; p\u00a0=\u00a0.02) in comparison to those without Diabetes mellitus. Using a competing risk regression model, a diabetes duration \u22658 years was a significant risk factor for stroke recurrence (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53).

We examined which secretory pathway trypsinogen takes to the surface of this endocrine-derived cell line. The 'constitutive' pathway externalizes proteins rapidly and in the absence of an external stimulus. In the alternate, 'regulated' pathway, proteins are stored in secretory granules until the cells are stimulated to secrete with 8-Br-cAMP. On the basis of indirect immunofluorescence localization, stimulation of release, and subcellular fractionation, we find that trypsinogen is targeted into the regulated secretory pathway in AtT-20 cells. In contrast, laminin, an endogenous secretory glycoprotein, is shown to be secreted constitutively. Thus it appears that the transport apparatus for the regulated secretory pathway in endocrine cells can recognize not only endocrine prohormones, but also the exocrine protein trypsinogen, which suggests that a similar sorting mechanism is used by endocrine and exocrine cells.","_input_hash":1038550191,"_task_hash":521379250,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":177,"end":180,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"cells","start":593,"end":598,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":838,"end":843,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1039,"end":1044,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1216,"end":1221,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 70, 70, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706712504,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32","_session_id":"2024-01-31_15-39-32"}

However, associations between family-level variables (maternal hostility, maternal depressive symptoms) and child behaviors (developmental course of ADHD and aggression) may be explained by genes that are shared by biologically related parents and children. Furthermore, ADHD symptoms and aggression commonly co-occur: it is important to consider both simultaneously to have a better understanding of processes underlying the developmental course of ADHD and aggression. To addresses these issues, we employed a longitudinal genetically sensitive parent-offspring adoption design. Analyses were conducted using Cohort I (n = 340) of the Early Growth and Development Study with cross-validation analyses conducted with Cohort II (n = 178). Adoptive mother hostility, but not depression, was associated with later child ADHD symptoms and aggression. Mothers and their adopted children were genetically unrelated, removing passive rGE as a possible explanation. Early child impulsivity/activation was associated with later ADHD symptoms and aggression. Child impulsivity/activation was also associated with maternal hostility, with some evidence for evocative gene-environment correlation processes on adoptive mother depressive symptoms. This study provides novel insights into family-based environmental influences on child ADHD and aggression symptoms, independent of shared parental genetic factors, implications of which are further explicated in the discussion.","_input_hash":136766513,"_task_hash":-2010946886,"spans":[{"text":"Longitudinal","start":58,"end":70,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"genes","start":649,"end":654,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"longitudinal","start":971,"end":983,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"Cohort","start":1070,"end":1076,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"Study","start":1125,"end":1130,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"Cohort","start":1177,"end":1183,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"study","start":1700,"end":1705,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"52, 78, 52, 1, 2, 1, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706795273,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

{"pmid":"12941437","text":"Life sciences^\nModulation of MK-801-elicited mouse popping behavior by galantamine is complex and dose-dependent.^\nThe ability of phencyclidine (PCP), a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, to precipitate a schizophreniform psychosis in susceptible individuals is consistent with the hypothesized pathologic occurrence of NMDA receptor hypofunction in this disorder. Because the psychosis caused by PCP resembles schizophrenia in all of the relevant domains of psychopathology, investigators have sought to characterize animal models of NMDA receptor hypofunction. MK-801 (dizocilpine) binds to the same hydrophobic channel domain in the NMDA receptor-associated ionophore as PCP, and has been shown to elicit intense irregular episodes of jumping behavior in mice, termed 'popping.' MK-801-elicited mouse popping is an animal model of NMDA receptor hypofunction that has been used to screen novel candidate compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia. Recently, a selective abnormality in the transduction of the acetylcholine signal at the level of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor has been described in schizophrenia. The existence of a nicotinic cholinergic abnormality in schizophrenia has stimulated interest in a potential therapeutic role for positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic receptors. Galantamine is a compound that possesses two interesting properties: inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic neurotransmission. Theoretically, galantamine would be expected to increase the efficiency or likelihood that acetylcholine will promote channel opening and ionic conductance at nicotinic receptors.

In many cases paediatricians are the first point of contact. In order to increase recognition rates, screening instruments may be a helpful support for health care professionals. However, there is a lack of valid and economical screening instruments for primary care patients. Thus, the aim of the study was the development of the new Depression Screener for Teenagers (DesTeen) and its validation in a paediatric sample.\t326 patients between 13 and 16 years old completed the DesTeen and a diagnostic interview, serving as gold standard. Prevalence rate for any depressive disorder (minor depression, major depression and dysthymia) was 12.6%. Psychometric properties were calculated. For validity measures, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for any depressive disorder and the diagnostic subgroups was computed.\tDesTeen showed a high reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1=.87) and a high validity (AUC=.91). For the diagnostic subgroups AUC values did not significantly differ from overall accuracy of any depressive disorder (major depression: AUC=.95, p=.179; dysthymia: AUC=.88, p=.605; minor depression: AUC=.87, p=.327). The optimal cut-off point for any depressive disorder according to the Youden-Index yielded a sensitivity of .90 and a specificity of .80. An abbreviated 5-item version of DesTeen showed no loss in validity (AUC=.90, p=.695).\tOverall, DesTeen can be regarded as a valid screening instrument for adolescent paediatric patients. For practical use, the 5-item version is even more promising. A replication of these results is essential.","_input_hash":-1305298848,"_task_hash":-1979502992,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":82,"end":90,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":476,"end":484,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":507,"end":512,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":635,"end":643,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnostic","start":700,"end":710,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"interview","start":711,"end":720,"pattern":1942352714},{"text":"Prevalence","start":748,"end":758,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1020,"end":1030,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1147,"end":1157,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":1674,"end":1682,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 2, 34, 55, 58, 53, 55, 55, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706795982,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

We hypothesized that low rates of lithium efflux (a potential manifestation of strong transport inhibition) would be associated with better clinical outcome of maintenance pharmacotherapy. We measured the erythrocyte (RBC) apparent rate constant for lithium efflux (kexch) in 22 patients with bipolar disorder who had been euthymic on lithium for 1 month. Subsequently, clinical mood ratings and in vivo RBC: plasma lithium ratios (LiR) were determined monthly. Outcome was categorized according to whether subjects completed 1 year of successful maintenance treatment (n = 10), experienced a recurrent affective episode (n = 8), or dropped out (n = 4). The kexch at the outset of the study was significantly lower (potentially because of greater transport inhibition) in 1-year completers than in patients with recurrences or those who dropped out (median kexch = 0.09, 0.24, and 0.27 h-1, respectively; P < .03). Moreover, 77% of patients with a kexch of 0.11 h-1 or lower were successfully maintained on lithium for 1 year, whereas only 23% of those with a kexch greater than or equal to 0.12 h-1 had a successful treatment outcome. LiR measured during the course of maintenance treatment was significantly higher (suggesting greater transport inhibition) in 1-year completers than in noncompleters (recurrences and dropouts). Measurement of kexch at an early point in treatment may provide a means for prospectively identifying those bipolar patients at greater risk for failure of maintenance lithium therapy.","_input_hash":-1046327673,"_task_hash":-91821589,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":662,"end":670,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":1068,"end":1073,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1181,"end":1189,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1315,"end":1323,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1829,"end":1837,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":1889,"end":1896,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 34, 34, 34, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706796147,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

As the aged population increases, incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias will also increase. Professionals agree that early intervention is essential for therapeutic and quality of life purposes; however, many older adults wait several months or years to seek medical help after first noticing signs of cognitive impairment. The present study sought to identify the predictors of help-seeking for cognitive impairment by an individual for him/herself after the first detection of symptoms.Method: An online survey was administered to adults (N = 250) 50 years old and older. Individuals responded about their help-seeking intentions in response to a hypothetical vignette depicting symptoms of cognitive decline derived from a similar study with caregivers conducted by Qualls and colleagues. Additional standardized measures measuring constructs such as knowledge of Alzheimer's disease were completed.Results: The present study reveals that cognitive (i.e. symptom identification and disease attribution) and affective (i.e. symptom impact and threat appraisal) factors, as well as an interaction between the two, are predictive of help-seeking intentions with excellent model fit.Conclusion: Help-seeking intentions by individuals with possible cognitive impairment are comparable to those of potential caregivers. Contrary to hypotheses, high threat appraisal positively predicted help-seeking intentions despite the expectation that threat-induced fear would lead to avoidance.

This paper discusses a nutritional knowledge and attitudes survey conducted as part of a larger project focused on improving nutritional intake of people with dementia within a residential care facility in Brisbane, Australia.\tThe specific aims of the survey were to identify (i) knowledge of the nutritional needs of aged care facility residents; (ii) mealtime practices; and (iii) attitudes towards mealtime practices and organisation.\tA survey based on those used in other healthcare settings was completed by 76 staff members. The survey included questions about nutritional knowledge, opinions of the food service, frequency of feeding assistance provided and feeding assessment practices.\tNutritional knowledge scores ranged from 1 to 9 of a possible 10, with a mean score of 4.67. While 76% of respondents correctly identified risk factors associated with malnutrition in nursing home residents, only 38% of participants correctly identified the need for increased protein and energy in residents with pressure ulcers, and just 15% exhibited correct knowledge of fluid requirements. Further, while nutritional assessment was considered an important part of practice by 83% of respondents, just 53% indicated that they actually carried out such assessments. Identified barriers to promoting optimal nutrition included insufficient time to observe residents (56%); being unaware of residents' feeding issues (46%); poor knowledge of nutritional assessments (44%); and unappetising appearance of food served (57%).\tAn important step towards improving health and quality of life for residents of aged care facilities would be to enhance staff nutritional awareness and assessment skills. This should be carried out through increased attention to both preservice curricula and on-the-job training.\tThe residential facility staff surveyed demonstrated low levels of nutrition knowledge, which reflects findings from the international literature. This has implications for the provision of responsive care to residents of these facilities and should be explored further.","_input_hash":-291700252,"_task_hash":-442408269,"spans":[{"text":"aims","start":614,"end":618,"pattern":-2080524606},{"text":"score","start":1147,"end":1152,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"literature","start":2309,"end":2319,"pattern":-478699552}],"meta":{"pattern":"43, 60, 5"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706796260,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

We examined within-trial spatial memory by using a relocation search paradigm introduced by Kristjansson (2000) (modified from Horowitz & Wolfe, 1998), in which the display items traded places every 110ms so that the target was never to be found in the same location from one moment to the next (the relocation condition), as compared with a static condition where the display items remained in place for the whole trial duration. To equate appearance between the two conditions, all items changed orientation every 110ms in both conditions, and were masked after each of the briefly presented visual arrays. The results showed that search was disrupted by item relocation for both patients and controls, but importantly this disruption was only seen in the right visual field for the patients, not the left, indicating that their spatial working memory in left visual space is already severely disrupted, and to a greater degree than for their right visual space, in contrast to what has been previously argued.","_input_hash":904816702,"_task_hash":850554853,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":91,"end":99,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"trial","start":182,"end":187,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"patients","start":245,"end":253,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":322,"end":330,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"trial","start":396,"end":401,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"trial","start":792,"end":797,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"patients","start":1059,"end":1067,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1162,"end":1170,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 73, 34, 34, 73, 73, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706800045,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

In 826 men and women 40 to 79 years old (1990 baseline), 5-year changes in carotid atherosclerosis were thoroughly assessed by high-resolution duplex scanning. The presence of chronic respiratory, urinary tract, dental, and other infections was ascertained by standard diagnostic criteria. Chronic infections amplified the risk of atherosclerosis development in the carotid arteries. The association was most pronounced in subjects free of carotid atherosclerosis at baseline (age-/sex-adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] for any chronic infection versus none, 4.08 [2.42 to 6.85]; P:<0.0001) and applied to all types of chronic (bacterial) infections. It remained independently significant after adjustment for classic vascular risk attributes and extended to low-risk individuals free of conventional risk factors. Among subjects with chronic infections, atherosclerosis risk was highest in those with a prominent inflammatory response. Markers of systemic inflammation, such as soluble adhesion molecules and circulating bacterial endotoxin, and levels of soluble human heat-shock protein 60 and antibodies to mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 were elevated in subjects with chronic infections and predictive of an increased risk of atherosclerosis.\tThe present study provides solid evidence for a role of common chronic infections in human atherogenesis.

La Crosse virus (LACV) from the Bunyavirales order is responsible for pediatric encephalitis cases in the United States, yet little is known about the infectivity of LACV. Given the structural similarities between class II fusion glycoproteins of LACV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus from the Togaviridae family, we hypothesized that LACV would share similar entry mechanisms with CHIKV. To test this hypothesis, we performed cholesterol-depletion and repletion assays and used cholesterol-modulating compounds to study LACV entry and replication. We found that LACV entry was cholesterol dependent, while replication was less affected by cholesterol manipulation. In addition, we generated single-point mutants in the LACV Gc ij loop that corresponded to known CHIKV residues important for virus entry. We found that a conserved histidine and alanine residue in the Gc ij loop impaired virus infectivity and attenuated LACV replication in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we took an evolution-based approach to explore how the LACV glycoprotein evolves in mosquitoes and mice. We found multiple variants that cluster in the Gc glycoprotein head domain, providing evidence for the Gc glycoprotein as a contributor to LACV adaptation. Together, these results begin to characterize the mechanisms of LACV infectivity and how the LACV glycoprotein contributes to replication and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Vector-borne viruses are significant health threats that lead to devastating disease worldwide. The emergence of arboviruses, in addition to the lack of effective antivirals or vaccines, highlights the need to study how arboviruses replicate at the molecular level. One potential antiviral target is the class II fusion glycoprotein. Alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and bunyaviruses encode a class II fusion glycoprotein that contains strong structural similarities at the tip of domain II. Here, we show that the bunyavirus La Crosse virus uses a cholesterol-dependent entry pathway similar to the alphavirus chikungunya virus, and residues in the ij loop are important for virus infectivity in vitro and replication in mice. These studies show that genetically diverse viruses may use similar pathways through conserved structure domains, suggesting that these viruses may be targets for broad-spectrum antivirals in multiple arboviral families.","_input_hash":-1976720436,"_task_hash":-997151599,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":824,"end":829,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"mice","start":1377,"end":1381,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":1916,"end":1921,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"mice","start":2423,"end":2427,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 82, 2, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706800231,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

This suggests that there may be alternative phenotypic expressions of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia, such as more elementary physiological or biochemical defects. One proposed phenotype is impaired inhibitory gating of the auditory evoked potential to repeated stimuli. Normally, the amplitude of the P50 response to the second stimulus is significantly less than the response to the first, but this gating of response is generally impaired in schizophrenia. Clinically unaffected individuals within a pedigree who have both an ancestral and descendant history of schizophrenia may be useful for studying whether this physiological defect is a possible alternative phenotype. We have studied inhibitory gating of the auditory P50 response to pairs of auditory stimuli in 17 nuclear families. In 11, there was one parent who had another relative with a chronic psychotic illness, in addition to the schizophrenic proband. All of the parents with family histories of schizophrenia had gating of the P50 response similar to their schizophrenia offspring, whereas only 7% of the parents without family history had gating of the P50 response in the abnormal range. These results support loss of gating of the auditory P50 wave as an inherited deficit related to schizophrenia and suggest that studies of parents may help elucidate the neurobiological expression of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia.","_input_hash":-24909048,"_task_hash":1401129028,"spans":[{"text":"genes","start":250,"end":255,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"history","start":744,"end":751,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"history","start":1289,"end":1296,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"genes","start":1551,"end":1556,"pattern":995975506}],"meta":{"pattern":"78, 64, 64, 78"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706800248,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

Methods Mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries and presence of carotid artery plaque were examined in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) findings in Chinese (mean age 59 years) were compared with a European population (mean age 62 years). Results Overall, the mean cIMT in Chinese was 0.70 mm (SD 0.16) and increased with age by 0.08 mm (SE 0.008) per 10-years older age. About 31% of the Chinese had carotid plaques and the prevalence varied 10-fold with age (6% at 40-49 to 63% at 70-89 years) and four-fold by region (range, 14%-57%). After adjustment for age, sex and region, plaque prevalence was higher in smokers than in non-smokers (36% vs. 28%) and two-fold higher in individuals with systolic blood pressure \u2265160 mmHg than those with systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg (44% vs. 22%) in the China Kadoorie Biobank study.

We describe our experience of a new system - IMPARTS (Integrating mental and physical: research training and services), which uses validated tools to identify and to monitor the progress of patients who may benefit from psychological intervention. At outpatient clinics, patients used an electronic tablet to complete the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Inclusion of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Data were linked directly to their electronic record to allow the results, with suggestions for treatment, to be reviewed immediately during the consultation. A total of 162 patients were included. Screening showed that referral was required in 28 (17%) with a probable major depressive disorder and 32 (20%) with a general anxiety disorder. Two (1%), who were identified as being at high risk of suicide or self-harm, were referred for immediate psychological assessment.

{"pmid":"25330102","text":"PloS one^\nModeling the dynamics of disease states in depression.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and costly disorder associated with considerable morbidity, disability, and risk for suicide. The disorder is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous. Despite intense research efforts, the response rates of antidepressant treatments are relatively low and the etiology and progression of MDD remain poorly understood. Here we use computational modeling to advance our understanding of MDD. First, we propose a systematic and comprehensive definition of disease states, which is based on a type of mathematical model called a finite-state machine. Second, we propose a dynamical systems model for the progression, or dynamics, of MDD. The model is abstract and combines several major factors (mechanisms) that influence the dynamics of MDD. We study under what conditions the model can account for the occurrence and recurrence of depressive episodes and how we can model the effects of antidepressant treatments and cognitive behavioral therapy within the same dynamical systems model through changing a small subset of parameters. Our computational modeling suggests several predictions about MDD. Patients who suffer from depression can be divided into two sub-populations: a high-risk sub-population that has a high risk of developing chronic depression and a low-risk sub-population, in which patients develop depression stochastically with low probability. The success of antidepressant treatment is stochastic, leading to widely different times-to-remission in otherwise identical patients. While the specific details of our model might be subjected to criticism and revisions, our approach shows the potential power of computationally modeling depression and the need for different type of quantitative data for understanding depression.","_input_hash":-1479274455,"_task_hash":-904536993,"spans":[{"text":"systematic","start":523,"end":533,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"study","start":856,"end":861,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapy","start":1050,"end":1057,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"Patients","start":1212,"end":1220,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1410,"end":1418,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1600,"end":1608,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"6, 2, 46, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706800573,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

Recently, cell-based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been explored as an effective treatment for CNS diseases. Among the various tissue-derived MSCs, we have isolated human cranial bone-derived MSCs (cMSCs) in our laboratory. In addition, we have focused on simulated microgravity (MG) as a valuable culture environment of MSCs. However, detailed mechanisms underlying functional recovery from transplantation of MSCs cultured under MG conditions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice. Human cMSCs were cultured under 1G and MG conditions, and cMSCs cultured under MG conditions expressed significantly higher messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2). In TBI model mice, the transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions (group MG) showed greater motor functional improvement compared with only phosphate-buffered saline administration (group PBS). Moreover, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/b cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) ratio were significantly lower at brain injury sites in mice of group MG than those of group PBS. In addition, an in vitro study showed that the conditioned medium of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions significantly suppressed the cell death of NG108-15 cells exposed to oxidative or inflammatory stress through anti-inflammatory and antiapoptosis effects. These findings demonstrate that culturing cMSCs under simulated MG increases the neuroprotective effects, suggesting that simulated MG cultures may be a useful method for cell-based therapy strategies for CNS diseases.","_input_hash":-1573462540,"_task_hash":-1031826192,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":5,"end":10,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"Human","start":99,"end":104,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"Cells","start":143,"end":148,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapy","start":325,"end":332,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"cells","start":356,"end":361,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"human","start":487,"end":492,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":791,"end":796,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapeutic","start":818,"end":829,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"mice","start":936,"end":940,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"Human","start":942,"end":947,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"mice","start":1186,"end":1190,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1597,"end":1601,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":1664,"end":1669,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cells","start":1795,"end":1800,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapy","start":2080,"end":2087,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 0, 70, 46, 70, 0, 2, 47, 82, 0, 82, 82, 2, 70, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706800827,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

Moreover, \u03b1-synuclein content in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents a PD biomarker candidate. However, capture-based assays for \u03b1-synuclein quantification in CSF (such as by ELISA) have shown discrepancies and have limited suitability for high-throughput screening. Here, we describe two sensitive, in-solution, time-resolved F\u00f6rster's resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based immunoassays for total and oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein quantification. CSF analysis showed strong concordance for total \u03b1-synuclein content between two TR-FRET assays and, in agreement with a previously characterized 36 h protocol-based ELISA, demonstrated lower \u03b1-synuclein levels in PD donors. Critically, the assay suitability for high-throughput screening of siRNA constructs and small molecules aimed at reducing endogenous \u03b1-synuclein levels was established and validated. In a small-scale proof of concept compound screen using 384 well plates, signals ranged from <30 to >120% of the mean of vehicle-treated cells for molecules known to lower and increase cellular \u03b1-synuclein, respectively. Furthermore, a reverse genetic screen of a kinase-directed siRNA library identified seven genes that modulated \u03b1-synuclein protein levels (five whose knockdown increased and two that decreased cellular \u03b1-synuclein protein). This provides critical new biological insight into cellular pathways regulating \u03b1-synuclein steady-state expression that may help guide further drug discovery efforts. Moreover, we describe an inherent limitation in current \u03b1-synuclein oligomer detection methodology, a finding that will direct improvement of future assay design. Our one-step TR-FRET-based platform for \u03b1-synuclein quantification provides a novel platform with superior performance parameters for the rapid screening of large biomarker cohorts and of compound and genetic libraries, both of which are essential to the development of PD therapies.","_input_hash":-170420054,"_task_hash":1851572932,"spans":[{"text":"therapeutic","start":297,"end":308,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"human","start":350,"end":355,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":1314,"end":1319,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"genes","start":1488,"end":1493,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"methodology","start":1877,"end":1888,"pattern":-2114709687}],"meta":{"pattern":"47, 0, 70, 78, 62"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706800889,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

In addition, children with clinical SAD, compared to those with subclinical SAD or no symptoms of SAD, had a disproportionately higher number of comorbid diagnoses and experienced significantly greater somatic concerns, anxiety, and general internalizing behavior. In addition, their parents experienced greater depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, phobic anxiety, and general distress. The results preliminarily support prior findings that most children experience a dissipation of SAD symptoms in young childhood but that some children continue to experience stable, significant distress.

But the impact of intensive rehabilitation on the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of intensive rehabilitation on the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke using data from the National Health Insurance Service database. This is a register-based, retrospective cohort study. Using data from the National Health Insurance Service database, we included the patients who received rehabilitation for stroke from 2006 to 2013. Of the 14,984 patients diagnosed with stroke, 2483 died within 1 year, and 2866 did not receive rehabilitation; hence, they were also excluded. The final sample included 9635 (49.2% men, 50.8% women) patients. After correcting for covariates, the Cox model was used to evaluate the effects of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) on survival. We estimated the independent contribution of each factor to the risk of death from the initiation of rehabilitation. Significant differences in mortality were observed according to age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), income level, and stroke type. Patients with stroke who received both PT and OT had a better long-term prognosis than those who received either treatment alone.

{"pmid":"7771669","text":"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research^\nThe Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale: a self-rated instrument for the quantification of thoughts about alcohol and drinking behavior.^\nIt has been suggested that a crucial dimension of alcohol 'craving' includes the concept of both obsessive thoughts about alcohol use and compulsive behaviors toward drinking. An interview-based rating scale, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-heavy drinkers (YBOCS-hd), has been found useful in quantifying this concept in alcohol-dependent individuals. A self-rating scale, the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) has been developed by us as a modification of the YBOCS-hd. The YBOCS-hd showed excellent interrater reliability in our hands. The correlation between the YBOCS-hd and the OCDS total scores obtained on 60 alcohol-dependent individuals was 0.83. The test-retest correlation for the OCDS total score was 0.96, and the obsessive and compulsive subscales test-retest correlations were 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. The internal consistency of the items in the OCDS was high (0.86) and did not improve significantly with removal of individual items. The shared variance between the OCDS scores and alcohol consumption during the period of evaluation was only approximately 20%, indicating that the dimension measured by the scale was somewhat independent of actual drinking. As such, it might act as an independent measure of the 'state of illness' for alcohol-dependent individuals. When used during a prospective 12-week treatment research study, initial results indicate that the OCDS seems to validly measure a dimension of alcohol dependence, because it decreased from baseline during alcohol reduction and increased in relationship to relapse drinking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","_input_hash":1566376905,"_task_hash":-1410332531,"spans":[{"text":"interview","start":365,"end":374,"pattern":1942352714},{"text":"score","start":908,"end":913,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"study","start":1552,"end":1557,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"58, 60, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706801025,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

To further examine the role of OPTN in ALS, we sought to identify novel ALS variants in OPTN and examine their potential for pathogenicity in vitro. Whole exome sequence data from 74 familial ALS cases were analysed for the presence of novel OPTN mutations. Pathogenicity was assessed by analysing effects on Golgi fragmentation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-linked CHOP activation, and cellular localization of optineurin in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells expressing mutant optineurin. We identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation in OPTN (c.883G > T, p.Val295Phe) in a single familial ALS case. This mutation induced recognized cellular features of ALS pathogenesis including Golgi fragmentation and ER stress in NSC-34 cells. In conclusion, the identification of a novel OPTN mutation in an Australian ALS family, and its capacity to induce ALS-like pathological features in vitro, further strengthens evidence for the role of optineurin in the pathogenesis of ALS.","_input_hash":-496728815,"_task_hash":-199294415,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":827,"end":832,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"case","start":975,"end":979,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"cells","start":1106,"end":1111,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 35, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706801037,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

{"pmid":"21885540","text":"Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery^\nIs it safe to stop anticoagulants after successful surgery for atrial fibrillation?^\nA best evidence topic in cardiothoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was: is it safe to stop anticoagulants after successful surgery for atrial fibrillation? Altogether, 177 papers were found using the reported search, of which 14 were selected that represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. Selection criteria included study relevance, primary outcome, size of study population and length of follow-up. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The weight of evidence, including over 10,000 patient-years of follow-up, supports the discontinuation of warfarin following atrial fibrillation correction procedures as being safe, with an associated annual thromboembolic stroke rate of 0-3.8% off warfarin, in studies where warfarin was stopped at a mean of 3.6 months (range 0-8 months) after the procedure. However, the confidence of this conclusion suffers from a paucity of high-quality randomized controlled trials in the field, with the main body of evidence coming instead from observational non-randomized studies. The stroke rate also varies with the exact procedure performed; pulmonary vein isolation procedures are the most extensively evaluated and carry the lowest stroke rate following warfarin discontinuation (0-0.4% per annum when performed as an isolated procedure). By contrast, left atrial appendage occlusion by insertion of a transcatheter device has an associated annual stroke rate of 0-3.8% off warfarin. Thus, discontinuation of warfarin following such transcatheter procedures cannot be recommended at this time. Concomitant heart surgeries, such as mitral valve repair have been shown to increase the thromboembolic rate both unpredictably and dramatically, and this review thus identifies concomitant mitral valve surgery as a potentially substantial risk factor for late thromboembolic stroke in patients undergoing corrective surgeries for atrial fibrillation. This review finds in favour of warfarin discontinuation in selected patients at three months post-procedure, emphasizing consideration of the patient's individual risk-factor profile as paramount. This recommendation is in line with the 2010 guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation produced by the European Society of Cardiology.","_input_hash":-722537582,"_task_hash":-1856660854,"spans":[{"text":"surgery","start":100,"end":107,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"surgery","start":174,"end":181,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"surgery","start":309,"end":316,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"study","start":525,"end":530,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":567,"end":572,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":687,"end":692,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"randomized","start":1203,"end":1213,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":1214,"end":1224,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trials","start":1225,"end":1231,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"observational","start":1297,"end":1310,"pattern":232030698},{"text":"randomized","start":1315,"end":1325,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"review","start":2008,"end":2014,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"surgery","start":2056,"end":2063,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":2139,"end":2147,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"review","start":2210,"end":2216,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"patients","start":2273,"end":2281,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"49, 49, 49, 2, 2, 2, 18, 27, 75, 80, 18, 4, 49, 34, 4, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706801089,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

These findings indicate that in trauma-exposed samples with pain, somatic burden rather than pain severity accounts for perceived cognitive problems.\tHigh somatic burden may reflect an underlying appraisal about somatic cues, which extend in part to interpretation of cognitive cues.","_input_hash":507867356,"_task_hash":-961663375,"spans":[{"text":"report","start":688,"end":694,"pattern":1226364217}],"meta":{"pattern":"36"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706801148,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}
{"pmid":"18375019","text":"Neurobiology of aging^\nInterferon-gamma-dependent cytotoxic activation of human astrocytes and astrocytoma cells.^\nAstrocytes and microglia become activated in a broad spectrum of inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases. Activated microglia are widely believed to be the principal source of inflammation-induced neuronal degeneration in these disorders. To investigate the neurotoxic potential of human astrocytes, we exposed them and human astrocytic U-373 MG cells to a variety of inflammatory stimulants. We then assessed the effects of their supernatants on human SH-SY5 cells. When astrocytes and U-373 MG cells were stimulated with interferon (IFN)-gamma (150U/ml), their supernatants significantly reduced SH-SY5Y cell viability. Other powerful inflammatory stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide (0.5mug/ml), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (10ng/ml) and interleukin-1beta (10ng/ml), alone or in combination, were without effect. These combinations were also unable to enhance the IFN-gamma effect. The induced cytotoxicities were reversed by JAK inhibitor I, a potent and specific inhibitor of JAKs. This result indicates that the neurotoxic effect was proceeding through the IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR)-JAK-STAT intracellular pathway. To establish that the IFNGR is expressed on both cultured astrocytes and U-373 MG cells, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA extracts to identify a specific IFNGR product. We showed the protein product on these cultured cells by immunocytochemistry using an antibody to IFNGR. Finally, using human postmortem material, we showed sharp upregulation of the IFNGR on activated astrocytes in affected areas in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. These findings suggest that activated astrocytes may become neurotoxic when stimulated by IFN-gamma and may therefore exacerbate the pathology in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases.","_input_hash":1175392943,"_task_hash":997038320,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":74,"end":79,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":397,"end":402,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":435,"end":440,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":461,"end":466,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"human","start":562,"end":567,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":575,"end":580,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":611,"end":616,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1321,"end":1326,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1456,"end":1461,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"human","start":1528,"end":1533,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 0, 0, 70, 0, 70, 70, 70, 70, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706801164,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

{"pmid":"37308987","text":"Acta neuropathologica communications^\nMass cytometric analysis of the immune cell landscape after traumatic brain injury elucidates the role of complement and complement receptors in neurologic outcomes.^\nFollowing traumatic brain injury (TBI), a neuroinflammatory response can persist for years and contribute to the development of chronic neurological manifestations. Complement plays a central role in post-TBI neuroinflammation, and C3 opsonins and the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) have been implicated in promoting secondary injury. We used single cell mass cytometry to characterize the immune cell landscape of the brain at different time points after TBI. To specifically investigate how complement shapes the post-TBI immune cell landscape, we analyzed TBI brains in the context of CR2-Crry treatment, an inhibitor of C3 activation. We analyzed 13 immune cell types, including peripheral and brain resident cells, and assessed expression of various receptors. TBI modulated the expression of phagocytic and complement receptors on both brain resident and infiltrating peripheral immune cells, and distinct functional clusters were identified within same cell populations that emerge at different phases after TBI. In particular, a CD11c+ (CR4) microglia subpopulation continued to expand over 28 days after injury, and was the only receptor to show continuous increase over time. Complement inhibition affected the abundance of brain resident immune cells in the injured hemisphere and impacted the expression of functional receptors on infiltrating cells. A role for C5a has also been indicated in models of brain injury, and we found significant upregulation of C5aR1 on many immune cell types after TBI. However, we demonstrated experimentally that while C5aR1 is involved in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain after injury, it does not alone affect histological or behavioral outcomes. However, CR2-Crry improved post-TBI outcomes and reduced resident immune cell populations, as well as complement and phagocytic receptor expression, indicating that its neuroprotective effects are mediated upstream of C5a generation, likely via modulating C3 opsonization and complement receptor expression.","_input_hash":-518028518,"_task_hash":-911912677,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":916,"end":921,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1095,"end":1100,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1459,"end":1464,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1559,"end":1564,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1826,"end":1831,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 70, 70, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706801413,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

A total of 1212 unique records were screened by 2 independent reviewers. Forty trials were identified, including 2718 patients with history of stroke.\tOutcome data were pooled according to assessment timing (ie, 4-8wk and 12wk after injection), and categorized into 6 main clinical goals (ie, spasticity-related pain, involuntary movements, passive joint motion, care ability, arm and hand use, and standing and walking performance). Sensitivity analyses were performed for the influence of study and intervention characteristics, involvement of pharmaceutical industry, and publication bias.\tRobust evidence is shown for the effectiveness of BoNT in reducing resistance to passive movement, as measured with the (Modified) Ashworth Score, and improving self-care ability for the affected hand and arm after intervention (P<.005) and at follow-up (P<.005). In addition, robust evidence is shown for the absence of effect on arm-hand capacity at follow-up. BoNT was found to significantly reduce involuntary movements, spasticity-related pain, and caregiver burden, and improve passive range of motion, while no evidence was found for arm and hand use after intervention.\tIn view of the robustness of current evidence, no further trials are needed to investigate BoNT for its favorable effects on resistance to passive movement of the spastic wrist and fingers, and on self-care. No trials are needed to further confirm the lack of effects of BoNT on arm-hand capacity, whereas additional trials are needed to establish the suggested favorable effects of BoNT on other body functions, which may result in clinically meaningful outcomes at activity and participation levels.","_input_hash":1810466831,"_task_hash":-1268795638,"spans":[{"text":"Systematic","start":160,"end":170,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"Review","start":171,"end":177,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"Classification","start":419,"end":433,"pattern":-756437862},{"text":"randomized","start":591,"end":601,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":602,"end":612,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trials","start":613,"end":619,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"intervention","start":672,"end":684,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"patients","start":688,"end":696,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"history","start":704,"end":711,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"trials","start":802,"end":808,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"patients","start":841,"end":849,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"history","start":855,"end":862,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"study","start":1214,"end":1219,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"intervention","start":1224,"end":1236,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"Score","start":1456,"end":1461,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"intervention","start":1531,"end":1543,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"intervention","start":1880,"end":1892,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"trials","start":1952,"end":1958,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"trials","start":2105,"end":2111,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"trials","start":2211,"end":2217,"pattern":1849967594}],"meta":{"pattern":"6, 4, 59, 18, 27, 75, 48, 34, 64, 75, 34, 64, 2, 48, 60, 48, 48, 75, 75, 75"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706801449,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}
{"pmid":"26757674","text":"Scientific reports^\nInteraction of RNA with a C-terminal fragment of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated TDP43 reduces cytotoxicity.^\nA hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disease, is formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) from misfolded proteins in neuronal cells. TAR RNA/DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP43) is an ALS-causative protein forming IBs in ALS patients. The relation between localization of the IBs and neurotoxicity remains largely unknown. We characterized aggregation of fluorescently tagged TDP43 and its carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) by analytical fluorescence imaging techniques. Quantitative time-lapse analysis in individual live cells showed that fluorescent-protein-tagged TDP43 was cleaved and a 35 kDa TDP43 CTF (TDP35) formed ubiquitin (Ub)-negative cytoplasmic IBs. Although TDP35 formed mildly toxic Ub-negative IBs in the cytoplasm, TDP25, another type of a TDP43 CTF, efficiently formed sufficiently toxic Ub-positive IBs. One- or two-color fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) revealed that coaggregation of TDP25 with TDP43 was initiated by depletion of the RNA that binds to TDP25. Moreover, nuclear localization tagging TDP25 reduced the rate of neuronal cell death. These observations point to the need to elucidate the novel sequestration mechanism and details of the toxicity of the misfolded and aggregation-prone TDP43 CTFs (as well as the RNA binding and nuclear retention) in order to identify possible preventive interventions against ALS.","_input_hash":1164737959,"_task_hash":768591259,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":310,"end":315,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"patients","start":407,"end":415,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"cells","start":706,"end":711,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 34, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706801467,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

In this study, we investigated whether DJ-1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and function in neuronal cells. Confocal and electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that M17 human neuroblastoma cells over-expressing wild-type DJ-1 (WT DJ-1 cells) displayed elongated mitochondria while M17 cells over-expressing PD-associated DJ-1 mutants (R98Q, D149A and L166P) (mutant DJ-1 cells) showed significant increase of fragmented mitochondria. Similar mitochondrial fragmentation was also noted in primary hippocampal neurons over-expressing PD-associated mutant forms of DJ-1. Functional analysis revealed that over-expression of PD-associated DJ-1 mutants resulted in mitochondria dysfunction and increased neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress (H(2) O(2)) or neurotoxin. Further immunoblot studies demonstrated that levels of dynamin-like protein (DLP1), also known as Drp1, a regulator of mitochondrial fission, was significantly decreased in WT DJ-1 cells but increased in mutant DJ-1 cells. Importantly, DLP1 knockdown in these mutant DJ-1 cells rescued the abnormal mitochondria morphology and all associated mitochondria/neuronal dysfunction. Taken together, these studies suggest that DJ-1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics through modulation of DLP1 expression and PD-associated DJ-1 mutations may cause PD by impairing mitochondrial dynamics and function.","_input_hash":1369476695,"_task_hash":-1097958180,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":444,"end":449,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cells","start":561,"end":566,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"human","start":633,"end":638,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":653,"end":658,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":699,"end":704,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":749,"end":754,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":835,"end":840,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1414,"end":1419,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1449,"end":1454,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1505,"end":1510,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 70, 0, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706801573,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

A critical problem in linking diabetes to cognitive impairment is that patients often have multiple comorbidities (e.g., obesity, hypertension) that have been independently linked to cognitive deficits. In the study reported here we focused on young adults with and without type 1 diabetes who were virtually free of such comorbidities. The two groups were matched on major health and demographic factors, and all participants completed a verbal working memory task during magnetoencephalographic brain imaging. We hypothesized that patients would have altered neural dynamics in verbal working memory processing and that these differences would directly relate to clinical disease measures. Accordingly, we found that patients had significantly stronger neural responses in the superior parietal cortices during memory encoding and significantly weaker activity in parietal-occipital regions during maintenance compared with control subjects. Moreover, disease duration and glycemic control were both significantly correlated with neural responses in various brain regions. In conclusion, young healthy adults with type 1 diabetes already have aberrant neural processing relative to their peers without diabetes, using compensatory responses to perform the task, and glucose management and duration may play a central role.","_input_hash":756214130,"_task_hash":-1450247862,"spans":[{"text":"Patients","start":36,"end":44,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":310,"end":318,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":449,"end":454,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":772,"end":780,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":958,"end":966,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 2, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706801676,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

However, previous analyses involving LOHS did not consider confounding or indirect factors, or the effects of other factors on LOHS and inpatient costs.\tTo investigate the direct and indirect effects of LOHS on the hospitalization costs of inpatients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.\tThis was a population-based, retrospective, and observational study that analyzed data acquired from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2015 and 2020 relating to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in Ningxia, China.\tHospitalizations were identified by the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10). Inpatient costs were described by the median M (P25, P75). We used a quantile regression model to estimate the linear relationships between a group of independent variables X and the quantile of the explained variable hospitalization cost (Y). A structural equation model (SEM) was then used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of LOHS on inpatient costs.\tThe study included 129,444 patients with ischemic stroke and 15,525 patients with hemorrhagic stroke. The median LOHS was 10 (8-13) days for ischemic stroke and 15 (10-22) days for hemorrhagic stroke. The median M (P25, P75) of inpatient costs was $1020 (742-1545) for ischemic stroke and 2813 (1576-6191) for hemorrhagic stroke. The total effect of LOHS on inpatient costs was 0.795 in patients with ischemic stroke. The effect of yearof discharge (X4) and CCI (X8) on inpatient costs was dominated by an indirect effect through the LOHS. The indirect effect was -0.071 (84.52% of the total effect value) and 0.034 (69.39% of the total effect value), respectively. The total effect of LOHS on inpatient costs in patients with hemorrhagic stroke was 0.754. The influence of CCI on inpatient costs was dominated by an indirect effect through LOHS; the indirect effect value was -0.028 (77.78% of the total effect value). The payment type, surgery, method of discharge, and hospital level also exerted an impact on inpatient costs by direct and indirect effects through the LOHS.\tLength of hospital stay (LOHS) was identified as the main factor influencing hospitalization costs. However, other social factors were shown to indirectly influence hospitalization costs through the LOHS.

The purpose of this study was to confirm that APOE allele polymorphism also represents a risk factor for unfavorable outcomes following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).\tA total of 104 patients with aneurysmal SAH were studied. Computed tomography (CT) scan findings of SAH were assessed by Fisher's grade and clinical neurologic assessment was performed using the Hunt and Hess (H&H)grading system. Serum lipids were also analyzed. Outcomes at 3 months after SAH were determined using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.\tThe distributions of APOE genotypes and alleles of patients were matched with those of control subjects. That 5 of 18 patients with APOE-E4 allele (28%) had an unfavorable outcome was significantly different from those without APOE-E4 (8%, chi2, p = 0.032; OR = 4.34, 95% CI 1.20-15.75). However, the presence or absence of E2 or E3 alleles had no significant difference. The relative hazard of APOE-E4 for unfavorable outcome exited after adjustment for clinical assessment (OR = 6.95, 95% CI 1.21-39.75). Total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B were elevated in patients with unfavorable rather than favorable outcomes.\tOur findings confirmed that the patients with APOE-E4 allele were predisposed to unfavorable outcomes after aneurysmal SAH even though an association between APOE and incidence of the SAH may not exist. The effect of APOE on neurobiology and lipoprotein metabolism seems to partially explain the difference in outcomes and deserves further study.","_input_hash":2142145136,"_task_hash":-483629530,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":272,"end":277,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":445,"end":453,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":824,"end":832,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":891,"end":899,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1367,"end":1375,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1457,"end":1465,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":1765,"end":1770,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706802117,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

Male and female juvenile rats were treated orally with risperidone (0.3 mg/kg, 3 times/day), aripiprazole (1 mg/kg), olanzapine (1 mg/kg) or vehicle (control), starting from postnatal day (PD) 23 (\u00b11 day) for 3 weeks (corresponding to the childhood-adolescent period in humans). Quantitative autoradiography was used to detect the binding density of [[3]H]MK-801 (an NMDA receptor antagonist) and [[3]H]muscimol (a selective GABAA receptor agonist). Aripiprazole elevated the [[3]H]MK801 binding levels in the NAcC of male rats, and the NAcS and CPu of female rats.

Although clinical trials have demonstrated that both synthetic surfactant and animal derived surfactant preparations are effective, comparison in animal models has suggested that there may be greater efficacy of animal derived surfactant products, perhaps due to the protein content of animal derived surfactant.\tTo compare the effect of animal derived surfactant to protein free synthetic surfactant preparations in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).\tSearches were updated of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2014), PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE (1975 through November 2014). All languages were included.\tRandomized controlled trials comparing administration of protein free synthetic surfactants to administration of animal derived surfactant extracts in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome were considered for this review.\tData collection and analysis were conducted according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.\tFifteen trials met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that the use of animal derived surfactant rather than protein free synthetic surfactant resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of pneumothorax [typical relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.77; typical risk difference (RD) -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 11 studies, 5356 infants] and a marginal reduction in the risk of mortality (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99; typical RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.00; NNTB 50; 13 studies, 5413 infants).Animal derived surfactant was associated with an increase in the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis [typical RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 50; 8 studies, 3462 infants] and a marginal increase in the risk of any intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05; 10 studies, 5045 infants) but no increase in Grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; 9 studies, 4241 infants).The meta-analyses supported a marginal decrease in the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality associated with the use of animal derived surfactant preparations (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00; 6 studies, 3811 infants). No other relevant differences in outcomes were noted.\tBoth animal derived surfactant extracts and protein free synthetic surfactant extracts are effective in the treatment and prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Comparative trials demonstrate greater early improvement in the requirement for ventilator support, fewer pneumothoraces, and fewer deaths associated with animal derived surfactant extract treatment. Animal derived surfactant may be associated with an increase in necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage, though the more serious hemorrhages (Grade 3 and 4) are not increased. Despite these concerns, animal derived surfactant extracts would seem to be the more desirable choice when compared to currently available protein free synthetic surfactants.","_input_hash":1812266689,"_task_hash":-841170253,"spans":[{"text":"systematic","start":25,"end":35,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"Animal","start":45,"end":51,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"animal","start":322,"end":328,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"trials","start":356,"end":362,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"animal","start":416,"end":422,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"animal","start":484,"end":490,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"animal","start":550,"end":556,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"animal","start":624,"end":630,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"animal","start":676,"end":682,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"Controlled","start":888,"end":898,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"Trials","start":899,"end":905,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"Randomized","start":1033,"end":1043,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":1044,"end":1054,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trials","start":1055,"end":1061,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"animal","start":1146,"end":1152,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"review","start":1277,"end":1283,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"Review","start":1381,"end":1387,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"trials","start":1403,"end":1409,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"animal","start":1479,"end":1485,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"animal","start":2675,"end":2681,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"animal","start":2878,"end":2884,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"trials","start":3052,"end":3058,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"animal","start":3195,"end":3201,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"Animal","start":3240,"end":3246,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"animal","start":3458,"end":3464,"pattern":-1575063083}],"meta":{"pattern":"6, 67, 67, 75, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 27, 75, 18, 27, 75, 67, 4, 4, 75, 67, 67, 67, 75, 67, 67, 67"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706802351,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}
{"pmid":"15907750","text":"Epilepsy & behavior : E&B^\nDifferentiating anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with partial epilepsy.^\nAnxiety and depression are separate psychiatric conditions that are often interrelated. This study examines whether they exist independently in this population of patients with partial epilepsy and if they affect all quality-of-life domains. Adult epilepsy patients taking two or more antiepileptic drugs completed a health status survey including demographic items, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-10 (QOLIE-10). The questionnaire was completed by 201 epilepsy patients. Symptom prevalences of anxiety (52% none, 25% mild, 16% moderate, 7% severe) and depression (62% none, 20% mild, 14% moderate, 4% severe) were high. All health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) domains worsened significantly with increasing levels of anxiety and depression: Total QOLIE-10 scores decreased from 72+/-18 in patients with no anxiety to 54+/-13 in those with mild, 48+/-18 in those with moderate, and 40+/-23 in those with severe anxiety (P<0.0001). Total QOLIE-10 scores decreased from 70+/-16 in patients with no depression to 50+/-16 in those with mild, 45+/-16 in those with moderate, and 24+/-21 in those with severe depression (P<0.0001). No significant difference in anxiety scores was observed controlling for seizure frequency or epilepsy duration. Regression analyses showed that anxiety and depression account for different proportions of variance as predictors of HRQOL (R2=0.337 (anxiety) and 0.511 (depression)). The data suggest that patients may benefit from increased attention to the role of anxiety separately from depression.","_input_hash":504102764,"_task_hash":-201878292,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":78,"end":86,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":204,"end":209,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":274,"end":282,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":368,"end":376,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"questionnaire","start":576,"end":589,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"patients","start":620,"end":628,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":951,"end":959,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1140,"end":1148,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1591,"end":1599,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 34, 34, 57, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706802354,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

However, clinical studies are conducted with specific populations that differ from the real world. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of alectinib in real-world settings. Patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EML4-ALK fusion were enrolled from two medical centers between June 2018 and June 2020. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) to alectinib. The secondary endpoint was response of brain metastases. The risk factors for disease progression were also investigated. In total, 127 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled into this study. Of them, 54.3% received first-line alectinib. The 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 77.4% and 68.3%, respectively. ORR and disease control rate (DCR) were 53.5% and 91.3%, respectively. Among patients with brain metastases, intracranial ORR and DCR were 63.6% and 88.6%, respectively. In addition, we found that 'crizotinib pretreatment', 'liver metastasis' and 'TP53 co-mutation' were individually associated with shorter PFS in alectinib treatment. In conclusion, this study confirms the salient clinical outcomes of alectinib for ALK-fusion-driven NSCLC patients with or without brain metastases, adding real-world evidence to the priority of alectinib in clinical practice.","_input_hash":-1323067513,"_task_hash":-778650179,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":176,"end":184,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"trials","start":227,"end":233,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"study","start":461,"end":466,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"Patients","start":544,"end":552,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":936,"end":944,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":989,"end":994,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1183,"end":1191,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":1462,"end":1467,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1548,"end":1556,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 75, 2, 34, 34, 2, 34, 2, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706802406,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

This study aimed to investigate the association between cortical thickness and methylation of BDNF promoters as well as serum BDNF levels in MDD. The participants consisted of 65 patients with recurrent MDD and 65 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Methylation of BDNF promoters and cortical thickness were compared between the groups. The right medial orbitofrontal, right lingual, right lateral occipital, left lateral orbitofrontal, left pars triangularis, and left lingual cortices were thinner in patients with MDD than in healthy controls. Among the MDD group, right pericalcarine, right medical orbitofrontal, right rostral middle frontal, right postcentral, right inferior temporal, right cuneus, right precuneus, left frontal pole, left superior frontal, left superior temporal, left rostral middle frontal and left lingual cortices had inverse correlations with methylation of BDNF promoters. Higher levels of BDNF promoter methylation may be closely associated with the reduced cortical thickness among patients with MDD. Serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in MDD, and showed an inverse relationship with BDNF methylation only in healthy controls. Particularly the prefrontal and occipital cortices seem to indicate key regions in which BDNF methylation has a significant effect on structure.","_input_hash":837182869,"_task_hash":1851744762,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":304,"end":309,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":478,"end":486,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":808,"end":816,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1320,"end":1328,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706802414,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

In recent years, several studies pointed out possible biomarkers that could be used alone or in combination with other resources in the diagnosis and follow-up of critically ill patients who develop delirium. In this context, a systematic review was conducted to determine the predictive value of several biomarkers in acutely (critically and noncritically) ill adult patients with delirium. Studies that used the confusion assessment method (CAM) and CAM-intensive care unit as the diagnostic method were considered. The most recent search was performed in November 2017.

If untreated, WD, which is initially a liver disease, can turn into a multi-systemic disease with neurological involvement. Very few studies have described cognitive impairment in WD. The aim of this study is to report the cognitive profile of 31 treated WD patients.\tPatients were classed into two groups using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS): WD patients without neurological signs (WD-N(-)) (n=13), and WD patients with neurological signs (WD-N(+)) (n=18). The patients participated in a neuropsychological assessment evaluating memory, executive function and visuo-spatial abilities.\tBoth groups performed well for verbal intelligence and episodic memory skills. However, the majority of these patients exhibited altered performance for at least one cognitive test, particularly in the executive domain. The WD-N(+) group performed less well than the WD-N(-) group on cognitive tests involving rapid motor function, abstract thinking, working memory and top-down inhibitory control.\tCognitive impairment in treated WD patients essentially affects executive function involving fronto-striatal circuits. Verbal intelligence and episodic memory abilities seem to be remarkably preserved. Neuropsychological assessment is a valuable tool to evaluate the presence and the consequences of these cognitive impairments in WD patients with or without neurological signs in the course of this chronic disease.","_input_hash":994789875,"_task_hash":737728561,"spans":[{"text":"case","start":61,"end":65,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"study","start":373,"end":378,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"report","start":385,"end":391,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"patients","start":431,"end":439,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Patients","start":441,"end":449,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":537,"end":545,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":598,"end":606,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":653,"end":661,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":887,"end":895,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1211,"end":1219,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1510,"end":1518,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"35, 2, 36, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706802497,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

Despite the existence of few medications treating cognition, the need for efficacious treatment options to alleviate, halt or even prevent cognitive decline is generally unmet to date. Consequently, extensive research efforts are undertaken to identify medications that can effectively enhance cognition.\tThis review covers ongoing clinical trials for cognition and reflects on efforts undertaken to increase the success rates of procognitive drug treatment. The review discusses ways to optimize the drug development process for cognition enhancing agents at the preclinical to clinical interface and provides concrete examples.\tThe existing efficacy readouts addressing cognition in preclinical research offer little translational validity to the clinical situation. In order to identify truly efficacious drug candidates, biomarkers need to be developed that directly address conserved mechanisms underlying cognitive performances.

Throughout history, liver transplantation for this population has been controversial, and many policies and regulations have existed to limit access to lifesaving transplant for patients who use alcohol. In recent years, the rates of liver transplantation for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease have increased dramatically; however, disparities persist. For instance, many criteria used in evaluation for transplant listing, such as social support and prior knowledge of the harms of alcohol use, are not evidence based and may selectively disadvantage patients with alcohol use disorder. In addition, few transplant providers have adequate training in the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and few transplant centers offer specialized addiction treatment. Finally, current approaches to liver transplantation would benefit from adopting principles of harm reduction, which have demonstrated efficacy in the realm of addiction medicine for years. As we look toward the future, we must emphasize the use of evidence-based measures in selecting patients for listing, ensure access to high-quality addiction care for all patients pretransplant and posttransplant, and adopt harm reduction beliefs to better address relapse when it inevitably occurs. We believe that only by addressing each of these issues will we be able to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources in liver transplantation for all patients.","_input_hash":-403433809,"_task_hash":1533147655,"spans":[{"text":"Study","start":81,"end":86,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"history","start":431,"end":438,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"patients","start":598,"end":606,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":680,"end":688,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":985,"end":993,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1476,"end":1484,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1551,"end":1559,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1838,"end":1846,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 64, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706802537,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

Confirmatory factor analysis designed for items with categorical response types was implemented to examine six proposed structural models. The five-factor model demonstrated the most parsimonious fit based on common overall fit indices that was further supported by examination of local model fit indicators, though, the four- and six-factor models evidenced adequate-to-good fit as well. Examination of RRB factor score approaches indicated only minor differences between summed item subscale scores and extracted factor scores with regard to associations with diagnostic measures. All RRB subtypes demonstrated significant associations with cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior.

The primary triggers for motor neuronal death are still unknown, but inflammation is considered to be an important factor contributing to the pathophysiology of ALS both clinically and in ALS models. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its corresponding four E-prostanoid receptors play a pivotal role in the degeneration of motor neurons in human and transgenic models of ALS. It has also been shown that PGE2-EP2 signaling in glial cells (astrocytes or microglia) promotes motor neuronal death in G93A mice. The present study was designed to investigate the levels of expression of EP receptors in the spinal motor neurons of ALS model mice and to examine whether PGE2 alters the expression of EP receptors in differentiated NSC-34 cells, a motor neuron-like cell line. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that EP2 and EP3 immunoreactivity was localized in NeuN-positive large cells showing the typical morphology of motor neurons in mice. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that the immunoreactivity of EP2 in motor neurons was significantly increased in the early symptomatic stage in ALS model mice. In contrast, the level of EP3 expression remained constant, irrespective of age. In differentiated NSC-34 cells, bath application of PGE2 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease of MTT reduction. Although PGE2 had no effect on cell survival at concentrations of less than 10 \u03bcM, pretreatment with 10 \u03bcM PGE2 significantly up-regulated EP2 and concomitantly potentiated cell death induced by 30 \u03bcM PGE2. These results suggest that PGE2 is an important effector for induction of the EP2 subtype in differentiated NSC-34 cells, and that not only EP2 up-regulation in glial cells but also EP2 up-regulation in motor neurons plays a pivotal role in the vulnerability of motor neurons in ALS model mice.","_input_hash":1526333590,"_task_hash":950583694,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":144,"end":149,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"human","start":666,"end":671,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"transgenic","start":676,"end":686,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"cells","start":758,"end":763,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"mice","start":828,"end":832,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":846,"end":851,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"mice","start":962,"end":966,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":1058,"end":1063,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1209,"end":1214,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"mice","start":1266,"end":1270,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1428,"end":1432,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":1540,"end":1545,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1959,"end":1964,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":2011,"end":2016,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"mice","start":2133,"end":2137,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 0, 77, 70, 82, 2, 82, 70, 70, 82, 82, 70, 70, 70, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706802682,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

In panic disorder there is recurrent attacks of severe anxiety which are unprovoked and unexpected. Dominant symptoms vary from person to person. The syndrome is likely to be heterogeneous as the biological aetiology may be related to abnormalities in the function of a number of neurotransmitters ie serotonin, noradrenaline, gamabutyric acid, dopamine and cholecystokinin. As such different benzodiazepines and anti-depressants are efficacious in the treatment of the disorder. Medications should be titrated to prevent attacks and restore confidence.

Cognition was investigated by means of objective assessment of executive functions (EpiTrack\u00ae) and verbal memory and by subjective ratings of self-perceived side effects (cognition, mood, and vegetative). Quality of life was assessed using the QOLIE-10 questionnaire. Patients underwent assessment at baseline and after a median follow-up interval of 32 weeks. Forty-four patients were treated with LCM, 11 with LTG, and 15 with TPM. Treatment arms differed with regard to the age at onset of epilepsy (LTG>TPM) and to seizure control from baseline to follow-up, which was best in patients whose seizures were treated with LTG (55% vs. 16% in patients whose seizures were treated with LCM and 13% in patients whose seizures were treated with TPM). Groups did not differ in the type of epilepsy, daily drug load or drug load change, nor in baseline seizure frequency. Repeated measures statistics controlling for epilepsy onset and seizure outcome showed deteriorated executive functions with TPM (F=7.5, p=0.001). On an individual level (reliable change indices), 53% of the patients whose seizures were treated with TPM showed losses in this domain (LCM 14%, LTG 27%) and none of the patients showed improvement (LCM 23%, LTG 27%; \u03c7(2)=11.8, p=0.019).

{"pmid":"4075172","text":"Brain research^\nThiamine deficiency depletes cortical norepinephrine and impairs learning processes in the rat.^\nSeveral lines of evidence indicate that thiamine deficiency causes the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a human memory disorder. The present study examined behavioral deficits in rats after recovery from a bout of thiamine deficiency. Following behavioral testing, the brains were dissected into regions and assayed biochemically for levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and the primary metabolites of these monoamines. Based on previous findings in this laboratory, we predicted that thiamine deficiency not only produces behavioral deficits but loss in catecholamines as well. Impairments were observed for a spatial delayed alternation task that had been learned prior to experimental treatment. In addition, experimental animals were impaired in their ability to acquire two novel tasks, active and passive shock avoidance, after recovery from the acute effects of thiamine deficiency. Comparable deficits were not observed for a number of reflex responses that were measured to assess the general neurological state of the animals. Biochemical analyses revealed that the concentration of norepinephrine was reduced significantly in cortex-hippocampus and olfactory bulb but not in other regions, while dopamine and serotonin levels were not altered in any brain region examined. These data demonstrate that a bout of thiamine deficiency can produce persistent deficits in brain norepinephrine and concomitant decrements in behavioral measures of learning and memory. These results are consistent with our hypothesis and evidence that noradrenergic deficits contribute to the amnesic symptoms of Korsakoff's psychosis.","_input_hash":-1763199193,"_task_hash":-843483921,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":215,"end":220,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":250,"end":255,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706802772,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

The aim of this study was to investigate urinary incontinence (UI) and sexual dysfunction (SD) two years after treatment for localized prostate cancer (PC).\tThis study followed all cases of localized PC diagnosed between 2008 and 2009 in men aged\u226465years old and still alive two years after treatment. In total, 437 men were recruited. Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and by cross-checking with data from the cancer registry. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed to evaluate persisting UI and SD at 2years.\tAt two years after treatment, UI was persistent in 48.8%; 41.2% had used urinary protections, and 39.2% had used at least 1 pad/day; 55.2% reported financial difficulties for purchasing protective pads. In total, 22.7% did not consult a specialist for UI. SD was persistent in 82.8%; 30.4% did not consult a specialist for SD. SD had a negative impact on the sex life of patients and their partners. After adjustment for cancer stage, prostatectomy was significantly associated with persisting UI and SD at two years.\tTwo years after treatment, rates of persisting UI and/or SD remain high. Treatment by prostatectomy was significantly associated with an increased risk of persisting adverse effects at two years. The different toxicities between treatments should be presented to patients before initiating therapy in order to encourage the patient to contributed to shared treatment decision-making.","_input_hash":1614074082,"_task_hash":889028014,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":191,"end":199,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":269,"end":274,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":415,"end":420,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"questionnaire","start":630,"end":643,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"patients","start":1169,"end":1177,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1579,"end":1587,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":1606,"end":1613,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 2, 57, 34, 34, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706802807,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10","_session_id":"2024-02-01_14-38-10"}

However, its application has been partially impeded by the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the mechanical properties of various tissues within the plaque. Twenty-one human carotid plaques were collected from endarterectomy. The plaque was cut into rings, and different type of atherosclerotic tissues, including media, fibrous cap (FC), lipid and intraplaque haemorrhage/thrombus (IPH/T) was dissected for uniaxial extension testing. In total, 65 media strips from 17 samples, 59 FC strips from 14 samples, 38 lipid strips from 11 samples, and 21 IPH/T strips from 11 samples were tested successfully. A modified Mooney-Rivlin strain energy density function was used to characterize the stretch-stress relationship. The stiffnesses of media and FC are comparable, as are lipid and IPH/T. However, both media and FC are stiffer than either lipid or IPH/T. The median values of incremental Young's modulus of media, FC, lipid and IPH/T at \u03bb=1 are 290.1, 244.5, 104.4, 52.9, respectively; they increase to 1019.5, 817.4, 220.7 and 176.9 at \u03bb=1.1; and 4302.7, 3335.0, 533.4 and 268.8 at \u03bb=1.15 (unit, kPa; \u03bb, stretch ratio).

Typically, protection is seen when the gap between insults is several days to a week. However, the effect of mild but persistent hypoxia is unknown. In this study we examined the hypothesis that mild pre-existing hypoxia (PaO2<17 mm Hg) would reduce neural injury in chronically instrumented late-gestation (0.85 gestation) fetal sheep exposed to 30 min of global cerebral ischaemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion (normoxia: n=9 vs. pre-existing hypoxia: n=9) or normoxia plus sham ischaemia (sham controls: n=9). Histopathology was assessed after 7 days of recovery. Fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia had lower PaO2 values (16.1\u00b10.6 vs. 26.0\u00b11.1 mm Hg) and were lighter at post-mortem (4,033\u00b1412 vs. 5,261\u00b1238 g) compared to normoxic fetuses. Cerebral ischaemia was associated with secondary cortical oedema and seizures, reduced final EEG power, loss of sleep state cycling, and significant loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, with no significant effect of pre-existing hypoxia. Pre-existing hypoxia was associated with a significantly attenuated rise in mean arterial pressure between 18 and 36 h and slower resolution of cortical oedema between 96 and 150 h after ischaemia.

Height, weight, head circumference and bone age were recorded at regular intervals for the first 6 years of life. The mean SD score (SDS) for height was not significantly different from zero at study entry, but decreased mainly during the second year of life to a nadir of -0.78 in boys and -0.54 in girls at 2.5 years. During the subsequent years, a significant trend towards a regain of height SDS was noted in both sexes. Weight-for-height SDS was close to zero in both sexes, with a significant continuous increasing trend throughout the observation period. Head circumference SDS decreased in boys during the first year of life from -0.28 to -0.68, whereas girls showed only a minor change. During the further follow-up period, head circumference SDS remained at approximately -0.3 in boys and 0.0 in girls. While the mean verbal and performance IQ of the total study population at 5 and 6 years of age did not differ from a group of 212 healthy non-PKU children, patients with a head circumference SDS less than the population median at 2 years of age exhibited poorer cognitive abilities at school age than those patients with a relative head size greater than the population median. The children with a head circumference less than the median at 2 years had smaller head sizes already at birth; in addition, the change in relative head size during the first 2 years was correlated significantly with cognitive abilities at school age in boys. Mean bone age was identical to chronological age at each time point of observation. The rate of maturation was one year of bone age per year of chronological age. No correlation between phenylalanine intake or phenylalanine concentrations and the rates of body or head growth or skeletal maturation could be established. We conclude that despite adequate weight gain, moderate growth retardation occurred during the first 2 years of life in this group of children treated for PKU. Growth was more compromised in boys than in girls and tended to be compensated during later follow-up. Early infantile head circumference and growth appear to be predictors of cognitive development.","_input_hash":-130242946,"_task_hash":1454689394,"spans":[{"text":"Study","start":208,"end":213,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"score","start":387,"end":392,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"study","start":455,"end":460,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1128,"end":1133,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1230,"end":1238,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1381,"end":1389,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 60, 2, 2, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706874852,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_12-22-00","_session_id":"2024-02-02_12-22-00"}

In seven of the eight subjects that were operated on, ICA reconstruction was successful. Since pseudoocclusion of the ICA is likely to progress rapidly to definite occlusion, the patient is severely jeopardized from periocclusive embolism into the major brain arteries. Immediate diagnostic clarification and emergency endarterectomy are mandatory.","_input_hash":-223517611,"_task_hash":-162171891,"spans":[{"text":"diagnostic","start":93,"end":103,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"diagnostic","start":956,"end":966,"pattern":-808942259}],"meta":{"pattern":"55, 55"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706874959,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_12-22-00","_session_id":"2024-02-02_12-22-00"}

{"pmid":"12395691","text":"Psychopharmacology bulletin^\nComparing the methods used to compare antidepressants.^\nA wide array of antidepressants are now available to treat depression. However, the conventional wisdom that these medications are equally effective may not be true. It is argued that most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) do not have the power to discriminate between an effective and an even more effective medication. Until RCTs that enroll 300 or more patients per arm are conducted, or more sensitive research designs are developed, it will be difficult to determine if a 'not statistically different' finding reflects true therapeutic equivalence or if it is a false-negative result (or type II error). Statistical methods that evaluate data from a number of studies are used increasingly to compare treatment strategies. The relative merits and limitations of quantitative meta-analysis and pooled analysis of original data are discussed. The former method is preferred when a large number of relevant RCTs can be analyzed. Beyond the number of studies, publication bias ('file drawer' effect) and study selection criteria may influence outcomes of meta-analysis. Pooled analysis, which combines all original patient data, is preferred when there are only a handful of related RCTs. However, the integrity of a pooled analysis can be ruined by selective inclusion of studies ('cherry picking'). The validity of combining the data from different studies also must be demonstrated. Results of studies using these complementary methods suggest that there may be clinically meaningful differences in efficacy between several classes of antidepressants.","_input_hash":-1650146031,"_task_hash":-650190446,"spans":[{"text":"randomized","start":274,"end":284,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":285,"end":295,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trials","start":296,"end":302,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"patients","start":443,"end":451,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapeutic","start":616,"end":627,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"study","start":1092,"end":1097,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"18, 27, 75, 34, 47, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706875029,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_12-22-00","_session_id":"2024-02-02_12-22-00"}

In this study, we explored the effects of urate on dopaminergic neurons in nigrostriatal pathway in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilaterally lesioned rats. Uric acid (UA), when given twice daily at 200 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 10 consecutive days, elevated urate (the anionic form of UA) in plasma and striatum by 55% and 36.8%, respectively, as compared with vehicle group. This regimen of UA was found to ameliorate the behavioral deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss as well as dopamine depletion in the nigrostriatal system. Moreover, UA administration was capable of increasing glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity while decreasing malondialdehyde accumulation in striatum. In addition, the phosphorylation of both protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2) in the lesioned striata of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was dramatically reduced as compared with sham-operated rats. This reduction was attenuated in the Parkinsonian rats receiving UA treatment. Similarly, in vitro findings showed that UA alleviated the decrease in Akt activation and the increase in GSK3\u03b2 activity caused by 6-OHDA. Furthermore, neuroprotection by urate and its regulation on GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation at Ser9 was found to be abolished in the presence of PI3K inhibitor. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that urate was able to protect dopaminergic neurons in rat nigrostriatal pathway against the neurotoxicity of 6-OHDA, and showed that its beneficial effects may be related to its regulation on Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signaling.","_input_hash":-724562426,"_task_hash":-1019716205,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":71,"end":74,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"study","start":281,"end":286,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rat","start":1650,"end":1653,"pattern":-569153227}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 2, 92"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706875055,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_12-22-00","_session_id":"2024-02-02_12-22-00"}

All recruited patients were administered battery of neuropsychological tests exploring various cognitive domains. Patients considered to have a neuropsychological deficit were those with at least one test score for a given domain indicative of impairment. Thirty patients out of 100 showed cognitive deficits, and were offered participation in RehabTr, of which 16 accepted (5 low grade glioma, 4 high grade glioma, 2 glioblastoma, 2 meningioma and 3 metastases) and 14 declined for various reasons. The RehabTr consisted of one weekly individual session of 1 h, for a total of 10 weeks, carried out by a trained psychologist. The functions trained were: memory, attention, visuo-spatial functions, language and reasoning by means of Training NeuroPsicologico (TNP(\u00ae)) software. To evaluate the effect of the RehabTr, the same battery of tests was administered directly after cognitive rehabilitation (T1), and at six-month follow-up (T2).

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have demonstrated neurochemical alterations in the frontal lobe of alcohol users, although most studies focused on older, alcohol-dependent subjects.\tIn this study, neurochemical data were acquired using MRS at 4.0 Tesla from emerging adults (18 to 24 years old) who were binge alcohol drinkers (BD, n = 23) or light drinkers (LD, n = 31). Since binge drinking is also associated with increased prevalence of experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout, BD were stratified into alcohol-induced blackout (BDBO) and non-blackout (BDN) groups.\tOverall, BD had significantly lower gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) than LD. When stratified by blackout history, BDBO also had lower ACC glutamate (Glu) than LD. No group differences in MRS metabolites were observed in the parietal-occipital cortex. Lower ACC GABA and Glu remained significant after accounting for lower gray matter content in BD, however, NAA differences were no longer evident. In addition, low ACC GABA levels were associated with greater alcohol use consequences, and worse response inhibition and attention/mental flexibility in BD.\tThese data indicate that binge drinking affects frontal lobe neurochemistry, more so in those who had experienced an alcohol-induced blackout. Characterization of the neurochemical profiles associated with binge alcohol consumption and blackout history may help identify unique risk factors for the later manifestation of alcohol abuse and dependence, in young individuals who are heavy, frequent drinkers, but who do not meet the criteria for alcohol abuse disorders.","_input_hash":968614032,"_task_hash":1479029586,"spans":[{"text":"history","start":130,"end":137,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"study","start":536,"end":541,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"prevalence","start":773,"end":783,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"history","start":1089,"end":1096,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"history","start":1785,"end":1792,"pattern":-1634665066}],"meta":{"pattern":"64, 2, 53, 64, 64"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706885424,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34","_session_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34"}

Similar to many other psychiatric syndromes, advances in genotyping technology, allowing for inexpensive genome-wide assays, has confirmed the contribution of polygenic inheritance involving common alleles of small effect, a handful of which have now been definitively identified. However, the past decade of gene discovery in ASD has been most notable for the application, in large family-based cohorts, of high-density microarray studies of submicroscopic chromosomal structure as well as high-throughput DNA sequencing-leading to the identification of an increasingly long list of risk regions and genes disrupted by rare, de novo germline mutations of large effect. This genomic architecture offers particular advantages for the illumination of biological mechanisms but also presents distinctive challenges.

In 98 psychosis probands (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychosis), neural activity was assessed during baseline and during a 5-s period in preparation for the pro/antisaccade task. To maximize the ability to identify meaningful differences between psychosis subtypes, analyses were conducted as a function of subgrouping probands by standard clinical diagnoses and neurobiological features. These psychosis 'biotypes' were created using brain-based biomarkers, independent of symptomatology (Clementz et al.,). Psychosis probands as a whole showed poor antisaccade performance and diminished baseline oscillatory phase synchrony. Psychosis biotypes differed on both behavioral and brain measures, in ways predicted from Clementz et al. (). Two biotype groups showed similarly deficient behavior and baseline synchrony, despite diametrically opposed neural activity amplitudes. Another biotype subgroup was more similar to healthy individuals on behavioral and brain measures, despite the presence of psychosis. This study provides evidence that (a) consideration of baseline levels of activation and synchrony will be essential for a comprehensive understanding of neural response differences in psychosis, and (b) distinct psychosis subgroups exhibit reduced versus augmented intrinsic neural activity, despite cognitive performance and clinical similarities.","_input_hash":-1729023554,"_task_hash":1356687676,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":385,"end":390,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1605,"end":1610,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706885486,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34","_session_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34"}

Reduced medullary serotonergic neurones, modulators of respiration in response to hypercapnia, were reported in a SUDEP post-mortem series. The amygdala and hippocampus have high serotonergic innervation and are functionally implicated in seizure-related respiratory dysregulation. We explored serotonergic networks in mesial temporal lobe structures in a surgical and post-mortem epilepsy series in relation to SUDEP risk. We stratified 75 temporal lobe epilepsy patients with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE/HS) into high (N = 16), medium (N = 11) and low risk (N = 48) groups for SUDEP based on generalised seizure frequency. We also included the amygdala in 35 post-mortem cases, including SUDEP (N = 17), epilepsy controls (N = 10) and non-epilepsy controls (N = 8). The immunohistochemistry labelling index (LI) and axonal length (AL) of serotonin transporter (SERT)-positive axons were quantified in 13 regions of interest with image analysis. SERT LI was highest in amygdala and subiculum regions. In the surgical series, higher SERT LI was observed in high risk than low risk cases in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and subiculum (p < 0.05). In the post-mortem cases higher SERT LI and AL was observed in the basal and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala and peri-amygdala cortex in SUDEP compared to epilepsy controls (p < 0.05). Patients on SRI showed higher SERT in the dentate gyrus (p < 0.005) and CA4 (p < 0.05) but there was no difference in patients with or without a psychiatric history. Higher SERT in hippocampal subfields in TLE/HS cases with SUDEP risk factors and higher amygdala SERT in post-mortem SUDEP cases than epilepsy controls supports a role for altered serotonergic networks involving limbic regions in SUDEP.

The test is especially helpful to reassess patients who seem to have become less responsive to levodopa and it also has some predictive value in the assessment of an untreated patient's likely response to dopaminergic therapy.","_input_hash":1902147044,"_task_hash":-577782697,"spans":[{"text":"therapy","start":279,"end":286,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":307,"end":315,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":601,"end":609,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":658,"end":666,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":846,"end":854,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":1021,"end":1028,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"46, 34, 34, 34, 34, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706885619,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34","_session_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34"}

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of ACE in this model and to compare the treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat with that with the angiotensin II antagonist HR 720. The endothelial layer of the left carotid artery was removed using an inflated balloon catheter. Injured and control vessels were both submitted to histomorphological analysis and DNA content quantification at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 days after injury. Evaluation of neointima thickening demonstrated a slow but steady increase of neointima that was significant after day 6 and reached 30% of the lumen in 2 weeks. This was paralleled by an increase in DNA content, which was significant 4 days after injury. ACE mRNA levels were quantified by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. Measurement of ACE mRNA levels revealed a significant upregulation 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. ACE activity was also significantly enhanced at 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. In addition, the treatment with ramiprilat was more efficient in reducing neointima formation than that with HR 720. These data underlie the role of ACE in this model of restenosis. The early induction of ACE expression after endothelial injury but before significant changes in the vessel structure suggests that ACE activity might be one of the mechanisms that trigger neointima formation in the rat.","_input_hash":491871978,"_task_hash":-1841580916,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":90,"end":93,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"rat","start":304,"end":307,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"study","start":365,"end":370,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rat","start":1873,"end":1876,"pattern":-569153227}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 92, 2, 92"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706885662,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34","_session_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34"}

There have been reports suggesting that circulating non-22K GH isoforms are increased in acromegaly, but the possible implications of such observations in the management of the disease have not been addressed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proportion of circulating non-22K GH isoforms in acromegaly. In addition, the relationships between the amount of non-22K GH and tumor size, biochemical measurements, and body composition also were investigated. Samples with different GH levels were selected from 24-h GH profiles from 15 acromegalic men evaluated before and 1 yr after transsphenoidal surgery and from 13 healthy men. The serum non-22K GH levels, expressed as percentage of total GH concentration, were determined by the 22K GH exclusion assay, which is based on immunomagnetic extraction of 22K GH from serum and quantitation of non-22K GH using a polyclonal GH assay. The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was fairly constant in different samples from the same patient, regardless of the GH level. However, a wide variation of values was observed among acromegalics, both before (14-51%) and after surgery (8-62%). The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was increased in untreated patients, compared with controls (26.6 vs. 17.4%; P < 0.01), and the values correlated significantly to tumor size, mean 24-h GH concentration, serum PRL, and extracellular water. After surgery, patients not truly cured, with mean 24-h GH concentration of 1 microg/L or more, had an increased proportion of non-22K GH, compared with those with levels less than 1 microg/L (P < 0.01). In the former group, the median values were similar than those in untreated acromegalics (34 vs. 26.6%, respectively), whereas in the latter, they were comparable with those in the controls (15.2 vs. 17.4%, respectively). We conclude that acromegalics have an increased proportion of circulating non-22K GH isoforms. The values are fairly constant in different samples from an individual, regardless of GH level, but a large spectrum can be observed among patients. This variability suggests that different pituitary adenomas secrete GH isoforms in variable amounts. Our observation that a higher proportion of non-22K GH isoforms is present in patients not truly cured after surgery suggests that the evaluation of non-22K GH isoforms can be useful in the follow-up of acromegalic patients.","_input_hash":-2139051293,"_task_hash":874263583,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":478,"end":483,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"surgery","start":857,"end":864,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"surgery","start":1372,"end":1379,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":1454,"end":1462,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"surgery","start":1640,"end":1647,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":1649,"end":1657,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2294,"end":2302,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2483,"end":2491,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"surgery","start":2514,"end":2521,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":2620,"end":2628,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 49, 49, 34, 49, 34, 34, 34, 49, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706885760,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34","_session_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34"}

Therefore, they would benefit from teaching procedures that minimize their difficulties in acquiring these relations. This study compared two teaching procedures, an error prevention procedure and an error correction procedure, for teaching relations between objects and pictures.\tParticipants were two groups of children with autism, aged between 3 and 7 years. In the context of picture-to-object requesting, one group was taught using an error correction method and the other group with an error prevention method. The measures for each child were accuracy of correspondences between taught picture and object pairs and accuracy of delayed correspondences in learning outcome tests with all combinations of object and picture pairs presented to them throughout the study.\tThe group receiving the error prevention-based teaching made significantly fewer errors during the teaching phases and in their learning outcome test for correspondences between all combinations of pictures and objects.\tThe error prevention teaching procedure would seem to provide a more efficient and ecologically valid method than the error correction procedure for teaching relations between objects and their graphic-based referents.

Using our previously described rat model of IMSCT, we describe a technique for microsurgical tumor resection and present the functional and histopathological analysis of tumor progression.\tTwenty-four Fischer 344 rats were randomized into two groups. All animals received a 5-microl intramedullary injection of 9L gliosarcoma cells. Animals were evaluated daily for signs of paralysis using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale. Group 1 continued with daily assessments using the BBB scale following tumor implantation, but received no further treatment. Group 2 underwent surgical removal of intramedullary tumor on postoperative day five. At a BBB score less than 5 (e.g., functional paraplegia), all animals of both groups were killed and sent for histopathological analysis.\tGroup 1 had a median onset of functional hind limb paraplegia at 15 +/- 1.0 days. Group 2 had a median onset of hind limb paresis at 53 +/- 0.46 days. Hematoxylin-eosin cross-sections confirmed the presence of intramedullary 9L tumor invading the spinal cord in both groups.\tAnimals with 9L IMSCTs consistently developed hind limb paraplegia in a reliable and reproducible manner. Animals undergoing microsurgical resection of IMSCT had a significant delay in the onset of functional paraplegia compared to the untreated controls. These findings suggest that this model may mimic the behavior of IMSCTs following operative resection in humans and thus may be used to examine efficacy of new treatment options for high-grade intramedullary tumors.","_input_hash":-527061586,"_task_hash":-1966062776,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":171,"end":174,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"animal","start":218,"end":224,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"rat","start":428,"end":431,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"randomized","start":620,"end":630,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"cells","start":723,"end":728,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"score","start":1056,"end":1061,"pattern":1310160002}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 67, 92, 18, 70, 60"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706885922,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34","_session_id":"2024-02-02_15-41-34"}

Ouabain and the vehicle aCSF were microinjected into the left lateral ventricle immediately, after 4h, and after 24h. The results showed that (a) locomotion responses of the Immediate group were significantly decreased compared to those of the aCSF group, particularly the first five minutes.

We hypothesized that the degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption can be quantified in vitro and is influenced by device position across the aneurysm neck. We tested this hypothesis using the Medina\u00ae Embolization Device (MED).\tTen different patient-specific elastic vascular models were manufactured. Models were connected to a pulsatile flow circuit, filled with a blood-mimicking fluid and treated by two operators using a single MED. Intra-aneurysmal flow velocity was measured using conventional and high-frequency digital subtraction angiography (HF-DSA) before and after each deployment. Aneurysm neck coverage by the implanted devices was assessed with flat detector computed tomography on a three-point Likert scale.\tA total of 80 individual MED deployments were performed by the two operators. The mean intra-aneurysmal flow velocity reduction after MED implantation was 33.6% (27.5-39.7%). No significant differences in neck coverage (p = 0.99) or flow disruption (p = 0.84) were observed between operators. The degree of flow disruption significantly correlated with neck coverage (\u03c1 = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21-0.59, p = 0.002) as well as with neck area (\u03c1 = -0,35, 95% CI: -0.54 --0.13, p = 0.024). On multiple regression analysis, both neck coverage and total neck area were independent predictors of flow disruption.\tThe degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption after MED implantation can be quantified in vitro and varies considerably between different aneurysms and different device configurations. Optimal device coverage across the aneurysm neck improves flow disruption and may thus contribute to aneurysm occlusion.","_input_hash":-390394218,"_task_hash":-551732806,"spans":[{"text":"vascular","start":521,"end":529,"pattern":-60508792}],"meta":{"pattern":"66"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706887347,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}
{"pmid":"12697002","text":"CNS drugs^\nThe triptan formulations : how to match patients and products.^\nThe 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists (the 'triptans') are migraine-specific agents that have revolutionised the treatment of migraine. They are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available in various strengths and formulations, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the triptans exist, as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including half-life, time to peak plasma concentrations, peak plasma concentrations, area under the concentration-time curve, metabolism and drug-drug interaction profiles. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability advantages for one agent over another is not well differentiated. However, delivery systems may play an important role in onset of action. Given that the clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle, identification of the most appropriate triptan for an individual patient requires consideration of the specific characteristics of the patient and knowledge of patient preference, an accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute-care medications and individual features of the drug being considered. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug also depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. Individual patient response to the triptans seems to be idiosyncratic and possibly genetically determined. Therefore, a set of specific questions can be used to determine whether a currently used triptan is optimally effective, whether the dose needs to be increased or whether another triptan should be tried. The clinician has in his/her armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of triptans, available in multiple formulations and dosages, which have good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimise therapeutic benefit. Use of the methods outlined in this review in choosing a triptan for an individual patient is probably more likely to lead to migraine relief than making an educated guess as to which triptan is most appropriate.","_input_hash":1635550398,"_task_hash":1614023072,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":51,"end":59,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"history","start":1263,"end":1270,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"therapeutic","start":2422,"end":2433,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"review","start":2479,"end":2485,"pattern":692368738}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 64, 47, 4"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706887371,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

Therefore, we examined the association of different APOE alleles with common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), carotid plaques, incident myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. We analyzed data from 3327 participants aged 20-79 years of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) from Northeast Germany with a median follow-up time of 14.5 years. Linear, logistic, and Cox-regression models were used to assess the associations of the APOE polymorphism with CCA-IMT, carotid plaques, incident MI and stroke, respectively. In our study, the APOE E2 allele was associated with lower CCA-IMT at baseline compared to E3 homozygotes (\u03b2: - 0.02 [95% CI - 0.04, - 0.004]). Over the follow-up, 244 MI events and 218 stroke events were observed.

However, the positive association between CCA-IMT and incident MI was more pronounced in E2 carriers than E3 homozygotes. Thus, our study suggests that while APOE E2 allele may predispose individuals to lower CCA-IMT, E2 carriers may be more prone to MI than E3 homozygotes as the CCA-IMT increases. APOE E4 allele had no effect on CCA-IMT, plaques, MI or stroke.","_input_hash":-1971787207,"_task_hash":1739782370,"spans":[{"text":"Study","start":610,"end":615,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":895,"end":900,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1506,"end":1511,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 2, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706887994,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

In this study the changes in rat PRL cells by estrogen treatment were studied histologically and immunocytochemically. Furthermore, intracellular structures in PRL cells were observed by high resolution scanning electron microscopy using the aldehyde prefix osmium-DMSO-osmium method. These rat pituitary tumors were established in Fischer-344 female rats by weekly injections of 2.5 mg estradiol valerate. The estrogen-induced, autonomous and transplantable rat pituitary tumors (MtT/F84) were also studied in the same manner and the findings were compared with estrogen-induced tumors. The increase of weight of pituitary gland and of serum PRL level correlated significantly with the number of estrogen administration. On the basis of histological findings, estrogen-induced pituitary tumors can be classified into two different stages, that is, hypertrophic hyperplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The former corresponds to the period until 6 weeks after the beginning of estrogen treatment and the latter to the period thereafter. In the former, PRL cells were significantly increased in number and volume, and were diffusely immunoreactive for PRL in the cytoplasm. Cell atypism was rarely found. The extent of acidophil staining was well preserved in hematoxylin-eosin staining. Ultrastructurally, organelles were well developed, especially rough endoplasmic reticulum showed whorl formation. Immature, irregularly shaped secretory granules were frequently observed within the Golgi area. Mature granules were richly stored at the periphery of the cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","_input_hash":-997142142,"_task_hash":909709578,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":100,"end":103,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"rat","start":230,"end":233,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"cells","start":353,"end":358,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":368,"end":373,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rat","start":389,"end":392,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"cells","start":397,"end":402,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":524,"end":529,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"rat","start":651,"end":654,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"rat","start":819,"end":822,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"cells","start":1416,"end":1421,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 92, 70, 2, 92, 70, 70, 92, 92, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888110,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

{"pmid":"32563266","text":"BMC public health^\nCorrelation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.^\nIn Korea, higher education has rapidly grown influenced by sociocultural tradition. Parents invest a significant portion of their household income in their children's education. Private education has been considered to greatly affect students' psychology and behavior. However, past research has largely neglected to study parents who pay these costs. Since household income and education level are important determinants of socioeconomic status (SES), education expenditures are likely to cause depressive symptoms. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.\tData were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS, 2015, 2018). The sample analyzed consisted of 397 and 337 fathers and 403 and 370 mothers in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The independent variable in this study was the proportion of private education cost. This proportion was calculated by dividing each household's private education costs by its equivalized household disposable income (EHDI) and multiplying this number by 100. The main dependent variable was parental responses to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-11 (CESD-11). Using a generalized linear model, we investigated the effects of the proportion of private education cost on parental depression.\tThe results showed that fathers with higher proportions of private education cost exhibited higher CESD-11 scores compared to fathers with lower proportions cost (moderate: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.419, S. E\u2009=\u20090.164, p\u00a0=\u20090.0105; high: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.476, S. E\u2009=\u20090.178, p\u00a0=\u20090.0076), indicating that a higher ratio of private education cost may negatively affect depression in fathers. However, there was no discernable correlation between mothers' CESD-11 scores and the proportion of private education cost (moderate: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.078, S. E\u2009=\u20090.250, p\u00a0=\u20090.7555; high: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.003, S.

Age-related changes in obstacle avoidance were examined by comparing the foot kinematics of 105 older and 103 younger adults when stepping over an obstacle. The difference in the clearance between the leading and trailing limbs (\u0394 clearance) was calculated to determine the degree of decrement in the clearance of the trailing limb. A cognitive test battery was used to evaluate cognitive function among older adults to assess their association with \u0394 clearance. Older adults showed a significantly lower clearance of the trailing limb than young adults, resulting in greater \u0394 clearance. Significant correlations were observed between greater \u0394 clearance and scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and immediate recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory test. Therefore, memory functions may contribute to the control of trailing limb movements, which can secure a safety margin to avoid stumbling over an obstacle during obstacle avoidance locomotion.","_input_hash":-340585952,"_task_hash":1493673601,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888423,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

Use of ergots contributed to initial theories of migraine pathogenesis and provided the substrate for development of the triptans. Triptans are very efficacious for many migraineurs, and since their widespread use, use of ergots has significantly declined. Unfortunately, there remain many migraineurs who benefit little from triptans, yet respond very well to ergots. Discoveries in migraine pathophysiology have given us better understanding of the complex processes involved, although there remain many unknown factors in migraine treatment. Additional, unrecognized therapeutic targets may exist throughout the neuronal connections of the brainstem, cortex, and cerebral vasculature. Ergots interact with a broader spectrum of receptors than triptans. This lack of receptor specificity explains potential ergot side effects, but may also account for efficacy. The role of ergots in headache should be revisited, especially in view of newer ergot formulations with improved tolerability and side effect profiles, such as orally inhaled dihydroergotamine. Redefining where in the headache treatment spectrum ergots belong and deciding when they may be the optimal choice of treatment is necessary.","_input_hash":2065933326,"_task_hash":-2117509984,"spans":[{"text":"therapeutic","start":843,"end":854,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888446,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

Here we show that a deficiency of this DNA repair pathway in humans does not predispose to neoplasia or dysfunctions in rapidly replicating tissues, but instead causes spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) by affecting large, terminally differentiated, non-dividing neuronal cells. Using genome-wide linkage mapping and a positional candidate approach in a Saudi Arabian family affected with autosomal recessive SCAN1, we identified a homozygous mutation in TDP1 (A1478G) that results in the substitution of histidine 493 with an arginine residue. The His493 residue is conserved in TDP1 across species and is located in the active site of the enzyme. Protein modeling predicts that mutation of this amino acid to arginine will disrupt the symmetric structure of the active site. We propose that loss-of-function mutations in TDP1 may cause SCAN1 either by interfering with DNA transcription or by inducing apoptosis in postmitotic neurons.","_input_hash":1138953252,"_task_hash":241910571,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":696,"end":701,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888471,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

Spiritual care for people with dementia involves reflective practice and meaningful engagement with the person with dementia, so as to facilitate shared understanding. Furthermore, the support of the spiritual and religious beliefs of the person need to be facilitated within an individualised or person centred approach to care and delivered within a multi-disciplinary collaborative context.","_input_hash":1518992422,"_task_hash":462994853,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":272,"end":280,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"history","start":484,"end":491,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"case","start":503,"end":507,"pattern":1741807605}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 64, 35"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888505,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

AD-type tau phosphoepitopes, detected by various monoclonal antibodies, are absent from normal adult neurons, but recent studies have shown that their expression may contribute to neuritogenesis and axon differentiation in the developing nervous system. Therefore, we have examined a brain nerve cell line that is spontaneously neuritogenic for possible expression of AD-type tau epitopes. The neuritogenic rat brain cell line B103 was found to constitutively produce two-AD related epitopes of tau, detected by cellular immunofluorescence studies with the PHF-1 and Alz-50 monoclonal antibodies. Biochemical studies showed that the antibodies bound to proteins within the molecular, weight range expected for phosphorylated tau isoforms. Further verification was established by use of tau antisense oligomers, which eliminated cellular immunofluorescence due to the AD-related monoclonals and polyclonal anti-tau but did not eliminate fluorescence due to anti-tubulin. Cells treated with tau antisense were not neurite-free. Neurites that remained, however, were abnormal, generally short and wavy in appearance. Cellular distribution of the tau epitopes was found to be particularly interesting. Alz-50 recognized only cytoplasmic tau whereas PHF-1 recognized nuclear tau as well as cytoplasmic. Thus, the two epitopes, are morphologically segregated within the cell. Because subcellular segregation of tau is compromised in Alzheimer's disease, mechanisms that segregate AD-type phosphotau epitopes in B103 cells may have relevance to this neurodegenerative disorder.","_input_hash":1332187104,"_task_hash":848036067,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":84,"end":87,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"rat","start":647,"end":650,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"Cells","start":1210,"end":1215,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1750,"end":1755,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 92, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888521,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

Considering the limited knowledge regarding the immune mechanisms involved in narcolepsy whether related to flu vaccination or not and the recent progresses in cytokine measurement technology, we assessed 30 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors using the Luminex technology in either peripheral (serum) or central (CSF) compartments in a large population of 90 children and adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 in comparison to 58 non-hypocretin deficient hypersomniacs and 41 healthy controls. Furthermore, we compared their levels in patients with narcolepsy whether exposed to pandemic flu vaccine or not, and analyzed the effect of age, duration of disease and symptom severity. Comparison for sera biomarkers between narcolepsy (n = 84, 54 males, median age: 15.5 years old) and healthy controls (n = 41, 13 males, median age: 20 years old) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of several pro- and anti-inflammatory serum cytokines and growth factors with interferon-\u03b3, CCL11, epidermal growth factor, and interleukin-2 receptor being independently associated with narcolepsy. Increased levels of interferon-\u03b3, CCL11, and interleukin-12 were found when close to narcolepsy onset. After several adjustments, only one CSF biomarker differed between narcolepsy (n = 44, 26 males, median age: 15 years old) and non-hypocretin deficient hypersomnias (n = 57, 24 males, median age: 36 years old) with higher CCL 3 levels found in narcolepsy. Comparison for sera biomarkers between patients with narcolepsy who developed the disease post-pandemic flu vaccination (n = 36) to those without vaccination (n = 48) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of three cytokines, regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted, CXCL10, and CXCL9, being independently and significantly increased in the group exposed to the vaccine. No significant differences were found between narcoleptics whether exposed to flu vaccination or not for CSF biomarkers except for a lower CXCL10 level found in the exposed group. To conclude, we highlighted the role of sera cytokine with pro-inflammatory properties and especially interferon-\u03b3 being independently associated with narcolepsy close to disease onset. The activity of the interferon-\u03b3 network was also increased in the context of narcolepsy after the pandemic flu vaccination being a potential key player in the immune mechanism that triggers narcolepsy and that coordinates the immune response necessary for resolving vaccination assaults.","_input_hash":-1487363250,"_task_hash":312834363,"spans":[{"text":"genes","start":159,"end":164,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"patients","start":692,"end":700,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":849,"end":857,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1829,"end":1837,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"78, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888564,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

TH insufficiency showed a decrease in the expression of parvalbumin (PV) in the cortex and hippocampus of pups at postnatal day (PD) 14, while treatment with thyroxine from PD 0 to PD 14 ameliorated the PV loss. On the other hand, treatment with antithyroid agents in adulthood did not result in a decrease in the expression of PV in these areas. These results indicate the existence of a critical period of TH action during the early postnatal period. A decrease in MeCP2-positive neuronal nuclei was also observed in the cortical layers II-IV of the cerebral cortex. The brains were then stained with CUX1, a marker for cortical layers II-IV. In comparison with normal mice, CUX1 signals were decreased in the somatosensory cortex of the hypothyroid mice, and the total thickness of cortical layers II-IV of the mice was lower than that of normal mice.

In nine of the children who had not required shunts the distribution of intelligence was within the normal range. The need for a shunt was significantly related to the presence of craniolacunae and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Seven of the 74 shunt-treated children had suffered ventriculitis, meningitis or septicaemia, and their intelligence was significantly worse than the others. In the 67 shunt-treated children who had not suffered infection, intelligence was significantly related to the thickness of the pallium when the shunt was inserted during the first four weeks of life, and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Intelligence was not related to the function of the shunt at time of assessment, to the number of revisions of the shunt, or to the rate of increase in head size during the first four weeks of life.

Since there is little empirical data on staff victims of assaults by Alzheimer's and other dementia patients, this paper will explore the implications of the present findings for long-term care settings.","_input_hash":602088034,"_task_hash":-1870183915,"spans":[{"text":"review","start":135,"end":141,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"review","start":489,"end":495,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"patients","start":699,"end":707,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"4, 4, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888752,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

To date, however, this impression has not been systematically investigated. A case-control study of children in Otago, New Zealand (case DMFT > or = 5; control DMFT <5; case status determined from School Dental Service dental records) was conducted by postal survey and reference to the School Dental Service records. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, and school socio-economic status. The purpose of the study was to assess whether having ADHD was associated with higher odds of having high caries experience. Questionnaires were returned for a total of 128 case-control pairs. Conditional logistical regression analysis showed that, after controlling for fluoride history, medical problems, diet, and self-reported oral hygiene, children with ADHD had nearly 12 times the odds of having a high DMFT score than children who did not have ADHD (OR = 11.98; 95% CI 1.13, 91.81).

Near miss incidents (NMI) that did not result in death have a crucial role in understanding risk factors in custody. Such research has not previously been undertaken. A program of research has been developed to study NMI, in order to better identify those at risk in police custody. For the purposes of this research, NMI have been defined as 'an unplanned and unforeseeable or unforeseen event that could have resulted, but did not result, in human death or may have resulted in injury or other adverse outcomes'. It was intended that the definition although broad, would not include simple accidents (e.g. slipping on urine in a cell) or trivial injury.\tThe two aims of the study are (a) to determine whether it is realistic to attempt to assess NMI with the intention of identifying information of use in enhancing detainee care and (b) to assess how frequently NMIs occur and whether there are specific patterns. Pilot interviews were conducted with three forensic physicians practising in London, UK to create a structured questionnaire for all forensic physicians working in London. The questionnaire provided the basis of a retrospective recall survey of all forensic physicians working in London as Forensic Medical Examiners. The questionnaire was designed to assess the numbers of NMI, patterns in occurrence and relevant learning points within the previous 6 months. A covering letter, background questionnaire (exploring the background of the medical practitioner), copies of the survey, and reply paid envelopes were sent to each Forensic Medical Examiner (n=134) in London, contracted to provide forensic medical services for the Metropolitan Police Service. Data about all incidents were anonymized.\tNinety six (73%) Forensic Medical Examiners responded. Of these 18% were Principal grade, the remainder were Senior (24%), Standard (35%) and Assistant (23%). Thirty eight NMI were reported by 27 Forensic Medical Examiners (of all levels). The initial reason for police contact was recorded as alcohol (n=8), theft and robbery (n=7), warrants (n=4), violence (n=3), traffic violations (n=2) and single cases of drugs, murder and immigration offences. Of the main perceived cause of each NMI, illicit drugs were involved in 12/38, alcohol in 17/38, deliberate self-harm in 11/38, issues concerning searches, checks or rousing in 8/38, failure of inter-agency communications in 5/38, and possible resource issues in 4/38. In a number of cases more than one factor was involved.\tThe information established about NMI is broadly consistent with documented patterns of deaths in police custody in England and Wales which supports the validity of the data. The next stage of this research will be a prospective six month study in which NMI will be analysed in order to learn lessons which may be utilised to attempt to prevent potentially avoidable deaths in police custody.","_input_hash":-1912391150,"_task_hash":386222831,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":462,"end":467,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"human","start":695,"end":700,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"aims","start":915,"end":919,"pattern":-2080524606},{"text":"study","start":927,"end":932,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"questionnaire","start":1279,"end":1292,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"questionnaire","start":1344,"end":1357,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"retrospective","start":1382,"end":1395,"pattern":1350033973},{"text":"questionnaire","start":1490,"end":1503,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"questionnaire","start":1659,"end":1672,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"study","start":2981,"end":2986,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 0, 43, 2, 57, 57, 65, 57, 57, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888809,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

Depression is a common co-morbidity of this condition. Despite this common interaction, relatively little research has been performed on the development of GBM-associated depression. We performed a literary search of the PubMed database for articles published relating to GBM and depression. A total of 85 articles were identified with 46 meeting inclusion criteria. Depression significantly impacts care, decreasing medication compliance, and patient survival. Diagnostically, because depression and GBM share intricate neuro-connectivity in a way that effect functionality, these diseases can be mistaken for alternative psychological or pathological disorders, complicating care. Therapeutically, anti-depressants have anti-tumor properties; yet, some have been shown to interfere with GBM treatment. One reason for this is that the pathophysiological development of depression and GBM share several pathways including altered regulation of the 5-HT receptor, norepinephrine, and 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. Over time, depression can persist after GBM treatment, affecting patient quality of life. Together, depression and GBM are complicated concomitant diseases. Clinicians must be aware of their co-existence. Because of overlapping molecular pathways involved in both diseases, careful medication selection is imperative to avoid potential adverse interactions. Since GBMs are the most common primary brain cancer, physicians dealing with this disease should be prepared for the development of depression as a potential sequela of this condition, given the related pathophysiology and the known poor outcomes.","_input_hash":1051221733,"_task_hash":-1123721771,"spans":[{"text":"review","start":96,"end":102,"pattern":692368738}],"meta":{"pattern":"4"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888815,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

Functional status was evaluated with the Tinetti scale, cognitive status with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and nutritional status with the Mini-Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF).

Here, we examined signaling events in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and searched for therapeutic agents that could overcome TRAIL resistance in glioma cells. TRAIL induced apoptosis through death receptor 5 (DR5) and was mediated by caspase-8-initiated extrinsic and intrinsic mitochondrial pathways in sensitive glioma cell lines. TRAIL also triggered apoptosis in resistant glioma cell lines through the same pathways, but only if the cells were pretreated with chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin, camptothecin and etoposide. Previous studies suggested that this was due to an increase in DR5 expression in wild-type TP53 cells, but this mechanism did not account for cells with mutant TP53. Here, we show that a more general effect of these agents is to downregulate caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP(S) (the short form of cellular Fas-associated death domain-fike interleukin-1-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein) and up-regulate Bak, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, independently of cell's TP53 status. Furthermore, we showed that TRAIL alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, induced apoptosis in primary tumor cultures from patients with malignant gliomas, reinforcing the potential of TRAIL as an effective therapeutic agent for malignant gliomas.","_input_hash":-940659230,"_task_hash":1233076146,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":67,"end":72,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":90,"end":95,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":161,"end":166,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":278,"end":283,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapeutic","start":387,"end":398,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"cells","start":453,"end":458,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":739,"end":744,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":926,"end":931,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":972,"end":977,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"patients","start":1447,"end":1455,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1531,"end":1542,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 70, 70, 70, 47, 70, 70, 70, 70, 34, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706888978,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

In this paper the term syringomyelia is only used for dysrhaphic cavities in the medulla. After our experience with 61 patients with syringomyelia now we perform the operative decompression of the craniocervical transition as the first step in the operative treatment of the progressive syringomyelia combined with severe craniocervical malformations.

This need motivated the present initiative to use data from a uniquely large patient population and design a novel methodology to achieve a risk determination with unprecedented accuracy. The authors also aimed to determine the impact of sex, pregnancy, AVM volume, and location on the risk for AVM rupture.METHODSThe present study does not consider any specific management of the AVMs, but only uses the age distribution for the first hemorrhage, the shape of which becomes universal for a sufficiently large set of patients. For this purpose, the authors collected observations, including age at first hemorrhage and AVM size and location, in 3425 patients. The average annual risk for hemorrhage could then be determined from the simple relation that the number of patients with their first hemorrhage at a specific age equals the risk for hemorrhage times the number of patients at risk at that age. For a subset of the patients, the information regarding occurrence of AVM hemorrhage after treatment of the first hemorrhage was used for further analysis of the influence on risk from AVM location and pregnancy.RESULTSThe age distribution for the first AVM hemorrhage was used to determine the average annual risk for hemorrhage in unruptured AVMs at adult ages (25-60 years). It was concluded to be 3.1% \u00b1 0.2% and unrelated to AVM volume but influenced by its location, with the highest risk for centrally located AVMs. The hemorrhage risk was found to be significantly higher for females in their fertile years.CONCLUSIONSThe present methodology allowed the authors to determine the average annual risk for the first AVM hemorrhage at 3.1% \u00b1 0.2% without the need for individual patient follow-up. This methodology has potential also for other similar types of investigations. The conclusion that centrally located AVMs carry a higher risk was confirmed by follow-up information. Follow-up information was also used to conclude that pregnancy causes a substantially greater AVM hemorrhage risk. The age distribution for AVM hemorrhage is incompatible with AVMs present at birth having the same hemorrhage risk as AVMs in adults. Plausibly, they instead develop in the early years of life, possibly with a lower hemorrhage risk during that time period.","_input_hash":-894110525,"_task_hash":655619847,"spans":[{"text":"methodology","start":436,"end":447,"pattern":-2114709687},{"text":"study","start":647,"end":652,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":838,"end":846,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":971,"end":979,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1089,"end":1097,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1195,"end":1203,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1245,"end":1253,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"methodology","start":1863,"end":1874,"pattern":-2114709687},{"text":"methodology","start":2032,"end":2043,"pattern":-2114709687}],"meta":{"pattern":"62, 2, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 62, 62"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706889002,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

Despite a strong relationship between these 2 important factors in population health, there are few studies quantifying the mortality risk associated with their co-occurrence in the general population. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality according to self-reported mental health problems and alcohol intake in the general population.\tWe followed 243,372 participants in Norwegian health surveys (1994-2002) through 2014 for all-cause and CVD mortality by data linkage to national registries. The mean (SD) age at the time of participation in the survey was 43.9 (10.6) years, and 47.8% were men. During a mean (SD) follow-up period of 16.7 (3.2) years, 6,587 participants died from CVD, and 21,376 died from all causes. Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs according to a mental health index (low, 1.00-1.50; high, 2.01-4.00; low score is favourable) based on the General Health Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and according to self-reported alcohol intake (low, <2; light, 2-11.99; moderate, 12-23.99; high, \u226524 grams/day). HRs were adjusted for age, sex, educational level, marital status, and CVD risk factors. Compared to a reference group with low mental health index score and low alcohol intake, HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality were 0.93 (0.89, 0.97; p = 0.001), 1.00 (0.92, 1.09; p = 0.926), and 1.14 (0.96, 1.35; p = 0.119) for low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. HRs (95% CIs) were 1.22 (1.14, 1.31; p < 0.001), 1.24 (1.15, 1.33; p < 0.001), 1.43 (1.23, 1.66; p < 0.001), and 2.29 (1.87, 2.80; p < 0.001) for high index score combined with low, light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. For CVD mortality, HRs (95% CIs) were 0.93 (0.86, 1.00; p = 0.058), 0.90 (0.76, 1.07; p = 0.225), and 0.95 (0.67, 1.33; p = 0.760) for a low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively, and 1.11 (0.98, 1.25; p = 0.102), 0.97 (0.83, 1.13; p = 0.689), 1.01 (0.71, 1.44; p = 0.956), and 1.78 (1.14, 2.78; p = 0.011) for high index score combined with low, light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. HRs for the combination of a high index score and high alcohol intake (HRs: 2.29 for all-cause and 1.78 for CVD mortality) were 64% (95% CI 53%, 74%; p < 0.001) and 69% (95% CI 42%, 97%; p < 0.001) higher than expected for all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, respectively, under the assumption of a multiplicative interaction structure. A limitation of our study is that the findings were based on average reported intake of alcohol without accounting for the drinking pattern.\tIn the general population, the mortality rates associated with more mental health problems and a high alcohol intake were increased when the risk factors occurred together.","_input_hash":-935787942,"_task_hash":-226843885,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":521,"end":526,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"score","start":1218,"end":1223,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"Questionnaire","start":1267,"end":1280,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"score","start":1578,"end":1583,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"score","start":1758,"end":1763,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"score","start":1991,"end":1996,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"score","start":2219,"end":2224,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"score","start":2437,"end":2442,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"score","start":2558,"end":2563,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"study","start":2878,"end":2883,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 60, 57, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706889048,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55","_session_id":"2024-02-02_16-18-55"}

What remains unknown is whether inner ear dysfunction can alter the brain to promote pathological behavior. Using molecular and behavioral assessments of mice that carry null or tissue-specific mutations of Slc12a2, we found that inner ear dysfunction causes motor hyperactivity by increasing in the nucleus accumbens the levels of phosphorylated adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein (pCREB) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), key mediators of neurotransmitter signaling and plasticity. Hyperactivity was remedied by local administration of the pERK inhibitor SL327. These findings reveal that a sensory impairment, such as inner ear dysfunction, can induce specific molecular changes in the brain that cause maladaptive behaviors, such as hyperactivity, that have been traditionally considered exclusively of cerebral origin.","_input_hash":649340803,"_task_hash":-1103763704,"spans":[{"text":"prevalence","start":122,"end":132,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"mice","start":388,"end":392,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"53, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706895293,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33","_session_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33"}

How this mutation leads to these neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Here, we show using patient stem cell-derived motor neurons that the repeat expansion impairs microtubule-based transport, a process critical for neuronal survival. Cargo transport defects are recapitulated by treating neurons from healthy individuals with proline-arginine and glycine-arginine dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced from the repeat expansion. Both arginine-rich DPRs similarly inhibit axonal trafficking in adult Drosophila neurons in vivo. Physical interaction studies demonstrate that arginine-rich DPRs associate with motor complexes and the unstructured tubulin tails of microtubules. Single-molecule imaging reveals that microtubule-bound arginine-rich DPRs directly impede translocation of purified dynein and kinesin-1 motor complexes. Collectively, our study implicates inhibitory interactions of arginine-rich DPRs with axonal transport machinery in C9orf72-associated ALS/FTD and thereby points to potential therapeutic strategies.","_input_hash":-739020825,"_task_hash":-1727419868,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":1166,"end":1171,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1323,"end":1334,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706895338,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33","_session_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33"}

A total of 171 patients had taken melatonin according to our chronobiotic protocol (2 mg, \u22656 months, always-at-the-same-clock time, 10-11pm, corrected for chronotype), 13 had applied melatonin for about 1-3 months, and 25 underwent mixed treatments. In total, 1529 clinical evaluations were performed, including Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and a newly developed RBD symptom severity scale (Ikelos-RS), analyzed using linear mixed models. Validation of Ikelos-RS showed excellent inter-rater reliability (\u03c1 = 0.9, P < .001), test-retest reliability (\u03c1 = 0.9, P < .001) and convergent validity (\u03c1 = 0.9, P < .001). With melatonin, RBD symptom severity gradually improved over the first 4 weeks of treatment (Ikelos-RS: 6.1 vs. 2.5; CGI Severity: 5.7 vs. 3.2) and remained stably improved (mean follow-up 4.2 \u00b1 3.1years; range: 0.6-21.7years). Initial response was slowed to up to 3 months with melatonin-suppressing (betablockers) or REM sleep spoiling co-medication (antidepressants) and failed with inadequately timed melatonin intake. When melatonin was discontinued after 6 months, symptoms remained stably improved (mean follow-up after discontinuation of 4.9 \u00b1 2.5years; range: 0.6-9.2). When administered only 1-3 months, RBD symptoms gradually returned. Without any melatonin, RBD symptoms persisted and did not wear off over time. Clock-timed, low-dose, long-term melatonin treatment in patients with iRBD appears to be associated with the improvement of symptoms. The outlasting improvement over years questions a pure symptomatic effect. Clock-time dependency challenges existing prescription guidelines for melatonin.","_input_hash":2001989810,"_task_hash":1640978272,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":339,"end":347,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":391,"end":399,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"observational","start":437,"end":450,"pattern":232030698},{"text":"cohort","start":451,"end":457,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"study","start":458,"end":463,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":480,"end":488,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1864,"end":1872,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 80, 1, 2, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706895361,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33","_session_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33"}

This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.\tThe hallmark symptom of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is acute orthostatic headache; however, clinical presentations can be heterogeneous. New evidence shows that lumbar puncture is not always necessary or sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Some patients may have normal opening pressure, which suggests that insufficiency of CSF volume (hypovolemia) rather than CSF pressure might be the underlying mechanism. Several neuroimaging modalities can aid in diagnosis and localization of the CSF leakage, including brain MRI, spinal MRI, CT myelography, digital subtraction myelography, and radionuclide cisternography. Complications, such as subdural hematoma, can lead to a change in the headache pattern and potentially life-threatening consequences. Conservative treatments, such as fluid supplementation, can provide temporary relief; however, epidural blood patches, especially targeted ones, are more effective and definitive. For patients with refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension, surgical repair of spinal CSF leakages should be considered.\tBrain and spinal MRIs are important for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

We have thus compared the effects of a single hydroxydopamine bilateral striatal lesion (SB-hydroxydopamine) with those of a double hydroxydopamine bilateral lesion (DB-hydroxydopamine) at the same dose (16 microg/striatum) by HPLC determination of dopamine and 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (dopac) levels in the striatum. Two weeks after neurosurgery, SB-hydroxydopamine and DB-hydroxydopamine induced dopaminergic depletion of at least 81% compared with control groups. After eight weeks striatal dopaminergic depletion was only 60.97% in SB-hydroxydopamine rats, suggesting a compensatory phenomenon, whereas in DB-hydroxydopamine rats dopaminergic loss was stable at 88%. For the DB-hydroxydopamine group the dopac/dopamine ratio was significantly increased at week 2 only, whereas no significant change was observed for other groups. This increase might be explained by increased dopamine turnover.

{"pmid":"17524565","text":"Neuroscience^\nFunctional recovery in rats with ischemic paraplegia after spinal grafting of human spinal stem cells.^\nTransient spinal cord ischemia in humans can lead to the development of permanent paraplegia with prominent spasticity and rigidity. Histopathological analyses of spinal cords in animals with ischemic spastic paraplegia show a selective loss of small inhibitory interneurons in previously ischemic segments but with a continuing presence of ventral alpha-motoneurons and descending cortico-spinal and rubro-spinal projections. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of human spinal stem cells (hSSCs) implanted spinally in rats with fully developed ischemic paraplegia on the recovery of motor function and corresponding changes in motor evoked potentials. In addition the optimal time frame for cell grafting after ischemia and the optimal dosing of grafted cells were also studied. Spinal cord ischemia was induced for 10 min using aortic occlusion and systemic hypotension. In the functional recovery study, hSSCs (10,000-30,000 cells/0.5 mul/injection) were grafted into spinal central gray matter of L2-L5 segments at 21 days after ischemia. Animals were immunosuppressed with Prograf (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg) for the duration of the study. After cell grafting the recovery of motor function was assessed periodically using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system and correlated with the recovery of motor evoked potentials. At predetermined times after grafting (2-12 weeks), animals were perfusion-fixed and the survival, and maturation of implanted cells were analyzed using antibodies recognizing human-specific antigens: nuclear protein (hNUMA), neural cell adhesion molecule (hMOC), neuron-specific enolase (hNSE) and synapthophysin (hSYN) as well as the non-human specific antibodies TUJ1, GFAP, GABA, GAD65 and GLYT2. After cell grafting a time-dependent improvement in motor function and suppression of spasticity and rigidity was seen and this improvement correlated with the recovery of motor evoked potentials. Immunohistochemical analysis of grafted lumbar segments at 8 and 12 weeks after grafting revealed intense hNSE immunoreactivity, an extensive axo-dendritic outgrowth as well as rostrocaudal and dorsoventral migration of implanted hNUMA-positive cells. An intense hSYN immunoreactivity was identified within the grafts and in the vicinity of persisting alpha-motoneurons. On average, 64% of hSYN terminals were GAD65 immunoreactive which corresponded to GABA immunoreactivity identified in 40-45% of hNUMA-positive grafted cells. The most robust survival of grafted cells was seen when cells were grafted 21 days after ischemia. As defined by cell survival and laminar distribution, the optimal dose of injected cells was 10,000-30,000 cells per injection. These data indicate that spinal grafting of hSSCs can represent an effective therapy for patients with spinal ischemic paraplegia.","_input_hash":-843241477,"_task_hash":700057337,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":92,"end":97,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":568,"end":573,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"human","start":603,"end":608,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":621,"end":626,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":893,"end":898,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":1038,"end":1043,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1269,"end":1274,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cells","start":1601,"end":1606,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"human","start":1650,"end":1655,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":1814,"end":1819,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":2317,"end":2322,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":2594,"end":2599,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":2637,"end":2642,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":2657,"end":2662,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":2783,"end":2788,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":2807,"end":2812,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapy","start":2905,"end":2912,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":2917,"end":2925,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 2, 0, 70, 70, 2, 2, 70, 0, 0, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 46, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706895578,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33","_session_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33"}

OPC differentiation requires significant genetic reprogramming, implicating chromatin remodeling. Mounting evidence indicates that chromatin remodelers play important roles during normal development and their mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental defects, with CHD7 haploinsuficiency being the cause of CHARGE syndrome and CHD8 being one of the strongest autism spectrum disorder (ASD) high-risk-associated genes. Herein, we report on uncharacterized functions of the chromatin remodelers Chd7 and Chd8 in OPCs. Their OPC-chromatin binding profile, combined with transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analyses of Chd7-deleted OPCs, demonstrates that Chd7 protects nonproliferative OPCs from apoptosis by chromatin closing and transcriptional repression of p53 Furthermore, Chd7 controls OPC differentiation through chromatin opening and transcriptional activation of key regulators, including Sox10, Nkx2.2, and Gpr17 However, Chd7 is dispensable for oligodendrocyte stage progression, consistent with Chd8 compensatory function, as suggested by their common chromatin-binding profiles and genetic interaction. Finally, CHD7 and CHD8 bind in OPCs to a majority of ASD risk-associated genes, suggesting an implication of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in ASD neurological defects. Our results thus offer new avenues to understand and modulate the CHD7 and CHD8 functions in normal development and disease.","_input_hash":1247442230,"_task_hash":371453398,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":211,"end":216,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":258,"end":263,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"genes","start":838,"end":843,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"report","start":856,"end":862,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"genes","start":1619,"end":1624,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"cells","start":1679,"end":1684,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 70, 78, 36, 78, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706895726,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33","_session_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33"}

At night, she was admitted to a hospital as emergency case. With further increase of intracranial pressure, a craniotomy was done and a hemorrhage was removed. Histologically, a bleeding of a cavernous hemangioma was found. The patient appealed to the fact-finding board for medical liability questions because she had not been admitted to a hospital immediately after the CCT. Therefore, surgery was done delayed.

Therefore, we investigated the influence of acute hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia induced by glucose or insulin infusion on neuronal and humoral control of vascular tone in rats. Euglycemic male Wistar rats were pithed under anesthesia and arterial blood pressure was measured. Changes in vascular responses to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and intravenous bolus injections of noradrenaline, angiotensin II, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were studied by infusing various concentrations of glucose or insulin. Continuous glucose infusion, which increased both blood glucose and serum insulin levels, significantly augmented adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses to SCS without affecting pressor responses to injection of noradrenaline or angiotensin II. In pithed rats with artificially increased blood pressure and blockade of autonomic outflow, glucose infusion attenuated CGRPergic nerve-depressor responses to SCS without affecting depressor responses to injection of CGRP, acetylcholine or SNP. In pithed rats treated with octreotide, which increased blood glucose without increasing serum insulin levels, glucose infusion caused only significant augmentation of adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses. Combined infusion of insulin and glucose, which resulted in increased serum insulin levels with euglycemia, significantly augmented adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses and attenuated CGRPergic nerve-mediated depressor responses. The present results suggest that acute hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia increase adrenergic nerve-mediated vasoconstriction, which in turn blunts CGRPergic nerve function, and that the increase in plasma insulin concentration associated with hyperglycemia may be responsible for the alteration of neuronal vascular regulation.","_input_hash":-1631764351,"_task_hash":1670537222,"spans":[{"text":"vascular","start":578,"end":586,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"vascular","start":711,"end":719,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"vascular","start":2240,"end":2248,"pattern":-60508792}],"meta":{"pattern":"66, 66, 66"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706896037,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33","_session_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33"}

{"pmid":"22440072","text":"Behavior therapy^\nMindfulness-based cognitive therapy improves emotional reactivity to social stress: results from a randomized controlled trial.^\nThe high likelihood of recurrence in depression is linked to a progressive increase in emotional reactivity to stress (stress sensitization). Mindfulness-based therapies teach mindfulness skills designed to decrease emotional reactivity in the face of negative affect-producing stressors. The primary aim of the current study was to assess whether Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is efficacious in reducing emotional reactivity to social evaluative threat in a clinical sample with recurrent depression. A secondary aim was to assess whether improvement in emotional reactivity mediates improvements in depressive symptoms. Fifty-two individuals with partially remitted depression were randomized into an 8-week MBCT course or a waitlist control condition. All participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) before and after the 8-week trial period. Emotional reactivity to stress was assessed with the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory at several time points before, during, and after the stressor. MBCT was associated with decreased emotional reactivity to social stress, specifically during the recovery (post-stressor) phase of the TSST. Waitlist controls showed an increase in anticipatory (pre-stressor) anxiety that was absent in the MBCT group. Improvements in emotional reactivity partially mediated improvements in depressive symptoms. Limitations include small sample size, lack of objective or treatment adherence measures, and non-generalizability to more severely depressed populations. Given that emotional reactivity to stress is an important psychopathological process underlying the chronic and recurrent nature of depression, these findings suggest that mindfulness skills are important in adaptive emotion regulation when coping with stress.","_input_hash":1872694368,"_task_hash":2047567436,"spans":[{"text":"therapy","start":46,"end":53,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"randomized","start":117,"end":127,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":128,"end":138,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"study","start":467,"end":472,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"Therapy","start":523,"end":530,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"randomized","start":844,"end":854,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"trial","start":1006,"end":1011,"pattern":-622671649}],"meta":{"pattern":"46, 18, 27, 2, 46, 18, 73"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706896089,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33","_session_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33"}

Patients who underwent closed treatment of a distal fibula fracture served as a comparative group. We evaluated peritreatment and posttreatment opioid prescription fills. The primary outcome, new persistent opioid use, was defined as opioid prescription fulfillment between 91 and 180 days after the procedure. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of patient factors, and the differences of the effect were tested using Wald statistics. The adjusted persistent use rates were calculated. A total of 13\u2009088 patients underwent treatment of an ankle fracture and filled a peritreatment opioid prescription.\tWhen compared with closed treatment of a distal fibula fracture, only 2 surgical treatment subtypes demonstrated significantly increased rates of persistent use compared with the closed treatment group: open treatment of bimalleolar ankle fracture (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.58; P = .002) and open treatment of trimalleolar ankle fracture with fixation of posterior lip (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04-2.07; P = .027).

Factors independently associated with new persistent opioid use included mental health disorders, comorbid conditions, tobacco use, and female sex.\tAll ankle fracture treatment groups demonstrated high rates of new persistent opioid use, and persistent use was not directly linked to injury severity.

Two patients underwent epidural blood patch (EBP) for total of three times. The average volumes of the blood used for EBP were 30 ml (case 1) and 24 ml (case 2). The procedure improved various symptoms except for neck stiffness and dizziness. EBP had led to low back pain, which disappeared within three days. CSF leak vanished in RNC after EBP.

Recently developed theoretical models for agitation in dementia require new interpretation and conceptualization of agitation.\tMorse's method of critical appraisal of the literature was used.

The analysis included 86 empirical or theoretical papers and one book.\tA transition from the observer's perspective to the patient's perspective in the interpretation of agitation was found. Five critical attributes of agitation in dementia were identified: excessive, inappropriate, repetitive, non-specific and observable. Patient factors, interpersonal factors, environmental factors and restraint were identified as precipitating antecedents. Mediating antecedents included discomfort, unmet need and misinterpretation. Consequences of agitation were identified at the levels of patient, caregiver and others.\tThis transition in perspectives has important implications as it can change health providers' attitudes and responses to agitation and lead to patient-focused and individualized care.

{"pmid":"1283445","text":"Neurobiology of aging^\nReduced GAP-43 message levels are associated with increased neurofibrillary tangle density in the frontal association cortex (area 9) in Alzheimer's disease.^\nWe previously suggested the hypothesis that defective neuronal plasticity is a major neurobiological deficit causing the dementia of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used message levels of the growth-associated protein, GAP-43, as a marker of axonal plasticity to examine the hypothesis of defective neuronal plasticity in AD. When all AD cases are combined, the average level of GAP-43 message in area 9 of the AD frontal association cortex was not significantly different from the level in the comparably aged control cortex. Differentiation of AD cases on the basis of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) density revealed that in AD cases with high tangle density average GAP-43 message level was reduced fivefold relative to levels in AD cases with low NFT density. AD cases with low neurofibrillary tangle density had levels of GAP-43 message that were not significantly different from the levels of normal controls. Differentiation of AD cases on the basis of neuritic plaque density did not indicate as strong a relationship to GAP-43 message level. The association between neurofibrillary tangle density and GAP-43 message level suggests the hypothesis that neurofibrillary tangles may reduce GAP-43 expression. Data of others show a relationship between high NFT density and reduced levels of synaptophysin-like immunoreactivity and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism. These data combine to suggest a set of AD cases with high NFT density, reduced axonal plasticity, reduced synaptic density, and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism--all variables that may be directly related to the functioning of the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","_input_hash":1954944182,"_task_hash":-1537228924,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706896323,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33","_session_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33"}

Lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein is a consistent feature of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob at autopsy and has also been demonstrated in the pre-clinical phase. Immunohistochemical accumulation of prion protein in the lymphoreticular system remains the only technique that has been shown to predict neurological disease reliably in animal prion disorders. In this study, immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate the presence of prion protein, with monoclonal antibodies KG9 and 3F4, in surgically removed tonsillectomy and appendicectomy specimens. The samples were collected from histopathology departments across the UK and anonymised prior to testing. Samples were tested from 16 703 patients (14 964 appendectomies, 1739 tonsillectomies), approximately 60% of whom were from the age group 20-29 years at operation. Twenty-five per cent of the samples were excluded from the final analyses because they contained inadequate amounts of lymphoid tissue. Three appendicectomy samples showed lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein, giving an estimated prevalence of 3/12 674 or 237 per million (95% CI 49-692 per million). The pattern of lymphoreticular accumulation in two of these samples was dissimilar from that seen in known cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Although it is uncertain whether immunohistochemical accumulation of prion protein in the lymphoreticular system is specific for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, it has not been described in any other disease, including other forms of human prion disease or a range of inflammatory and infective conditions. These findings reinforce the importance of measures taken by the UK Department of Health to reduce the risk of spread of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob via blood products and surgical instruments, and of the urgency to proceed with large-scale screening of fresh tonsil specimens for the presence of prion protein.","_input_hash":-403927134,"_task_hash":-1662913169,"spans":[{"text":"Prevalence","start":26,"end":36,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"study","start":111,"end":116,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"aims","start":117,"end":121,"pattern":-2080524606},{"text":"animal","start":636,"end":642,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"study","start":668,"end":673,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":995,"end":1003,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"prevalence","start":1366,"end":1376,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"human","start":1825,"end":1830,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"53, 2, 43, 67, 2, 34, 53, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706896338,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33","_session_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33"}

Both Children With and Without Autism Commonly Align Their Language With That of Their Caregivers.^\nLinguistic repetitions in children are conceptualized as negative in children with autism - echolalia, without communicative purpose - and positive in typically developing (TD) children - linguistic alignment involved in shared engagement, common ground and language acquisition. To investigate this apparent contradiction we analyzed spontaneous speech in 67 parent-child dyads from a longitudinal corpus (30 minutes of play activities at 6 visits over 2 years). We included 32 children with autism and 35 linguistically matched TD children (mean age at recruitment 32.76 and 20.27 months). We found a small number of exact repetitions in both groups (roughly 1% of utterances across visits), which increased over time in children with autism and decreased in the TD group. Partial repetitions were much more frequent: children reused caregivers' words at high rates regardless of diagnostic group (24% of utterances at first visit), and this increased in frequency (but not level) over time, faster for TD children (at final visit: 33% for autism, 40% for TD). The same happened for partial repetition of syntax and semantic alignment. However, chance alignment (as measured by surrogate pairs) also increased and findings for developmental changes were reliable only for syntactic and semantic alignment. Children with richer linguistic abilities also displayed a higher tendency to partially re-use their caregivers' language (alignment rates and semantic alignment). This highlights that all children commonly re-used the words, syntax, and topics of their caregivers, albeit with some quantitative differences, and that most repetition was at least potentially productive, with repeated language being re-contextualized and integrated with non-repeated language. The salience of echolalia in ASD might be partially explained by slight differences in frequency, amplified by lower semantic alignment, persistence over time, and expectations of echolalia. More in-depth qualitative and quantitative analyses of how repetitions are used and received in context are needed.","_input_hash":906721544,"_task_hash":874384270,"spans":[{"text":"longitudinal","start":522,"end":534,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1018,"end":1028,"pattern":-808942259}],"meta":{"pattern":"52, 55"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706896403,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33","_session_id":"2024-02-02_18-30-33"}

In transient ischemia model, rats were subjected to a 1.5-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The administration of PF (2.5 and 5 mg kg(-1), s.c.) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both neurological impairment and the histologically measured infarction volume. Similar results were also obtained when PF (2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was given in permanent ischemia model. The neuroprotective effect of PF (10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was abolished by pretreatment of DPCPX (0.25 mg kg(-1), s.c.), a selective adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) antagonist. PF (10, 40, and 160 mg kg(-1), i.v.) had no effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rates (HR) in the conscious rat. Additionally, PF (10(-3) mol l(-1)) had no effect on noradrenaline- (NA-) or high K+ concentration-induced contractions of isolated rabbit primary artery. In competitive binding experiments, PF did not compete with the binding of [3H]DPCPX, but displaced the binding of [3H]NECA to the membrane preparation of rat cerebral cortex. This binding manner was distinguished from the classical A1R agonists. The results demonstrated that activation of A1R might be involved in PF-induced neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia in rat. However, PF had no 'well-known' cardiovascular side effects of classical A1R agonists. The results suggest that PF might have the potential therapeutic value as an anti-stroke drug.","_input_hash":-275582942,"_task_hash":1644032015,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":93,"end":96,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"rat","start":1101,"end":1104,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"rabbit","start":1238,"end":1244,"pattern":1055392994},{"text":"rat","start":1416,"end":1419,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"rat","start":1628,"end":1631,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1773,"end":1784,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 92, 91, 92, 92, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707054249,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

Recent studies revealed that Hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated glycolysis is one of the sources, as the association of chemoresistance and the expression of HK2 was confirmed in multiple cancers. However, there has been little knowledge of the functional contribution of HK2 to TMZ resistance in GBM. In our study, we found that HK2 expression is crucial for GBM proliferation and chemoresistance. In contrast to the healthy brain, HK2 expression is much higher in human GBM, especially in those patients with GBM recurrence. High HK2 expression is negatively related to the overall survival in GBM patients. HK2 depletion in GBM cells suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to TMZ-induced apoptosis. Both HK2-mediated glycolysis and mitochondria permeability transition pore opening (MPTP) were associated with its function in chemoresistance. Furthermore, we also revealed that the abnormal expression of HK2 was modulated by the expression of HOTAIR, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The absence of HOTAIR in GBM cells suppressed the HK2 expression in protein and mRNA level and, therefore, inhibited the cell proliferation and enhanced the cytotoxicity of TMZ both in vivo and in vitro. HOTAIR promoted the expression of HK2 by targeting mir-125, which suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased the TMZ-induced apoptosis. These findings shed light on a new therapeutic strategy in modulating HOTAIR/miR-125, which may interfere with the expression of HK2, and enhance the therapeutic sensitivity of GBM to TMZ.","_input_hash":-275731689,"_task_hash":-2051922587,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":125,"end":130,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":585,"end":590,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"human","start":742,"end":747,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"patients","start":773,"end":781,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":876,"end":884,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"cells","start":907,"end":912,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1317,"end":1322,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1672,"end":1683,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1787,"end":1798,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 2, 0, 34, 34, 70, 70, 47, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707054376,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

{"pmid":"19734013","text":"Schizophrenia research^\nThe impact of context processing deficits on task-switching performance in schizophrenia.^\nThe prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been described as important for maintaining and implementing contextual information in the service of goal-oriented behavior. Accordingly, impairments in context processing are thought to underlie cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, a clinical disorder that has been linked to PFC dysfunction (Servan-Schreiber et al., 1996). However, task switching, a cognitive ability linked to PFC function, has not been consistently impaired in schizophrenia. In this experiment, we assessed whether task-switching performance would be selectively impaired for patients when context demands were high. In the rule-switching condition, a switch required the updating of the relevant task response rules whereas perceptual switching did not entail a switching of contextual information. Instead, a perceptual switch entailed a shift of visuospatial attention to the relevant feature. A second goal was to determine whether potential deficits in context switching would be observed in schizophrenia even in situations when these patients do not need to overcome a prepotent response. Studies of context processing have typically required patients with schizophrenia to use contextual rules to overcome prepotent response tendencies whereas our switching paradigm did not require the inhibition of a competing response. Patients were much slower to switch tasks than controls when contextual rules switched from one trial to the next whereas their performance was intact when the switch occurred between different feature sets and contextual demands were low. Our results demonstrate that context processing deficits are observable in schizophrenia even when there is no prepotent response tendency to inhibit. Moreover, our results suggest that PFC impairments influence performance primarily when patients are required to switch the application of one explicit rule to another.","_input_hash":793043945,"_task_hash":1285328117,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":710,"end":718,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1175,"end":1183,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1284,"end":1292,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Patients","start":1465,"end":1473,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"trial","start":1561,"end":1566,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"patients","start":1944,"end":1952,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 34, 34, 73, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707054400,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

Its pathophysiology remains unclear. PANDAS has been proposed to result from cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against GABHS with brain antigens, but the targets of these antibodies are unclear and may be heterogeneous. We developed an in vivo assay in mice to characterize the cellular targets of antibodies in serum from individuals with PANDAS. We focus on striatal interneurons, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of tic disorders. Sera from children with well-characterized PANDAS (n = 5) from a previously described clinical trial (NCT01281969), and matched controls, were infused into the striatum of mice; antibody binding to interneurons was characterized using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Antibodies from children with PANDAS bound to \u223c80% of cholinergic interneurons, significantly higher than the <50% binding seen with matched healthy controls. There was no elevated binding to two different populations of GABAergic interneurons (PV and nNOS-positive), confirming the specificity of this phenomenon. Elevated binding to cholinergic interneurons resolved in parallel with symptom improvement after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Antibody-mediated dysregulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons may be a locus of pathology in PANDAS. Future clarification of the functional consequences of this specific binding may identify new opportunities for intervention in children with this condition.","_input_hash":2061677408,"_task_hash":-331278629,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":76,"end":84,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"mice","start":669,"end":673,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"trial","start":959,"end":964,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"mice","start":1036,"end":1040,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"intervention","start":1818,"end":1830,"pattern":-2001382570}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 82, 73, 82, 48"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707054536,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

These infants and toddlers typically arrive home with developmental delays and a lack of proficiency in any language, making it difficult to make objective service delivery decisions. This article reports the results of speech and language assessments for a group of 28 children aged 12 to 24 months who were newly adopted from Eastern Europe. Most of the children did well, with average English language standard scores within normal limits on the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scale-Developmental Profile.

{"pmid":"21951913","text":"Molecular brain^\nTransplantation of human neural stem/progenitor cells overexpressing galectin-1 improves functional recovery from focal brain ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil.^\nTransplantation of human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSPCs) is a promising method to regenerate tissue from damage and recover function in various neurological diseases including brain ischemia. Galectin-1(Gal1) is a lectin that is expressed in damaged brain areas after ischemia. Here, we characterized the detailed Gal1 expression pattern in an animal model of brain ischemia. After brain ischemia, Gal1 was expressed in reactive astrocytes within and around the infarcted region, and its expression diminished over time. Previously, we showed that infusion of human Gal1 protein (hGal1) resulted in functional recovery after brain ischemia but failed to reduce the volume of the ischemic region. This prompted us to examine whether the combination of hNSPCs-transplantation and stable delivery of hGal1 around the ischemic region could reduce the ischemic volume and promote better functional recovery after brain ischemia. In this study, we transplanted hNSPCs that stably overexpressed hGal1 (hGal1-hNSPCs) in a model of unilateral focal brain ischemia using Mongolian gerbils. Indeed, we found that transplantation of hGal1-hNSPCs both reduced the ischemic volume and improved deficits in motor function after brain ischemia to a greater extent than the transplantation of hNSPCs alone. This study provides evidence for a potential application of hGal1 with hNSPCs-transplantation in the treatment of brain ischemia.","_input_hash":1985889213,"_task_hash":-48313863,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":36,"end":41,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":65,"end":70,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"human","start":197,"end":202,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":226,"end":231,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"animal","start":528,"end":534,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"human","start":744,"end":749,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":1116,"end":1121,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1479,"end":1484,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 70, 0, 70, 67, 0, 2, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707054708,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}
{"pmid":"30875614","text":"Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior^\nEarly prediction of long-term tactile object recognition performance after sensorimotor stroke.^\nUntil now tactile agnosia has been reported only in small, but detailed cross-sectional case studies. Here we show that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of early diffusion-weighted lesion maps can be used to accurately predict long-term recovery of tactile object recognition (TOR) in 35 subjects with varying hand skill impairment and associated specific daily activity limitation after cortical sensori-motor stroke. Multiple regression analysis revealed the essentially dysfunctional subprocesses for object recognition in the specifically impaired subjects, i.e., grasping as determined by a subtest of Jebsen Taylor hand function test, and perception of macrogeometrical object properties. The Gaussian process regression of MVPA represents a function that relates a selection of lesioned voxels as input variables to TOR performance scores as target variables. On the behavioural level, patients fell into three recovery subgroups, depending on TOR performance over the observation period. Only baseline motor hand skill and shape discrimination were significantly correlated with the TOR trajectories. To define functionally meaningful voxels, we combined information from MVPA of lesion maps and a priori knowledge of regions of interest derived from a data bank for shape recognition. A high significance for the predicted TOR performances over nine months could be verified by permutation tests, leading us to expect that the model generalises to larger patient cohorts with first cortical ischemic stroke. The lesion sites of the persistently impaired subjects exhibited an overlap with critical areas related to the MVPA prediction map in the cytoarchitectonic areas PFt of inferior parietal lobule and OP1 of parietal operculum which are associated with higher order sensory processing. This ultimate check corroborated the significance of the MVPA map for the prediction of tactile object recognition. The clinical implication of our study is that neuroimaging data acquired immediately after first stroke could facilitate individual forecasting of post-stroke recovery.","_input_hash":488172704,"_task_hash":1910930769,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":33,"end":38,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"case","start":260,"end":264,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"patients","start":1068,"end":1076,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":2123,"end":2128,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 35, 34, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707054727,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

Initially, we identified analog 4m that had good in vitro properties but low plasma and brain exposure in a mouse PK experiment due to short plasma stability; this was overcome by reversing the amide bond and changing the heterocycle. Thiazole 27 showed excellent in vitro properties and a promising mouse PK profile, making it suitable for in vivo testing. This series post-translationally stabilizes the SMN protein, unrelated to global proteasome or autophagy inhibition, revealing a novel therapeutic mechanism that should complement other modalities for treatment of SMA.","_input_hash":318691572,"_task_hash":-2068119311,"spans":[{"text":"mouse","start":669,"end":674,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mouse","start":861,"end":866,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1054,"end":1065,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"81, 81, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707055194,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

Here we use such a model, termed APPsi:tTA, to determine what phenotypes persist in mice with high amyloid burden after new production of APP/A\u03b2 has been suppressed. We find that 12- to 13-month-old APPsi:tTA mice are impaired in cognitive tasks that assess short- and long-term memories. Acutely suppressing new APPsi/A\u03b2 production produced highly significant improvements in performing short-term spatial memory tasks, which upon continued suppression translated to superior performance in more demanding tasks that assess long-term spatial memory and working memory. Deficits in episodic-like memory and cognitive flexibility, however, were more persistent. Arresting mutant APPsi production caused a rapid decline in the brain levels of soluble APP ectodomains, full-length APP, and APP C-terminal fragments. As expected, amyloid deposits persisted after new APP/A\u03b2 production was inhibited, whereas, unexpectedly, we detected persistent pools of solubilizable, relatively mobile, A\u03b242. Additionally, we observed persistent levels of A\u03b2-immunoreactive entities that were of a size consistent with SDS-resistant oligomeric assemblies. Thus, in this model with significant amyloid pathology, a rapid amelioration of cognitive deficits was observed despite persistent levels of oligomeric A\u03b2 assemblies and low, but detectable solubilizable A\u03b242 peptides. These findings implicate complex relationships between accumulating A\u03b2 and activities of APP, soluble APP ectodomains, and/or APP C-terminal fragments in mediating cognitive deficits in this model of amyloidosis.","_input_hash":1185416499,"_task_hash":701475776,"spans":[{"text":"Transgenic","start":180,"end":190,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"mice","start":191,"end":195,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":528,"end":532,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":653,"end":657,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"77, 82, 82, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707055412,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

The cause and mechanisms underlying the demise of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons are ill-defined, but interactions between genes and environmental factors are recognized to play a critical role in modulating the vulnerability to PD. Current evidence points to reactive glia as a pivotal factor in PD pathophysiology, playing both protective and destructive roles. Here, the contribution of reactive astrocytes and their ability to modulate DAergic neurodegeneration, neuroprotection and neurorepair in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) rodent model of PD will be discussed in the light of novel emerging evidence implicating wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (Wnt)/\u03b2-catenin signaling as a strong candidate in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic plasticity. In this work, we highlight an intrinsic Wnt1/frizzled-1/\u03b2-catenin tone that critically contributes to the survival and protection of adult midbrain DAergic neurons, with potential implications for drug design or drug action in PD. The dynamic interplay between astrocyte-derived factors and neurogenic signals in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic neurotoxicity and repair will be summarized, together with recent findings showing a critical role of glia-neural stem/progenitor cell (NPC) interactions aimed at overcoming neurodegeneration and inducing neurorestoration.

Extended family members were tested by polymerase chain reaction amplification of junction fragments. DOCK4 dosage was measured in additional samples using SNP arrays. Since QuantiSNP analysis identified a novel CNTNAP5 microdeletion in the same affected sibling pair, this gene was sequenced in 143 additional ASD families. Further polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis included 380 ASD cases and suitable control subjects.\tThe maternally inherited microdeletion encompassed chr7:110,663,978-111,257,682 and led to a DOCK4-IMMP2L fusion transcript.

However, six of nine individuals with this microdeletion had poor reading ability, which prompted us to screen 606 other dyslexia cases.

Baseline period from January 1 to March 8, 2020, was compared with the COVID period from March 9, to April 2, 2020. The variables included were total daily stroke alerts across the hospital emergency departments, thrombolysis, time to presentation, stroke severity, time from door-to-imaging, time from door-to-needle in thrombolysis, and time from door-to-puncture in thrombectomy. The 2 time periods were compared using nonparametric statistics and Poisson regression.\tNine hundred two stroke alerts during the period across the emergency departments were analyzed. Total daily stroke alerts decreased from median, 10 (interquartile range, 8-13) during baseline period to median, 8 (interquartile range, 4-10, P=0.001) during COVID period. Time to presentation, stroke severity, and time to treatment were unchanged. COVID period was associated with decrease in stroke alerts with rate ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.28).

Since 2010, a growing number of reports in grey literature and anecdotal information among professionals have become available on NPS use among previously unaffected groups, such as people living in rural, socioeconomically deprived communities. In our research, we aimed to explore NPS use among these communities.\tWe conducted a mixed method research with convergent parallel design. Data collection took place in 2017 in marginalised communities in villages in two regions in Hungary, where 150 questionnaires were recorded and 50 interviews were conducted with current NPS users.\tAccording to the survey results, NPS is very easy to access, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist (SCRA) are easily bought in marginalised rural communities (79% found SCRA easy to obtain). Both SCRA and synthetic cathinones are used regularly; 57% of SCRA users and 37% of synthetic cathinone users used the respective substance at least once a week in the past 30 days. Besides NPS, sedative use (without prescription) and alcohol consumption are common among the respondents. 17% of the sample has already injected NPS. The overwhelming majority of the respondents rated regular consumption of NPS as 'very dangerous' (SCRA: 75%, synthetic cathinones 72%). NPS users have limited knowledge of consequences and the social and health treatment options available. Most themes in the interviews are associated with surviving stress, crisis and anxiety, as well as the wish to escape from insecurity and chaotic life. Positive effects of substance use (community, joy, energy) are rarely present.\tPeople who use drugs (PWUD) living in these rural communities face the consequences of the rural risk environment: easy access to NPS, inadequate access to services, poor labour market situation and attributions of marginalised groups, for example disaffiliation. NPS use is not a recreational activity in this population; individuals mainly use NPS to get away from reality, problems, pain, poverty and marginalisation. NPS use is a survival strategy. Effective responses have to address substance use and social integration; we need complex interventions addressing structural factors.","_input_hash":128194469,"_task_hash":-212219789,"spans":[{"text":"literature","start":306,"end":316,"pattern":-478699552}],"meta":{"pattern":"5"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707055858,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

Both domestic and foreign investments in the gaming sector bring in not only substantial revenues but also positive spillover effects on related sectors and even on the entire local economy. However, an over-expansion of commercial gambling may lead to deterioration in the terms of trade with an adverse impact on real income. If this situation persists, it would not be impossible for immiserizing growth to occur. As a highly profitable sector, casino gaming may enable its operators to diversify out of this risk if they invest retained profits in non-gaming sectors to cash in on the spillover effects it has created. The gaming-dominant economy can then be directed on a more balanced and sustainable growth path, and will become less susceptible to business cycles. Indeed, economic experiences in the world's major casino resorts are consistent basically with this argument for diversification. We believe that after the current global crisis fades away, economic growth and resulting surges in global demand for gambling services can provide further opportunities for the expansion of existing casino resorts and the development of new gaming markets.","_input_hash":-1819358834,"_task_hash":-1996547735,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707055886,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

Preventing microglial activation to inhibit neuroinflammation may become a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Guizhi Fuling capsule (GZFL) has a strong repression on inflammatory responses. Here, the presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, a well-established mouse model of AD, were divided into: WT mice (WT), WT mice+GZFL (WT+GZFL), PS cDKO mice (cDKO), and PS cDKO mice+GZFL (cDKO+GZFL). Mice in the WT+GZFL and cDKO+GZFL group were fed standard chow containing 2000 ppm GZFL for 90 days. After 60 days of GZFL treatment, mice were given to behavioral tests for 30 days in order to explore the effects of GZFL on cognitive and motor function. Then, mice were sacrificed for examining the effects of GZFL on inflammation. Furthermore, primary microglia were obtained from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats and pretreated with or without GZFL (50 \u03bcg/ml) for 1 h in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) stimulation to speculate whether the underlying mechanism of GZFL's anti-inflammatory potential was closely associated with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that GZFL has the ability to alleviate memory deficits in PS cDKO mice, which attributes to the improvement of neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. In addition, GZFL could inverse the tau hyperphosphorylation and the lessened expression of synaptic proteins in hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Furthermore, GZFL prevented LPS-induced neuroinflammatory responses in primary microglia by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. It is noteworthy that therapeutic effects of GZFL on memory impairment are depended on the inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses by the blockage of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, GZFL may be an effective compound Chinese medicine for the improvement and postponement of neurodegenerative progression in AD.","_input_hash":-7881948,"_task_hash":1953291219,"spans":[{"text":"knockout","start":190,"end":198,"pattern":100040093},{"text":"knockout","start":661,"end":669,"pattern":100040093},{"text":"mice","start":680,"end":684,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mouse","start":705,"end":710,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mice","start":746,"end":750,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":789,"end":793,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"Mice","start":837,"end":841,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":971,"end":975,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1098,"end":1102,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1684,"end":1688,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1965,"end":1969,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"therapeutic","start":2138,"end":2149,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"79, 79, 82, 81, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707056021,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

In this study, C57Bl/6J mice were injected intracerebrally with [3H]inositol, and poly-PI turnover in brain was assessed by determining the levels of labeled inositol monophosphates (IP1) accumulated after intraperitoneal injection of LiCl (6 meq/kg body weight) 4 hr before killing. Using this experimental protocol, acute ethanol administration (by gavage) resulted in time- and dose-dependent decreases in the levels of labeled IP1 in both cerebrum and cerebellum as compared with controls. The ethanol-induced decrease in labeled IP1 correlated well with the decrease in levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (as measured by the radioreceptor assay) and the increase in blood ethanol concentration. Despite a 4-fold higher accumulation of labeled IP1 in the cerebrum compared with the cerebellum, there were no major differences in the steady-state levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (based on tissue weight) in either brain region. Intraperitoneal injection of atropine (50 mg/kg) (a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist) to the lithium-treated mice resulted in a 34% decrease in labeled IP1 as compared with controls. This result suggests that a substantial proportion of the signals transduced were due to activation of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor.

Twenty of 30 patients (66%) receiving at least twice weekly poly-ICLC showed regression or stabilization of gadolinium-enhancing tumor, as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (median = 65% volume decrease).

{"pmid":"2921862","text":"The Journal of surgical research^\nContinuous intravenous ammonia infusion as a model for the study of hepatic encephalopathy in rabbits.^\nTo obtain a more precise pathophysiological evaluation of the role of ammonia in acute hepatic encephalopathy, we compared the plasma ammonia concentrations and electroencephalographic recordings (EEGs) of rabbits with surgically induced acute hepatic failure (AHF, n = 10) and normal rabbits administered an infusion of ammonium acetate (NH4-Ac, n = 7) over a 10-hr period. AHF was surgically induced by portocaval shunting followed by hepatic artery ligation 48 hr later. In the infusion group the dose of NH4-Ac, initially 0.78 mmol/kg/hr, was increased every 2 hr by 0.13 mmole/kg/hr during a 10-hour period to simulate the arterial NH3 concentrations observed in AHF. Ammonia levels in rabbits administered the NH4-Ac infusion were identical to those observed in AHF, with the exception of the higher initial value in the AHF group. Moreover, the mean rates of increase in grade of encephalopathy in the two groups were similar, although the EEG grades in the infusion group were significantly less at all time points. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a more pathophysiological approach to identification of the putative toxins in hepatic encephalopathy is feasible. Some of the EEG abnormalities of acute hepatic encephalopathy in rabbits are presumably due to hyperammonemia; the encephalopathy observed in AHF at zero time is probably caused by the previously constructed portocaval shunt via an undefined, but possibly also ammonia-related, mechanism.","_input_hash":-1934695665,"_task_hash":-1106626388,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":93,"end":98,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rabbits","start":344,"end":351,"pattern":737637839},{"text":"rabbits","start":423,"end":430,"pattern":737637839},{"text":"rabbits","start":829,"end":836,"pattern":737637839},{"text":"study","start":1182,"end":1187,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rabbits","start":1386,"end":1393,"pattern":737637839}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 90, 90, 90, 2, 90"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707056162,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

However, recent research suggests that focusing on pain status (i.e., the presence or absence of chronic pain) at treatment initiation may not reflect the clinical significance of pain over the long-term course of OUD. Reports of variability in chronic pain and its clinical significance over time have yet to be investigated in patients with prescription OUD. The present study examined variability in chronic pain status from entry into prescription OUD treatment through 3.5-year follow-up. Additionally, we examined the association between concurrent chronic pain and opioid use at three follow-up time points.\tThis secondary analysis (N\u202f=\u202f309) of a national, randomized, controlled trial of prescription OUD treatment used generalized estimating equations to assess variability in the prevalence of chronic pain from study entry to 3.5-year follow-up, and the association between chronic pain status and concurrent opioid use.\tFifty-three percent of participants reported variability in chronic pain status over time.

{"pmid":"35274469","text":"Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research^\nAttribution of intentions in autism spectrum disorder: A study of event-related potentials.^\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social cognition deficits, including difficulties inferring the intentions of others. Although deficits in attribution of intentions (AI) have been consistently replicated in ASD, their exact nature remains unexplored. Here we registered the electrophysiological correlates of a nonverbal social cognition task to investigate AI in autistic adults. Twenty-one male autistic adults and 30 male neurotypical volunteers performed a comic strips task depicting either intentional action (AI) or physical causality with or without human characters, while their electroencephalographic signal was recorded. Compared to neurotypical volunteers, autistic participants were significantly less accurate in correctly identifying congruence in the AI condition, but not in the physical causality conditions. In the AI condition a bilateral posterior positive event-related potential (ERP) occurred 200-400 ms post-stimulus (the ERP intention effect) in both groups. This waveform comprised a P200 and a P300 component, with the P200 component being larger for the AI condition in neurotypical volunteers but not in autistic individuals, who also showed a longer latency for this waveform. Group differences in amplitude of the ERP intention effect only became evident when we compared autistic participants to a subgroup of similarly performing neurotypical participants, suggesting that the atypical ERP waveform in ASD is an effect of group, rather than a marker of low-task performance. Together, these results suggest that the lower accuracy of the ASD group in the AI task may result from impaired early attentional processing and contextual integration of socially relevant cues. LAY SUMMARY: To understand why autistic people have difficulties in inferring others' intentions, we asked participants to judge the congruence of the endings of comic strips depicting either intentional actions (e.g., fetching a chair to reach for something) or situations solely following physical rules (e.g., an apple falling on someone's head), while their electrical brain activity was recorded. Autistic individuals had more difficulties in inferring intentions than neurotypical controls, which may reflect impaired attention and contextual integration of social cues.","_input_hash":-230705354,"_task_hash":-923843428,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":142,"end":147,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"human","start":755,"end":760,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"SUMMARY","start":1907,"end":1914,"pattern":915282476}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 0, 9"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707056600,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10","_session_id":"2024-02-04_14-40-10"}

The aim of this study was to evaluate influence of use of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) on extent of resection (EOR), clinical outcome, and survival in patients with preoperatively intended subtotal resection of GB.\tRetrospective assessment was performed in 3 neurosurgical centers (2008-2013). All patients with primary GB, unilocular growth, and adjuvant radiochemotherapy in whom subtotal resection was intended were included. Imaging data were pseudonymized and volumetrically assessed by a central reviewer. Clinical outcome was evaluated based on complications, new permanent neurologic deficits, and survival. Based on subtraction of potential EOR (as defined by reviewer) from effective EOR, EOR change (\u0394EOR) was calculated for each case. We calculated multivariate linear regressions to assess influence on effective EOR and \u0394EOR, binary regressions to assess influence on complications and new permanent neurologic deficits, and Cox regression models to assess survival.\tAssessment included 70 patients. In iMRI group, a significantly lower \u0394EOR (4% vs. 22%, P\u00a0= 0.008) was found. In linear regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, only iMRI influenced \u0394EOR significantly (P\u00a0= 0.03, odds ratio 0.27). In binary regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, effective EOR, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, none of the variables showed a significant difference concerning complications and new permanent neurologic deficits.

Because these disabling symptoms are generally not well tolerated by caregivers, patients with these symptoms tend to be institutionalized earlier than patients without them. The identification of protective and risk factors for neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD would facilitate the development of more specific treatments for these symptoms and thereby decrease morbidity and mortality in AD. The E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a well-documented risk factor for the development of AD. However, genetic association studies of the APOE 4 allele and BPS in AD have produced conflicting findings.\tThis study investigates the association between APOE and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a large sample of clinically well-characterized subjects with probable AD (n=790) who were systematically evaluated using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Behavioral Rating Scale for Dementia (BRSD).\tOur study found that hallucinations were significantly more likely to occur in subjects with no APO\u03954 alleles than in subjects with two \u03954 alleles (15% of subjects and 5% of subjects, respectively; p=.0066), whereas there was no association between the occurrence of delusions, aberrant motor behavior, or agitation and the number of \u03954 alleles. However, 94% of the subjects with hallucinations also had delusions (D+H).\tThese findings suggest that in AD the \u03954 allele is differentially associated with D+H but not delusions alone. This is consistent with the hypothesis that distinct psychotic subphenotypes may be associated with the APOE allele.","_input_hash":2096642916,"_task_hash":-1580045033,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":106,"end":114,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":252,"end":260,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":440,"end":448,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":511,"end":519,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":975,"end":980,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1298,"end":1303,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 34, 34, 2, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","config":{"choice_style":"single"},"accept":["Remaining"],"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707144841,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

To address this, Tg mouse model of AD, Tg-NSE/PS2m, which expresses human mutant PS2 in the brain, was chosen. Animals were subjected to treadmill exercise for 12 weeks from 24 months of age. The exercised mice were treadmill run at speed of 12 m/min, 60 min/day, 5 days/week on a 0% gradient for 3 months. Treadmill exercised mice improved cognitive function in water maze test. Treadmill exercised mice significantly reduced the expression of A\u03b2-42, Cox-2, and caspase-3 in the hippocampus. In parallel, treadmill exercised Tg mice decreased the phosphorylation levels of JNK, p38MAPK and tau (Ser404, Ser202, Thr231), and increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK, PI3K, Akt and GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2. In addition, treadmill exercised Tg mice up-regulated the expressions of NGF, BDNF and phospho-CREB, and the expressions of SOD-1, SOD-2 and HSP-70. Treadmill exercised Tg mice up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and down-regulated the expressions of cytochrome c and Bax in the hippocampus. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus in mice was significantly decreased after treadmill exercise. Finally, serum TC, insulin, glucose, and corticosterone levels were significantly decreased in the Tg mice after treadmill exercise. As a consequence of such change, A\u03b2-dependent neuronal cell death in the hippocampus of Tg mice was markedly suppressed following treadmill exercise. These results strongly suggest that treadmill exercise provides a therapeutic potential to inhibit both A\u03b2-42 and neuronal death pathways. Therefore, treadmill exercise may be beneficial in prevention or treatment of AD.","_input_hash":-463157331,"_task_hash":2075509987,"spans":[{"text":"transgenic","start":83,"end":93,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"mouse","start":94,"end":99,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"study","start":143,"end":148,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"transgenic","start":306,"end":316,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"mice","start":322,"end":326,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mouse","start":378,"end":383,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"human","start":426,"end":431,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"mice","start":564,"end":568,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":685,"end":689,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":758,"end":762,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":887,"end":891,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1088,"end":1092,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1224,"end":1228,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":1375,"end":1380,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"mice","start":1403,"end":1407,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1564,"end":1568,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1686,"end":1690,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1811,"end":1822,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"77, 81, 2, 77, 82, 81, 0, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 70, 82, 82, 82, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707144864,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

AD is the most common cause of dementia, and neuroinflammation is one of the major contributing factors in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, low-dose RT may be used clinically for treating AD. However, the appropriate doses, effects, and underlying mechanisms of RT in AD have not been determined. In this study, we aimed to determine the appropriate RT dose and schedule for AD treatment and to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of low-dose RT in AD.\tWe first determined the proper dose and schedule for RT in late-stage AD using 8- to 9-month-old 5x Familial AD (5xFAD) mice, a well-known animal model of AD, by comparing the effects of a low total dose with low dose per fraction (LD-LDRT, 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.6 Gy) with those of a low moderate total dose with conventional dose per fraction (LMD-CDRT, 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 Gy).\tLD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT were found to reduce the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines CD54, IL-3, CXCL9/10, and CCL2/4 in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, increased microgliosis assessed using Iba-1 and CD68 dual immunostaining was significantly reduced by LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice.

Compared with age-matched controls, children with severe CH had poorer hearing and communication skills, albeit generally within normal limits. Children with severe CH had fractional anisotropy that was significantly lower in the cerebellum, bilateral thalami and right temporal lobe, and radial diffusivity that was significantly higher in the cerebellum and bilateral thalami. Microscopic fractional anisotropy and intra-neurite volume fraction were also significantly decreased, and transverse microscopic diffusivity was significantly increased, in the CH group in areas including the cerebellum, thalamus, occipital lobe, and corpus callosum, and in the white matter adjacent to sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the left hemisphere.

Yet, the interpretation of PET scans is not clear-cut. The present study aimed at determining the best method to analyse PET/CT in a large, real-life cohort of patients presenting with suspicion of GCA.\tOne hundred and three patients with clinical suspicion of GCA undergoing PET/CT between 2006 and 2012 were included. Clinical data were retrieved from patients' charts. PET/CT was categorized by visual scoring of the uptake and by the artery/liver standardized uptake values (SUV) ratios. Diagnosis of GCA was confirmed in 68 patients and excluded in 35 patients, which served as the controls. GCA patients were older (median age 75 vs. 68\u2009years), and presented more often with ischaemic symptoms. The best discrimination between GCA patients and controls was achieved for PET/CT findings within the supra-aortic arteries (sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.91 for a SUV/LE cut-off value of 1.0). Specificity of PET/CT for the aorta and the iliofemoral arteries was lower (<0.34). Visual scoring correlated poorly to SUV measurements (Kendall Tau-b 0.13-0.55) and had a lower diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.75). Prednisone treatment for \u226510\u2009days significantly reduced PET/CT sensitivity (P\u2009=\u20090.009).\tSUV based analysis of PET/CT enhances diagnostic accuracy with best discrimination in the supra-aortic region, particularly in steroid na\u00efve patients. For discrimination based on the aorta and the iliofemoral region, higher cut-off values have to be applied, resulting in lower sensitivities for diagnosing GCA.","_input_hash":1456181213,"_task_hash":642584835,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":89,"end":97,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":432,"end":437,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cohort","start":515,"end":521,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"patients","start":525,"end":533,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":590,"end":598,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":719,"end":727,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Diagnosis","start":857,"end":866,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"patients","start":894,"end":902,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":922,"end":930,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":966,"end":974,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1102,"end":1110,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1441,"end":1451,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1625,"end":1635,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":1728,"end":1736,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 1, 34, 34, 34, 56, 34, 34, 34, 34, 55, 55, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707145797,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of ASD and lack of a proper human cellular model system, the pathophysiological mechanism of ASD during the developmental process is largely unknown. However, recent progress in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology as well as in vitro neural differentiation techniques have allowed us to functionally characterize neurons and analyze cortical development during neural differentiation. These technical advances will increase our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of heterogeneous ASD and help identify molecular biomarkers for patient stratification as well as personalized medicine. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of iPSC generation, differentiation of specific neuronal subtypes from iPSCs, and phenotypic characterizations of human ASD patient-derived iPSC models. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of iPSC technology and future directions of ASD pathophysiology studies using iPSCs.","_input_hash":161699650,"_task_hash":-400479693,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":366,"end":371,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"review","start":950,"end":956,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"summarize","start":961,"end":970,"pattern":1982627683},{"text":"human","start":1107,"end":1112,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 4, 8, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707145839,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

Increased expression of the master regulator of ALP, transcription factor EB (TFEB), is hypothesized to promote the clearance of WT \u03b1-synuclein and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we explore the efficacy of targeted TFEB overexpression either in neurons or oligodendrocytes to reduce the pathological burden of \u03b1-synuclein in a PD rat model and a MSA mouse model. While TFEB neuronal expression was sufficient to prevent neurodegeneration in the PD model, we show that only TFEB oligodendroglial overexpression leads to neuroprotective effects in the MSA model. These beneficial effects were associated with a decreased accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein into oligodendrocytes through recovery of the ALP machinery.

{"pmid":"15292181","text":"The Journal of biological chemistry^\nProliferation of neointimal smooth muscle cells after arterial injury. Dependence on interactions between fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor-9.^\nThe growth factor signaling mechanisms responsible for neointimal smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and accumulation, a characteristic feature of many vascular pathologies that can lead to restenosis after angioplasty, remain to be identified. Here, we examined the contribution of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 2 and 3 as well as novel fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) to such proliferation. Balloon catheter injury to the rat carotid artery stimulated the expression of two distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms, differing only by the presence or absence of the acidic box, and two distinctly spliced FGFR-3 isoforms containing the acidic box and differing only by the presence of either the IIIb or IIIc exon. Post-injury arterial administration of recombinant adenoviruses expressing dominant negative mutant forms of these FGFRs were used to assess the roles of the endogenous FGFR isoforms in neointimal SMC proliferation. Dominant negative FGFR-2 containing the acidic box inhibited such proliferation by 40%, whereas the dominant negative FGFR-3 forms had little effect. Expression of FGF-9, known to be capable of binding to all four neointimal FGFR-2/-3 isoforms, was abundant within the neointima. FGF-9 markedly stimulated both the proliferation of neointimal SMCs and the activation of extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2, effects which were abrogated by the administration of antisense FGF-9 oligonucleotides to injured arteries and the expression of the dominant negative FGFR-2 adenovirus in cultured neointimal SMCs. These studies demonstrate that, although multiple FGFRs are induced in neointimal SMCs following arterial injury, specific interactions between distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms and FGF-9 contribute to the proliferation of these SMCs.","_input_hash":-744466589,"_task_hash":-224875785,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":79,"end":84,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"vascular","start":368,"end":376,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"rat","start":654,"end":657,"pattern":-569153227}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 66, 92"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707146079,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

The objective of this study was to evaluate the motor, cognitive and emotional changes associated with dopaminergic and BDNF imbalance after DM exposure in rats. Sixty Wistar rats (9-10 months-old) were used, under Ethics Committee on Animal Research license (ID 19/2017). The animals were randomly divided into four groups: control (CTL, 0.9% saline), DM2 (2 mg DM in 1.6 mL 0.9% saline), DM4 (4 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline), and DM8 (8 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline). DM groups were submitted to 9 or 15 inhalations, one every 48 h. Half of the animals from each group were randomly selected and perfused 24 h after the 9th or 15th inhalation. Throughout the experiment, the animal's behavior were evaluated using catalepsy test, open field, hole-board test, Modified Elevated Plus Maze, and social interaction. At the end of the experiments, the rats were perfused transcardially and their brains were processed for Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) and Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunohistochemistries. The animals submitted to 9 inhalations of DM showed a reduction in immunoreactivity for TH in the Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and dorsal striatum (DS) areas, and an increase in BDNF in the DS and CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal areas. Conversely, the animals submitted to 15 inhalations of DM showed immunoreactivity reduced for TH in the SNpc and VTA, and an increase in BDNF in the hippocampal areas (CA3 and DG). Our results indicate that the DM inhalation at different periods induce motor and cognitive impairments in rats. Such alterations were accompanied by dopaminergic system damage and a possible dysfunction on synaptic plasticity.","_input_hash":923549339,"_task_hash":-1389599575,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":452,"end":457,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"Animal","start":665,"end":671,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"randomly","start":720,"end":728,"pattern":985041104},{"text":"randomly","start":1016,"end":1024,"pattern":985041104},{"text":"animal","start":1117,"end":1123,"pattern":-1575063083}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 67, 25, 25, 67"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707146135,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}
{"pmid":"9520072","text":"European neurology^\nCerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid beta-peptide in Alzheimer's disease and major depression - inverse correlation with dementia severity.^\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia that ultimately leads to death. Histopathological hallmarks of AD include brain amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. Major depression is a frequent diagnosis in every gerontopsychiatric clinic that sees patients with both cognitive and affective disorders. Many depressed patients, in fact, are clinically characterized by cognitive impairments. Thus, an assay that excludes - or confirms - probable AD in cognitively impaired patients is desirable. Such assays may use protein markers that are derived from such histopathologically relevant molecules as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its derivatives including the amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta). To evaluate the differential diagnostic properties of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta and secreted soluble ectodomain (APPs), we quantitated CSF levels of these measures in AD patients and compared them to age-matched control patients with major depression. CSF levels of APPs and Abeta were similar in patients with AD or major depression, and the apolipoprotein E genotype had no influence on CSF levels of Abeta in AD patients. Measurement of Abeta peptide using a novel zinc/copper capture ELISA that detects aggregated Abeta peptides as well demonstrated similar levels in AD and major depression. In AD patients, CSF levels of total Abeta (Abeta1-40 plus Abeta1-42) were inversely correlated with a functional measure of dementia severity (NOSGER), suggesting that CSF levels of Abeta decrease with advancing severity of AD. Thus, CSF levels of Abeta are not useful for the differentiation of AD from major depression. However, CSF levels of Abeta reflect the severity of dementia and may be useful as biological markers of the stage of the disease.","_input_hash":-952252381,"_task_hash":-1137537287,"spans":[{"text":"diagnosis","start":458,"end":467,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"patients","start":513,"end":521,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":582,"end":590,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":737,"end":745,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnostic","start":995,"end":1005,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":1142,"end":1150,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1192,"end":1200,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1269,"end":1277,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1387,"end":1395,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1575,"end":1583,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"56, 34, 34, 34, 55, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707146149,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

Assistive technology^\nEvaluation of the performance of paraplegic subjects during walking with a new design of reciprocal gait orthosis.^\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) influences a person's ability to stand and walk. Various orthoses have been developed to solve these standing and walking problems, however, patients still experience high energy consumption during walking and high forces on the upper limbs. A new reciprocal gait orthosis (RGO) was designed to address these problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the new orthosis design with paraplegic subjects.\tThree paraplegic subjects with the lesion at level T12 and three able-bodied subjects were included in this study. Hip and pelvis range of motion and vertical ground reaction force were evaluated using the Qualysis motion analyzer system and a Kistler force plate. Energy consumption was measured with the Polar heart rate monitoring system. The differences between SCI individuals when walking with a Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis (KAFO) and the new RGO, and the differences between able-bodied and paraplegic subjects were evaluated by the use of paired sample and two sample t test, respectively.\tThe results showed that energy consumption and gait analysis outcomes with new RGO orthosis were better than the KAFO. However, there was a large difference between paraplegic and able-bodied subjects while walking with the new orthosis.\tThe new RGO design performed better than a KAFO in terms of energy consumption, walking style and vertical ground reaction force. Therefore, it appears that RGO may be a useful orthosis for patients with paraplegia.

{"pmid":"29883458","text":"PloS one^\nSexual behavior and testis morphology in the BACHD rat model.^\nHuntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in brain neurodegeneration and peripheral pathology affecting different organs including testis. Patients with HD suffer from motor and cognitive impairment, and multiple psychiatric symptoms. Among behavioral abnormalities in HD, sexual disturbances have often been reported, but scarcely investigated in animal models. The BACHD rat model of HD carries the human full-length mutated HTT (mHTT) genomic sequence with 97 CAG-CAA repeats and displays HD-like alterations at neuropathological and behavioral level.\tThis study aims to phenotype the BACHD rats' sexual behavior and performance as well as testis morphology because alterations in these aspects have been associated to HD.\tTwo rat cohorts at the age of 3 and 7 months were subjected to mating tests to assess different parameters of sexual behavior. Histological analyses for testis morphology were performed in different rat cohorts at 1.5, 7 and 12 months of age whereas immunohistochemical analyses were carried out at 7 and 12 months of age to visualize the presence of mHTT in testicular tissue. Furthermore, western blot analyses were used to assess HTT and mHTT expression levels in striatum and testis at three months of age.\tAt 3 months, BACHD rats showed a decreased time exploring the female anogenital area (AGA), decreased latency to mount, increased number of intromissions and ejaculations and enhanced hit rate. At 7 months, all sexual parameters were comparable between genotypes with the exception that BACHD rats explored the AGA less than wild type rats. Testis analyses did not reveal any morphological alteration at any of the examined ages, but showed presence of mHTT limited to Sertoli cells in transgenic rats at both 7 and 12 months. BACHD rat HTT and mHTT expression levels in testis were lower than striatum at 3 months of age.\tThe testis phenotype in the BACHD rat model does not mimic the changes observed in human HD testis. The altered sexual behavior in BACHD rats at three months of age could be to a certain extent representative of and share common underlying pathways with some of the sexual disturbances in HD patients. Further investigating the biological causes of the sexual phenotype in BACHD rats may therefore contribute to clarifying the mechanisms at the base of sexual behavior changes in HD.","_input_hash":-1418697319,"_task_hash":1696976932,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":61,"end":64,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"Patients","start":311,"end":319,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"animal","start":520,"end":526,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"rat","start":545,"end":548,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"human","start":573,"end":578,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":732,"end":737,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"aims","start":738,"end":742,"pattern":-2080524606},{"text":"rat","start":902,"end":905,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"rat","start":1097,"end":1100,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"cells","start":1886,"end":1891,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"transgenic","start":1895,"end":1905,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"rat","start":1942,"end":1945,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"rat","start":2066,"end":2069,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"human","start":2115,"end":2120,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"patients","start":2324,"end":2332,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 34, 67, 92, 0, 2, 43, 92, 92, 70, 77, 92, 92, 0, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707147327,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

Felbamate is an investigational antiepileptic drug with a preclinical profile that suggests it would be effective in patients with multiple types of seizures. In controlled clinical trials, felbamate was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of refractory partial-onset seizures.\tWe studied the efficacy of felbamate in 73 patients ranging in age from 4 to 36 years who had the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. During a 28-day base-line phase, the patients received their usual antiepileptic therapies. At the end of this phase, felbamate or placebo was administered for 70 days in addition to the current antiepileptic medications. The dosage of felbamate was titrated during the first 14 days of the treatment phase to a maximum of 45 mg per kilogram of body weight per day or 3600 mg per day, whichever was less. The primary efficacy variables were the total number of seizures counted during a four-hour period of video recording, parents' or guardians' global evaluations of the patients' quality of life, and the total number of atonic seizures, as reported by parents or guardians.\tThe patients treated with felbamate had a 34 percent decrease in the frequency of atonic seizures, as compared with a 9 percent decrease in the patients who received placebo (P = 0.01). The felbamate-treated patients had a 19 percent decrease in the total frequency of seizures, as compared with a 4 percent increase in the placebo group (P = 0.002). The global-evaluation scores were significantly higher in the felbamate group than in the placebo group from day 49 to the end of the study. There were no significant differences in the frequency of seizures occurring during video monitoring, but there was a significant reduction (P = 0.017) in the number of tonic-clonic seizures during the maintenance period in the felbamate group. The types and frequency of side effects were similar in the two treatment groups.\tFelbamate is beneficial in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.","_input_hash":-1489155511,"_task_hash":-1368497927,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":461,"end":469,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"controlled","start":506,"end":516,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trials","start":526,"end":532,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"placebo","start":560,"end":567,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"patients","start":675,"end":683,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":792,"end":800,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"placebo","start":886,"end":893,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"patients","start":1328,"end":1336,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1437,"end":1445,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1577,"end":1585,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"placebo","start":1599,"end":1606,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"patients","start":1641,"end":1649,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"placebo","start":1757,"end":1764,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"placebo","start":1874,"end":1881,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"study","start":1918,"end":1923,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":2279,"end":2287,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 27, 75, 14, 34, 34, 14, 34, 34, 34, 14, 34, 14, 14, 2, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707147413,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

Abundant evidence now discredits this stereotype, but it is unclear if prevailing 'evidence-based' treatments have been evaluated in samples representative of the diversity of individuals affected by EDs. Our goal was to evaluate the reporting, inclusion, and analysis of sociodemographic variables in ED psychotherapeutic treatment randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the US through 2020.\tWe conducted a systematic review of ED psychotherapeutic treatment RCTs in the US and examined the reporting and inclusion of gender identity, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status (SES) of enrolled participants, as well as recruitment methods, power analyses, and discussion of limitations and generalizability.\tOur search yielded 58 studies meeting inclusion criteria dating back to 1985. Reporting was at times incomplete, absent, or centered on the racial/gender majority group. No studies reported gender diverse participants, and men and people of color were underrepresented generally, with differences noted across diagnoses. A minority of papers considered sociodemographic variables in analyses or acknowledged limitations related to sample characteristics. Some progress was made across the decades, with studies increasingly providing full racial and ethnic data, and more men included over time. Although racial and ethnic diversity improved somewhat, progress appeared to stall in the last decade.\tWe summarize findings, consider context and challenges for RCT researchers, and offer suggestions for researchers, journal editors, and reviewers on improving representation, reporting, and analytic practices.\tRandomized controlled trials of eating disorder psychotherapeutic treatment in the US are increasingly reporting full race/ethnicity data, but information on SES is inconsistent and sexual orientation absent. White women still comprise the overwhelming majority of participants, with few men and people of color, and no gender-diverse individuals. Findings underscore the need to improve reporting and increase representation to ensure evidence-based treatments are effective across and within diverse groups.\tLos trastornos de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) alguna vez se conceptualizaron como enfermedades que afectaban principalmente a las mujeres blancas, adineradas, un concepto err\u00f3neo que inform\u00f3 la investigaci\u00f3n y la pr\u00e1ctica cl\u00ednica durante muchos a\u00f1os.

Dimensional psychopathology in the parents was also correlated with short sleep duration in their children. The brain areas in which higher volume was correlated with longer sleep duration included the orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal and temporal cortex, precuneus, and supramarginal gyrus. Longitudinal data analysis showed that the psychiatric problems, especially the depressive problems, were significantly associated with short sleep duration 1 year later. Further, mediation analysis showed that depressive problems significantly mediate the effect of these brain regions on sleep. Higher cognitive scores were associated with higher volume of the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and medial orbitofrontal cortex.

{"pmid":"35446941","text":"Brain : a journal of neurology^\nClearance of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prions in vivo by the Hsp70 disaggregase system.^\nThe metazoan Hsp70 disaggregase protects neurons from proteotoxicity that arises from the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. Hsp70 and its co-chaperones disassemble and extract polypeptides from protein aggregates for refolding or degradation. The effectiveness of the chaperone system decreases with age and leads to accumulation rather than removal of neurotoxic protein aggregates. Therapeutic enhancement of the Hsp70 protein disassembly machinery is proposed to counter late-onset protein misfolding neurodegenerative disease that may arise. In the context of prion disease, it is not known whether stimulation of protein aggregate disassembly paradoxically leads to enhanced formation of seeding competent species of disease-specific proteins and acceleration of neurodegenerative disease. Here we have tested the hypothesis that modulation of Hsp70 disaggregase activity perturbs mammalian prion-induced neurotoxicity and prion seeding activity. To do so we used prion protein (PrP) transgenic Drosophila that authentically replicate mammalian prions. RNASeq identified that Hsp70, DnaJ-1 and Hsp110 gene expression was downregulated in prion-exposed PrP Drosophila. We demonstrated that RNAi knockdown of Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila enhanced neurotoxicity, whereas overexpression mitigated toxicity. Strikingly, prion seeding activity in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila was ablated or reduced by Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 overexpression, respectively. Similar effects were seen in scrapie prion-exposed ovine PrP Drosophila with modified Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression. These unique observations show that the metazoan Hsp70 disaggregase facilitates the clearance of mammalian prions and that its enhanced activity is a potential therapeutic strategy for human prion disease.","_input_hash":-1539946562,"_task_hash":1149296813,"spans":[{"text":"Therapeutic","start":525,"end":536,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"transgenic","start":1130,"end":1140,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"human","start":1437,"end":1442,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":1611,"end":1616,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1985,"end":1996,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"human","start":2010,"end":2015,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"47, 77, 0, 0, 47, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707147542,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

This study aimed to investigate the effects of these reformulation tools on insight and symptom change. A small-N repeated measures design was employed with quantitative and qualitative measures collected from six therapist/client dyads. Participating therapists kept a record of their delivery of CAT reformulation tools. Participating clients completed the insight subscale of the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale every fourth session and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-10 every session. Qualitative data from client change interviews regarding their experiences of CAT and attributions of change was explored using template analysis. Participants demonstrated improvements (symptom reduction and insight increases) over the course of the intervention. Administration of reformulation tools did not consistently result in significant changes on insight and symptom measures. However, the tools were identified by participants as leading to insight and emotional change within the context of a good therapeutic relationship. These findings suggest that a genuine therapeutic relationship is an important change mechanism operating through, and strengthened by, CAT-specific tools.","_input_hash":-1007878123,"_task_hash":1165673698,"spans":[{"text":"Case","start":155,"end":159,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"therapeutic","start":227,"end":238,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"therapeutic","start":283,"end":294,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"therapy","start":322,"end":329,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"CAT","start":331,"end":334,"pattern":-1412123339},{"text":"study","start":518,"end":523,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"CAT","start":811,"end":814,"pattern":-1412123339},{"text":"CAT","start":1095,"end":1098,"pattern":-1412123339},{"text":"intervention","start":1268,"end":1280,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1527,"end":1538,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1591,"end":1602,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"CAT","start":1689,"end":1692,"pattern":-1412123339}],"meta":{"pattern":"35, 47, 47, 46, 95, 2, 95, 95, 48, 47, 47, 95"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707147588,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

Data was from the Japanese Schizophrenia Sib-pair Linkage Group (JSSLG), which is a multi-site collaborative study group established to create a national resource for genetic studies of schizophrenia in Japan. All subjects were Japanese, and the probands and their siblings had schizophrenia. Multipoint non-parametric linkage analysis and exclusion mapping were performed with GENEHUNTER software. Simulation studies suggested that in the absence of linkage we could expect one multipoint maximum LOD score (MLS) of 1.9 per genome scan. An MLS of 3.7 would be expected only once in every 20 genome scans and thus corresponds to a genome-wide significance of 0.05. No loci in the initial screen fulfilled the criteria for significant or suggestive evidence for linkage. Ten chromosomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 17, and 20) had at least one region with a nominal P value < 0.05.

Here we investigated the effects of treadmill training (TMT) on regenerative responses of the corticospinal tract (CST) after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI). One week after injury of the low thoracic spinal cord, rats were given TMT or sedentary treatment for 1-4 weeks. Anterograde tracing of descending CST axons revealed that TMT enhanced collateral arborization of CST axons surrounding the injury cavity and promoted extension into the caudal spinal cord. The number of oligodendrocytes in the vicinity of the injury cavity was significantly increased at 2 or 4 weeks after TMT compared to sedentary controls. The data further showed that TMT increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in the motor cortex as well as the spinal cord injury area, and inhibition of Erk1/2 activity by administration of the MEK1 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 reduced collateral outgrowth of descending CST axons in TMT animals. TMT for 2-4 weeks significantly improved behavioral scores as assessed by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale, as well as on motor function and gridwalk testing. Our data imply that Erk1/2 may be an important mediator for transmitting signals from the injury site to the cell body, and further suggest that activation of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway may be involved in enhanced outgrowth of CST axons after TMT.","_input_hash":1633818830,"_task_hash":1143148813,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707147607,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

A focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model on Macaca mulatta was performed with a modified middle cerebral artery occlusion method. Among the nearly 8000 genes, approximately 8% of the total number of genes examined were affected after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Major altered genes were downregulated.

Results showed that after ischemia/reperfusion injury, IGF-1 mRNA expression decreased in ipsilateral striatum, whereas increased in ipsilateral hippocampus. No expression changes were observed in cortex. EA treatment could obviously upregulate the IGF-1 mRNA expression in striatum, and further enhance its expression in hippocampus. Therefore, the data presented suggest a possible mediator underlying the mechanisms of anti-ischemic effect of acupuncture.

Effective treatments include psychotherapy (often cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.","_input_hash":158168417,"_task_hash":-961396230,"spans":[{"text":"Patients","start":176,"end":184,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":285,"end":293,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":643,"end":650,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707147778,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41","_session_id":"2024-02-05_15-38-41"}

There have been a few brain structural magnetic resonance imaging studies for GD, although the results have been inconsistent. On the other hand, GD was suggested to be a heterogeneous disorder in terms of risk attitude. We aimed to examine the heterogeneity of GD by combining a behavioral economics task and voxel-based morphometry. Thirty-six male GD patients and 36 healthy male control subjects underwent a task for estimation of loss aversion, which can assess risk attitude in real-life decision-making. The GD patients were divided into two groups based on their level of loss aversion, low and high. While both groups showed common gray matter volume reduction in the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral posterior cerebellum, high loss-aversion GD showed pronounced reduction in the left posterior cerebellum and additional reduction in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex. Our study suggests that the heterogeneity of GD is underpinned at the brain structural level.

Images of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were processed with tract-based spatial statistics controlling for age and sex. The data were also used to train Gaussian process classifiers to predict diagnostic group.\tIn BD vs DMDD, FA in the corticospinal tract was reduced. In DMDD vs HV, reductions in FA and AD were confined to the anterior corpus callosum. In BD vs HV, widespread reductions in FA and increased RD were observed. FA in the anterior corpus callosum and corticospinal tract was negatively associated with irritability. The Gaussian process classifier could not discriminate between BD and DMDD, but achieved 68% accuracy in predicting DMDD vs HV and 75% accuracy in predicting BD vs HV.\tAberrant white matter microstructure was associated with both categorical diagnosis and the dimension of irritability. Alterations in DMDD were regionally discrete and related to reduced AD. In BD, we observed widespread increases in RD, supporting the hypothesis of altered myelination in BD.

Baseline head CT use at the participating ED was determined for children with closed head injury through retrospective chart review from March 2014 through November 2015. Head injury patients were identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes for head injury, unspecified (959.01) and concussion with and without loss of consciousness (850-850.9) until October 2015, after which ICD-9 was no longer used. To identify eligible patients after October 2015, lists of all pediatric patients evaluated at the participating ED were reviewed, and patients were included in the analysis if they had a physician-assigned discharge diagnosis of head injury or concussion. Exclusion criteria were age \u2265 18 years, penetrating head trauma, history of brain tumor, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, bleeding disorder, or presentation\u00a0>\u00a024 hours postinjury. Medical history, injury mechanism, symptoms, head CT use, and disposition were recorded. Implementation of the Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool was achieved through provider education sessions beginning in December 2015 and ending in August 2016. Head CT use was monitored for 12 months postimplementation, from September 2016 through August 2017. Patients were classified into low, intermediate, or high risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) by chart review. ED length of stay (LOS), disposition, and ED returns within 72 hours were recorded. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables, using Kruskal-Wallis test.\tA total of 252 children with closed head injury were evaluated preimplementation (March 2014 through November 2015), 132 children were evaluated during implementation (December 2015 through August 2016), and 172 children were evaluated postimplementation (September 2016 through August 2017).

Each contact pair was classified as being from healthy (gray matter, n = 696; white matter, n = 530) or pathological (epileptogenic zone, n = 195) tissue using neuroimaging analysis of the local tissue environment and intracerebral EEG recordings. Brain tissue conductivities were obtained using numerical simulations based on conductivity estimates that accounted for the current flow in the local brain volume around the contact pairs (a cube with a side length of 13 mm). Conductivity values were 0.26 S/m for gray matter and 0.17 S/m for white matter. Healthy gray and white matter had statistically different median impedances (P < 0.0001). White matter conductivity was found to be homogeneous as normality tests did not find evidence of multiple subgroups.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the not-well-known molecular determinants that predict responsiveness to c-MET inhibitors and to explore new strategies for improving inhibitor efficacy in brain tumors.\tWe investigated the molecular factors and pathway activation signatures that determine sensitivity to c-MET inhibitors in a panel of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells, glioblastoma stem cells, and established cell line-derived xenografts using functional assays, reverse protein microarrays, and in vivo tumor volume measurements, but validation with animal survival analyses remains to be done.

In this report, the differentiation capacity in vivo of these cells was analysed following a standardized trauma. Before the trauma, the subependymal cells expressed nestin but not the astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament respectively. In response to injury, the majority of the subependymal cells coexpressed nestin and GFAP, but never nestin and neurofilament. Furthermore, cells coexpressing nestin and GFAP were found progressively further away from the subependyma and closer to the lesion at later time points after the injury, indicating that these cells migrate towards the lesion. Nestin was in addition re-expressed in reactive astrocytes near the lesion and in non-reactive astrocytes very far from the lesion throughout the ipsilateral cortex. In conclusion, our data indicate that the nestin-positive subependymal cells are an in vivo source for the generation of new astrocytes but not neurons after injury, and that nestin re-expression in astrocytes following traumatic stimuli can be used as a sensitive marker for astroglial activation.","_input_hash":1361671912,"_task_hash":1410982689,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":75,"end":80,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":215,"end":220,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":277,"end":282,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"report","start":334,"end":340,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"cells","start":388,"end":393,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":476,"end":481,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":686,"end":691,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":770,"end":775,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":950,"end":955,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1221,"end":1226,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 70, 70, 36, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707150414,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

Also, there are controversial data about the comparison between euthymic bipolar patients and different subgroups of schizophrenia in neurocognition, functioning, and QoL level. The present study aimed to compare the neurocognitive performance, functional outcome, and QoL of remitted and non-remitted patients with SC with respect to a group of euthymic patients with BD, and a control group. It included 655 subjects: 98 patients with schizophrenia in remission (SC-R), 184 non-remitted patients with schizophrenia (SC-NR), 117 euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder (BD), and 256 healthy subjects. A comprehensive clinical, neurocognitive (six cognitive domains), functional, and QoL assessment was carried out. Remission criteria of Andreasen were used to classify schizophrenia patients as remitted or non-remitted. Compared with control subjects all groups of patients showed impaired neurocognitive performance, functioning and QoL.

When found to be different in preclinical AD, these inflammatory biomarkers may be used to select preclinical AD subjects who are most likely to develop AD, to participate in clinical trials with new disease-modifying drugs.\tHealthy elderly (n= 50; age 71.9; MMSE >24) and subjects with preclinical AD (n=50; age 73.4; MMSE >24) defined by CSF A\u03b21-42 levels < 1000 pg/mL were included. Four neuroinflammatory biomarkers were determined in plasma, GFAP, YKL-40, MCP-1, and eotaxin-1. Differences in biomarker outcomes were compared using ANCOVA. Subject characteristics age, gender, and APOE \u03b54 status were reported per group and were covariates in the ANCOVA.

{"pmid":"27180681","text":"Scientific reports^\nCancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.^\nDDX3X is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that has been implicated in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism including translation initiation and the assembly of stress granules (SGs). Recent genomic studies have reported recurrent DDX3X mutations in numerous tumors including medulloblastoma (MB), but the physiological impact of these mutations is poorly understood. Here we show that a consistent feature of MB-associated mutations is SG hyper-assembly and concomitant translation impairment. We used CLIP-seq to obtain a comprehensive assessment of DDX3X binding targets and ribosome profiling for high-resolution assessment of global translation. Surprisingly, mutant DDX3X expression caused broad inhibition of translation that impacted DDX3X targeted and non-targeted mRNAs alike. Assessment of translation efficiency with single-cell resolution revealed that SG hyper-assembly correlated precisely with impaired global translation. SG hyper-assembly and translation impairment driven by mutant DDX3X were rescued by a genetic approach that limited SG assembly and by deletion of the N-terminal low complexity domain within DDX3X. Thus, in addition to a primary defect at the level of translation initiation caused by DDX3X mutation, SG assembly itself contributes to global translation inhibition. This work provides mechanistic insights into the consequences of cancer-related DDX3X mutations, suggesting that globally reduced translation may provide a context-dependent survival advantage that must be considered as a possible contributor to tumorigenesis.","_input_hash":-1566668354,"_task_hash":2143538967,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707150650,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

{"pmid":"18634851","text":"Neuroscience letters^\nDeletion of both ICAM-1 and C3 enhances severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis compared to C3-deficient mice.^\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and leukocyte infiltration, demyelination of neurons, and blood-brain barrier breakdown. The development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for MS is dependent on a number of components of the immune system including complement and adhesion molecules. Previous studies in our lab have examined the role of C3, the central complement component, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) a key cell adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation including the CNS. In these studies we demonstrated that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE is markedly attenuated in both ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) mice. Given the pivotal role that these proteins play in EAE, we hypothesized that EAE in ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) double mutant mice would likely fail to develop. Unexpectedly, EAE in ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice was only modestly attenuated compared to wild type mice and significantly worse than C3(-/-) mice. Leukocyte infiltration was commensurate with disease severity between the three groups of mice. Spinal cord T cells from ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice produced the highest levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, despite reduced disease severity compared to wild type mice. The mechanisms behind the elevated EAE severity in ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice may relate to altered homing of leukocytes or processing of self-antigens in the double mutant background.","_input_hash":336093559,"_task_hash":2030729055,"spans":[{"text":"animal","start":417,"end":423,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"mice","start":935,"end":939,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1063,"end":1067,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1139,"end":1143,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1195,"end":1199,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1237,"end":1241,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1333,"end":1337,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":1353,"end":1358,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"mice","start":1384,"end":1388,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1500,"end":1504,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1577,"end":1581,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"67, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 70, 82, 82, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707150777,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

In addition, the role of the visual system in relation to visual hallucinations was examined.\t102 consecutive patients diagnosed with strictly defined Parkinson's disease were examined for the presence of hallucinations and delusions and assessed for visual acuity, cognition, depression using the geriatric depression scale, disease severity as measured by the UPDRS, and other clinical variables.\tOf 102 consecutive patients, 29.4% (n=30) had hallucinations or delusions, four (3.9%) were determined to be psychotic due solely to delirium and were excluded from further analysis. Of the 98 remaining patients, 26.5% (n=26) had visual hallucinations. Among these, one patient also had delusions, two had auditory hallucinations, and one had gustatory hallucinations. Visual hallucinations were significantly associated with worse visual acuity, lower cognitive score, higher depression score, and worse disease severity. Hallucinations were not associated with history of psychiatric disease, dose or duration of levodopa or other antiparkinsonian medication treatment, or duration of illness.\tVisual hallucinations are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease and are most likely of multifactorial origin. Although higher doses of levodopa are known to be related clinically to hallucinations in individual patients, the results suggest that several underlying characteristics of patients with Parkinson's disease (disease severity, dementia, depression, worse visual acuity) may be more important determinants of which patients experience hallucinations. The data also provide preliminary evidence that abnormality of the visual system may be related to visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, as has been found in other disorders with visual hallucinations.","_input_hash":-1412047639,"_task_hash":-2071139996,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":64,"end":69,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":132,"end":137,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"prevalence","start":170,"end":180,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"patients","start":462,"end":470,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":770,"end":778,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":954,"end":962,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"score","start":1214,"end":1219,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"score","start":1239,"end":1244,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"history","start":1314,"end":1321,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"patients","start":1659,"end":1667,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1732,"end":1740,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1872,"end":1880,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 2, 53, 34, 34, 34, 60, 60, 64, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707150786,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

Although studies of human and animal sera from group A streptococcal diseases or immunization models have been crucial in providing clues to molecular mimicry and its role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever, study of human monoclonal autoantibodies have provided important insights into how antibodies against the valve may activate the valve endothelium and lead to T cell infiltration. Passive transfer of anti-streptococcal T cell lines in a rat model of rheumatic carditis illustrates effects of CD4+ T cells on the valve. Although Sydenham chorea has been known as the neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever for decades, the combination of autoimmunity and behavior is a relatively new concept linking brain, behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders with streptococcal infections. In Sydenham chorea, human mAbs and their expression in transgenic mice have linked autoimmunity to central dopamine pathways as well as dopamine receptors and dopaminergic neurons in basal ganglia. Taken together, the studies reviewed provide a basis for understanding streptococcal sequelae and how immune responses against group A streptococci influence autoimmunity and inflammatory responses in the heart and brain.","_input_hash":-2009334713,"_task_hash":16003232,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":879,"end":884,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":1048,"end":1053,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"animal","start":1058,"end":1064,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"study","start":1240,"end":1245,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"human","start":1249,"end":1254,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"rat","start":1477,"end":1480,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"cells","start":1539,"end":1544,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"human","start":1844,"end":1849,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"transgenic","start":1879,"end":1889,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"mice","start":1890,"end":1894,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 0, 67, 2, 0, 92, 70, 0, 77, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707150933,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

Several compounds are under development that address both underlying pathophysiological abnormalities and core ASD symptoms. This article reviews one of these treatments, d,l-leucovorin calcium (also known as folinic acid) for treatment of folate pathway abnormalities in children with ASD. Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that is essential for normal neurodevelopment and abnormalities in the folate and related pathways have been identified in children with ASD. One of these abnormalities involves a partial blockage in the ability of folate to be transported into the brain utilizing the primary transport mechanism, the folate receptor alpha. Autoantibodies which interfere with the function of the folate receptor alpha called folate receptor alpha autoantibodies have been identified in 58%-76% of children with ASD and independent studies have demonstrated that blood titers of these autoantibodies correlate with folate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Most significantly, case-series, open-label, and single and double-blind placebo-controlled studies suggest that d,l-leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the blockage at the folate receptor alpha by using the reduced folate carrier, an alternate pathway, can substantially improve particular symptoms in children with ASD, especially those positive for folate receptor alpha autoantibodies.

Paper-based measurement tools can be burdensome to the patient and clinician and lack the temporal resolution needed to accurately and objectively track changes in motor symptom severity throughout the day. Wearable sensor-based systems that continuously monitor PD motor disorders may help to solve this problem, although critical shortcomings persist in identifying multiple disorders at high temporal resolution during unconstrained activity. The purpose of this study was to advance the current state of the art by (1) introducing hybrid sensor technology to concurrently acquire surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer data during unconstrained activity and (2) analyzing the data using dynamic neural network algorithms to capture the evolving temporal characteristics of the sensor data and improve motor disorder recognition of tremor and dyskinesia. Algorithms were trained (n=11 patients) and tested (n=8 patients; n=4 controls) to recognize tremor and dyskinesia at 1-second resolution based on sensor data features and expert annotation of video recording during 4-hour monitoring periods of unconstrained daily activity. The algorithms were able to make accurate distinctions between tremor, dyskinesia, and normal movement despite the presence of diverse voluntary activity. Motor disorder severity classifications averaged 94.9% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity based on 1 sensor per symptomatic limb. These initial findings indicate that new sensor technology and software algorithms can be effective in enhancing wearable sensor-based system performance for monitoring PD motor disorders during unconstrained activities.","_input_hash":-1364728066,"_task_hash":-1857917549,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":781,"end":786,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1215,"end":1223,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1241,"end":1249,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"expert","start":1357,"end":1363,"pattern":316071577}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 34, 34, 11"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707151063,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

We studied 100 African-American CHF patients (aged 55-87 years) in New York Heart Association classes II-IV, who are enrolled in an ongoing, randomized, controlled trial, evaluating the effectiveness of a telemonitoring intervention to improve access to ambulatory care for heart failure patients. These CHF patients were recruited from an inner-city practice, rural physician practices and an urban physician practice in Atlanta. The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used to measure cognition. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MMSE score of less than 24. The crude prevalence of cognitive impairment was 10% in this population of African Americans with CHF.

{"pmid":"34526055","text":"Molecular neurodegeneration^\nAdult-onset CNS myelin sulfatide deficiency is sufficient to cause Alzheimer's disease-like neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.^\nHuman genetic association studies point to immune response and lipid metabolism, in addition to amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau, as major pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by microglia and astrocytes, plays a causative role in neurodegeneration in AD. Our group and others have reported early and dramatic losses of brain sulfatide in AD cases and animal models that are mediated by ApoE in an isoform-dependent manner and accelerated by A\u03b2 accumulation. To date, it remains unclear if changes in specific brain lipids are sufficient to drive AD-related pathology.\tTo study the consequences of CNS sulfatide deficiency and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we developed a novel mouse model of adult-onset myelin sulfatide deficiency, i.e., tamoxifen-inducible myelinating glia-specific cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) conditional knockout mice (CST[fl/fl]/Plp1-CreERT), took advantage of constitutive CST knockout mice (CST[-/-]), and generated CST/ApoE double knockout mice (CST[-/-]/ApoE[-/-]), and assessed these mice using a broad range of methodologies including lipidomics, RNA profiling, behavioral testing, PLX3397-mediated microglia depletion, mass spectrometry (MS) imaging, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and Western blot.\tWe found that mild central nervous system (CNS) sulfatide losses within myelinating cells are sufficient to activate disease-associated microglia and astrocytes, and to increase the expression of AD risk genes (e.g., Apoe, Trem2, Cd33, and Mmp12), as well as previously established causal regulators of the immune/microglia network in late-onset AD (e.g., Tyrobp, Dock, and Fcerg1), leading to chronic AD-like neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment. Notably, neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment showed gender differences, being more pronounced in females than males. Subsequent mechanistic studies demonstrated that although CNS sulfatide losses led to ApoE upregulation, genetically-induced myelin sulfatide deficiency led to neuroinflammation independently of ApoE. These results, together with our previous studies (sulfatide deficiency in the context of AD is mediated by ApoE and accelerated by A\u03b2 accumulation) placed both A\u03b2 and ApoE upstream of sulfatide deficiency-induced neuroinflammation, and suggested a positive feedback loop where sulfatide losses may be amplified by increased ApoE expression. We also demonstrated that CNS sulfatide deficiency-induced astrogliosis and ApoE upregulation are not secondary to microgliosis, and that astrogliosis and microgliosis seem to be driven by activation of STAT3 and PU.1/Spi1 transcription factors, respectively.\tOur results strongly suggest that sulfatide deficiency is an important contributor and driver of neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment in AD pathology.","_input_hash":-1643731984,"_task_hash":-1273198551,"spans":[{"text":"Human","start":166,"end":171,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"animal","start":600,"end":606,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"study","start":820,"end":825,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"mouse","start":942,"end":947,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"knockout","start":1097,"end":1105,"pattern":100040093},{"text":"mice","start":1106,"end":1110,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"knockout","start":1172,"end":1180,"pattern":100040093},{"text":"mice","start":1181,"end":1185,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"knockout","start":1228,"end":1236,"pattern":100040093},{"text":"mice","start":1237,"end":1241,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1283,"end":1287,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":1595,"end":1600,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"genes","start":1715,"end":1720,"pattern":995975506}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 67, 2, 81, 79, 82, 79, 82, 79, 82, 82, 70, 78"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707151711,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

Recently a tissue-specific and selective upregulation of the multidrug efflux transporter ABCB1 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the spinal cord of both patients and the mutant SOD1-G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that prevalently kills motor neurons has been reported. Here, we extended the analysis of P-gp expression in the SOD1-G93A ALS mouse model and found that P-gp upregulation was restricted to endothelial cells of the capillaries, while P-gp expression was not detected in other cells of the spinal cord parenchyma such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Using both in vitro human and mouse models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we found that mutant SOD1 astrocytes were driving P-gp upregulation in endothelial cells. In addition, a significant increase in reactive oxygen species production, Nrf2 and NF\u03baB activation in endothelial cells exposed to mutant SOD1 astrocytes in both human and murine BBB models were observed. Most interestingly, astrocytes expressing FUS-H517Q, a different familial ALS-linked mutated gene, also drove NF\u03baB-dependent upregulation of P-gp. However, the pathway was not dependent on oxidative stress but rather involved TNF-\u03b1 release.

{"pmid":"37178103","text":"Annals of emergency medicine^\nTenecteplase Versus Alteplase for Acute Stroke: Mortality and Bleeding Complications.^\nIntravenous thrombolysis with alteplase has been the foundation of initial treatment of acute ischemic stroke for several decades. Tenecteplase is a thrombolytic agent that offers logistical advantages in cost and administration relative to alteplase. There is evidence that tenecteplase has at least similar efficacy and safety outcomes compared with alteplase for stroke. In this study, we compared tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute stroke in a large retrospective US database (TriNetX) regarding the following 3 outcomes: (1) mortality, (2) intracranial hemorrhage, and (3) the need for acute blood transfusions.\tIn this retrospective study using the US cohort of 54 academic medical centers/health care organizations in the TriNetX database, we identified 3,432 patients treated with tenecteplase and 55,894 patients treated with alteplase for stroke after January 1, 2012. Propensity score matching was performed on basic demographic information and 7 previous clinical diagnostic groups, resulting in a total of 6,864 patients with acute stroke evenly matched between groups. Mortality rates, the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage, and blood transfusions (as a marker of significant blood loss) were recorded for each group over the ensuing 7- and 30-day periods. Secondary subgroup analyses were conducted on a cohort treated from 2021 to 2022 in an attempt to determine whether temporal differences in acute ischemic stroke treatment would alter the results.\tPatients treated with tenecteplase had a significantly lower mortality rate (8.2% versus 9.8%; risk ratio [RR], 0.832) and lower risk of major bleeding as measured by the frequency of blood transfusions (0.3% versus 1.4%; RR, 0.207) than alteplase at 30 days after thrombolysis for stroke. In the larger 10-year data set of patients with stroke treated after January 1, 2012, patients receiving tenecteplase were not found to have a statistically different incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (3.5% versus 3.0%; RR, 1.185) at 30 days after the administration of the thrombolytic agents in patients. However, a subgroup analysis of 2,216 evenly matched patients with stroke treated from 2021 to 2022 demonstrated notably better survival and statistically lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage than the alteplase group.\tIn our large retrospective multicenter study using real-world evidence from large health care organizations, tenecteplase for the treatment of acute stroke demonstrated a lower mortality rate, decreased intracranial hemorrhage, and less significant blood loss. The favorable mortality and safety profiles observed in this large study, taken together with previous randomized controlled trial data and operational advantages in rapid dosing and cost-effectiveness, all support the preferential use of tenecteplase in patients with ischemic stroke.","_input_hash":2105461170,"_task_hash":1516398887,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":499,"end":504,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"retrospective","start":576,"end":589,"pattern":1350033973},{"text":"retrospective","start":747,"end":760,"pattern":1350033973},{"text":"study","start":761,"end":766,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cohort","start":780,"end":786,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"patients","start":889,"end":897,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":935,"end":943,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"score","start":1012,"end":1017,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1098,"end":1108,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":1147,"end":1155,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"cohort","start":1444,"end":1450,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"Patients","start":1593,"end":1601,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1917,"end":1925,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1969,"end":1977,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2183,"end":2191,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2246,"end":2254,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"retrospective","start":2426,"end":2439,"pattern":1350033973},{"text":"study","start":2452,"end":2457,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":2741,"end":2746,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"randomized","start":2777,"end":2787,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":2788,"end":2798,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trial","start":2799,"end":2804,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"patients","start":2929,"end":2937,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 65, 65, 2, 1, 34, 34, 60, 55, 34, 1, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 65, 2, 2, 18, 27, 73, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707151889,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

Because it is well known that chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs can induce tardive dyskinesia and has been hypothesized to induce a supersensitivity psychosis, it is reasonable to believe that other behavioral changes may occur over time.

Drugs that inhibit the inactivation of NAAG by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) increase its extracellular concentration and its activation of its receptor, mGluR3. These drugs warrant attention, as they are effective in animal models of several clinical disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia. In inflammatory and neuropathic pain studies, GCPII inhibitors moderated both the primary and secondary pain responses when given systemically, locally or in brain regions associated with the pain perception pathway. The finding that GCPII inhibition also moderated the motor and cognitive effects of ethanol intoxication led to the discovery of their procognitive efficacy in long-term memory tests in control mice and in short-term memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. NAAG and GCPII inhibitors respectively reduce cocaine self-administration and the rewarding effects of a synthetic stimulant. Most recently, GCPII inhibition also has been reported to be efficacious in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. GCPII was first discovered as a protein expressed by and released from metastatic prostate cells where it is known as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). GCPII inhibitors with high affinity for this protein have been developed as prostate imaging and radiochemical therapies for prostate cancer. Taken together, these data militate in favor of the development and application of GCPII inhibitors in more advanced preclinical research as a prelude to clinical trials.","_input_hash":-475580170,"_task_hash":43424715,"spans":[{"text":"therapeutic","start":302,"end":313,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"animal","start":586,"end":592,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"mice","start":1101,"end":1105,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mouse","start":1136,"end":1141,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"cells","start":1504,"end":1509,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"trials","start":1879,"end":1885,"pattern":1849967594}],"meta":{"pattern":"47, 67, 82, 81, 70, 75"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707152486,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}
{"pmid":"29915258","text":"Nature communications^\nA recurrent point mutation in PRKCA is a hallmark of chordoid gliomas.^\nChordoid glioma (ChG) is a characteristic, slow growing, and well-circumscribed diencephalic tumor, whose mutational landscape is unknown. Here we report the analysis of 16 ChG by whole-exome and RNA-sequencing. We found that 15 ChG harbor the same PRKCA [D463H] mutation. PRKCA encodes the Protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme alpha (PKC\u03b1) and is mutated in a wide range of human cancers. However the hot spot PRKCA [D463H] mutation was not described in other tumors. PRKCA [D463H] is strongly associated with the activation of protein translation initiation (EIF2) pathway. PKC\u03b1[D463H] mRNA levels are more abundant than wild-type PKC\u03b1 transcripts, while PKC\u03b1[D463H] is less stable than the PCK\u03b1[WT] protein. Compared to PCK\u03b1[WT], the PKC\u03b1[D463H] protein is depleted from the cell membrane. The PKC\u03b1[D463H] mutant enhances proliferation of astrocytes and tanycytes, the cells of origin of ChG. In conclusion, our study identifies the hallmark mutation for chordoid gliomas and provides mechanistic insights on ChG oncogenesis.","_input_hash":-1537086297,"_task_hash":2116834605,"spans":[{"text":"report","start":242,"end":248,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"human","start":464,"end":469,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":961,"end":966,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":1004,"end":1009,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"36, 0, 70, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707152499,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

{"pmid":"29580855","text":"Journal of vascular surgery^\nStatin therapy is associated with higher long-term but not perioperative survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.^\nAlthough preoperative and perioperative statin therapy improves postoperative outcomes in several populations, few data examine its association with survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. In addition, no data exist regarding the benefits of starting statins in patients with AAA not currently taking them.\tWe performed a registry-based study of all patients undergoing repair of AAAs in the Vascular Quality Initiative between 2003 and 2017 without documented statin intolerance. In our primary analysis, we evaluated the association between preoperative statin therapy and long-term mortality, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital myocardial infarction and stroke. As a secondary analysis, we studied the cohort of patients not taking a statin preoperatively and compared their long-term mortality on the basis of whether they were discharged on a statin. To account for nonrandom assignment to treatment, we constructed propensity scores and applied inverse probability weighting.\tWe identified 40,452 AAA repairs, of which 37,950 fit our entry criteria (29,257 endovascular and 8693 open). Overall, 25,997 patients (69%) were taking a statin preoperatively, with patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair more frequently taking a statin than those undergoing open repair (69% compared with 66%; P\u00a0< .001). After propensity weighting, preoperative statin therapy was not associated with 30-day death or in-hospital stroke or myocardial infarction. However, patients taking statins preoperatively experienced higher adjusted 1-year (94% vs 90%) and 5-year (85% vs 81%) survival from the date of surgery compared with those who were not (P\u00a0< .001 overall), although subgroup analysis showed that this applied only to intact or symptomatic aneurysms. Of the 11,941 patients not taking a statin preoperatively and discharged alive, 2910 (24%) started on a statin before discharge. In our secondary analysis of the subset of patients not taking statins preoperatively, those initiated on a statin before discharge experienced higher survival at 1\u00a0year (94% vs 91%) and 5\u00a0years (89% vs 81%; P\u00a0< .001 overall) than those who remained off statin therapy, with the greatest absolute long-term survival difference in patients with rupture (87% vs 62%; P\u00a0< .001 overall).\tPreoperative statin therapy is associated with higher long-term survival but not perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing AAA repair, and initiating statin therapy in previously statin-naive patients is associated with markedly higher survival. All patients with AAAs without contraindications should receive statin therapy. In patients not taking a statin at the time of AAA repair, clinicians should consider initiating one before discharge.","_input_hash":-560453057,"_task_hash":-452884361,"spans":[{"text":"vascular","start":11,"end":19,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"therapy","start":36,"end":43,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"therapy","start":199,"end":206,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":429,"end":437,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":504,"end":509,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":517,"end":525,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Vascular","start":559,"end":567,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"therapy","start":730,"end":737,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"cohort","start":871,"end":877,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"patients","start":881,"end":889,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1274,"end":1282,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1331,"end":1339,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":1529,"end":1536,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":1631,"end":1639,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"surgery","start":1768,"end":1775,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":1936,"end":1944,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2094,"end":2102,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":2312,"end":2319,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":2381,"end":2389,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":2455,"end":2462,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":2557,"end":2565,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":2611,"end":2618,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":2646,"end":2654,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2704,"end":2712,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":2771,"end":2778,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":2783,"end":2791,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"66, 46, 46, 34, 2, 34, 66, 46, 1, 34, 34, 34, 46, 34, 49, 34, 34, 46, 34, 46, 34, 46, 34, 34, 46, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707152537,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

The objective of this study was to review existing and identify novel radiological and clinical characteristics of CM1 patients that associate syrinx development and surgical intervention.\tPatients with Chiari I malformation diagnosed on imaging between 0 and 18\u00a0years were retrospectively reviewed from January 1, 2007 to February 12, 2020.

Our results showed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of scopolamine leads to learning and memory dysfunction, whereas the administration of apigenin (synthetic compound, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) improved cognitive ability, which was confirmed by behavioral tests such as the T-maze test, novel objective recognition test, and Morris water maze test in mice. In addition, scopolamine-induced lipid peroxidation in the brain was attenuated by administration of apigenin. To further evaluate the protective mechanisms of apigenin on cognitive and memory function, Western blot analysis was carried out. Administration of apigenin decreased the B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio and suppressed caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. Furthermore, apigenin down-regulated the \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme, along with presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 protein levels. Apigenin-administered mice showed lower protein levels of a receptor for advanced glycation end-products, whereas insulin-degrading enzyme, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression were promoted by treatment with apigenin. Therefore, this study demonstrated that apigenin is an active substance that can improve cognitive and memory functions by regulating apoptosis, amyloidogenesis, and BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways.","_input_hash":-4702929,"_task_hash":473927361,"spans":[{"text":"mouse","start":246,"end":251,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mice","start":613,"end":617,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1202,"end":1206,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":1472,"end":1477,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"81, 82, 82, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707152653,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

Using a retrospective cohort design, this study analysed data collected from patients with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia in 2003 (index hospitalisation) in order to evaluate prescription patterns of antipsychotic drugs.\tPatients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia, at least one year prior membership with the insurance fund and a follow-up period of one year were identified. Results were standardised by age and stratified by the severity of their illness, defined by the number of hospital bed days during the three years preceding the index hospitalisation.\tA total of 3,121 patients with schizophrenia (male 56.4%, female 43.6%) received 56 692 single prescriptions of antipsychotics. Of these, 35.4% of the prescriptions were for typical and 64.6% for atypical antipsychotics; 55% were for high-potency, 45% for low-potency typical antipsychotics. The most frequently prescribed drugs were olanzapine (26.6%), clozapine (21.3%) and risperidone (19%). There were no relevant gender differences concerning prescription patterns. During a 12-month follow-up period after the first hospitalisation, 1 372 patients (43.9%) were treated exclusively with an atypical antipsychotic, another 499 patients (16%) had a combination of an atypical plus a low-potency typical antipsychotic. Thus, basal therapy with an atypical was observed in 59.9% of our study population. Only 327 patients (10.5%) were treated exclusively with a typical antipsychotic.

At present, cognitive impairment after HIE has received increasing attention. Synaptic plasticity determines the development of cognitive function, so it is urgent to develop new drugs that can improve HIE-induced cognitive impairment. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced neuroinflammation affects synaptic plasticity. As a SIRT1 agonist, resveratrol has a powerful anti-inflammatory effect, but whether it has an effect on impaired synaptic plasticity in HIE and the potential mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, resveratrol was used to intervene in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) mice, and the effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and further mechanisms were explored through performing neurobehavioral, morphological observations, Golgi sliver staining, western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments. We first found that resveratrol improves HI-induced long-term cognitive and memory deficits, and then we found that resveratrol reduces hippocampal neuronal damage and increases dendritic spine density and the expression of synaptic proteins. Finally, we found that this effect may be exerted by regulating the neuroinflammatory response mediated by the SIRT1/NF-\u03baB axis. This study provides a new theoretical basis for resveratrol to prevent long-term neurological dysfunction following HIBI.","_input_hash":-1606686897,"_task_hash":-1295610974,"spans":[{"text":"Mice","start":126,"end":130,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":812,"end":817,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"mice","start":893,"end":897,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":1535,"end":1540,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"82, 2, 82, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707152729,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

The serum concentration of phenytoin was well controlled within the therapeutic range; no seizures occurred. Four months later, combination therapy with doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) 800 mg/d, cyclophosphamide 100 mg/d, and medroxyprogesterone acetate 800 mg/d was initiated because of further metastasis. Approximately 1 month after the start of concurrent treatment with the antineoplastic agents, the serum phenytoin concentration was elevated to fourfold of the original concentration. Staggering was observed at that time, but toxic symptoms gradually subsided with the decline in the serum phenytoin concentration after its withdrawal.\tA probable explanation for the marked elevation of serum phenytoin concentration is a reduction of the capacity of CYP2C-dependent phenytoin metabolism, and the antineoplastic agents could be involved in this event. The interaction of fluorouracil and phenytoin is known in clinical practice, and it is reported that the expression of hepatic CYP2C enzymes is depressed by exposure of rats to fluorouracil. 5'-DFUR, a prodrug of fluorouracil, was considered the likeliest candidate responsible for the interaction.

A comparison of the percent DNA synthesis inhibition (assayed by 3H-thymidine uptake 30 min after irradiation), and a 24 h post-irradiation G2 phase accumulation determined by flow cytometry placed the AT heterozygotes and the NHL patients in an intermediate position between the normal subjects (with maximum DNA synthesis inhibition and minimum G2 phase accumulation) and the AT homozygotes (with minimum DNA synthesis inhibition and maximum G2 accumulation). The similarity between AT heterozygotes and the NHL patients with respect to the two parameters studied after irradiation was statistically significant. The data indicating a moderate abnormality in the control of cell cycle progression after irradiation in the LCLs and fibroblasts from NHL patients may explain the enhanced cellular and chromosomal radiosensitivity in these patients reported by us earlier. In addition to demonstrating a link between cell cycle abnormality and radiosensitivity as a possible basis for cancer susceptibility, particularly in the NHL patients, the present studies emphasized the usefulness of the assay for 24 h post-irradiation G2 phase accumulation developed by Lavin et al.

However, past pharmacological approaches have failed to resolve whether activation or blockade of this receptor would have greater therapeutic benefit. To address this issue, we generated compound mice expressing a human amyloid precursor protein gene with familial AD mutations in combination with deficiency of amylin receptors produced by hemizygosity for the critical calcitonin receptor subunit of this heterodimeric GPCR. These compound transgenic AD mice demonstrated attenuated responses to human amylin- and A\u03b2-induced depression of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in keeping with the genetic depletion of amylin receptors. Both the LTP responses and spatial memory (as measured with Morris water maze) in these mice were improved compared to AD mouse controls and, importantly, a reduction in both the amyloid plaque burden and markers of neuroinflammation was observed.

{"pmid":"28428190","text":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research^\nIn Vivo Detection of EGFRvIII in Glioblastoma via Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signature Consistent with Deep Peritumoral Infiltration: The \u03c6-Index.^\nPurpose: The epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) mutation has been considered a driver mutation and therapeutic target in glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain cancer. Currently, detecting EGFRvIII requires postoperative tissue analyses, which are ex vivo and unable to capture the tumor's spatial heterogeneity. Considering the increasing evidence of in vivo imaging signatures capturing molecular characteristics of cancer, this study aims to detect EGFRvIII in primary glioblastoma noninvasively, using routine clinically acquired imaging.Experimental Design: We found peritumoral infiltration and vascularization patterns being related to EGFRvIII status. We therefore constructed a quantitative within-patient peritumoral heterogeneity index (PHI/\u03c6-index), by contrasting perfusion patterns of immediate and distant peritumoral edema. Application of \u03c6-index in preoperative perfusion scans of independent discovery (n = 64) and validation (n = 78) cohorts, revealed the generalizability of this EGFRvIII imaging signature.Results: Analysis in both cohorts demonstrated that the obtained signature is highly accurate (89.92%), specific (92.35%), and sensitive (83.77%), with significantly distinctive ability (P = 4.0033 \u00d7 10[-10], AUC = 0.8869). Findings indicated a highly infiltrative-migratory phenotype for EGFRvIII[+] tumors, which displayed similar perfusion patterns throughout peritumoral edema. Contrarily, EGFRvIII[-] tumors displayed perfusion dynamics consistent with peritumorally confined vascularization, suggesting potential benefit from extensive peritumoral resection/radiation.Conclusions: This EGFRvIII signature is potentially suitable for clinical translation, since obtained from analysis of clinically acquired images. Use of within-patient heterogeneity measures, rather than population-based associations, renders \u03c6-index potentially resistant to inter-scanner variations. Overall, our findings enable noninvasive evaluation of EGFRvIII for patient selection for targeted therapy, stratification into clinical trials, personalized treatment planning, and potentially treatment-response evaluation.

Yet, few studies have examined risk factors related to suicidal ideation (SI) among children aged 12 and younger. Aims: The current study addresses this gap. Method: A questionnaire was filled out by 1,350 Flemish primary caregivers (94.7% mothers) of 9-year-old children (50.4% boys, Mage = 9.45). Their responses were analyzed using logistic regression and independent samples t tests. Results: The presence of passive SI was reported in 10.5% of the children. A psychiatric, developmental, or behavioral condition (or multiple conditions), a learning disorder, impulsivity, aggression, and experiencing multiple stressful family life events were discovered as potential risk factors of passive SI in childhood. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of this study meant that causality could not be inferred. In addition, it was based on reports of primary caregivers, rather than on reports from the children themselves. Conclusion: These new empirical findings can be used for the development of prevention programs and be taken into account in risk assessments of SI in clinical practice. Confirmation of our findings in a longitudinal child-reported study is needed.","_input_hash":2036532201,"_task_hash":669115466,"spans":[{"text":"Aims","start":270,"end":274,"pattern":-2080524606},{"text":"study","start":288,"end":293,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"questionnaire","start":324,"end":337,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"study","start":918,"end":923,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"longitudinal","start":1285,"end":1297,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"study","start":1313,"end":1318,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"43, 2, 57, 2, 52, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707153029,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

It is unclear whether white matter degeneration occurs throughout the whole brain, or whether patterns of degeneration occur more in specific brain areas.\tWe prospectively collected National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with acute ischemic stroke within the first week after onset (baseline), and at 1 and 3 months. DTI was processed to produce maps of fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficients, and axial and radial diffusivity. DTI parameters in specified regions-of-interest corresponding to items on the NIHSS were calculated and changes over time were assessed using linear mixed-effect modeling.\tSeventeen patients were included in the study. Mean age (SD) was 71 (11.7) years, and median (IQR) baseline NIHSS 9 (5-13.3). Changes over time were observed in both visual cortices, contralesional primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and superior temporal gyrus (P < .05).

A baseline sample of 1195 13-year-old pupils was from 22 randomly selected schools in the Hordaland County in western Norway. Latent class growth analysis revealed three developmental trajectories. The first trajectory was a conventional trajectory, comprising 36.3% of participants, who showed changes in smoking, physical exercise, fruit intake, and drunkenness consistent with the prevailing age specific norms of these behaviors in the Norwegian society at the time. The second trajectory was a passive trajectory, comprising 25.5% of participants, who reported low levels of both healthy and unhealthy behaviors during the 17-year period. The third trajectory was an unhealthy trajectory, comprising 38.2% of participants, who had high levels of unhealthy behaviors over time. Several covariates were examined, but only sex and mother's and father's educational levels were found to be significantly associated with the identified trajectories. While these findings need to be replicated in future studies, the identification of the different trajectories suggests the need to tailor intervention according to specific needs.","_input_hash":1902413739,"_task_hash":-241057442,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":241,"end":246,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"randomly","start":476,"end":484,"pattern":985041104},{"text":"intervention","start":1508,"end":1520,"pattern":-2001382570}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 25, 48"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707153068,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

The developed program of the complex differentiated medical and psychological rehabilitation and suicidal behaviour prevention (MPRS BP) in patients with dementia is aimed at the preventive measures of the suicidal behaviour (SB) through the depressive symptoms reduction, patient's mind and cognitive status stabilization, self-aggression decreases, social functioning and independence increase in patients with dementia. The individual approach to the prevention of SB in patients with dementia considered the SB factors (extra- and intrapersonal), SB formation mechanisms (cognitive, depressive, and psychological), clinical psychopathological SB correlators (especially gender-based) in different types of dementia.

In contrast, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, is associated with acute and neurodevelopmental propsychotic side effects through its interaction with central cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs). CB1R stimulation in the ventral hippocampus (VHipp) potentiates affective memory formation through inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, thereby altering emotional salience attribution. These changes in DA activity and salience attribution, evoked by dysfunctional VHipp regulatory actions and THC exposure, could predispose susceptible individuals to psychotic symptoms. Although THC can accelerate the onset of schizophrenia, CBD displays antipsychotic properties, can prevent the acquisition of emotionally irrelevant memories, and reverses amphetamine-induced neuronal sensitization through selective phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) molecular signaling pathway. This review summarizes clinical and preclinical evidence demonstrating that distinct phytocannabinoids act within the VHipp and associated corticolimbic structures to modulate emotional memory processing through changes in mesolimbic DA activity states, salience attribution, and signal transduction pathways associated with schizophrenia-related pathology.","_input_hash":-1281063069,"_task_hash":-1955473836,"spans":[{"text":"review","start":1331,"end":1337,"pattern":692368738}],"meta":{"pattern":"4"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707153196,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

The goal of the current study was to investigate whether the observed impulse-control deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts would generalize to other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity, such as delay discounting and behavioral inhibition among a group of relatively 'pure' heroin addicts in Bulgaria who participated in our previous study.\tWe tested 92 currently abstinent male heroin addicts, classified as psychopathic or non-psychopathic based on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R). We administered two neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity: (1) Delayed Rewards Discounting Task, a measure of temporal discounting of rewards; and (2) Passive Avoidance Learning Task, a measure of behavioral inhibition.\tPsychopathic heroin addicts were not impaired relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts on the Delayed Rewards Discounting Task and the Passive Avoidance Learning Task, on the latter of which they showed better attentional capacity.\tThese results indicate that psychopathic heroin users are not uniformly impaired across neurocognitive domains of impulsivity.

In order to investigate olfactory perception in different depressive states, we carried out olfactory testing during a depressive episode (n=37) and in a remitted state (n=17). As expected, patients were significantly less depressed (p<0.001) and less anhedonic (p=0.001) in the remitted state. A comparison of olfactory perception between age- and gender-matched patients and healthy volunteers (n=37) controlled for intrinsic olfactory deficits in major depression. In the depressive episode, we applied regression analyses to investigate the relation of olfactory hedonics, severity of depression and anhedonia. The Sniffin' Sticks Test extended by analogue rating scales for intensity and hedonic estimates was employed for olfactory testing. Depression severity was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), anhedonia with the Snaith-Hamilton-Pleasure-Scale (SHAPS). Odour identification ability was significantly reduced during the depressive state. In contrast, no significant differences in hedonic and intensity estimates could be found between the depressive and the remitted state and healthy controls. During the depressive episode, we found a significant relation only between anhedonia and olfactory hedonics. We concluded that anhedonia has potential impact on olfactory hedonics in major depression. Our results indicate the need for (1) confirmatory studies in severe melancholic depression and (2) investigation of the impact of anhedonia on olfactory hedonics in psychiatric diseases other than major depression.","_input_hash":1789872780,"_task_hash":1306700010,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":106,"end":111,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":541,"end":549,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":715,"end":723,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"controlled","start":754,"end":764,"pattern":-610699305}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 34, 34, 27"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707153247,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10","_session_id":"2024-02-05_17-23-10"}

The early form of the illness is found in young patients, generally less than 30 years old, and the main clinical manifestation is a migraine headache with subcortical lesions in the white matter, while in the later form ischemic events and behavioral symptoms are predominant. Anatomo-pathological findings in CADASIL include the presence of osmophilic granular deposits in vessel walls, skin, muscles and cerebral arteries. We present a patient with CADASIL and cavernous angioma. We studied a 40-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a left temporal-parietal cavernous angioma, with aphasia as the only symptom, two years before admission. Her family history showed that her father had suffered from vascular dementia. She was admitted to our hospital with right-side hemiparesis and dysarthria. A CT scan showed the presence of ischemic vascular lesions and former surgery sequelae. The duplex scan of the neck vessels and a transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out an embolic source. Laboratory tests including VDRL, HIV, prothrombotic profile and rheumatologic screening tests were normal. An MRI in T2W and FLAIR showed the presence of multiple subcortical cerebral lesions and hyperintensity in the white matter (leukoencephalopaty).

A molecular DNA test was performed, and a nucleotide substitution in position 583 in exon 4 of gene Notch3 was detected. This mutation was found only in CADASIL patients. The association with cavernous angioma has not been previously reported, and we believe that it was unrelated to CADASIL, either clinically or genetically.

We evaluated the effects of the neuroactive peptide, DNSP-11 following repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation over the course of 10-weeks in Rhesus macaques. This approach allowed us to examine striatal target engagement, safety and tolerability, and brain distribution following a single [125]I-labeled DNSP-11 dose.\tOur initial data support that repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation of DNSP-11 resulted in bilateral, striatal target engagement based on neurochemical changes in dopamine (DA) metabolites-without observable, adverse behavioral effects or weight loss in NHPs. Furthermore, a [125]I-labeled DNSP-11 study illustrates diffuse rostral to caudal distribution in the brain including the striatum-our target region of interest.\tThe results of this study are compared to our experiments in normal and 6-OHDA lesioned rats, where DNSP-11 was repeatedly delivered intranasally using a micropipette with animals under light sedation.\tThe results from this proof-of-concept study support the utility of our repeated intranasal dosing methodology in awake Rhesus macaques, to evaluate the effects of neuroactive compounds on the NHP brain. Additionally, results indicate that DNSP-11 can be safely and effectively delivered intranasally in MPTP-treated NHPs, while engaging the DA system.","_input_hash":-629559594,"_task_hash":1404688053,"spans":[{"text":"Methodology","start":33,"end":44,"pattern":-2114709687},{"text":"methodology","start":417,"end":428,"pattern":-2114709687},{"text":"human","start":510,"end":515,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":1205,"end":1210,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1349,"end":1354,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1570,"end":1575,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"methodology","start":1630,"end":1641,"pattern":-2114709687}],"meta":{"pattern":"62, 62, 0, 2, 2, 2, 62"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707497294,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46","_session_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46"}

Abnormal concentrations of amino acids and of neurotransmitter metabolites have been found in plasma, platelets and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, and in plasma and CSF of patients with a delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolite levels in plasma of AD patients with a concurrent delirium.\tIn a case-control study of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) with concurrent delirium, we investigated the contribution of delirium to some biochemical parameters in blood.

Therefore Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention is becoming a global health priority. Our knowledge of the pathophysiological process leading to the development of pathological brain lesions that characterize AD has increased exponentially in recent years. However, the phenotypic expression of AD not only depends on the development of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but other factors also play a role. Thus, over the last few decades, epidemiological studies have revealed several risk factors for developing AD, such as vascular or lifestyle related factors. Having the current knowledge on AD, two different strategies have been developed for the prevention of AD: one is based on primary prevention by acting on modifiable risk factors, the other is a pathophysiology-driven approach aimed to identify individuals in a preclinical stage of the disease and treating them with drugs purporting to act on molecular targets of the amyloid cascade. Several promising trials with these approaches are currently ongoing and results are expected in the next few years. The intrinsic limitations in the design of preventive trials should be overcome through a global effort involving healthy population, healthcare professionals, governments, industry, and scientific institutions.

It has high affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and a1-adrenergic receptors, and a low potential for extrapyramidal symptoms.\tThe pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability, and cost-effectiveness of sertindole are covered in this article, based on a literature review (PubMed) from 1990 to 2014.\tThe reviewed studies suggest a beneficial effect of sertindole on positive, negative and cognitive symptoms, and on relapse prevention.

Of these, seven were actual or possible RCTs, but only two were found to meet the requirements of the set of minimal methodological criteria.\tThe very limited amount of reliable evidence available is in favour of massage and touch interventions for problems associated with dementia. However, this evidence addresses only two specific applications: hand massage for the immediate or short-term reduction of agitated behaviour, and the addition of touch to verbal encouragement to eat for the normalization of nutritional intake. The existing evidence does not support general conclusions about the effect or possible side effects of such interventions. No severe side effects were identified.\tMassage and touch may serve as alternatives or complements to other therapies for the management of behavioural, emotional and perhaps other conditions associated with dementia.

It is a progressive and well recognized complex disease; therefore, it is very urgent to develop novel and effective anti-AD drugs. In this study, a series of novel isochroman-4-one derivatives from natural (\u00b1)-7,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-isochroman-4-one [(\u00b1)-XJP] were designed and synthesized, and their anti-AD potential was evaluated. Among them, compound 10a [(Z)-3-acetyl-1-benzyl-4-((6,7-dimethoxy-4-oxoisochroman-3-ylidene)methyl)pyridin-1-ium bromide] possessed potent anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as well as modest antioxidant activity. Further molecular modeling and kinetic investigations revealed that compound 10a was a dual-binding inhibitor that binds to both catalytic anionic site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the enzyme AChE. In addition, compound 10a exhibited low cytotoxicity and moderate anti-A\u03b2 aggregation efficacy. Moreover, the in silico screening suggested that these compounds could pass across the blood-brain barrier with high penetration. These findings show that compound 10a was a promising lead from a natural product with potent AChE inhibitory activity and deserves to be further developed for the prevention and treatment of AD.","_input_hash":1457292628,"_task_hash":-650839265,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":450,"end":455,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707497649,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46","_session_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46"}

We confirm and extend previous observations of virus persistence in the brain, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, thyroid and reticuloendothelial system. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time persistence of viral nucleic acid in specific cell types in the thymus, lymph nodes, testes and bladder, and the adrenal, parathyroid and salivary glands; the cell types infected were observed in several animals. In lymphoid tissue, viral nucleic acid was predominantly located in the T cell-dependent areas of the spleen and lymph nodes; it was also present in cells of the thymic medulla. This has important implications for the deficiency in T cell function observed in persistently infected mice. In the testes, viral nucleic acid was detected in spermatogonia but not differentiating spermatocytes and therefore, in this tissue at least, persistence is related to the state of differentiation of the cell. Endocrine and exocrine dysfunctions have been described in persistently infected mice and we report that the highest levels of viral nucleic acid were found in the adrenal gland. The infection of endocrine and exocrine tissue was not pantropic, specific cell types expressed viral nucleic acid in each tissue. In the adrenal cortex, cells of the zona reticularis and zona fasciculata but not the zona glomerulosa were positive, whereas in the adrenal medulla viral nucleic acid was predominantly localized to adrenalin-secreting cells.

Grasping the Opportunity is a Chinese Internet intervention, which was translated and modified from CATCH-IT developed in the West. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Grasp the Opportunity in reducing depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents.\tIn this randomized controlled trial, Chinese adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms were recruited from three secondary schools in Hong Kong. The participants (n = 257) were randomly assigned to receive either intervention or attention control. The primary outcome was the improvement in depressive symptoms according to the revised Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-R) at the 12-month follow-up. Analyses were performed using intention to treat (ITT).\tThe participants were randomly assigned to receive the intervention (n = 130) or attention control (n = 127).

We screened neurocognitive functioning in 103 adolescents with SCD (16-17 years, 50% female) and compared outcomes between patients with a history of exposure to hydroxycarbamide (n = 12 HbSC/HbS\u03b2[+] thalassaemia; n = 52 HbSS/HbS\u03b2[0] thalassaemia) and those never treated with hydroxycarbamide (n = 31 HbSC/HbS\u03b2[+] thalassaemia; n = 8 HbSS/HbS\u03b2[0] thalassaemia). Demographic distributions were similar between the groups. After adjusting for socioeconomic status, the hydroxycarbamide group had significantly higher scores on nonverbal IQ (HbSC/HbS\u03b2 thalassaemia: P = 0\u00b7036, effect size [d] = 0\u00b765), reaction speed (HbSS/HbS\u03b2[0] thalassaemia: P = 0\u00b7002, d = 1\u00b770), sustained attention (HbSS/HbS\u03b2[0] thalassaemia: P = 0\u00b7014, d = 1\u00b730), working memory (HbSC/HbS\u03b2[+] thalassaemia: P = 0\u00b7034, d = 0\u00b771) and verbal memory (HbSC/HbS\u03b2[+] thalassaemia: P = 0\u00b7038, d = 0\u00b784) when compared to those who did not receive hydroxycarbamide.

In recent years, many studies have focused on the mechanism(s) of PQ neurotoxicity. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of manganese (III) meso-tetrakis (N,N'-diethylimidazolium) porphyrin (MnTDM), a superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic, on PQ-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in 1RB3AN27 (N27) cells, a dopaminergic neuronal cell line. The results indicated that MnTDM significantly attenuated PQ-induced loss of cell viability, glutathione depletion, and reactive oxygen species production. MnTDM also ameliorated PQ-induced morphological nuclear changes of apoptosis and increased rates of apoptosis. In addition, our data provide direct evidence that MnTDM suppressed PQ-induced caspase-3 cleavage, possibly a key event of PQ neurotoxicity. These observations suggested that oxidative stress and apoptosis are implicated in PQ-induced neurotoxicity and this toxicity could be prevented by MnTDM. These findings also proposed a novel therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease and other disorders associated with oxidative stress.","_input_hash":1091887404,"_task_hash":1779657938,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":409,"end":414,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cells","start":637,"end":642,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1279,"end":1290,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 70, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707497873,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46","_session_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46"}

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) and habituation of the startle reflex are operational measures of early information processing. Impaired PPI in schizophrenia has been replicated in many studies and is regarded as an endophenotype for schizophrenia. However, reports on the stability of PPI over a longer period of time are lacking, both for patients with schizophrenia and for healthy subjects. The current study examined 25 initially drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients and 23 healthy matched controls. Three PPI measures [stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) 30, 60, 120 ms] and habituation were assessed at baseline, and again after 6 yr. Sixteen patients and 17 healthy controls completed the study, and 13 patients and 17 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. The schizophrenia patients had PPI deficits compared to controls at baseline. After 6 yr, no significant group differences were found. PPI had increased significantly in the patients and had decreased significantly in controls. In addition, patients showed significantly less habituation than controls while habituation did not change in patients or controls. The present results show that PPI in drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients can improve significantly over time. As PPI increased in patients over the same period that it decreased in controls, it is likely that the increase was caused by disease-related factors such as disease process, clinical state, or medication.","_input_hash":1494168100,"_task_hash":-302241640,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":162,"end":167,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":676,"end":684,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":742,"end":747,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":810,"end":818,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":993,"end":1001,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":1040,"end":1045,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1054,"end":1062,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1142,"end":1150,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1298,"end":1306,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1365,"end":1373,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1462,"end":1470,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1561,"end":1569,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1627,"end":1635,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 34, 2, 34, 34, 2, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707497913,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46","_session_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46"}

Owing to recent advances in high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies, genetic research in both fields is evolving at a rapidly increasing pace making it more and more difficult to follow and evaluate the most significant progress in the field. To alleviate this problem, our groups have created dedicated and freely available online databases, ALSoD (http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk/) and ALSGene (http://www.alsgene.org), which provide systematic and in-depth qualitative and quantitative overviews of genetic research in both familial and sporadic ALS.

While amyloid deposition has been noted within atrial appendages, the incidence and significance remains incompletely understood. More accurate amyloid typing methodologies and targeted pharmacotherapeutics have recently been developed, prompting pathologists to provide more detailed information about the type of amyloid identified in such samples. This study sought to fully characterize the morphologic characteristics of atrial amyloid as well as its incidence and clinical significance. Tissue archives were queried for atrial appendages removed during the cardiac surgeries (2010-2014). Patient demographics, imaging features, and salient clinical findings were recorded. Pattern and extent of amyloid deposition were recorded. Typing of the amyloid protein, when present, was performed on a subset of cases by laser capture microdissection with mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. A total of 383 atrial appendages from 345 consecutive patients were included in the study (mean age, 69 years; range, 26-92 years). Amyloid was present in 46% of patients. A linear relationship was observed between age and presence of atrial amyloidosis. Women were more likely to have atrial amyloidosis. Two distinct morphologies of amyloid were observed: filamentous and nonfilamentous, and correlated perfectly with amyloid type (filamentous = AANF-type amyloid; nonfilamentous = ATTR-type amyloid). Filamentous deposits were observed in 91% of those with amyloid. Amyloid was more likely to be found in the left atrial appendage than the right. Patients with atrial amyloid, irrespective of type, were more likely to have experienced stroke or TIA and more likely to have atrial arrhythmia preoperatively. Postoperatively, those with atrial amyloid are more likely to experience recurrence of arrhythmia than those who did not have atrial amyloid. Understanding the morphologic characteristics of AANF-type amyloid will allow for identification by the light microscopy and obviates the need for expensive ancillary typing techniques. The finding of nonfilamentous amyloid, should still prompt confirmation of amyloid type so that targeted therapy may be employed.","_input_hash":-1396896614,"_task_hash":1444660385,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":156,"end":161,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":728,"end":733,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1323,"end":1331,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":1353,"end":1358,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1431,"end":1439,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Patients","start":1919,"end":1927,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":2513,"end":2520,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 2, 34, 2, 34, 34, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707498041,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46","_session_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46"}

{"pmid":"28566233","text":"Molecular genetics and metabolism^\nExpanding the genetic cause of multiple sulfatase deficiency: A novel SUMF1 variant in a patient displaying a severe late infantile form of the disease.^\nMultiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by defective cellular sulfatases. Activity of sulfatases depends on post-translational modification catalyzed by formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), encoded by the SUMF1 gene. SUMF1 pathologic variants cause MSD, a syndrome presenting with a complex phenotype. We describe the first Polish patient with MSD caused by a yet undescribed pathologic variant c.337G>A [p.Glu113Lys] (i.e. p.E113K) in heterozygous combination with the known deletion allele c.519+5_519+8del [p.Ala149_Ala173del]. The clinical picture of the patient initially suggested late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy, with developmental delay followed by regression of visual, hearing and motor abilities as the most apparent clinical symptoms. Transient signs of ichthyosis and minor dysmorphic features guided the laboratory workup towards MSD. Since MSD is a rare disease and there is a variable clinical spectrum, we thoroughly describe the clinical outcome of our patient. The FGE-E113K variant, expressed in cell culture, correctly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum but was retained intracellularly in contrast to the wild type FGE. Analysis of FGE-mediated activation of steroid sulfatase in immortalized MSD cells revealed that FGE-E113K exhibited only approx. 15% of the activity of wild type FGE. Based on the crystal structure we predict that the exchange of glutamate-113 against lysine should induce a strong destabilization of the secondary structure, possibly affecting the folding for correct disulfide bridging between C235-C346 as well as distortion of the active site groove that could affect both the intracellular stability as well as the activity of FGE. Thus, the novel variant of the SUMF1 gene obviously results in functionally impaired FGE protein leading to a severe late infantile type of MSD.","_input_hash":-473174795,"_task_hash":424651895,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":1467,"end":1472,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-case-report"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707498109,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46","_session_id":"2024-02-09_17-44-46"}

For future clinical trials quantitative data on disease progression rates are essential. Moreover, diagnosis can be challenging in ALD women, as the most important diagnostic biomarker is normal in 15-20%. Better biomarkers are needed. The purpose of this single centre cross-sectional follow-up study in women with ALD was to assess whether Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), AMC Linear Disability Scale (ALDS) and Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) can detect disease progression and to model the effect of age and duration of symptoms on the rate of progression. Moreover, we performed a pilot study to assess if a semi-targeted lipidomics approach can identify possible new diagnostic biomarkers.\tIn this study 46 women (baseline clinical data published by our group previously) were invited for a follow-up visit. Newly identified women at our center were also recruited. We analysed 65 baseline and 34 follow-up assessments. Median time between baseline and follow-up was 7.8\u2009years (range 6.4-8.7). Mean age at baseline was 49.2\u2009\u00b1\u200914.2\u2009years, at follow-up 55.4\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1. EDSS increased significantly (+\u20090.08 points/year), but the other outcome measures did not. Increasing age and duration of symptoms were associated with more disability. For the pilot study we analysed plasma of 20 ALD women and 10 controls with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, which identified 100 potential biomarker ratios with strong differentiating properties and non-overlapping data distributions between ALD women and controls.\tProgression of spinal cord disease can be detected with EDSS, but not with ALDS or SF-36 after a follow-up period of almost 8\u2009years. Moreover, age and the duration of symptoms seem positively associated with the rate of progression. Although a significant progression was measurable, it was below the rate generally conceived as clinically relevant. Therefore, EDSS, ALDS and SF-36 are not suitable as primary outcome measures in clinical trials for spinal cord disease in ALD women.

Regardless of rat sex, with the disease development xanthine oxidase (XO) activity and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression increased in spinal cord, whereas glutathione levels decreased. This was accompanied by the rise in spinal cord malondialdehyde level. On the other hand, with EAE development superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased, while O2[-] concentration increased only in spinal cord of male rats. Consequently, SOD activity was lower, whereas O2[-] concentration was higher in spinal cord of male rats with clinically manifested EAE. XO activity and iNOS mRNA expression were also elevated in their spinal cord. Consistently, in the effector phase of EAE the concentration of advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) was higher in spinal cord of male rats, which exhibit more severe neurological deficit than their female counterparts. In as much as data obtained in the experimental models could be translated to humans, the findings may be relevant for designing sex-specific antioxidant therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the study indicated that the increased pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance in plasma may be an early indicator of EAE development.

The underlying pathophysiology of sleep abnormalities across neuropsychiatric disorders remains unclear, and may involve the inter-play of several clinical variables and mechanistic pathways. In this review, we propose a heuristic framework in which reciprocal interactions of immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and mitochondrial pathways may drive sleep abnormalities across potentially neuroprogressive disorders. Specifically, it is proposed that systemic inflammation may activate microglial cells and astrocytes in brain regions involved in sleep and circadian regulation. Activated glial cells may secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (for example, interleukin-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha), nitric oxide and gliotransmitters, which may influence the expression of key circadian regulators (e.g., the Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) gene). Furthermore, sleep disruption may further aggravate oxidative and nitrosative, peripheral immune activation, and (neuro) inflammation across these disorders in a vicious pathophysiological loop. This review will focus on chronic fatigue syndrome, bipolar disorder, and multiple sclerosis as exemplars of neuro-immune disorders. We conclude that novel therapeutic targets exploring immune and oxidative & nitrosative pathways (p.e. melatonin and molecular hydrogen) hold promise in alleviating sleep and circadian dysfunction in these disorders.","_input_hash":-632270502,"_task_hash":-1639382578,"spans":[{"text":"review","start":615,"end":621,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"cells","start":918,"end":923,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1016,"end":1021,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"review","start":1493,"end":1499,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1644,"end":1655,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"4, 70, 70, 4, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707847098,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

There is, however, less knowledge about what psychological interventions may be helpful in reducing these symptoms. Evidence from the literature, to date, suggests that of the seven studies that have addressed this issue only four were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, all these studies included less than 100 patients with the vast majority reporting positive results. Overall, it seems that although cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT)-based psychological interventions appear to be efficacious in the treatment of PPTS, the studies are too small to draw any firm conclusions and should be subjected to larger good-quality RCTs.

{"pmid":"15956992","text":"Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology^\nConstitutively active micro opioid receptors mediate the enhanced conditioned aversive effect of naloxone in morphine-dependent mice.^\nNaloxone administration produces a robust conditioned place aversion (CPA) in opiate-naive rodents by blocking the action of enkephalins at mu opioid receptors. This aversive response is potentiated by prior exposure to morphine. In vitro studies indicate that morphine treatment may promote constitutive activity of mu opioid receptors. We hypothesized that such enhanced constitutive activity in vivo may underlie the increased aversive property of naloxone by uncovering the inverse agonist property of this drug. The CPA produced by naloxone was compared with that produced by the neutral antagonists 6-alpha- and 6-beta-naloxol in mice with and without prior morphine exposure. While all three drugs produced CPA, only naloxone CPA was enhanced by morphine given 20 h prior to each naloxone injection. Furthermore, only naloxone produced withdrawal jumping when given 20 h after morphine, even though 6-alpha-naloxol was able to produce jumping when given 4 h after morphine. These data suggest that morphine may enhance naloxone CPA by increasing levels of constitutively active mu receptors and further support the role of such constitutive activity in mediating naloxone-precipitated physical withdrawal. Such long-term changes in constitutive activity of the mu receptor induced by exogenous opiate exposure may thus be an important factor in hedonic homeostatic dysregulation proposed to underlie the addictive process.","_input_hash":1937995284,"_task_hash":538048144,"spans":[{"text":"mice","start":870,"end":874,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707847491,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

{"pmid":"16020051","text":"Issues in mental health nursing^\nExploring the benefits of an exercise program for people with schizophrenia: a qualitative study.^\nThe relationship between regular exercise and physical health and well-being is extensively documented in the literature. However, considerably less attention is devoted to the impact of exercise on health outcomes for people experiencing a mental illness. In response to the recognized paucity, a structured exercise program was developed and implemented for residents of a Community Care Unit in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Six residents participated in the program over a period of three months. This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study. A focus group interview was conducted with the resident participants (n=6), the exercise physiologists who developed and implemented the program (n=2), and nursing staff involved in implementing and supporting the program (n=4). Analysis of the data collected revealed that four main themes had emerged: the individual nature of the program, physical improvement, group dynamics, and future plans. The findings of this study suggest that involvement in the program produced very positive outcomes, most notably in the physical fitness of residents. The individual nature of the program which enabled gradual participation, and the cohesive approach of the group as a whole were considered very important factors contributing to the overall success. Furthermore, the participants planned to continue with some form of physical activity in the future. The potential value of regular exercise for patients experiencing a mental illness has significant implications for nursing and requires further research exploration.","_input_hash":808464578,"_task_hash":15248043,"spans":[{"text":"literature","start":242,"end":252,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"study","start":687,"end":692,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"interview","start":708,"end":717,"pattern":1942352714},{"text":"study","start":1113,"end":1118,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1588,"end":1596,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"5, 2, 58, 2, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707847519,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

The EncephalApp Stroop test is validated for its screening. The aim of the study was to define Tunisian norms for the test based on healthy controls norms and to estimate the prevalence of CHE in cirrhotic Tunisian patients. Methods: A prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted. Ambulatory or hospitalized cirrhotic patients aged 40 years and over were recruited at 11 centers. Healthy subjects aged 40 years and over were recruited at 8 centers. We used a translated Arabic version of the streamlined EncephalApp Stroop test. The task has two components: 'Off' and 'On' state depending on the discordance or concordance of the stimuli. Results: 142 patients were included. The mean age was 57.26 years [40-86]. 40 (28.17%) of cirrhotic patients who were included were diagnosed as having a minimal hepatic encephalopathy or CHE. Among the ineligible patients, 22 had overt hepatic encephalopathy. If we consider these patients, the overall prevalence rate of CHE was around 24.39% in cirrhotic patients. It was more frequent in women (34.21% vs 25.96%), and in patients whose level of school education is between 6 and 13 years. Its prevalence does not appear to be affected by gender, MELD score, etiology of cirrhosis and age group of patients, as these variables were independent with respective p according to the chi-square test 0.413; 0.736; 0.663 and 0.1. The stroop times (On / Off and On + Off) correlated significantly with each other, are associated significantly and positively with age (respective Pearson coefficients: 0.578; 0.567 and 0.6). The more the age increases, the more the stroop response times increases (p > 10 [-3]). Conclusions: EncephalApp Stroop test was an efficient screening tool for CHE in Tunisian cirrhotic patients.","_input_hash":-934431631,"_task_hash":1283307693,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":285,"end":290,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"prevalence","start":385,"end":395,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"patients","start":425,"end":433,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":488,"end":493,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":546,"end":554,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":880,"end":888,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":967,"end":975,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1081,"end":1089,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1149,"end":1157,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"prevalence","start":1171,"end":1181,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"patients","start":1225,"end":1233,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1292,"end":1300,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"prevalence","start":1364,"end":1374,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"score","start":1422,"end":1427,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"patients","start":1468,"end":1476,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1974,"end":1982,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 53, 34, 2, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 53, 34, 34, 53, 60, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707847588,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

Therefore, the Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART) was designed to quantify the extent of handicap in individuals. Using dimensions of handicap identified and described by the WHO, CHART uses measurable, behavioral terms to compare such individuals with the norms of able-bodied members of society. Test-retest, proxies, and independent raters have established the validity and reliability of CHART. Rasch analysis has verified the CHART scaling and scoring procedures. In addition, an initial application of CHART, with a group of 342 spinal cord injured individuals, is described. Beyond demonstrating the instrument's effectiveness in assessing the extent of handicap or social disadvantage, this application, by documenting rehabilitation outcomes, demonstrates the potential usefulness of CHART for program evaluation.","_input_hash":475458843,"_task_hash":-1018887588,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707847664,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

Despite growing efforts to understand associations between potential risk factors and outcomes after injury, prognosis is elusive and lacks the inclusion of genetic variables which may convey additional predictive power. This study assessed which factors contribute to pediatric QoL 6 and 18 months post-recruitment in 159 participants (mTBI = 52; orthopedic injury [OI] = 43; typically developing controls [TDC] = 64) aged 18 to 60 months at the time of injury (M = 37.50, SD = 11.69). Family environment, injury characteristics, and child cognitive-behavioral functioning were assessed at 6 months via parent questionnaires and socio-cognitive assessment. QoL was determined using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory at both time points. Genetic information (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] genotype) was collected using saliva samples. Hierarchical regression analyses testing biological, family-environmental, injury and cognitive-behavioral factors revealed that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was a significant independent predictor of better QoL 6 months post-injury in the mTBI group. Lower parental distress significantly and independently predicted higher QoL 18 months after mTBI, and 6 months post-recruitment in the TDC group. At 18 months, models were non-significant for both control groups. Genetic factors involved in neuroplasticity may play an important role in recovery 6 months after mTBI and contribute to outcome via their interplay with environmental factors. Over time, family factors appear to become the primary determinants of post-mTBI outcome.","_input_hash":1777339934,"_task_hash":-706419391,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":117,"end":122,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":596,"end":601,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707847689,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is a team-based, highly-coordinated approach to treating common mental health conditions in primary care that has a robust evidence base. Several recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams. As telehealth technology advances and uptake expands, understanding the evidence for remote CoCM becomes increasingly crucial to inform CoCM practice and implementation.\tThe objective of this study was to systematically review randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams in treating common psychiatric conditions in primary care and medical settings.\tPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to structure our review. Our search strategy and development of search terms was informed by knowledge and review of the CoCM literature. Articles were reviewed by 3 authors, and once selected, they were sent to 2 authors for further data extraction to describe various study characteristics and process measures relating to remote CoCM.\tThe literature search identified 13,211 articles, 9 of which met inclusion criteria. The 9 studies collectively demonstrate effectiveness of remote CoCM in treating a range of behavioral health conditions (depression [n\u00a0= 7], anxiety [n\u00a0= 2], and PTSD [n\u00a0= 1]), across various populations and settings. Sample sizes ranged from 191 patients to 704 patients, publication dates from 2004 to 2018, and studies were conducted from 2000 to 2014. Various process measures were also reported.\tAs the 9 studies included in our systematic review demonstrate, remote CoCM can be effective in treating a range of behavioral health conditions in various primary care and specialty medical settings. These findings suggest organizations may have more flexibility in building their CoCM team and drawing upon wider workforces than previously recognized. As recent shifts in telehealth policy and practice continue to motivate telehealth approaches, further research that can inform best practices for remote CoCM will be useful and valuable to those making organizational decisions when implementing integrated care models.","_input_hash":-877233575,"_task_hash":144521288,"spans":[{"text":"Systematic","start":134,"end":144,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"Review","start":145,"end":151,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"patients","start":200,"end":208,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"randomized","start":514,"end":524,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":525,"end":535,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trials","start":536,"end":542,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"study","start":793,"end":798,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"review","start":821,"end":827,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"randomized","start":828,"end":838,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":839,"end":849,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trials","start":850,"end":856,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"Systematic","start":1016,"end":1026,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"review","start":1091,"end":1097,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"review","start":1181,"end":1187,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"literature","start":1200,"end":1210,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"study","start":1344,"end":1349,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"literature","start":1416,"end":1426,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"patients","start":1744,"end":1752,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1760,"end":1768,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"systematic","start":1931,"end":1941,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"review","start":1942,"end":1948,"pattern":692368738}],"meta":{"pattern":"6, 4, 34, 18, 27, 75, 2, 4, 18, 27, 75, 6, 4, 4, 5, 2, 5, 34, 34, 6, 4"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707847693,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

Here, the novel Guide for Narrative Repair (GNaR) recently developed by (Thomsen et al., 2020) is introduced as a potentially useful tool to help people with AvPD in crafting more adaptive narrative identities. The guide is brought to life via a case study analysis of Adam, a male outpatient suffering from AvPD.

Early life stress (ELS), common in patients with psychiatric disorders, has independently been associated with memory biases, and confounds MDD versus control group comparisons. Furthermore, in most studies negative biases could have resulted from executive impairments rather than memory difficulties per se.\tTo investigate whether memory biases are relevant to MDD vulnerability and how they are influenced by ELS, we developed an associative recognition memory task for temporo-spatial contexts of social actions with low executive demands, which were matched across conditions (self-blame, other-blame, self-praise, other-praise). We included fifty-three medication-free remitted MDD (25 with ELS, 28 without) and 24 healthy control (HC) participants without ELS.\tOnly MDD patients with ELS showed a reduced bias (accuracy/speed ratio) towards memory for positive vs. negative materials when compared with MDD without ELS and with HC participants; attenuated positive biases correlated with number of past major depressive episodes, but not current symptoms. There were no biases towards self-blaming or self-praising memories.\tThis demonstrates that reduced positive biases in associative memory were specific to MDD patients with ELS rather than a general feature of MDD, and were associated with lifetime recurrence risk which may reflect a scarring effect. If replicated, our results would call for stratifying MDD patients by history of ELS when assessing and treating emotional memories.","_input_hash":852871014,"_task_hash":1322029319,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":433,"end":441,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1175,"end":1183,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1620,"end":1628,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1821,"end":1829,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"history","start":1833,"end":1840,"pattern":-1634665066}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 34, 34, 64"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707847779,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

This report provides detailed results on the metabolic effects of pioglitazone and the trial's prespecified secondary aim of diabetes prevention.\tA total of 3,876 patients with recent ischemic stroke or TIA, no history of diabetes, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <126 mg/dL, and insulin resistance by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score >3.0 were randomly assigned to pioglitazone or placebo. Surveillance for diabetes onset during the trial was accomplished by periodic interviews and annual FPG testing.\tAt baseline, the mean FPG, HbA1c, insulin, and HOMA-IR were 98.2 mg/dL (5.46 mmol/L), 5.8% (40 mmol/mol), 22.4 \u03bcIU/mL, and 5.4, respectively.

Wistar rats were subjected to BCCAo procedure under anaesthesia to induce VaD. The rats were subjected to Morris water maze (MWM) test (6th day onwards post-surgery). MWM test was employed to assess learning and memory of the animals whereby escape latency time, time spent in target quadrant and Path length (distance travelled) taken as important parameters. Serum nitrite level; Brain thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels; Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; brain Myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and neutrophil count were estimated as per standard procedures. BCCAo in rats produced a significant vascular endothelial dysfunction, as reflected by decrease in serum nitrite levels. Further, these animals showed poor performance on MWM, depicting impairment of learning and memory. There was a significant rise in brain oxidative stress level as indicated by increase in TBARS and decrease in GSH levels. An increase in brain AChE activity was also observed. Moreover, these rats also exhibited an increase in MPO activity and neutrophil infiltration in brain (as marker of inflammation). Treatment of Carnosine (200 and 400 mg/kg, i.p.)/Donepezil (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) ameliorated BCCAo-induced memory deficits; endothelial dysfunction; biochemical and histopathological changes. It is concluded that Carnosine has shown efficacy in rat model of BCCAo-induced VaD and can be considered as an important therapeutic agent for the treatment of VaD.","_input_hash":1081466890,"_task_hash":1100579581,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":86,"end":89,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"vascular","start":149,"end":157,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"study","start":181,"end":186,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rat","start":253,"end":256,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"vascular","start":324,"end":332,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"surgery","start":506,"end":513,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"vascular","start":1005,"end":1013,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"rat","start":1737,"end":1740,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1806,"end":1817,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 66, 2, 92, 66, 49, 66, 92, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707847863,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

Further, through immunohistochemical illumination, distinct classes of genes were found whose protein products localized to infiltrating macrophages, endothelial cells and resident glia, such as CD163, Glut5, and ISG15. In addition we found proteins induced in cortical neurons (ie, cyclin D3, tissue transglutaminase, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and STAT1), which have not previously been described as participating in simian immunodeficiency virus or HIV-related CNS pathology. This molecular phenotyping in the infected brains revealed pathways promoting entry of macrophages into the brain and their subsequent detrimental effects on neurons. These data support the hypothesis that in HIV-induced CNS disease products of activated macrophages and astrocytes lead to CNS dysfunction by directly damaging neurons, as well as by induction of altered gene and protein expression profiles in neurons themselves which are deleterious to their function.","_input_hash":537219458,"_task_hash":-764080443,"spans":[{"text":"genes","start":67,"end":72,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"human","start":182,"end":187,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"monkey","start":318,"end":324,"pattern":1909560603},{"text":"genes","start":359,"end":364,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"genes","start":615,"end":620,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"cells","start":706,"end":711,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"78, 0, 83, 78, 78, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707848029,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

Three clinical forms of Gaucher disease have been described: type 1 as non-neuronopathic, type 2 as acute neuronopathic, and type 3 as subacute neuronopathic. We recently identified a rare mutation (G-->A at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1604) [Choy et al., 1994a, Am J Med Genet 51:156-160] and a novel mutation (T-->G at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1366) in two type 1 Gaucher patients by sequence analysis of the entire glucocerebrosidase coding region [Choy et al., 1994a, 1994b, Hum Mol Genet 3:821-823]. To demonstrate that these are deleterious and not neutral mutations, we cloned the full-length glucocerebrosidase cDNA of patients and of a normal control in the plasmid vector pAcUW1, recombined the human gene into the Baculovirus genome downstream of its polyhedron p10 promoter, and expressed the inserted gene in cultured cells of Spodoptera frugiperda transfected by recombinant Baculovirus. The levels of residual glucocerebrosidase activity determined in transfected cells with the Gaucher G1604A and T1366G alleles are 6.9% and 2.9% of that expressed by the normal allele (normal = 352.0 nmol/hr/mg protein or 100%). By comparison, the enzyme-specific activity expressed in transfected cells by 2 known Gaucher alleles, A1226G and T1448C, that are prevalent in type 1 and type 2 Gaucher disease are 23.4% and 3.3% of normal. No endogeneous glucocerebrosidase activity was detected in cultured cells transfected by either the wild-type Baculovirus or Baculovirus with the pAcUW1 plasmid vector without the glucocerebrosidase cDNA insert. These findings show that the Baculovirus expression system in cultured Spodoptera frugiperda cells is a suitable system for the functional expression and characterization of the normal and mutant glucocerebrosidase alleles. Moreover, the use of this expression system demonstrates that the G1604A and T1366G mutations are both deleterious mutations resulting in profoundly deficient glucocerebrosidase activity and subsequent Gaucher disease.","_input_hash":-1950431642,"_task_hash":643124036,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":717,"end":725,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":970,"end":978,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"human","start":1048,"end":1053,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":1174,"end":1179,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1322,"end":1327,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1542,"end":1547,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1749,"end":1754,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1986,"end":1991,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 0, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707848127,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

These findings extend recent reports of the chronicity of abuse and have implications for care providers. The standard of care for abuse assessments may need to be expanded to include consideration of lifetime physical and sexual abuse experiences of pregnant and postpartum women.","_input_hash":-1161521845,"_task_hash":101497824,"spans":[{"text":"history","start":719,"end":726,"pattern":-1634665066}],"meta":{"pattern":"64"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707848132,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

The Social Inclusion Questionnaire User Experience (SInQUE) is a new measure of social inclusion for mental health service users which assesses five domains (consumption, production, access to services, social integration and civil engagement). It has good psychometric properties and is acceptable to service users and mental health professionals. It is not clear whether individuals with different diagnostic conditions experience a similar reduction in social inclusion.\t(1) Investigate whether current social inclusion differs between diagnostic groups (people with schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders, common mental disorder or personality disorder); (2) Identify factors associated with lower social inclusion; (3) Examine associations between social inclusion and stigma, quality of life and loneliness.\tMental health service users with psychotic disorder, personality disorder or common mental disorder, living in the community, completed the SInQUE, alongside other validated outcome measures. Multiple regression investigated associations.\tAbout 192 service users (55% with psychotic disorder; 26% with common mental disorder; 19% with personality disorder). Current social inclusion did not vary according to diagnosis, except for the sub-domain of productivity, where individuals with personality disorder were more socially included than the other two groups. Lower social inclusion was associated with older age (p\u2009=\u2009.008), lack of higher education (p\u2009<\u2009.001), more previous admissions (p\u2009=\u2009.005), severity of current symptoms and greater experienced stigma (p\u2009=\u2009.006) and anticipated stigma (p\u2009=\u2009.035). Greater social inclusion was associated with better quality of life (p\u2009<\u2009.001) and less loneliness (p\u2009<\u2009.001).\tBarriers to social inclusion in individuals with severe mental health problems include factors related to the illness, such as symptom severity and external factors, such as stigma and discrimination. Social inclusion is a recovery goal and should be routinely assessed.

We hypothesized that the parenchymal abnormality on CTASI in faster scanners would overestimate ischemic core.\tThis prospective study assessed the correlation of Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on NCCT, CTASI, and computed tomography perfusion (CTP) with final infarct size in patients within 8 hours of AIS. Follow-up with NCCT or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 24 hours. Correlations of NCCT and CTASI with final infarct size and with CTP parameters were assessed. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients who underwent intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Inter-rater reliability was tested using Spearman's rank correlation. A P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.\tA total of 105 patients were included in the final analysis. NCCT had a stronger correlation with the final infarct size than did CTASI (Spearman's \u03c1\u2009=\u2009.85 versus .78, P\u2009=\u2009.13).

S8 and Prx2) genes by characterizing the expression of the human orthologs and their potential for causing specific human malformations. The expression pattern of PRRX2 and its close relative, PRRX1, were analyzed in human tissue by RT-PCR. Although the expression of these human genes is similar to their mouse orthologs, there are notable differences in expression. PRRX2 was detected in the human kidney and lung, whereas in mice and chickens neither of these tissues has been reported to express Prrx2. For PRRX1 the expression pattern was quite similar to other vertebrates, but the ratio of the two isoforms was reversed. To begin the search for the gene-disease connection, both genes were mapped to human chromosomes by FISH. The PRRX1 locus maps to 1q23, whereas the PRRX2 locus maps to 9q34.1. This localization, along with the recently described phenotypes of the gene-targeted Prrx1, Prrx2 and double mutant mice, enabled us to search the human disease databases for similar malformations. This examination suggested that mutations at the PRRX1 and/or PRRX2 loci could result in Nager Acrofacial Dysostosis (NAFD) syndrome.

These included problem-solving, ruminating, and self-blaming thoughts. Compared to clinic-referred children, nonreferred children reported more problem solving and less ruminating. In the nonreferred group, increasing age was associated with more problem solving and less ruminating. No such age-related associations were found in the clinic-referred group. The 2 groups did not differ in the types of worry-termination strategies they reported, but clinic-referred children were more likely to keep worrying until the perceived threat was removed.

{"pmid":"29039020","text":"Molecular neurobiology^\nSystemic Inflammation and Multimodal Biomarkers in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.^\nThere is increasing evidence suggesting that one of the most relevant pathophysiological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuroinflammation, which plays an important role in the production and regulation of AD-related proteins (amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and Tau) and exacerbates AD pathology. Neuroinflammation can also be induced by systemic influences (factors from outside the central nervous system). However, the role of systemic inflammation in AD pathophysiology is much less understood. Thus, our main objective in this study was to verify whether the presence of serum cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1) affects different AD biomarkers: A\u03b21-42 and Tau protein levels, hippocampal volumes (HV), and default mode network functional connectivity (DMN FC) in healthy elderly controls, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients due to AD, and mild AD patients. To accomplish this, we acquired 3-T MRI, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 42 healthy controls, 55 aMCI patients due to AD, and 33 mild AD patients. Comparing the groups, we found that the mild AD patients presented smaller HV, disrupted DMN FC, and proportionally less IL-1\u03b2 than the controls. The aMCI patients only differed from the controls in DMN FC. In intra-group comparison, aMCI and mild AD with detectable levels of cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, and IL-12) had decreased DMN FC. On the other hand, patients with detectable levels of IL-10 and IL-12 presented a more favorable AD biomarkers profile (larger HV, more CSF A\u03b21-42, and less p-Tau), indicating a possible protective role of these ILs. Our findings indicate a possible relationship between systemic inflammation with DMN FC disruption, hippocampal atrophy, and CSF protein levels in the subjects with mild AD and aMCI.","_input_hash":1476451717,"_task_hash":-138687263,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":663,"end":668,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":981,"end":989,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1013,"end":1021,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1143,"end":1151,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1178,"end":1186,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1236,"end":1244,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1343,"end":1351,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1549,"end":1557,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707848360,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

Centrally administered NPY suppresses alcohol drinking in subpopulations of rats vulnerable to the development of high alcohol-drinking behavior. The purpose of the current study was to determine the role of NPY in the CeA on elevated alcohol drinking produced by alcohol dependence. Adult male Wistar rats were trained to respond for 10% w/v alcohol in an operant situation with the use of a supersaccharin fading procedure. Following stabilization of responding, rats were divided into two groups matched for intake and given daily access to either alcohol-containing (9.2% v/v) liquid diet or an isocaloric control diet. Following extended access to the diet and reliable separation of operant responding between dependent and non-dependent rats during 6-h withdrawal tests, all rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae aimed at the CeA. Rats were then infused with 4 NPY doses (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 microg/0.5 microl aCSF) in a within-subjects Latin-square design during acute withdrawal and tested for operant alcohol responding 30 min later. Alcohol-dependent rats exhibited higher operant alcohol responding than non-dependent rats when infused with vehicle, but responding was similar in the two groups following infusion of all doses of NPY. These results indicate that NPY abolishes dependence-induced elevations in alcohol drinking and implicate the recruitment of limbic NPY systems in the motivational drive to consume alcohol following the transition to dependence.","_input_hash":126640348,"_task_hash":-1050224202,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":518,"end":523,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707848483,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

It is possible that ignorance and stigma prevent such persons from seeking appropriate help, and that community attitudes and beliefs play a role in determining the help-seeking behaviour and successful treatment of the mentally ill. Nevertheless, there is little research on the attitudes of lay persons toward mental illness within the South African community.\tThe aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of the general South African public toward mental illness, specifically regarding the causes of illness and treatment options.\tThe study design employed a questionnaire survey. Structured interviews (n = 667) were conducted with members of the general public. One of eight vignettes, portraying depression, schizophrenia, panic disorder or substance abuse, with subtle or obvious symptoms, was presented to each respondent.\tThe main findings were that cases were most often conceptualised as stress-related or due to a lack of willpower rather than as medical disorders. Treatment advocated was more often to talk the problem over than to consult professional medical help. Psychotherapy was the preferred treatment option, particularly in vignettes where symptom presentation was subtle, and in cases of substance abuse.\tThese data suggest that stigma and misinformation regarding mental illness exist, influencing preferred treatment modality and help-seeking behaviour. More work needs to be done to educate the public about the psychobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and about the value of effective treatments. A better understanding of these disorders amongst the public would presumably lessen stigmatisation and encourage the use of currently available and effective interventions.","_input_hash":-1407491298,"_task_hash":1466770441,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":712,"end":717,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":896,"end":901,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"questionnaire","start":920,"end":933,"pattern":-759522552}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 2, 57"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707848503,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

Recently, many researchers demonstrated downregulation of PRSS8 in cancer tissues as well as its tumor suppressor role in cancer development. However, the biological functions of PRSS8 in glioma remain unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated a decreased expression of PRSS8 in glioma tissues and cell lines. PRSS8 upregulation inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, xenograft experiments showed that PRSS8 overexpression suppressed glioma cell growth in vivo. We also found that upregulated PRSS8 reduced the protein expression levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR in glioma cells. Taken together, our study demonstrated that overexpression of PRSS8 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, PRSS8 may act as a novel therapeutic target for glioma.","_input_hash":1587637603,"_task_hash":-1506210454,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":259,"end":264,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":492,"end":497,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cells","start":874,"end":879,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":901,"end":906,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1094,"end":1105,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 2, 70, 2, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707848525,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

Access to preventive health care services, including genital human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations, may mitigate the impact of ACEs on adverse health outcomes. Our objective was to assess associations between ACEs and HPV vaccination coverage among young adults.\tWe included 3415 respondents aged 18 to 29 years to the 2019-2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ACE and HPV vaccination modules. Adverse childhood experiences included emotional, physical, and sexual abuse; household intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and mental illness; and parental separation/divorce and incarcerated household member. We used log-binomial regression models to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between ACEs and self-reported HPV vaccination and completion. Secondary outcomes included influenza vaccination uptake, time since routine checkup, HIV testing history, and HIV-related risk behavior.\tSeveral ACEs were positively associated with HPV vaccination initiation, including emotional abuse (PR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.43), intimate partner violence (PR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30), substance abuse (PR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.33), and mental illness (PR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.22-1.50). Similar associations were observed for completion. Conversely, most ACEs were negatively associated with influenza vaccination (PRs from 0.72 to 1.00) and with recent checkup (PRs from 0.92 to 1.00). Adverse childhood experiences were positively associated with having had an HIV test (PRs from 1.19 to 1.56) and HIV-related risk behavior (PRs from 1.19 to 2.07).\tThe unexpected positive associations between ACEs and HPV vaccination coverage could be due to opportunities to receive HPV vaccination in late adolescence or early adulthood while accessing STI/HIV prevention or treatment services. Future studies should evaluate associations between ACEs and timely HPV vaccination in early adolescence.","_input_hash":1006360547,"_task_hash":-1159625585,"spans":[{"text":"Human","start":89,"end":94,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":327,"end":332,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"prevalence","start":944,"end":954,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"history","start":1181,"end":1188,"pattern":-1634665066}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 0, 53, 64"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707848610,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36","_session_id":"2024-02-13_18-54-36"}

The VEEV-neutralizing, protective murine mAb 3B4C-4 was humanized using combinatorial antibody libraries and phage-display technology. Humanized VEEV-binding Fabs were evaluated for virus-neutralizing capacity, then selected Fabs were converted to whole immunoglobulin (Ig) G1, and stable cell lines were generated. The humanized mAb Hy4-26C, designated Hy4 IgG, had virus-neutralizing capacity similar to that of 3B4C-4.

Problematic alcohol use was higher in adolescents with problematic Internet use compared to those without problematic Internet use. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms were statistically significant associated with both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Prosocial behavior was related to problematic Internet use. Male gender and less peer problems were associated with problematic alcohol use.

Participants were 448 patients referred to a private practice in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada for psychological or neuropsychological assessment, related to evaluation of impairment and disability resulting from a work-related or non-work related accident. All patients were involved in some form of compensation claim at the time of their evaluation. All patients completed two tests designed to detect exaggerated cognitive deficits, the Computerized Assessment of Response Bias (CARB) and the Word Memory Test (WMT) as part of their evaluation. The diagnostic groups included 322 head injury cases, varying from very minor to very severe. Normative data for the smell test were derived from 126 patients with orthopedic injuries who passed both the CARB and the WMT. Patients with more severe traumatic brain injuries were 10-12 times more likely to have olfactory deficits than persons with trivial to mild head injuries. In a subgroup of patients who failed either the CARB or the WMT, there was no relationship between injury severity and total scores on the smell test. Therefore, the dose-response relationship between brain injury severity and olfactory deficits is severely attenuated when patients who are probably exaggerating their cognitive deficits are included in the analyses. Those patients with trivial to mild head injuries who demonstrated adequate effort on both the CARB and the WMT were no more likely to show olfactory deficits than the non-head-injured orthopedic control subjects. Therefore, anosmia following mild traumatic brain injury should not be concluded from self-reports or from tests of smell unless tests of effort have been passed.

The awards were held in 2009, aiming to share clinical experience and best practice in headache-related disease management. 56 unusual and challenging cases of headache from 5 European countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain) were judged by a Scientific Committee including expert representatives from participating countries, acting as reviewers. Three cases were selected from each country. The 15 resulting cases were presented to the Scientific Committee in Madrid, Spain in November 2009 and awards were given to the top 5 presentations. This article presents details of these cases, including the award winning entries. They have been categorized into four main groups: (a) headaches in rare syndromes; (b) secondary headaches to infectious/autoimmune causes or post-trauma/mass occupation; (c) headache in unresolved cases; and (d) other relevant cases. First prize was awarded to a case involving a 55-year-old male with familial thrombocytopenia and a unilateral neuralgiform headache secondary to trigeminal vascular contact, and which was successfully treated with carbamazepine. Conclusions from the meeting include: rare syndromes do occur and require appropriate treatment to improve outcomes; concomitant diseases may impair adequate diagnosis and should be investigated; physicians should be cautious and treat possible serious underlying disease, whilst accurately clarifying the correct diagnosis; neurological examination and complementary tests may be required; consideration should be given to possible rare medication events; and some cases may remain without a clear cause or diagnosis and symptoms should be treated whilst investigations continue.","_input_hash":146315177,"_task_hash":-1414469505,"spans":[{"text":"expert","start":481,"end":487,"pattern":316071577},{"text":"case","start":1097,"end":1101,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"vascular","start":1225,"end":1233,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1456,"end":1465,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1612,"end":1621,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1806,"end":1815,"pattern":-1255217628}],"meta":{"pattern":"11, 35, 66, 56, 56, 56"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707907620,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}

In data from 1017 participants from the Human Connectome Project, we show that early visual and connected areas have low temporal variability of their functional connectivity. We show that a low temporal variability of the connectivity of cortical areas is related to high mean functional connectivity between those areas, and provide an account of how these dynamics arise. We then investigate how these concepts help to understand brain dynamics in mental disorders. We find that in both first episode and long-term schizophrenia, reduced functional connectivity of early visual and related temporal cortex areas is associated with increased temporal variability of the functional connectivity, consistent with decreased stability of attractor networks related to sensory processing. In ADHD, we find these functional connectivities are increased and their temporal variability is decreased, and relate this to increased engagement with visual sensory input as manifest in high screen time usage in ADHD. We further show that these differences in the dynamics of the cortex in schizophrenia, and ADHD can be related to differences in the functional connectivity of the specific sensory vs. association thalamic nuclei. These discoveries help to advance our understanding of cortical operation in health, and in some mental disorders.","_input_hash":2142971032,"_task_hash":-1936712033,"spans":[{"text":"Human","start":325,"end":330,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909030,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}

Unlike specialized cells, these cells can proliferate several times to produce millions of cells. Nowadays, pluripotent stem cells are important candidates to provide a renewable source for the replacement of cells in tissues of interest. The damage to neurons and glial cells in the brain or spinal cord is present in neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal cord injury, lysosomal storage disorder, epilepsy, and glioblastoma. Therefore, stem cell transplantation can be used as a novel therapeutic approach in cases of brain and spinal cord damage. Recently, researchers have generated neuron-like cells and glial-like cells from embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and neural stem cells. In addition, several experimental studies have been performed for developing stem cell transplantation in brain tissue. Herein, we focus on stem cell therapy to regenerate injured tissue resulting from neurological diseases and then discuss possible differentiation pathways of stem cells to the renewal of neurons.","_input_hash":-492052631,"_task_hash":800510235,"spans":[{"text":"Cells","start":62,"end":67,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"Therapeutic","start":83,"end":94,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"cells","start":142,"end":147,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":275,"end":280,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":288,"end":293,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":347,"end":352,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":381,"end":386,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":465,"end":470,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":527,"end":532,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapeutic","start":865,"end":876,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"cells","start":977,"end":982,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":998,"end":1003,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1024,"end":1029,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1048,"end":1053,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1071,"end":1076,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapy","start":1228,"end":1235,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"cells","start":1361,"end":1366,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 47, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 47, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 46, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909138,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}

The cAMP analogs were delivered via osmotic minipumps at 1-250 mM through an indwelling cortical cannula or by intrathecal infusion for up to 4 weeks after either a T8 unilateral over-hemisection or a C2-3 dorsolateral quadrant lesion, respectively. In both SCI models, continuous db-cAMP delivery was associated with histopathological changes that included sporadic micro-hemorrhage formation and cavitation, enhanced macrophage infiltration and tissue damage at regions beyond the immediate application site; no deleterious or beneficial effect of agent delivery was observed at the spinal injury site. Furthermore, these changes were accompanied by pronounced behavioral deficits that included an absence of progressive locomotor recovery, increased extensor tone, paralysis, and sensory abnormalities. These deleterious effects were not observed in saline-treated animals, in animals in which the db-cAMP dose did not exceed 1 mM, or in those animals that received a high dose (250 mM) of the alternative cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP. These results demonstrate that, for continuous intraparenchymal or intrathecal administration of cAMP analogs for the study of biological or therapeutic effects within the central nervous system (CNS), consideration of the effective concentration applied as well as the potential toxicity of chemical moieties on the parent molecule and/or their activity needs to be taken into account.","_input_hash":-869286844,"_task_hash":789953944,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":1674,"end":1679,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1697,"end":1708,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909265,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}

It was initially described by the French Las\u00e8gue and Falret in 1877. Two subjects, who live in a close relationship, in isolation, share delusional ideas based on the same themes. Various classifications exist. Its epidemiology remains unclear, because most of the data have been extrapolated from case reports.\tIn this paper, we describe and comment two cases of shared paranoid disorder: in the first case report, a husband shares the paranoiac delusion of his wife; the second case report describes a shared paranoid disorder between a schizophrenic daughter and her mother.\tA review of the existing literature is also presented. Some clinical characteristics arise, such as frequent mother-daughter associations and diagnosis of schizophrenia in inducing subject. Particular social and psychopathological conditions for the occurrence of a shared delusional disorder are described, such as personality traits and genetic influences. This article also reviews some forensic issues, which may be of importance, since this disorder is underdiagnosed. Data concerning the principles of its treatment are sparse, but most authors consider that the separation of the two subjects has to be the basis of any intervention. The inducing subject has to be treated with specific medical interventions, including the prescription of antipsychotics. Sometimes, the separation is enough to eliminate the delusional ideas from the induced subject, who, according to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, is the only one to meet the criteria for shared delusional disorder. The case reports are discussed in light of the review, and some propositions for their treatment are made.\tAs shared delusional disorder is a rare disease, only few data exist on its pathophysiology and mechanisms, and controlled studies are needed in order to understand its specific implications better and to define recommendations for its management.","_input_hash":-293824751,"_task_hash":-322339490,"spans":[{"text":"epidemiology","start":362,"end":374,"pattern":-2128961709},{"text":"case","start":445,"end":449,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"case","start":550,"end":554,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"report","start":555,"end":561,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"case","start":627,"end":631,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"report","start":632,"end":638,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"review","start":727,"end":733,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"literature","start":750,"end":760,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"diagnosis","start":867,"end":876,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"intervention","start":1352,"end":1364,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"case","start":1698,"end":1702,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"review","start":1741,"end":1747,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"controlled","start":1913,"end":1923,"pattern":-610699305}],"meta":{"pattern":"54, 35, 35, 36, 35, 36, 4, 5, 56, 48, 35, 4, 27"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909322,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}

Dietary (poly)phenols revert and prevent age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in model systems. However, only limited attempts were made to evaluate the impact of digestion on the bioactivities of (poly)phenols and determine their mechanisms of action. This constitutes a challenge for the development of (poly)phenol-based nutritional therapies. Here, we subjected (poly)phenols from Arbutus unedo to in vitro digestion and tested the products in cell models of PD based on the cytotoxicity of aSyn. The (poly)phenol-digested metabolites from A. unedo leaves (LPDMs) effectively counteracted aSyn and H2O2 toxicity in yeast and human cells, improving viability by reducing aSyn aggregation and inducing its clearance. In addition, LPDMs modulated pathways associated with aSyn toxicity, such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial impairment, and SIR2 expression. Overall, LPDMs reduced aSyn toxicity, enhanced the efficiency of ER-associated protein degradation by the proteasome and autophagy, and reduced oxidative stress.

{"pmid":"18760507","text":"Neurobiology of aging^\nEarly diagnostic accuracy and pathophysiologic relevance of an autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease peripheral biomarker.^\nTreatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the discovery of promising drug candidates depend on early diagnosis. Few currently available diagnostic tests have significantly improved this early uncertainty, while the 'gold standard' diagnosis continues to require clinical dementia in life and the presence of pathologic brain lesions of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain at autopsy. Here, the inflammatory agonist bradykinin, a small nano-peptide, that induces PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 in fibroblasts, was applied to punch-biopsy-obtained human skin fibroblasts. Quantitative imaging of the phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 bands was then used in a ratio that is mathematically configured into an AD-Biomarker Index (AD-Index). In the population described here (N=264), there were 64 autopsy examinations. Demented individuals were clinically diagnosed as AD with an overall accuracy of 78%. Among the 42 autopsy-confirmed cases for which there were also AD-Biomarker measurements, the overall accuracy of the AD-Biomarker was 98%. Among both the autopsy-confirmed and the clinically diagnosed patients, the AD-Index values were inversely correlated with the duration of disease, i.e., the time from the onset of dementia symptoms. Among the autopsy-confirmed cases, the AD-Biomarker diagnosis showed remarkably high sensitivity (97%) and specificity (100%) compared to clinical diagnosis (sensitivity: 78% and specificity: 20%). Using autopsy validation, the clinical diagnosis was only accurate at 52% level vs. the AD-Biomarker accuracy of 100% for cases with dementia not larger than 4 years of duration. Finally, application of soluble Abeta(1-42) to the fibroblasts of normal controls induced the abnormal AD-Biomarker phenotype, suggesting the pathophysiologic relevance of this AD-Biomarker measurement. In summary, the AD-Biomarker, as confirmed by autopsy validation, showed significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than did clinical diagnosis, particularly at early stages of disease, and pathophysiological relevance was demonstrated for the mechanistic basis of the AD-Biomarker measurements.","_input_hash":-1436650455,"_task_hash":-837934616,"spans":[{"text":"diagnostic","start":29,"end":39,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"diagnosis","start":248,"end":257,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnostic","start":283,"end":293,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"diagnosis","start":378,"end":387,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"human","start":729,"end":734,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"patients","start":1280,"end":1288,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1470,"end":1479,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1565,"end":1574,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1655,"end":1664,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"summary","start":2001,"end":2008,"pattern":915282476},{"text":"diagnosis","start":2138,"end":2147,"pattern":-1255217628}],"meta":{"pattern":"55, 56, 55, 56, 0, 34, 56, 56, 56, 9, 56"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909521,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}
{"pmid":"18952610","text":"The Journal of biological chemistry^\nA Drosophila protein family implicated in pheromone perception is related to Tay-Sachs GM2-activator protein.^\nLow volatility, lipid-like cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones produced by Drosophila melanogaster females play an essential role in triggering and modulating mating behavior, but the chemosensory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Recently, we showed that the CheB42a protein, which is expressed in only 10 pheromone-sensing taste hairs on the front legs of males, modulates progression to late stages of male courtship behavior in response to female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons. Here we report that expression of all 12 genes in the CheB gene family is predominantly or exclusively gustatory-specific, and occurs in many different, often non-overlapping patterns. Only the Gr family of gustatory receptor genes displays a comparable variety of gustatory-specific expression patterns. Unlike Grs, however, expression of all but one CheB gene is sexually dimorphic. Like CheB42a, other CheBs may therefore function specifically in gustatory perception of pheromones. We also show that CheBs belong to the ML superfamily of lipid-binding proteins, and are most similar to human GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP). In particular, GM2-AP residues involved in ligand binding are conserved in CheBs but not in other ML proteins. Finally, CheB42a is specifically secreted into the inner lumen of pheromone-sensing taste hairs, where pheromones interact with membrane-bound receptors. We propose that CheB proteins interact directly with lipid-like Drosophila pheromones and modulate their detection by the gustatory signal transduction machinery. Furthermore, as loss of GM2-AP in Tay-Sachs disease prevents degradation of GM2 gangliosides and results in neurodegeneration, the function of CheBs in pheromone response may involve biochemical mechanisms critical for lipid metabolism in human neurons.","_input_hash":1648227141,"_task_hash":982100429,"spans":[{"text":"report","start":649,"end":655,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"genes","start":682,"end":687,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"genes","start":867,"end":872,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"human","start":1231,"end":1236,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":1936,"end":1941,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"36, 78, 78, 0, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909530,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}

The inflammatory responses which induce cell apoptosis and necrosis after I/R brain injury lead to a limited process of neural repair. To further comprehend how these targets function in I/R state, we investigated the pathological changes and TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo models of I/R brain injury in this study. Meanwhile, we explored the roles of schisantherin A on I/R brain injury, and whether it exerted neuroprotective effects by regulating the TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways or not. The results showed that schisantherin A significantly reduced the neuronal apoptosis induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) injury in primary culture of rat cortical neurons. Also, schisantherin A alleviated neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume, attenuated oxidation stress, inflammation and apoptosis in ischemic parietal cortex of rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury. Moreover, the activated TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways were inhibited by schisantherin A treatment. In conclusion, TLR4 and C5aR1 played a vital role during I/R brain injury in rats, and schisantherin A exhibited neuroprotective effects by TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways. These findings also provided new insights that would aid in elucidating the effect of schisantherin A against cerebral I/R and support the development of schisantherin A as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke.","_input_hash":-224541085,"_task_hash":982238070,"spans":[{"text":"therapeutic","start":244,"end":255,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"study","start":717,"end":722,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rat","start":1084,"end":1087,"pattern":-569153227}],"meta":{"pattern":"47, 2, 92"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909608,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}

The neural basis of apathy in bvFTD is not completely understood. Previous neuroimaging studies have poorly considered executive impairment and dementia severity as possible confounding factors. Herein we investigated the neural basis of apathy in bvFTD through structural neuroimaging taking into account these factors.\tWe included patients with probable bvFTD (n\u00a0=\u00a021) and cognitively healthy controls (HC, n\u00a0=\u00a022). Participants were matched for age, sex and schooling. All subjects underwent a thorough neuropsychological examination, including tests for executive functions and social cognition. Apathy was assessed with the Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS). All subjects underwent 3T brain MRI. We investigated correlations between SAS scores and gray matter atrophy within the bvFTD group. Executive function (Frontal Assessment Battery) and disease severity were considered as covariates in neuroimaging analyses.\tCompared to HC, bvFTD patients had lower scores on global cognitive efficiency, executive functions and social cognition. All bvFTD had clinically relevant apathy (scores greater than 14 in the SAS). Performance in executive function tests did not correlate with apathy scores. The severity of apathy was negatively correlated with gray matter volumes in midline prefrontal regions, namely orbitofrontal cortex and both anterior and dorsal regions of cingulate cortex.\tApathy in bvFTD is related to a specific network of prefrontal cortical areas critically involved in effort-based behavior for rewards and appears to be independent of executive dysfunction.","_input_hash":-2132690594,"_task_hash":-43137199,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":638,"end":646,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1245,"end":1253,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909642,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}
{"pmid":"29076783","text":"Journal of neurosurgery^\nSystematic histopathological analysis of different 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence levels in newly diagnosed glioblastomas.^\nOBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by distinct intratumoral histopathological heterogeneity with regard to variable tumor morphology, cell proliferation, and microvascularity. Maximum resection of a GBM results in an improved prognosis and thus represents the aim of surgery in the majority of cases. Fluorescence-guided surgery using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is currently widely applied for improved intraoperative tumor visualization in patients with a GBM. Three intratumoral fluorescence levels (i.e., strong, vague, or no fluorescence) can usually be distinguished during surgery. So far, however, their exact histopathological correlates and their surgical relevance have not been clarified sufficiently. Thus, the aim of this study was to systematically analyze tissue samples from newly diagnosed GBMs with different fluorescence levels according to relevant histopathological parameters. METHODS This prospective study recruited patients who underwent 5-ALA fluorescence-guided resection of a newly diagnosed radiologically suspected GBM. Each patient received 5-ALA approximately 3 hours before surgery, and a modified neurosurgical microscope was applied for intraoperative visualization of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. During surgery, tissue samples with strong, vague, or no fluorescence were collected. For each sample, the presence of tumor tissue, quality of tissue (compact, infiltrative, or no tumor), histopathological criteria of malignancy (cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and presence of microvascular proliferation/necrosis), proliferation rate (MIB-1 labeling index [LI]), and microvessel density (using CD34 staining) were investigated. RESULTS Altogether, 77 patients with a newly diagnosed, histopathologically confirmed GBM were included, and 131 samples with strong fluorescence, 69 samples with vague fluorescence, and 67 samples with no fluorescence were collected. Tumor tissue was detected in all 131 (100%) of the samples with strong fluorescence and in 65 (94%) of the 69 samples with vague fluorescence. However, mostly infiltrative tumor tissue was still found in 33 (49%) of 67 samples despite their lack of fluorescence. Strong fluorescence corresponded to compact tumors in 109 (83%) of 131 samples, whereas vague fluorescence was consistent with infiltrative tumors in 44 (64%) of 69 samples. In terms of the histopathological criteria of malignancy, a significant positive correlation of all analyzed parameters comprising cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis with the 3 fluorescence levels was observed (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the proliferation rate significantly and positively correlated with strong (MIB-1 LI 28.3%), vague (MIB-1 LI 16.7%), and no (MIB-1 LI 8.8%) fluorescence (p < 0.001). Last, a significantly higher microvessel density was detected in samples with strong fluorescence (CD34 125.5 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) than in those with vague (CD34 82.8 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) or no (CD34 68.6 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) fluorescence (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Strong and vague 5-ALA-induced fluorescence enables visualization of intratumoral areas with specific histopathological features and thus supports neurosurgeons in improving the extent of resection in patients with a newly diagnosed GBM. Despite the lack of fluorescence, tumor tissue was still observed in approximately half of the cases. To overcome this current limitation, the promising approach of complementary spectroscopic measurement of fluorescence should be investigated further.","_input_hash":-988287540,"_task_hash":-1913106858,"spans":[{"text":"Systematic","start":25,"end":35,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"surgery","start":439,"end":446,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"surgery","start":493,"end":500,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":616,"end":624,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"surgery","start":754,"end":761,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"study","start":910,"end":915,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1099,"end":1104,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1115,"end":1123,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"surgery","start":1282,"end":1289,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"surgery","start":1414,"end":1421,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":1883,"end":1891,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":3457,"end":3465,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"6, 49, 49, 34, 49, 2, 2, 34, 49, 49, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909707,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}
{"pmid":"30658131","text":"Brain research bulletin^\nCerebral malaria.^\nMalaria remains of significant public health concern under the tropics, causing millions of deaths annually. The disease is caused by protozoans of the Plasmodium genus, of which harbors several distinct species. Human infection occurs during the blood meal of an infected female mosquito belonging to the Anopheles genus. It is estimated that around 1% of children infected with Plasmodium falciparum develops a more severe form of malaria, which may eventually lead to cerebral complications including cerebral malaria (CM). CM can be positively diagnosed in patients unable to localize a painful stimulus, with peripheral asexual P. falciparum parasitemia and no other identifiable causes of an encephalopathy. Unarousable comas along with the presence of asexual forms of the parasite on a peripheral blood smear are hallmarks of the disease. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CM have yet be fully elucidated, the pathology in itself indicates a clear disease of the vascular endothelium. It is characterized by parasite sequestration, inflammatory cytokine production and vascular leakage, eventually resulting in brain hypoxia. The condition requires systemic health management consisting of focused nursing practices, supportive care, and anti-malarial drugs. The continued understanding of pathogenic mechanisms leading to the onset of CM is fundamental and key for the expansion and development of appropriate neuroprotective interventions. Future research perspectives may also include the development of field-based and rapid diagnostic tests for CM, understanding of host-pathogen interactions to advance development of prevention tools and therapies, and antimalarial drug trials.","_input_hash":-768991947,"_task_hash":-299777184,"spans":[{"text":"Human","start":257,"end":262,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"patients","start":605,"end":613,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"vascular","start":1043,"end":1051,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"vascular","start":1149,"end":1157,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1609,"end":1619,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"trials","start":1758,"end":1764,"pattern":1849967594}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 34, 66, 66, 55, 75"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909841,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}

Aggregation-prone truncated species of \u03b1Syn caused by aberrant cleavage of this fibrillogenic protein are hypothesized to participate in its sequestration into inclusions subsequently leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Here, we investigated the role of calpain cleavage of \u03b1Syn in vivo by generating two opposing mouse models. We crossed into human [A30P]\u03b1Syn transgenic (i) mice deficient for calpastatin, a calpain-specific inhibitor, thus enhancing calpain activity (SynCAST(-)) and (ii) mice overexpressing human calpastatin leading to reduced calpain activity (SynCAST(+)). As anticipated, a reduced calpain activity led to a decreased number of \u03b1Syn-positive aggregates, whereas loss of calpastatin led to increased truncation of \u03b1Syn in SynCAST(-). Furthermore, overexpression of calpastatin decreased astrogliosis and the calpain-dependent degradation of synaptic proteins, potentially ameliorating the observed neuropathology in [A30P]\u03b1Syn and SynCAST(+) mice. Overall, our data further support a crucial role of calpains, particularly of calpain 1, in the pathogenesis of PD and in disease-associated aggregation of \u03b1Syn, indicating a therapeutic potential of calpain inhibition in PD.","_input_hash":-1056617574,"_task_hash":1700112354,"spans":[{"text":"Human","start":0,"end":5,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":95,"end":100,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"transgenic","start":179,"end":189,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"mouse","start":744,"end":749,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"human","start":774,"end":779,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"transgenic","start":791,"end":801,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"mice","start":806,"end":810,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":922,"end":926,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"human","start":942,"end":947,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"mice","start":1395,"end":1399,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1576,"end":1587,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 0, 77, 81, 0, 77, 82, 82, 0, 82, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1707909928,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40","_session_id":"2024-02-14_11-20-40"}

We prospectively studied the response to sildenafil and the erectile function of patients with ED due to PFUD.\tThe erectile function of patients referred to us with PFUD for urethroplasty were prospectively evaluated before surgery. Patients underwent nocturnal penile tumescence testing and, if results were abnormal, penile duplex ultrasonography with intracavernous injection and arteriography were performed to diagnose the etiology of ED. Patients were questioned about erectile function every 3 months after surgery and if they complained of ED they were offered 100 mg sildenafil. Patients were followed for at least 18 months after surgery.\tA total of 29 consecutive patients were evaluated and 22 (76%) of them had ED before surgery.

For our difficult-to-treat patients, our current overall impression is that the benefits of adding the 12-step component have outweighed the costs. We began the program with an expressed intent of experimenting with the integration. Staff were subsequently recruited who were open to the experiment and the success of the integration has been a function of the flexibility within the staff. Our hunch is that this integration would not work as well with an existing staff who harbored prejudice toward either position. Actually, we have found working on the integration quite invigorating. Our recovering counselors have raised issues that we have not heard raised in the more traditional settings we have been associated with. Likewise, we have seen our counselors grow professionally from hearing alternative views of why individuals struggle and how they get better. The exchange has been synergistic rather than divisive. Although we are encouraged by our early experience, it is the long-term outcome that will clarify the relative usefulness of this treatment strategy. We are confident that as we live with the integration longer, more of the advantages and disadvantages will become apparent and perhaps we can refine our understanding of which subgroup of patients makes most use of this type of integrated approach.","_input_hash":-78615489,"_task_hash":-523695278,"spans":[{"text":"traditional","start":131,"end":142,"pattern":1983949530},{"text":"summary","start":164,"end":171,"pattern":915282476},{"text":"patients","start":344,"end":352,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":393,"end":401,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":498,"end":506,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"traditional","start":1148,"end":1159,"pattern":1983949530},{"text":"patients","start":1736,"end":1744,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"10, 9, 34, 34, 34, 10, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708011507,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

We investigated whether treatment with BVA (0.25 and 0.8 mg/kg) at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoints, located lateral from the anterior border of the tibia, has a beneficial effect in a myelin basic protein (MBP)(68-82)-induced acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model. Pretreatment (every 3 days from 1 h before immunization) with BVA was more effective than posttreatment (daily after immunization) with BVA with respect to clinical signs (neurological impairment and loss of body weight) of acute EAE rats. Treatment with BVA at the ST36 acupoint in normal rats did not induce the clinical signs. Pretreatment with BVA suppressed demyelination, glial activation, expression of cytokines [interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IL-17, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and IL-1\u03b2], chemokines [RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1], and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB (p65 and phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1) signaling pathways in the spinal cord of acute EAE rats. Pretreatment with BVA decreased the number of CD4(+), CD4(+)/IFN-\u03b3(+), and CD4(+)/IL-17(+) T cells, but increased the number of CD4(+)/Foxp3(+) T cells in the spinal cord and lymph nodes of acute EAE rats. Treatment with BVA at six placebo acupoints (SP9, GB39, and four non-acupoints) did not have a positive effect in acute EAE rats. Interestingly, onset and posttreatment with BVA at the ST36 acupoint markedly attenuated neurological impairment in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(35-55)-induced chronic EAE mice compared to treatment with BVA at six placebo acupoints. Our findings strongly suggest that treatment with BVA with ST36 acupoint could delay or attenuate the development and progression of EAE by upregulating regulatory T cells and suppressing T-helper (Th) 17 and Th1 responses. These results warrant further investigation of BVA as a treatment for autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system.","_input_hash":1379409105,"_task_hash":73155330,"spans":[{"text":"Cells","start":128,"end":133,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapeutic","start":194,"end":205,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"rat","start":569,"end":572,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"cells","start":1498,"end":1503,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1551,"end":1556,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"placebo","start":1637,"end":1644,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"mice","start":1926,"end":1930,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"placebo","start":1969,"end":1976,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"cells","start":2154,"end":2159,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 47, 92, 70, 70, 14, 82, 14, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708012074,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

Consistent with previous findings, there was substantial overlap between the DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes with the severe inattentive and severe combined latent classes. However, DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes were distributed over several latent classes in each sample, and a substantial proportion of individuals with no DSM-IV diagnosis were also assigned to these severe classes.\tResults from LCA using an Australian twin sample replicate six of the eight latent class subtypes previously reported using Missouri female twins and extend the findings to male twins.

In this context, the role of personality traits and attitudes of staff members in decision-making around coercion is increasingly being assessed. This study aimed to examine the role of staff attitudes towards coercion and staff members' personality traits in decision-making around coercion in an experimental setting.\tWe assessed the attitudes towards coercion and (general) personality traits of mental health professionals in psychiatric hospitals with a quantitative survey. Furthermore, we developed case vignettes representing cases in a 'grey zone' and included them in the survey to assess staff members' decisions about coercion in specific situations.\tA general approving attitude towards coercion significantly influenced decisions around coercion in individual cases-resulting in a more likely approval of applying coercion in the cases described in the vignettes. Personality traits did not seem to be relevant in this regard.\tStrategies to reduce coercion in mental healthcare institutions should focus more on the role of staff attitudes and encourage staff members to reflect on them critically.","_input_hash":-1722984314,"_task_hash":261500425,"spans":[{"text":"case","start":198,"end":202,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"study","start":567,"end":572,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"case","start":922,"end":926,"pattern":1741807605}],"meta":{"pattern":"35, 2, 35"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708012802,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

The classification of edema into vasogenic, cytotoxic, hydrocephalic and osmotic has stood the test of time although it is recognized that in most clinical situations there is a combination of different types of edema during the course of the disease. Basic information about the types of edema is provided for better understanding of the expression pattern of some of the newer molecules implicated in the pathogenesis of brain edema. These molecules include the aquaporins, matrix metalloproteinases and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors A and B and the angiopoietins. The potential of these agents in the treatment of edema is discussed. Since many molecules are involved in the pathogenesis of brain edema, effective treatment cannot be achieved by a single agent but will require the administration of a 'magic bullet' containing a variety of agents released at different times during the course of edema in order to be successful.","_input_hash":1679934514,"_task_hash":-798773603,"spans":[{"text":"classification","start":263,"end":277,"pattern":-756437862},{"text":"vascular","start":788,"end":796,"pattern":-60508792}],"meta":{"pattern":"59, 66"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708012844,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

Clinical trials demonstrate that selegiline slows the rate of disease progression and delays the appearance of disability necessitating levodopa. However, confounding symptomatic effects have made it difficult to ascertain the presence of any direct neuroprotective effect. Laboratory studies demonstrate that selegiline protects dopaminergic neurons through a mechanism that does not involve MAO-B inhibition. Recent studies suggest that neuroprotection in laboratory models may be related to the capacity of selegiline to up-regulate a series of anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic molecules which promote cell survival. Further delineation of the precise mechanism whereby selegiline induces this effect may permit for the development of enhanced neuroprotective benefits in PD patients.","_input_hash":1479407891,"_task_hash":-1245589024,"spans":[{"text":"therapy","start":330,"end":337,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"trials","start":348,"end":354,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"patients","start":1116,"end":1124,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"46, 75, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708012925,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

To examine whether memory-related EEG parameters may predict cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we assessed P200 and N200 latencies as well as beta event-related synchronization (ERS) in 16 elderly controls (EC), 29 MCI cases and 10 patients with AD during the successful performance of a pure attentional detection task as compared with a highly working memory demanding two-back task. At 1 year follow-up, 16 MCI patients showed progressive cognitive decline (PMCI) and 13 remained stable (SMCI). Both P200 and N200 latencies in the two-back task were longer in PMCI and AD cases compared with EC and SMCI cases. During the interval 1000 ms to 1700 ms after stimulus, beta ERS at parietal electrodes was of lower amplitude in PMCI and AD compared with EC and SMCI cases. Univariate models showed that P200, N200 and log% beta values were significantly related to the SMCI/PMCI distinction with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, 0.78 and 0.72, respectively. The combination of all three EEG hallmarks was the stronger predictor of MCI deterioration with 90% of correctly classified MCI cases. Our data reveal that PMCI and clinically overt AD share the same pattern of working memory-related EEG activation characterized by increased P200-N200 latencies and decreased beta ERS. They also show that P200 latency during the two-back task may be a simple and promising EEG marker of rapid cognitive decline in MCI.","_input_hash":1495301720,"_task_hash":-1878255604,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":294,"end":302,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":586,"end":594,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":768,"end":776,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708012935,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

Most CPT research to date has focused on pre- to post-treatment change in total PTSD symptoms; however, PTSD symptom criteria may not change equivalently over the course of treatment. For example, changes in re-experiencing symptoms have been shown to precede changes in other PTSD criteria during other PTSD treatments (i.e. virtual reality exposure therapy, venlafaxine ER). An improved understanding of the mechanism of change in PTSD symptoms during CPT may assist in optimizing treatment.\tThe purpose of this study was to identify the pattern and temporal precedence of change in PTSD symptom criteria during and after CPT using cross-lagged panel analyses.\tData from veterans (n = 32) enrolled in a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of CPT for MST-related PTSD were utilized for this secondary analysis. Using hierarchical linear modelling, each symptom criterion was entered as a predictor of subsequent change in the other PTSD symptom criteria.\tAll symptom criteria followed a logarithmic pattern of change. Hyperarousal symptoms were found to both predict and temporally precede change in avoidance symptoms, but not re-experiencing symptoms. Re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms did not predict change in other PTSD symptom criteria.\tThese findings provide initial support that targeting and reducing hyperarousal symptoms may be a key component of PTSD intervention with CPT.

More importantly, studies using ocular US found an almost equal sensitivity (0.91 vs. 0.90; p\u00a0=\u00a0.35) and higher specificity (0.82 vs. 0.58; p\u00a0=\u00a0.01) than those using brain CT.\tMeasurement of the ONSD may be a useful method for predicting raised ICP in adult patients with severe TBI.","_input_hash":938120727,"_task_hash":-1621874297,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":119,"end":127,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnostic","start":210,"end":220,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":445,"end":453,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnostic","start":527,"end":537,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"summary","start":626,"end":633,"pattern":915282476},{"text":"diagnostic","start":720,"end":730,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":774,"end":782,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1314,"end":1322,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 55, 34, 55, 9, 55, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708013126,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

The history of 'harm reduction' in New York City is characterized within changing historical periods and in relation to the actions of stakeholders. The expansion is traced over four periods: (i) 1984-1989: emergence, activism, and science; (ii) 1990-1994 reckoning: syringe exchange legislation and consolidation; (iii) 1995-1999: bureaucratization, opposition, and challenges to institutional control; and (iv) 2000-2010 revitalization: expansion of syringe access and harm reduction. It is clear from this review that the leadership of activism and the work of advocates catalyzed syringe access policy and practice. Without this 'push,' it is unlikely that New York City would have experienced the dramatic decline in HIV infection among drug injectors in the 1990s. Second, successful arguments for expanding syringe access in New York City were based on the high HIV/AIDS infection rates.

Different Tnc isoforms can be generated by the insertion of variable combinations of one to seven (in rats) alternatively spliced distinct fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains to the smallest variant. Each spliced FnIII repeat mediates specific actions on neurite outgrowth, neuron migration or adhesion. Hence, different Tnc isoforms might differentially influence CNS repair. We explored the expression pattern of Tnc variants after cortical lesions and after treatment of astrocytes with various cytokines. Using RT-PCR, we observed a strong upregulation of Tnc transcripts containing the spliced FnIII domains B or D in injured tissue at 2-4 days post-lesion (dpl). Looking at specific combinations, we showed a dramatic increase of Tnc isoforms harboring the neurite outgrowth-promoting BD repeat with both the B and D domains being adjacent to each other. Isoforms containing only the axon growth-stimulating spliced domain D were also dramatically enhanced after injury. Injury-induced increase of Tnc proteins comprising the domain D was confirmed by Western Blotting and immunostaining of cortical lesions. In contrast, the FnIII modules C and AD1 were weakly modulated after injury. The growth cone repulsive A1A2A4 domains were poorly expressed in normal and injured tissue but the smallest isoform, which is also repellant, was highly expressed after injury. Expression of the shortest Tnc isoform and of variants containing B, D or BD, was strongly upregulated in cultured astrocytes after TGFbeta1 treatment, suggesting that TGFbeta1 could mediate, at least in part, the injury-induced upregulation of these isoforms. We identified complex injury-induced differential regulations of Tnc isoforms that may well influence axonal regeneration and repair processes in the damaged CNS.","_input_hash":1435594044,"_task_hash":645083869,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708013288,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

Recently, we reported that peucedanocoumarin III (PCiii) is a promising therapeutic compound with the ability to disaggregate \u03b1-synuclein inclusion and protect dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we found that trans-4'-acetyl-3'-tigloylkhellactone (racemic peucedanocoumarin IV [PCiv]), a structural isomer of PCiii with a higher synthetic yield presented a strong anti-aggregate activity to a degree comparable to that of PCiii. PCiv retained effective inhibitory function against \u03b2-sheet aggregate-mimic \u03b223 cytotoxicities and potently prevented \u03b1-synucleinopathy in \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibril (PFF)-treated mice cortical neurons. In detailed pharmacokinetic profiling of PCiv, oral administration of PCiv in rats exhibited an approximately 97-min half-life and 10% bioavailability. Moreover, tissue distribution analysis revealed favorable profiles of brain penetration with a 6.4 brain-to-plasma concentration ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of PCiv was further evaluated in a sporadic PD mouse model with a combinatorial co-injection of \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibril and recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing \u03b1-synuclein. Motor dysfunctions induced in this combinatorial \u03b1-synucleinopathy PD mouse model was almost completely rescued by PCiv diet administration, and this therapeutic effect is consistent with the marked prevention of dopaminergic neuron loss and suppression of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our translational study suggests that PCiv is advantageous as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, especially with its good synthetic yield, high brain distribution, and anti-aggregate activity. PCiv may be useful in the management of \u03b1-synuclein inclusion formation and propagation at different stages of PD.","_input_hash":-2112674820,"_task_hash":1886848977,"spans":[{"text":"Animal","start":117,"end":123,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"therapeutic","start":332,"end":343,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"therapeutic","start":483,"end":494,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"mice","start":1043,"end":1047,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1358,"end":1369,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"mouse","start":1426,"end":1431,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mouse","start":1637,"end":1642,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1717,"end":1728,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"study","start":1883,"end":1888,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1929,"end":1940,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"67, 47, 47, 82, 47, 81, 81, 47, 2, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708013301,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

The current study documented the prevalence of driving after alcohol and marijuana use in the past 2 weeks as well as the prevalence of riding with a driver who had used each substance during that time frame. We tested whether young adults who lived with family members (i.e., their parents or their children) were less likely to engage in these behaviors. Methods: Participants aged 18-25 who resided in nonmetropolitan areas in the United States (N = 1,131; 55% female, Mage = 22.6) completed an online survey. Multivariate logistic regressions examined alcohol- and marijuana-related driving and riding behaviors adjusting for demographic factors. Interactions tested whether associations varied by gender. Results: In the 2 weeks prior to the survey, 17% of participants drove after drinking alcohol and 21% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking. The prevalence of driving after marijuana use was 11%, and 16% of the sample had ridden with a driver who had been using marijuana. Participants who lived with their parents were less likely to ride with a driver who had been using alcohol or marijuana (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 0.71 and 0.55, respectively). Living with parents was also associated negatively with driving after both substances, but these associations were no longer significant when controlling for substance use frequency and driving frequency. Surprisingly, the odds of driving after marijuana use were over 2 times larger for young adults who lived with their children. For women, but not men, residing with children decreased the odds of driving and riding after alcohol use. Conclusions: Living with parents protects against riding after substance use among young adults. Prevention programs should target young adults who live independently or those transitioning away from the parental home. Furthermore, given the higher rates of driving after marijuana use among young adult parents, this group should be educated about the risks associated with this behavior.","_input_hash":-913406568,"_task_hash":-874583128,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":292,"end":297,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"prevalence","start":313,"end":323,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"prevalence","start":402,"end":412,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"prevalence","start":1144,"end":1154,"pattern":1787723395}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 53, 53, 53"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708013308,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

A variety of frame-based, frameless, and robotic stereotactic systems have been designed for the accurate placement of depth electrodes.\tUsing the FHC microTargeting platform as a model, we introduce a fully customized design that has all the constructive elements positioned by a computer algorithm, according to the planned trajectories, anchoring points, and anatomic constraints. All the constructive elements form a single-body fixture, which allows for the efficient implantation of multiple depth electrodes following trajectories having a wide range of orientations. We aim at evaluating the safety and accuracy of this stereotactic system in a clinical setting.\tA total of 173 depth electrodes were implanted in 21 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Matlab and DEETO software packages were used to postoperatively evaluate the targeting accuracy. Automatic detection of electrode locations eliminated any subjectivity in calculating the targeting errors.\tAs a result of using custom geometry of the stereotactic platform, the new design is optimized for each patient and streamlines the surgical procedures. The most important results characterizing the platform's accuracy are the values of 1.22 mm for the median lateral target point localization error and 1.17 mm for the median lateral entry point localization error.\tThe patient-customized platforms are comparable in terms of safety, accuracy, and simplicity of use to the existing robotic devices for implantation of depth electrodes in patients undergoing SEEG investigations.","_input_hash":-363157213,"_task_hash":1993986031,"spans":[{"text":"diagnostic","start":149,"end":159,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":281,"end":289,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1044,"end":1052,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1827,"end":1835,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"55, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708013625,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

Thirty-three patients had cerebral ischemic attack (CIA), including 14 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) and 19 patients with other heart disease or lone Af (NonMS).

In the CIA group, there was a tendency of small amplitude of f wave and longer RR interval than the NonCIA group with ambulatory ECG. The CIA group also had larger left atrial cavity size and aortic diameter with TTE. TEE revealed thrombus formation in 29 cases, and the CIA group had a higher occurrence rate of thrombus than NonCIA group.

The risk factors of cerebral embolism could not be made clear in this study, but a fuzzy echo and thrombus in the left atrium with TEE are specific findings of cerebral embolism.

The results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. The antiaggregating effect of clopidogrel is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of ADP binding to a purinergic receptor present at the platelet surface. Clopidogrel is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. The chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. Several purinergic receptors have been described on platelets; P2X (1), a calcium channel, and P2Y1 a Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor, have been found not to be antagonized by clopidogrel. Another Gi (2)-coupled receptor (named P2Y12) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells. These cells displayed a strong affinity for (33)P-2MeS-ADP, a stable analogue of ADP, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. The binding of (33)P-2MeS-ADP to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets. In these transfected CHO cells, as in platelets, ADP and 2MeS-ADP induced adenylyl cyclase downregulation, an effect that was inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel. These results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called 'P2t' platelet receptor and show that the active metabolite of clopidogrel binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of ADP on platelets.","_input_hash":398928586,"_task_hash":-714817838,"spans":[{"text":"vascular","start":12,"end":20,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"trials","start":213,"end":219,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"vascular","start":306,"end":314,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"vascular","start":363,"end":371,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"patients","start":382,"end":390,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"history","start":398,"end":405,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"cells","start":1129,"end":1134,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1142,"end":1147,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1357,"end":1362,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1537,"end":1542,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"66, 75, 66, 66, 34, 64, 70, 70, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708013894,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59","_session_id":"2024-02-15_16-35-59"}

Based on the distribution of Agatston scores in the selected arterial region, the subjects were divided into calcium score categories of 0 (no calcification), 1-100, 101-400 and\u2009>\u2009400.\tParticipants with CKD stages 3-5 had the highest prevalence of calcification and the highest frequency of calcium scores >\u2009400 in all arterial sites. Calcification in at least one arterial site was present in >\u200990% of patients with CKD stage 3. In all five CKD stages prevalence of calcification was greatest in both the thoracic and abdominal aorta, and in the iliac arteries. These arterial sites also showed the highest calcium scores. High calcium scores (>\u2009400) in all five arterial regions were independently associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease. In multivariable analyses, after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, declining creatinine clearance was associated with increasing calcification of the coronary arteries (p\u2009=\u20090.012) and the thoracic aorta (p\u2009=\u20090.037) only.\tArterial calcification is highly prevalent throughout all five CKD stages and is most prominent in both the thoracic and abdominal aorta, and in the iliac arteries. Follow-up studies are needed to explore the potential of extracardiac calcification sites in prediction of cardiovascular events in the CKD population.","_input_hash":-989946874,"_task_hash":-900620953,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":80,"end":88,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":147,"end":152,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"Patients","start":203,"end":211,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":459,"end":464,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"observational","start":558,"end":571,"pattern":232030698},{"text":"study","start":589,"end":594,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"Cohort","start":683,"end":689,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"score","start":1017,"end":1022,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"prevalence","start":1134,"end":1144,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"patients","start":1303,"end":1311,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"prevalence","start":1353,"end":1363,"pattern":1787723395}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 34, 2, 80, 2, 1, 60, 53, 34, 53"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708076724,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}

{"pmid":"25637797","text":"Neuroscience^\nEnhanced angiogenesis promoted by human umbilical mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in stroked mouse is Notch1 signaling associated.^\nCellular therapy has provided hope for restoring neurological function post stroke through promoting endogenous neurogenesis, angiogenesis and synaptogenesis. The current study was based on the observation that transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) promoted the neurological function improvement in stroked mice and meanwhile enhanced angiogenesis in the stroked hemisphere. Grafted hUCMSCs secreted human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Notch1 signaling was activated after stroke and also in the grafted hUCMSCs. To address the potential mechanism that might mediate such pro-angiogenic effect, we established a hUCMSC-neuron co-culture system. Neurons were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) injury before co-culturing to mimic the in vivo cell transplantation. Consistent with the in vivo data, co-culture medium claimed from hUCMSC-OGD neuron co-culture system significantly promoted the capillary-like tube formation of brain-derived endothelial cells. Moreover, coincident with our in vivo data, Notch 1 signaling activation was detected in hUCMSCs after co-cultured with OGD neurons as demonstrated by the up-regulation of key Notch1 signaling components Notch1 and Notch1 intercellular domain (NICD). In addition, OGD-neuron co-culture also increased the VEGF-A production by hUCMSCs. To verify whether Notch1 activation was involved in the pro-angiogenic effect, \u03b3-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) was added into the co-culture medium before co-culture. It turned out that DAPT significantly prevented the Notch1 activation in hUCMSCs after co-culture with OGD neurons. More importantly, the pro-angiogenic effect of hUCMSCs was remarkably abolished by DAPT addition as demonstrated by inhibited capillary-like tube formation and less VEGF-A production. Regarding how Notch1 signaling was linked with VEGF-A secretion, we provided some clue that Notch1 effector Hes1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated by OGD-neuron co-culturing and down-regulated after additional treatment of DAPT. In summary, our data provided evidence that the VEGF-A secretion from hUCMSCs after being triggered by OGD neurons is Notch1 signaling associated. This might be a possible mechanism that contributes to the angiogenic effect of hUCMSC transplantation in stroked brain.","_input_hash":468744291,"_task_hash":-413912489,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":48,"end":53,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"mouse","start":113,"end":118,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"therapy","start":161,"end":168,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"study","start":323,"end":328,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"human","start":382,"end":387,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":420,"end":425,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"mice","start":494,"end":498,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"human","start":587,"end":592,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"vascular","start":593,"end":601,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"cells","start":1165,"end":1170,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"summary","start":2286,"end":2293,"pattern":915282476}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 81, 46, 2, 0, 70, 82, 0, 66, 70, 9"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708076853,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}

While glial scar formation by astrocytes has been extensively studied, much less is known about the fibrotic scar, in particular after stroke. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u00df-expressing (PDGFR\u00df[+]) pericytes have been suggested as a source of the fibrotic scar depositing fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins after detaching from the vessel wall. However, to what extent these parenchymal PDGFR\u00df[+] cells contribute to the fibrotic scar and whether targeting these cells affects fibrotic scar formation in stroke is still unclear. Here, we utilize male transgenic mice that after a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model have a shift from a parenchymal to a perivascular location of PDGFR\u00df[+] cells due to the loss of regulator of G-protein signaling 5 in pericytes. We find that only a small fraction of parenchymal PDGFR\u00df[+] cells co-label with type I collagen and fibronectin. Consequently, a reduction in parenchymal PDGFR\u00df[+] cells by ca. 50% did not affect the overall type I collagen or fibronectin deposition after stroke. The redistribution of PDGFR\u00df[+] cells to a perivascular location, however, resulted in a reduced thickening of the vascular basement membrane and changed the temporal dynamics of glial scar maturation after stroke. We demonstrate that parenchymal PDGFR\u00df[+] cells are not the main contributor to the fibrotic ECM, and therefore targeting these cells might not impact on fibrotic scar formation after stroke.","_input_hash":-99281735,"_task_hash":895045541,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":650,"end":655,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":716,"end":721,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"transgenic","start":804,"end":814,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"mice","start":815,"end":819,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":961,"end":966,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1095,"end":1100,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1199,"end":1204,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1331,"end":1336,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"vascular","start":1414,"end":1422,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"cells","start":1556,"end":1561,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1642,"end":1647,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 70, 77, 82, 70, 70, 70, 70, 66, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708076946,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}

Stress factors play an important role in the etiopathology of both diseases, since increased corticosteroid levels caused by chronic stress indirectly induce neuronal damage. The aim of our experiments was to evaluate the changes induced by stress in the transcription of amyloid precursor protein (APP), mitogen activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1) and beta-actin, of which the latest plays a leading role in synaptic plasticity. Additionally we intended to examine how duloxetine - a serotonin-norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor type antidepressant - would modify the stress-induced changes. Wistar rats were exposed to immobilization stress for five hours daily through 21 days, while part of the animals received 45 mg/bwkg of duloxetine. At the end of the third week total RNA was purified from the cortex and hippocampus. The amount of beta-actin, APP and MAPK-1 mRNA was determined by real time PCR method. On protein level, semiquantitative measurement was performed by Western blot. The expression of beta-actin mRNA in the animals exposed to stress was four times as intense as in the control group. The increase in the beta-actin mRNA levels was repressed by the duloxetine treatment. In the case of APP and MAPK-1 no changes were detected. According to the Western blot results, the antidepressant treatment slightly, the drug along with the stress treatment strongly decreased the amount of the beta-actin protein. Our findings indicate that antidepressant treatment with duloxetine could play a protective role against the chronic stress-induced changes in the nervous system, such as disorders of synaptic plasticity, and the consequent cognitive dysfunctions in case of both affective disorders and AD.","_input_hash":-376352602,"_task_hash":1569204278,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":214,"end":217,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"case","start":1499,"end":1503,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"case","start":1974,"end":1978,"pattern":1741807605}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 35, 35"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708076968,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}

SULEHS is an ultra-rare disorder associated with biallelic loss-of-function variants of the TASP1 gene, and up-to-date, seven patients from five families have been reported in the literature. Loss of TASP1 function has been reported to alter H3K4 histone modifications and expression of TFIIA and HOX transcription factors in the SULEHS phenotype. In this report, a new patient molecularly diagnosed with SULEHS by a novel homozygous c.404-2A > G variant in the TASP1 gene is presented with the long-term follow-up. Although the majority of the patient's clinical characteristics were similar to those of previously reported SULEHS patients, this study was the first to describe some additional anomalies, such as cystic hygroma, increased nuchal thickness, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary sequestration anomaly, chronic constipation, encephalomalacia, and aggressive behavior. Because of the remarkable similarities between the clinical features of Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BRWS) and the patient, BRWS was considered the most likely diagnosis before the molecular diagnosis. Network analysis also supported that the interaction of the SULEHS-associated TASP1 gene with the BRWS-associated ACTB and ACTG1 genes through common intermediate molecules. Overall, despite the existence of differences in clinical features, inheritance patterns, and underlying pathophysiology between BRWS and SULEHS, both diseases could be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the high clinical similarities, including the dysmorphic features, growth parameters, neurodevelopmental phenotype, neurological problems, and multisystem involvement. Additionally, this report could contribute to a better understanding of the genotypic and clinical features of SULEHS by describing a novel pathogenic variant and new clinical features, such as prenatal manifestations.","_input_hash":-30262767,"_task_hash":-595971301,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":575,"end":583,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"literature","start":629,"end":639,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"report","start":805,"end":811,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"patients","start":1081,"end":1089,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":1096,"end":1101,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1509,"end":1518,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1540,"end":1549,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"genes","start":1680,"end":1685,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1925,"end":1934,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"report","start":2129,"end":2135,"pattern":1226364217}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 5, 36, 34, 2, 56, 56, 78, 56, 36"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708076978,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}

This analysis indicates that the proportion of cases in which Addison disease is attributable to ALD is age dependent. It is highest when the adrenal insufficiency manifests before 15 years.

Cats (n = 15) were submitted to brain death by rapid inflation of an intracranial balloon. A further 12 cats served as a sham-operated control group. The changes in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, LV dP/dtmax, rate-pressure product (RPP), and circulating noradrenaline and adrenaline were studied during 240 min after the induction of brain death. Central venous pressure was kept constant. The hearts were histologically examined afterward. Electrocerebral activity disappeared within 30 sec after balloon inflation. At 3 min, noradrenaline and adrenaline levels had increased 75- and 40-fold, respectively, compared to pre-induction levels. The hemodynamic response was characterized by an early and rapid increase of hemodynamic variables at 2.9 +/- 0.2 min. This was followed by a second phase of normalization or deterioration. Two distinct subgroups (n = 9) became hemodynamically unstable (HDU), characterized by a systolic arterial blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, at 108 +/- 29 min, and progressively deteriorated to 67 +/- 8 mm Hg at 240 min after inflation of the balloon. The hemodynamic variables of the other, hemodynamically stable (HDS), subgroup (n = 6) normalized at 60 min after inflation. Hemodynamic deterioration of the HDU subgroup compared to the HDS subgroup was significant at 10 min after induction of brain death. The maximum values of RPP were similar in the two subgroups.

The questionnaire contained a scale focusing on fulfillment of adolescent needs, the Children's Depression Inventory, and items on current substance use. The results of t-tests indicated that the higher the adolescent is on the Need scale, the greater the likelihood of engaging in substance use (p < .05). Further, results indicated that cigarette smoking, drinking alcohol, and smoking marijuana are associated with significantly higher scores on the Need scale for both males and females. Although the Need scale was significantly positively correlated with the Children's Depression Inventory (r = .45, p = .0001), the two feeling states were not collinear. However, the Need scale was not significantly correlated with age, indicating that the need state is not simply a developmental process (r = .04, p = .11).

In the present study, the delivery efficiency of cationic bovine serum albumin-conjugated tanshinone IIA PEGylated nanoparticles (CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs) in rat brain was investigated. We further explored whether the protective mechanism of CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs in cerebral ischemia was associated with modulating neuronal signaling pathways. The experimental cerebral ischemia model was established to evaluate the treatment efficacy of CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs. The pharmacokinetics demonstrated that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs could obviously prolong circulation time and increase plasma concentration compared with intravenously administrated TIIA solution. The biodistribution and brain uptake study confirmed that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs possessed better brain delivery efficacy with a high drug accumulation and fluorescence quantitative level in brain. CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs effectively reduced infarction volume, neurological dysfunctions, neutrophils infiltration and neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8; upregulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and increase TGF-\u03b21 level in the ischemic brain. In addition, treatment with CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs markedly inhibited the mRNA expressions of GFAP, MMP-9, COX-2, p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK, downregulated the protein levels of GFAP, MMP-9 and COX-2, as well as decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK and JNK.

Conditioning of inflammatory cells reflects, at least in part, soluble mediators (such as transforming growth factor \u03b2 and IL-4) that are released by cancer cells and alter the phenotype of cells of the innate immune system. Signaling pathways in cancer cells that potentiate this activity are incompletely understood. The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is a cell-signaling receptor known to promote cancer cell survival, proliferation, metastasis, and cancer stem cell-like properties. The present findings show that uPAR expression in diverse cancer cells, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma cells, promotes the ability of these cells to condition co-cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages so that the macrophages express significantly increased levels of arginase 1, a biomarker of the alternatively activated M2 macrophage phenotype. Expression of transforming growth factor \u03b2 was substantially increased in uPAR-expressing cancer cells via a mechanism that requires uPA-initiated cell signaling. uPAR also controlled expression of IL-4 in cancer cells via a mechanism that involves activation of ERK1/2.

Here, we present results from a longitudinal analysis of annual counts of six bird species, using North American Breeding Bird Survey data from ten states (1994 to 2010). We fit overdispersed Poisson models to annual counts. Counts from successive years were linked by an autoregressive process that depended on WNV transmission intensity (annual West Nile neuroinvasive disease reports) and was adjusted by El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation events. These models were fit using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.\tModel fit was mostly excellent, especially for American Crows, for which our models explained between 26% and 81% of the observed variance. The impact of WNV on bird populations was quantitatively evaluated by contrasting hypothetical count trajectories (omission of WNV) with observed counts. Populations of American crows were most consistently affected with a substantial cumulative impact in six of ten states. The largest negative impact, almost 60%, was found in Illinois. A regionally substantial decline was also seen for American Robins and House Sparrows, while the other species appeared unaffected.\tOur results confirm findings from previous studies that single out American Crows as the species most vulnerable to WNV infection.

Although recent animal studies have tried to clarify the neural substrates of the MMN, the nature of schizophrenia-related deficits is unknown. In this study, we applied a novel paradigm developed from translational animal model studies to carefully deconstruct the constituent neurophysiological processes underlying MMN generation. Patients with schizophrenia (N = 25) and healthy comparison subjects (HCS; N = 27) underwent MMN testing using both a conventional auditory oddball paradigm and a 'many-standards paradigm' that was specifically developed to deconstruct the subcomponent adaptation and deviance detection processes that are presumed to underlie the MMN. Using a conventional oddball paradigm, patients with schizophrenia exhibited large effect size deficits of both duration and frequency MMN, consistent with many previous studies.

This study explored mediation of these links via trajectories of child conduct and emotional problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) from ages 4-16 years old in data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort (n = 13373). Through gender-specific structural equation models, a composite measure of exposure to early maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), predicted young adult depression at age 18 (Revised Clinical Interview Schedule - distal outcome). Mediational effects were then estimated by testing which parts of joint piecewise latent trajectory models for child/adolescent conduct and emotional problems were associated with both exposure and distal outcome. For girls, only conduct problems in early childhood were consistently indicated to mediate effects of early maternal depression on risk of young adulthood depression. Some evidence for a pathway via changing levels of childhood and adolescent emotional difficulties was also suggested. For boys, by contrast, the differing models gave less consistent findings providing some evidence for a small time-specific indirect effect via early childhood conduct problems. In addition to its practice implications the current methodological application offers considerable potential in exploratory longitudinal developmental mediation studies. \u00a9 2016 The Authors International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","_input_hash":-1381128263,"_task_hash":1068759848,"spans":[{"text":"longitudinal","start":144,"end":156,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"study","start":303,"end":308,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"Questionnaire","start":428,"end":441,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"Longitudinal","start":490,"end":502,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"Study","start":503,"end":508,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cohort","start":533,"end":539,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"Interview","start":767,"end":776,"pattern":1942352714},{"text":"methodological","start":1536,"end":1550,"pattern":2019241922},{"text":"longitudinal","start":1608,"end":1620,"pattern":-959651259}],"meta":{"pattern":"52, 2, 57, 52, 2, 1, 58, 61, 52"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708077677,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}

Hyperactive behaviour, sleep problems and epilepsy seem to be more common in AS than in other genetic conditions associated with severe intellectual disability. We hypothesised that both more sleep problems and earlier onset of epileptic seizures would predict more symptoms of hyperactivity. Hence, the aim of the project was to explore the association between hyperactive behaviour, sleep problems and age of epilepsy onset in individuals with AS.\tAll known parents/guardians (n\u00a0=\u00a0115) of individuals with AS in Norway were invited to participate in this descriptive correlational study. Fifty-six individuals (49%) responded, and 42 people (25 male and 17 female; mean age 18.5\u00a0years, range 2-57\u00a0years) with genetically verified AS were included. Scores for 'hyperactivity' and 'sleep problems' were derived from questionnaire data. Information on epilepsy was obtained from medical records.\t'Hyperactivity' was positively correlated with 'total sleep problems' (r\u00a0=\u00a00.46, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and negatively correlated with 'age of epilepsy onset' (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.47, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). 'Age of epilepsy onset' was not correlated with 'total sleep problems'. An overall multiple regression model with 'hyperactivity' as the dependent variable and 'age of epilepsy onset' and 'total sleep problems' as covariates was significant (R[2] \u00a0=\u00a00.39, F\u00a0=\u00a08.16, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Hence, hyperactivity in AS could be predicted from both age of epilepsy onset and current sleep problems.\tSleep problems may increase hyperactivity symptoms in individuals with AS. The association between hyperactivity and sleep problems in AS indicates that both should be investigated together as part of routine clinical assessment and intervention for either area of difficulty. Younger age of epilepsy onset was associated with more hyperactivity in AS, which may be related to encephalopathic effects of seizures and epilepsy.","_input_hash":2065143414,"_task_hash":1362838663,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":932,"end":937,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"questionnaire","start":1165,"end":1178,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"intervention","start":2031,"end":2043,"pattern":-2001382570}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 57, 48"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708077689,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}

[et al]^\nPositron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.^\nTo evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) on target volume delineation for radiation treatment planning.\tThe data of the literature concerning the use of PET in target volume delineation are summarized. The following points are discussed for each tumor entity: biological background for the PET investigation, sensitivity and specificity of PET (with different tracers) in comparison to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and impact of PET on target volume definition. New PET tracers, which could visualize biological pathways, such as hypoxia, proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression patterns, will also be discussed.\tThe results of clinical studies on the integration of PET in target volume definition for lung, head-and-neck, genitourinary and brain tumors were analyzed. Fluorodeoxyglucose-(FDG-)PET has a significant impact on GTV (gross tumor volume) and PTV (planning target volume) delineation in lung cancer and can detect lymph node involvement and differentiate malignant tissue from atelectasis. In head-and-neck cancer, the value of FDG-PET for radiation treatment planning is still under investigation. For example, FDG-PET could be superior to CT and MRI in the detection of lymph node metastases and unknown primary cancer and in the differentiation of viable tumor tissue after treatment. Therefore, it might play an important role in GTV definition and sparing of normal tissue. Choline PET and acetate PET are promising tracers in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but their validity in local tumor demarcation, lymph node diagnosis and detection of recurrence has to be defined in future clinical trials. FDG-PET seems to be particularly valuable in lymph node status definition in cervical cancer. In high-grade gliomas and meningiomas, methionine PET helps to define the GTV and differentiate tumor from normal tissue. For other entities like gastrointestinal cancer, lymphomas, sarcomas, etc., the data of the literature are yet insufficient. The imaging of hypoxia, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression leads to the identification of different areas of a biologically heterogeneous tumor mass that can individually be targeted using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In addition, a biological dose distribution can be generated, the socalled dose painting. However, systematic experimental and clinical trials are necessary to validate this hypothesis.\tRegarding treatment planning in radiotherapy, PET offers advantages in terms of tumor delineation and the description of biological processes. To define the real impact of this investigation in radiation treatment planning, subsequent experimental, clinical and cost-benefit analyses are required.","_input_hash":-1952071207,"_task_hash":-1081502493,"spans":[{"text":"literature","start":290,"end":300,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1671,"end":1680,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1759,"end":1768,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"trials","start":1834,"end":1840,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"literature","start":2150,"end":2160,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"radiotherapy","start":2421,"end":2433,"pattern":1529178352},{"text":"systematic","start":2541,"end":2551,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"trials","start":2578,"end":2584,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"radiotherapy","start":2660,"end":2672,"pattern":1529178352}],"meta":{"pattern":"5, 56, 56, 75, 5, 51, 6, 75, 51"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708077742,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}

Assessment of this relationship can be useful to describe cortical substrates for disease progression in migraine and to identify clinical variables that warrant management emphasis.\tThirty CM cases (mean age 40 years; male-to-female 1:4) and 30 sex-matched healthy controls (mean age 40 years) were enrolled. Participants completed self-administered and standardized questionnaires assessing headache-related clinical features and common psychological comorbidities. T1-weighted brain images were acquired on a 3T MRI. A whole-brain cortical thickness analysis was performed. Additionally, correlations between all brain regions were assessed to examine interregional cortical thickness covariance. Interactions were analyzed to identify clinical variables that were significantly associated with cortical thickness.\tThe whole brain cortical thickness analysis revealed no significant differences between CM patients and controls. However, significant associations between clinical features and cortical thickness were observed for the patients only. These associations included the right superior temporal sulcus (R[2] \u00a0=\u00a00.72, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001) and the right insula (R[2] \u00a0=\u00a00.71, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) with distinct clinical variables ie, longer history of CM, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep quality, pain self-efficacy, and somatic symptoms. Higher interregional cortical covariance was found in CM compared to controls (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.1, CI 2.10-4.56, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), such that cortical thickness between regions tended to be more correlated in patients, particularly in the temporal and frontal lobes.\tCM patients have significantly greater cortical covariance compared to controls. Cortical thickness in CM patients was predominantly accounted for by CM duration, PTSD, and poor sleep quality, while improved pain self-efficacy buffered cortical thickness. While it is important to address all CM features and comorbidities, it may be useful to emphasize optimizing the management of certain clinical features that contribute to cortical abnormalities including managing PTSD, early management to shorten duration of CM, and improving pain self-efficacy and sleep quality.","_input_hash":-2140079251,"_task_hash":1504957160,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":154,"end":159,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1466,"end":1474,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1594,"end":1602,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"history","start":1787,"end":1794,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"patients","start":2089,"end":2097,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2150,"end":2158,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2253,"end":2261,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 34, 34, 64, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708077768,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}
{"pmid":"8102036","text":"The American journal of physiology^\nAutonomic control of pancreatic polypeptide and glucagon secretion during neuroglucopenia and hypoglycemia in mice.^\nNeural control of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release has not been previously investigated in the mouse. In addition, it is not known to what extent increased glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia in mice is neurally mediated vs. an effect of hypoglycemia to directly stimulate glucagon secretion at the level of the islet. Feeding or the cholinergic agonist carbachol increased plasma PP levels in conscious mice (+74 +/- 18 pg/ml vs. fasted mice and +141 +/- 17 pg/ml vs. control, respectively). Neuroglucopenia induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose or insulin-induced hypoglycemia also increased plasma PP (+79 +/- 18 and +89 +/- 11 pg/ml vs. control, respectively). These increases were abolished by hexamethonium and reduced by atropine methylnitrate (atropine). Hypoglycemia-induced hyperglucagonemia (+1,243 +/- 275 pg/ml) was reduced to 31 +/- 7% of control by atropine (+382 +/- 85 pg/ml), to 48 +/- 9% of control by combined adrenergic blockade (+601 +/- 112 pg/ml), and nearly abolished by atropine plus combined blockade (+143 +/- 41 pg/ml; 11 +/- 3% of control) or hexamethonium (+151 +/- 38 pg/ml; 12 +/- 3% of control). We conclude the following in the mouse. 1) Feeding or cholinergic agonists increase plasma PP. 2) During neuroglucopenia or hypoglycemia, plasma PP is increased via nicotinic and muscarinic mechanisms. 3) The glucagon response to hypoglycemia is predominantly the result of autonomic activation and is mediated by both muscarinic and adrenergic mechanisms.","_input_hash":-584264067,"_task_hash":1168526309,"spans":[{"text":"mouse","start":251,"end":256,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mice","start":354,"end":358,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":563,"end":567,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":597,"end":601,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mouse","start":1313,"end":1318,"pattern":-1086236359}],"meta":{"pattern":"81, 82, 82, 82, 81"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708077818,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}
{"pmid":"26513639","text":"Forensic science international^\nMethadone related deaths compared to all prescription related deaths.^\nMethadone is increasingly implicated in unintentional overdose deaths. Despite major interventions, rates continue to remain high. One primary intervention, Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) are limited in their ability to impact this epidemic due to federal law restricting Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) from sharing data to PDMPs, despite being a major source of Methadone dispensing.\tThis retrospective, observational study analyzed all prescription-related deaths occurring in San Diego County during the year 2013 with a specific focus on methadone-related deaths. All patients designated by medical examiner to have died by unintentional prescription were then referenced in the California PDMP, the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES).\tAs a whole, patients who died had a high number of average prescriptions, 21, and averaged 4.5 different providers, and three different pharmacies. Methadone-related deaths (MRD) accounted for 46 out of the 254 total patient deaths (18.1%). Methadone prescriptions were found in 14 patients with PDMP reports, 10 of who had methadone on toxicology report. Notably, 100% of methadone prescribed by primary care specialists. MRD patients were less likely to have toxicology reports matching PDMP data compared to other related drug deaths (20.6 vs. 61.2%, p<0.0001). Of the 46 methadone deaths, only 10 (29.4%) had prescriptions for methadone recorded in the database. Out of the 51 patients with only one drug recorded at death, methadone was most common (n=12; 23.5%). While all deaths had a notably high rate of chronic prescriptions at death (68.8% compared to 2% for all patients in CURES), there was no significant difference between MRD and other drug-related deaths (73.5 vs. 67.8%, p=0.68, respectively). MRD patients were less likely than other drug patients to have matching PDMP data without any illicit substance or alcohol (14.7 vs. 41.4%, p=0.003, respectively).\tMethadone is a long-acting opioid that carries a higher risk profile than other opioids. In San Diego, the great majority of MRD had no data on methadone in the statewide PDMP database, bringing to question the restriction of OTP clinics from uploading information into the database. A risk-benefit analysis should be made to consider changing laws that would allow for OTP to input data into PDMP. OTP should make it standard of care to check PDMP data on their patients. Methadone prescribed for pain management should be limited to the most compliant patients.","_input_hash":-1757622503,"_task_hash":669482190,"spans":[{"text":"intervention","start":246,"end":258,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"retrospective","start":509,"end":522,"pattern":1350033973},{"text":"observational","start":524,"end":537,"pattern":232030698},{"text":"study","start":538,"end":543,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":691,"end":699,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Controlled","start":823,"end":833,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"Review","start":856,"end":862,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"patients","start":906,"end":914,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1176,"end":1184,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"report","start":1242,"end":1248,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"patients","start":1321,"end":1329,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1575,"end":1583,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1768,"end":1776,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1910,"end":1918,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1952,"end":1960,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2533,"end":2541,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2624,"end":2632,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"48, 65, 80, 2, 34, 27, 4, 34, 34, 36, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708077869,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}

{"pmid":"29067401","text":"Journal of vision^\nMotion-generated optical information allows event perception despite blurry vision in AMD and amblyopic patients.^\nEvents consist of objects in motion. When objects move, their opaque surfaces reflect light and produce both static image structure and dynamic optic flow. The static and dynamic optical information co-specify events. Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and amblyopia cannot identify static objects because of weakened image structure. However, optic flow is detectable despite blurry vision because visual motion measurement uses low spatial frequencies. When motion ceases, image structure persists and might preserve properties specified by optic flow. We tested whether optic flow and image structure interact to allow event perception with poor static vision. AMD (Experiment 1), amblyopic (Experiments 2 and 3), and normally sighted observers identified common events from either blurry (Experiments 1 and 2) or clear images (Experiment 3), when either single image frames were presented, a sequence of frames was presented with motion masks, or a sequence of frames was presented with detectable motion. Results showed that with static images, but no motion, events were not perceived well by participants other than controls in Experiment 3. However, with detectable motion, events were perceived. Immediately following this and again after five days, participants were able to identify events from the original static images. So, when image structure information is weak, optic flow compensates for it and enables event perception. Furthermore, weakened static image structure information nevertheless preserves information that was once available in optic flow. The combination is powerful and allows events to be perceived accurately and stably despite blurry vision.","_input_hash":995578159,"_task_hash":-1764134644,"spans":[{"text":"Patients","start":352,"end":360,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708078008,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53","_session_id":"2024-02-16_10-44-53"}

A sound diagnostic assessment is indispendable for this task. In a second step the level of severity needs to be gauged in order to clarify whether the requirement of the entry criteria of \u00a7\u00a7 20, 21 of the German penal code are fulfilled. In a third step, significant impairments of self-control mechanisms need to be elucidated. The present article reviews indicators of such impairments regarding pedophilia. With respect to a mandatory treatment order (\u00a7 63 German penal code) or preventive detention (\u00a7 66 German penal code) the legal prognosis of the defendant needs to be considered.

Recent studies revealed that the ferroptosis pathway is involved in the death process of dopaminergic neurons in PD. The aberrant endosomal sorting pathway, which results in aberrant iron level in eukaryotic cells, may serve a role in the ferroptosis pathway in PD condition. However, its specific molecular mechanisms remained unclear. In the present study, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, the rank ordering of super-enhancers (ROSE) algorithm, and RNA interference (RNAi) to explore the regulatory mechanism of PD-specific super-enhancer (SE) in the endosomal sorting pathway and ferroptosis pathway of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats and cells. The ChIP assay and ROSE algorithm results showed that there are specific SEs expression in 6-OHDA-lesioned SNc of PD rats, and the most significant expression gene is Sorting Nexin 5 (SNX5). SNX5 silencing by RNAi experiments significantly decreased the level of ferroptosis in 6-OHDA-lesioned PC12 cells, suggesting the correlation between the SNX5, ferroptosis, and PD. In conclusion, this study investigated the mechanism by which PD-specific SE driven SNX5 promoted the ferroptosis level in PD models. This study further improved the understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis during PD injury and provided potential therapeutic targets and clinical diagnostic markers in PD condition.","_input_hash":1497974493,"_task_hash":769124923,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":476,"end":481,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":620,"end":625,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cells","start":923,"end":928,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1229,"end":1234,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":1322,"end":1327,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1441,"end":1446,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1554,"end":1565,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1587,"end":1597,"pattern":-808942259}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 2, 70, 70, 2, 2, 47, 55"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708080524,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

Magnetic resonance images were acquired at t(3) and nine years after baseline all participants were screened for dementia. Three groups were distinguished: (1) participants who did not develop dementia or cognitive decline, (2) participants who did not develop dementia but did show significant cognitive decline, and (3) participants who developed dementia. Gray matter volume of structures in the PFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL) was measured. Prefrontal volume was significantly smaller in group 3 than in the other two groups, and PFC volume was significantly better than MTL volume in distinguishing between groups 2 and 3.

From February 1996 to July 2003, all brachial artery pseudoaneurysms secondary to drug abuse as diagnosed by duplex imaging were recruited for the study. Aneurysm excision, ligation, and radical debridement along with revascularization by axial reanastomosis were performed for all patients except one with chronic degenerative fusiform aneurysm, who received aneurysm resection and interposition reverse saphenous vein graft. Upper limb arterial flow was evaluated clinically and with hand-held Doppler in the perioperative period and during subsequent follow-up. During the study period, nine consecutive patients presented with cubital fossa swelling following deliberate drug arterial injections. Two of them suffered from thromboembolic complications and were managed conservatively by heparinization. Seven patients (six male, one female), aged 32-53, were confirmed to have brachial artery pseudoaneurysms by duplex scan and recruited for data analysis. Pseudoaneurysms ranged 10-40 mm in size. One ex-heroin abuser, who presented with median nerve palsy, underwent aneurysm resection and reversed saphenous vein interposition. The other six patients presented with painful pulsatile cubital fossa swellings. They underwent aneurysm resection, extensive debridement, and primary axial reanastomosis. There were no perioperative procedure-related complications. With an average follow-up of 38.7 months, no recurrences or neurovascular complications were detected.

{"pmid":"33779331","text":"Human & experimental toxicology^\nBone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes reduce apoptosis and inflammatory response during spinal cord injury by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.^\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most common destructive injuries, which may lead to permanent neurological dysfunction. Currently, transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in experimental models of SCI shows promise as effective therapies. BMSCs secrete various factors that can regulate the microenvironment, which is called paracrine effect. Among these paracrine substances, exosomes are considered to be the most valuable therapeutic factors. Our study found that BMSCs-derived exosomes therapy attenuated cell apoptosis and inflammation response in the injured spinal cord tissues. In in vitro studies, BMSCs-derived exosomes significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PC12 cell apoptosis, reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL (interleukin)-1\u03b2 and promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors including IL-10 and IL-4. Moreover, we found that LPS-induced protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and nuclear transcription factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) was significantly downregulated after treatment with BMSCs-derived exosomes. In in vivo studies, we found that hindlimb motor function was significantly improved in SCI rats with systemic administration of BMSCs-derived exosomes. We also observed that the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and pro-inflammatory factors was significantly decreased, while the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and anti-inflammatory factors were upregulated in SCI rats after exosome treatment. In conclusion, BMSCs-derived exosomes can inhibit apoptosis and inflammation response induced by injury and promote motor function recovery by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which suggests that BMSCs-derived exosomes are expected to become a new therapeutic strategy for SCI.","_input_hash":1479517580,"_task_hash":1311603430,"spans":[{"text":"Human","start":0,"end":5,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":62,"end":67,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":395,"end":400,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapeutic","start":663,"end":674,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"study","start":688,"end":693,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapy","start":728,"end":735,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"therapeutic","start":2064,"end":2075,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 70, 70, 47, 2, 46, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708080702,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

The role of tumour grading as independent prognostic factor in these group of tumours remains matter of debate. The aim of this study was to determine if grade is an independent prognostic factor and not somehow associated to IDH mutation and 1p/19q status of the tumour.\tWe analysed 399 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, histologically proven World Health Organisation (WHO) 2016 grade II or grade III IDH-mut gliomas, assessed by polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry\u00a0or next-generation sequencing (NGS).\tThe analysis included 399 patients with grade II (n\u00a0=\u00a0250, 62.7%) or grade III (n\u00a0=\u00a0149, 37.3%) diffuse gliomas.

Periodic limb movement during sleep (PLMS), markers of sleep fragmentation, and systolic and mean BP non-dipping profile were more frequent among patients. BP non-dipping status was associated with older age, later RLS onset and diagnosis, RLS severity and higher sleep fragmentation.

The age-eligible cases decreased from 710 in year 1 to 691 in year 2 and 643 in year 3. Decedents classified as alcoholics rose from 18% in year 1 to 25% in years 2 and 3. The proportions classified as narcotic abusers and those with both conditions were relatively constant, averaging 7 and 5%, respectively, over the 3 years. Substance abuse itself was the manner of death for alcoholics and most of those with both conditions; 38% of the narcotics abusers were homicide victims. There were no appreciable demographic changes among substance abusers during this period.","_input_hash":-777839503,"_task_hash":-842454517,"spans":[{"text":"case","start":449,"end":453,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"report","start":461,"end":467,"pattern":1226364217}],"meta":{"pattern":"35, 36"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708080737,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

DNA methylation may be a possible mechanism for persistence of such memory. Here we injected the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza) into hippocampus CA1 area and prelimbic cortex during the stages of acquisition and expression of cocaine-induced place preference in C57BL/6 mice. Results showed that in CA1 DNA methylation inhibitors could restrain acquisition but had no impact on expression of the cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). On the contrary, in prelimbic cortex, 5-aza had no effect on acquisition but blocked expression. Our results indicated that DNA methylation in hippocampus is required for learning; while DNA methylation in prelimbic cortex is necessary for memory retrieval. The present finding is consistent with the role of the hippocampus as a structure contributing to cocaine-induced memory acquisition, and prelimbic cortex, a part of prefrontal cortex as an area responsible for cocaine-induced memory retrieval. In conclusion, DNA methylation does play an important role in drug-induced learning and memory although the detailed effect still calls for further research.","_input_hash":1895047881,"_task_hash":-141819311,"spans":[{"text":"mice","start":618,"end":622,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708080771,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

While development of depression in response to the disability and emotional stress of AD may be a contributory factor in some patients, several studies showed that depression was not, or was only seldom, related to self-awareness of AD and these studies could not explain the high prevalence figures. To overcome the overlapping phenomenology of the two diseases, specific diagnostic criteria have been developed for depression in this context. Mixed findings have come from neuropathological and neuroimaging studies, with some evidence linking the underlying neural substrate of AD and depression, suggesting an overlapping cause of primary depression and depression comorbid with AD. Few randomized controlled trials for depression associated with AD have been conducted, with rather poor results for the use of antidepressants.\tCurrently, depression associated with AD is not considered a separate disorder by regulatory authorities and is unlikely to be considered as such in the near future. Several obstacles remain to support such a specific position, including the heterogenous nature of depression in general and within AD itself, the lack of a distinct set of symptoms, and limited treatment.","_input_hash":157695266,"_task_hash":542225282,"spans":[{"text":"Case","start":39,"end":43,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"aims","start":115,"end":119,"pattern":-2080524606},{"text":"study","start":128,"end":133,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"literature","start":339,"end":349,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"patients","start":397,"end":405,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":580,"end":588,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"prevalence","start":735,"end":745,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"diagnostic","start":827,"end":837,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"randomized","start":1145,"end":1155,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":1156,"end":1166,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trials","start":1167,"end":1173,"pattern":1849967594}],"meta":{"pattern":"35, 43, 2, 5, 34, 34, 53, 55, 18, 27, 75"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708080791,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

Nitrite was assayed in 'spot' morning urine samples in both the enuretics and normal controls. Enuretics were then given 50 mg indomethacin suppositories each night; urine volume, urinary osmolality and electrolytes, serum osmolality and electrolytes and urinary nitrite were assayed before indomethacin treatment and after 15 days of treatment.\tThe mean (sd) urinary nitrite excretion was 24.4 (19.6) micromol/L in normal children and 275.9 (111.2) micromol/L in enuretics (P<0.05). With indomethacin, the urinary nitrite concentration was significantly decreased to 141 (45.1) micromol/L (P<0.05) and associated with a significant reduction in bed-wetting episodes and voiding frequency. The functional bladder capacity was <70% of the predicted value for age in six of the patients; they had significant improvements on indomethacin, to values similar to those in patients with a nearly normal functional bladder capacity. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary volume by 41%, the night volume by 40%, clearance of free water by 46% and increased the day : night urinary volume ratio by 55%. The absolute amounts of urinary calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, urea, creatinine, and glucose were lower on indomethacin, although not statistically significantly so. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary and 'spot' morning osmolality and osmotic clearance. There were no significant changes in serum osmolality and electrolyte concentrations. Indomethacin also decreased the absolute amount of urinary sodium, chloride and potassium, fractional sodium and potassium excretion, and filtered sodium. Creatinine clearance was decreased by 20% (P>0.05) and normal 24-h urinary protein was significantly lower, by 47%, after indomethacin treatment (P<0.05).\tUrinary nitrite excretion increased significantly in patients with primary nocturnal enuresis; indomethacin markedly reduced bed-wetting episodes and decreased the frequency of voiding in enuretics with small or normal functional bladder capacity, which was associated with a significant decrease in urinary nitrite excretion. Indomethacin reduced bed-wetting by decreasing the urine volume, clearance of free water and urinary electrolytes, and through possible effects on bladder and urethral contraction, by inhibiting NO and prostaglandin synthesis.

Here, we show that endogenous neural precursor cells perform an anti-tumour response by specifically targeting stem-like brain tumour cells. In vitro, neural precursor cells predominantly express bone morphogenetic protein-7; bone morphogenetic protein-7 is constitutively released from neurospheres and induces canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells. Exposure of human and murine stem-like brain tumour cells to neurosphere-derived bone morphogenetic protein-7 induces tumour stem cell differentiation, attenuates stem-like marker expression and reduces self-renewal and the ability for tumour initiation. Neurosphere-derived or recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-7 reduces glioblastoma expansion from stem-like cells by down-regulating the transcription factor Olig2. In vivo, large numbers of bone morphogenetic protein-7-expressing neural precursors encircle brain tumours in young mice, induce canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells and can thereby attenuate tumour formation. This anti-tumour response is strongly reduced in older mice. Our results indicate that endogenous neural precursor cells protect the young brain from glioblastoma by releasing bone morphogenetic protein-7, which acts as a paracrine tumour suppressor that represses proliferation, self-renewal and tumour-initiation of stem-like glioblastoma cells.","_input_hash":-609888004,"_task_hash":1957551490,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":102,"end":107,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":186,"end":191,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":309,"end":314,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":396,"end":401,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":430,"end":435,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":648,"end":653,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"human","start":667,"end":672,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":707,"end":712,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1020,"end":1025,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"mice","start":1193,"end":1197,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":1280,"end":1285,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"mice","start":1385,"end":1389,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":1445,"end":1450,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1671,"end":1676,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 0, 70, 70, 82, 70, 82, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708087622,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

For the past decades, the efficacy criteria for surgical treatment of acromegaly have significantly changed, which requires appropriate correction.\tWe aimed to evaluate the results of transsphenoidal adenomectomy in acromegaly patients using various criteria for disease remission.\tThe study included patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly who underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic adenomectomy performed by a single neurosurgeon. The surgical treatment outcomes were evaluated 6 months after operative intervention based on levels of IGF-1, OGTT, and GH. The obtained data were analyzed using different threshold values for the level of GH nadir during OGTT: criteria A <2.0 ng/ml, criteria B <1.0 ng/ml, and criteria C <0.4 ng/ml to assess acromegaly remission, along with matching of the IGF-1 level to the reference range for a given gender and age.\tThe study included 70 patients (52 females and 18 males) with a mean age of 52.2\u00b111.5 years (29 to 73 years). The baseline IGF-1 level exceeded the upper limit of the reference range 3.3\u00b11.4 (1.1-7.3)-fold, on average. The baseline mean basal GH level was 34.2\u00b141.7 (1.2-192.0) ng/ml. The mean pituitary adenoma size was 16.7\u00b18.6 (4.3-46.0) mm; 18 (26%) out of 70 patients had pituitary microadenoma, and 52 (74%) patients had macroadenoma. Six months after surgery, acromegaly remission met criteria A in 47 (67%) patients, criteria B in 28 (40%) patients, and criteria C in 18 (26%) patients.\tOur findings demonstrate that evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in treatment of acromegaly patients depends on the criteria chosen for assessing remission.

Because cellular injury mechanisms and therapeutic approaches may depend on the severity of the initial insult, it is important to utilize a model in which outcomes are sensitive to injury severity. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized and subjected to sham injury (n = 23) or CCI injury at either 0.5 mm (n = 22) or 1.0 mm (n = 22) depth of impact at a velocity of 5 m/sec. At 2 days, brain-injured mice exhibited significant memory (p < 0.05) and motor function (p < 0.001) deficits compared to sham-injured mice; furthermore, mice subjected to an impact of 1.0 mm were significantly more impaired in both outcome measures than those injured at 0.5 mm (p < 0.05). The cortical lesion increased in size between 24 h and 7 days in both injury groups, but was significantly larger in the 1.0 mm group. Hippocampal cell loss was observed in the hilar and CA3 regions in both groups, and in the CA1 and dentate granule cell layers in the 1.0 mm group. Regional patterns of IgG extravasation and reactive astrocytosis were similar in the two injured groups, but changes were more persistent in the 1.0 mm group. Both levels of injury resulted in acute loss of neuronal MAP-2 immunoreactivity in the cortex and sub-region specific changes in the hippocampus. Thus, increasing the depth of impact led to similar structural alterations in neurons, astrocytes and the vasculature, but resulted in greater behavioral deficits and cortical and hippocampal cell death.","_input_hash":199389476,"_task_hash":-182941574,"spans":[{"text":"Controlled","start":123,"end":133,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"mice","start":252,"end":256,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"therapeutic","start":386,"end":397,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"mice","start":565,"end":569,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":752,"end":756,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":862,"end":866,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":881,"end":885,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"27, 82, 47, 82, 82, 82, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708087875,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of magnolol on the proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and neointima formation in vivo, as well as the related cell signaling mechanisms.\tTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induced proliferation ofVSMCs was assessed using colorimetric assay. Cell cycle progression and mRNA expression of cell cycle associated molecules were determined by flow cytometry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respectively. The signaling molecules such as ERK1/2,JNK, P38 and NF-kappaB were determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, rat carotid artery balloon injury model was performed to assess the effect of magnolol on neointima formation in vivo.\tOral administration of magnolol significantly inhibited intimal area and intimal/medial ratio (I/M). Our in vitro assays revealed magnolol dose dependently induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. Also, magnolol inhibited mRNA and protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK2 in vitro and in vivo. The cell cycle arrest was associated with inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB translocation.\tMagnolol suppressed proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and attenuated neointima formation in vivo by inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 through modulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK2 expression.\tThus, the results suggest that magnolol could be a potential therapeutic candidate for the prevention of restenosis and atherosclerosis.","_input_hash":-1318627569,"_task_hash":-107051593,"spans":[{"text":"vascular","start":154,"end":162,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"vascular","start":251,"end":259,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"cells","start":274,"end":279,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":402,"end":407,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rat","start":980,"end":983,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1776,"end":1787,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"66, 66, 70, 2, 92, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708088002,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

High levels of ED related symptoms were associated with 'concretised' understanding of own emotions (i.e. a greater number of food related responses), but sophisticated understanding of same sex acquaintance's emotions. They were associated with fewer positive thoughts for self, fewer negative emotions about their own behaviour, and more food responses for same sex acquaintance's behaviour. Similarities and differences were observed in the different perspectives. Limitations are discussed. Implications for further research related to this topic and relevant to EDs are briefly summarised.","_input_hash":1443896365,"_task_hash":-1551399107,"spans":[{"text":"review","start":26,"end":32,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"study","start":183,"end":188,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"report","start":395,"end":401,"pattern":1226364217}],"meta":{"pattern":"4, 2, 36"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708088049,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

{"pmid":"29802210","text":"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)^\nNeuroprotection via AT2 receptor agonists in ischemic stroke.^\nStroke is a devastating disease that afflicts millions of people each year worldwide. Ischemic stroke, which accounts for ~88% of cases, occurs when blood supply to the brain is decreased, often because of thromboembolism or atherosclerotic occlusion. This deprives the brain of oxygen and nutrients, causing immediate, irreversible necrosis within the core of the ischemic area, but more delayed and potentially reversible neuronal damage in the surrounding brain tissue, the penumbra. The only currently approved therapies for ischemic stroke, the thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and the endovascular clot retrieval/destruction processes, are aimed at restoring blood flow to the infarcted area, but are only available for a minority of patients and are not able in most cases to completely restore neurological deficits. Consequently, there remains a need for agents that will protect neurones against death following ischemic stroke. Here, we evaluate angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 (AT2) receptor agonists as a possible therapeutic target for this disease. We first provide an overview of stroke epidemiology, pathophysiology, and currently approved therapies. We next review the large amount of preclinical evidence, accumulated over the past decade and a half, which indicates that AT2 receptor agonists exert significant neuroprotective effects in various animal models, and discuss the potential mechanisms involved. Finally, after discussing the challenges of delivering blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeable AT2 receptor agonists to the infarcted areas of the brain, we summarize the evidence for and against the development of these agents as a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.","_input_hash":965449413,"_task_hash":1886676366,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":880,"end":888,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1166,"end":1177,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"epidemiology","start":1242,"end":1254,"pattern":-2128961709},{"text":"review","start":1315,"end":1321,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"animal","start":1505,"end":1511,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"summarize","start":1722,"end":1731,"pattern":1982627683},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1808,"end":1819,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 47, 54, 4, 67, 8, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708088249,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}
{"pmid":"9268809","text":"Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology^\nThe Post-Stroke Depression Rating Scale: a test specifically devised to investigate affective disorders of stroke patients.^\nOwing to the lack of instruments specifically constructed to study emotional and affective disorders of stroke patients, the nature of post-stroke depression (PSD) remains controversial. With this in mind, the authors constructed a new scale, the Post-Stroke Depression Scale (PSDS) which takes into account a series of symptoms and problems commonly observed in depressed stroke patients. The PSDS and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDS) were administered to a group of 124 patients, who had been classified, on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria, in the following categories: No depression (n = 32); Minor PSD (n = 47); Major PSD (n = 45). Scores obtained by these stroke patients on the PSDS and on the HDS were compared to those obtained on the same scales by 17 psychiatric patients also classified as major depression on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria. An analysis of the symptomatological profiles clearly showed that: (1) a continuum exists between the so-called 'major' and 'minor' forms of PSD; (2) in both groups of depressed stroke patients the depressive symptomatology seems due to the psychological reaction to the devastating consequences of stroke, since the motivated aspects of depression prevailed in depressed stroke patients, whereas the (biologically determined) unmotivated aspects prevailed in patients with a functional form of major depression; and (3) in stroke patients a DSM III-based diagnosis of major PSD could be in part inflated by symptoms (such as apathy and vegetative disorders) that are typical of major depression in a patient free from brain damage, but that could be due to the brain lesion per se in a stroke patient.","_input_hash":-639306682,"_task_hash":1724826964,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":240,"end":245,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":290,"end":298,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":559,"end":567,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":661,"end":669,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnostic","start":722,"end":732,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":868,"end":876,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":973,"end":981,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1044,"end":1054,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":1250,"end":1258,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1444,"end":1452,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1525,"end":1533,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1596,"end":1604,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1621,"end":1630,"pattern":-1255217628}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 34, 34, 34, 55, 34, 34, 55, 34, 34, 34, 34, 56"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708088253,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

If this is not the case the assumption could lead to bias, e.g. when men of different ages are compared in interventional studies on ED. Objective: To explore the risk of developing ED over time for men from different age groups. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was sent to a number of male residents in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1992 (n = 10,458). Men were randomly selected according to year of birth to obtain several cohorts at 5-year intervals of ages 45, 50, 55 years, etc., up to the age of 85 or older. In 2003 an analogous, slightly expanded, questionnaire was sent to a random sample of men from the age cohorts 46, 51 years, etc. (n = 10,845). A total of 4072 men received both surveys, thereby constituting a group of men followed longitudinally for 11 years. The future risk of developing ED in the different age cohorts, adjusted for a number of ED risk factors, was then assessed. Results: A total of 3257 men responded to both questionnaires (response rate = 80%, age range = 56-103 years). The risk of having ED increased substantially with increasing age, both within each survey and longitudinally between the surveys. The adjusted risk of developing ED within the next 11 years increased with a factor of 10, from 1.8% at the age of 45 years at baseline to as much as 11.4% at the age of 65 years.

{"pmid":"15970229","text":"Social science & medicine (1982)^\nIndividual socio-economic status, community socio-economic status and stroke in New Zealand: a case control study.^\nThere is considerable debate about the association between individual socio-economic status, community socio-economic status and health. The current study examines individual data from a case-control study of stroke (n = 3489) conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. The study sought to identify whether individual socio-economic status (as measured by income from lifetime occupation) and community socio-economic status (measured in a number of ways) predicts the onset of stroke both independently and after controlling for individual risk factors (e.g., smoking, obesity and hypertension). Logistic regression results show that individual socio-economic status and all of the community socio-economic status measures predict the onset of stroke before controlling for individual risk factors. However, there is a high correlation between the various measures of community socio-economic status.

A study in opioid-dependent patients.^\nA history of sexual violence has been related to more complex treatment needs in patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Most of the existing studies, however, included patients with various types of SUD, did not examine gender differences and focused on a small range of clinical domains. Our sample consisted of opioid-dependent outpatients treated during a three-year period in a German metropolitan region. The analysis was based on a local case register and included all patients for whom information on lifetime sexual violence was available (N=3531; 68.3% males). In a case-control design, patients with a history of sexual violence were compared to patients without these experiences regarding a wide range of clinical and social factors indicative of potential needs. Almost two thirds (65.6%) of the female patients and 10.9% of the males reported experiences of sexual violence. Victims differed from non-victims across a variety of domains, including more psychiatric symptoms and suicide attempts, more legal problems, financial and family problems, as well as a higher use of services. In contrast to a previous study among alcohol-dependent patients, no gender differences became apparent. Our findings suggest that experiences of sexual violence are an indicator for more complex needs in opioid-dependent patients of both genders. In addition to integrated trauma-informed approaches, an effort needs to be made to link addiction facilities to further institutions to meet these complex needs.","_input_hash":874471595,"_task_hash":686215891,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":84,"end":92,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":125,"end":130,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"history","start":164,"end":171,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"patients","start":243,"end":251,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":336,"end":344,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"case","start":612,"end":616,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"patients","start":643,"end":651,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"case","start":743,"end":747,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"patients","start":764,"end":772,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"history","start":780,"end":787,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"patients","start":824,"end":832,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":984,"end":992,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":1293,"end":1298,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1323,"end":1331,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1489,"end":1497,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 64, 34, 34, 35, 34, 35, 34, 64, 34, 34, 2, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708088404,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

This conclusion provides little help to clinicians who provide interventions for depressed PWE. The aim of this review was to systematically and qualitatively review the literature on the efficacy of CBT for depression in PWE based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case series. We aim to determine patterns in the literature to inform the type of CBT, if any, that should be offered to PWE who are depressed. Databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane EBM Reviews were searched via OVID. Selection criteria included the following: (1) participants with epilepsy; (2) use of CBT; (3) valid depression outcome measure; and (4) published in peer-reviewed journal in English. Inclusions of studies were assessed by two independent researchers. We identified 14 outcome papers for 13 CBT trials including 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 case series. Positive effects of CBT on depression were reported in three of six RCTs. A review of their content revealed that all effective RCTs specifically tailored CBT to improve depression. Conversely, two of three RCTs that failed to find depression-related effects focused on improving seizure-control. This pattern was also observed in the case series. Although limited in number and having methodologic limitations, the treatment studies included in our review suggest that interventions tailored toward improving depression are possibly efficacious, whereas those that focus on improving seizure control do not appear to be. However, this review highlights that there is need for further RCTs in this area in order to confirm the possible efficacy of CBT for depression in PWE.","_input_hash":-1215016399,"_task_hash":897813584,"spans":[{"text":"therapy","start":30,"end":37,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"systematic","start":80,"end":90,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"therapy","start":121,"end":128,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"review","start":235,"end":241,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"therapy","start":308,"end":315,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"review","start":442,"end":448,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"review","start":489,"end":495,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"literature","start":500,"end":510,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"randomized","start":565,"end":575,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":576,"end":586,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trials","start":587,"end":593,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"case","start":605,"end":609,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"literature","start":654,"end":664,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"trials","start":1126,"end":1132,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"randomized","start":1145,"end":1155,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"controlled","start":1156,"end":1166,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trials","start":1167,"end":1173,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"case","start":1187,"end":1191,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"review","start":1276,"end":1282,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"case","start":1535,"end":1539,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"review","start":1650,"end":1656,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"review","start":1836,"end":1842,"pattern":692368738}],"meta":{"pattern":"46, 6, 46, 4, 46, 4, 4, 5, 18, 27, 75, 35, 5, 75, 18, 27, 75, 35, 4, 35, 4, 4"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708088423,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

Attitude of nursing personnel].^\nInside the realm of therapeutic relationships, one recognizes the importance of the nurse's attitude towards patients as one of those elements bearing influence on the objectives desired by the nursing profession. This study compares the attitudes towards via parenteral drug addicts held by nursing students and non specialized nurses. By means of a pilot study which used a selfadministered Litcker scale questionnaire developed by the study authors, two samples were selected: a student sample (n = 40) and a non specialized nurse sample (n = 40).

The conclusion drawn from this study is that the attitude of nursing students is significantly more positive towards via parenteral drug addicts than the attitude held by non specialized nurses. The adoption of a more negative attitude towards these patients occurs at the start of a nurse's professional career.","_input_hash":-1779581308,"_task_hash":-1518501448,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":52,"end":60,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapeutic","start":115,"end":126,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"patients","start":204,"end":212,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":314,"end":319,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":452,"end":457,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"questionnaire","start":502,"end":515,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"study","start":533,"end":538,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":826,"end":831,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1045,"end":1053,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 47, 34, 2, 2, 57, 2, 2, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708088507,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

Previous studies indicate that several components of emotional processing are intact in schizophrenia when subjects are instructed to attend to emotionally-evocative stimuli. However, few studies have examined whether emotional stimuli capture attention to a normal degree in people with schizophrenia when attention is directed elsewhere. The current event-related potential study examined motivated attention to task-irrelevant emotional stimuli in 35 stabilized outpatients and 26 healthy controls with a modified visual P300 oddball detection task. Participants viewed images of rare target and commonly occurring standard letter stimuli, as well as intermixed emotional (unpleasant, pleasant, neutral) pictures. Subjects were instructed to count the number of rare targets; the emotional valence of the picture stimuli was, therefore, task-irrelevant. We separately evaluated the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) and Late Positive Potential (LPP) to emotional pictures and the P300 to target stimuli. Patients and controls showed similar patterns of EPN and LPP amplitude to the emotional stimuli, such that the EPN and LPP were larger for both pleasant and unpleasant versus neutral pictures. Although patients performed worse than controls on the target counting task, both groups showed comparable P300 differentiation between target versus non-target stimuli. Emotional stimuli captured attentional resources in people with schizophrenia even when the emotional stimuli were task-irrelevant, suggesting intact motivated attention at the level of early electrophysiological responding.","_input_hash":23204340,"_task_hash":552315519,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":643,"end":648,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"Patients","start":1273,"end":1281,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1475,"end":1483,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708088581,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

Additionally, these essential metals play key roles in ensuring proper brain development and function. They also play vital roles in the central nervous system as significant cofactors for several enzymes, including the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and other enzymes that take part in the creation and breakdown of neurotransmitters in the brain. An imbalance in the levels of these metals weakens the structural, regulatory, and catalytic roles of different enzymes, proteins, receptors, and transporters and is known to provoke the development of various neurological conditions through different mechanisms, such as via induction of oxidative stress, increased \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and fibril formation, and stimulation of microglial cells, thus resulting in inflammation and reduced production of metalloproteins. In the present review, the authors focus on neurological disorders with psychiatric signs associated with copper, iron, and manganese excess and the diagnosis and potential treatment of such disorders.

However, postoperative progressive spinal deformity complicates outcome in a subset of patients after surgery. We set out to determine whether the use of laminoplasty (LP) vs laminectomy (LM) has reduced the incidence of subsequent spinal deformity following intradural tumor resection at our institution.\tWe retrospectively reviewed the records of 238 consecutive patients undergoing resection of intradural tumor at a single institution. The incidence of subsequent progressive kyphosis or scoliosis, perioperative morbidity, and neurological outcome were compared between the LP and LM cohorts.\tOne hundred eighty patients underwent LM and 58 underwent LP. Patients were 46 +/- 19 years old with median modified McCormick score of 2. Tumors were intramedullary in 102 (43%) and extramedullary in 102 (43%). All baseline clinical, radiographic, and operative variables were similar between the LP and LM cohorts. LP was associated with a decreased mean length of hospitalization (5 vs 7 days; P = .002) and trend of decreased incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak (3% vs 9%; P = .14). Following LP vs LM, 5 (9%) vs 21 (12%) patients developed progressive deformity (P = .728) a mean of 14 months after surgery. The incidence of progressive deformity was also similar between LP vs LM in pediatric patients < 18 years of age (43% vs 36%), with preoperative scoliosis or loss of cervical/lumbar lordosis (28% vs 22%), or with intramedullary tumors (11% vs 11%).\tLP for the resection of intradural spinal tumors was not associated with a decreased incidence of short-term progressive spinal deformity or improved neurological function. However, LP may be associated with a reduction in incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak. Longer-term follow-up is warranted to definitively assess the long-term effect of LP and the risk of deformity over time.","_input_hash":-1285141946,"_task_hash":-1090175553,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":398,"end":406,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"surgery","start":413,"end":420,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":676,"end":684,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":928,"end":936,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Patients","start":971,"end":979,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"score","start":1036,"end":1041,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"patients","start":1435,"end":1443,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"surgery","start":1513,"end":1520,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":1608,"end":1616,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 49, 34, 34, 34, 60, 34, 49, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708088617,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06","_session_id":"2024-02-16_11-48-06"}

There are the destructive and irreversible effects of the antibodies to antigens that are complexed with voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC complex antibodies), especially antibodies to leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) on the one hand. On the other hand, antibodies may have reversible functional effects, such as antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, which cause an internalization of these receptors but do not lead to cell destruction: LGI1 antibodies also seem to have functional, in this case epileptogenic effects.

(2) Low and moderate doses of alcohol have been reported to increase overall affective expression, happiness, euphoria, conviviality and pleasant and carefree feelings. Tension, depression and self-consciousness have been reported to decrease with equal doses. (3) Low alcohol doses have been found to improve certain types of cognitive performance.

Treatment in supine position including field verification as a prerequisite for anesthesia without intubation.^\nFor craniospinal axis irradiation in young children sometimes anesthesia is required. In order to minimize risks from the anesthesist's point of view supine position would be preferable to standard prone position. In case of irradiation in supine position verification of the 3-field junction in the cervical region causes problems, because there is no direct visual control. For such situations the clinical application of a new technique is presented.\tFor treatment planning a modern 3D planning system was necessary. Patient's positioning was done by using a vacuum-form body immobilizer and an integrated head mask. Radiation fields were placed only by table movements being calculated by the planning system in relation to a reference point at the patient's surface. In addition to common verification films specially prepared small films were used for the 3-field junction in the cervical region. These films were placed close to the patient for the whole time of each radiation session being exposed by every radiation field.\tTwo children (age 3 and 5 years, respectively) were irradiated as described. Twenty-eight of those specially prepared films were exposed. Two films (7%) had to be excluded because of inadequate exposure. An overlap of radiation fields was seen on 1 of the 26 remaining films (4%), whereas an unacceptable gap was not found. Acute skin reactions were comparable to those observed in patients being irradiated in standard prone position.\tThe presented technique for craniospinal axis irradiation in supine position including field verification was not only precise and reproducable, but also comfortable and safe for the patient.

The main outcome was the total score on BADS (Behavioural Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome) and the secondary outcomes were: cognition (executive functions; selective attention; visuospatial memory and attention; verbal memory; working memory) and clinical measures (symptoms; insight; neurocognitive complaints; self-esteem). All outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), week 12 (posttherapy, T2), and follow-up (week 36, i.e., 6months posttherapy, T3).\tNo difference was shown for the main outcome. A significant improvement was found for BADS' profile score for RECOS at T2 and T3, and for CRT at T3. Change in BADS in the RECOS and CRT arms were not significantly different between T1 and T2 (+0.86, p=0.108), or between T1 and T3 (+0.36, p=0.540). Significant improvements were found in several secondary outcomes including cognition (executive functions, selective attention, verbal memory, and visuospatial abilities) and clinician measures (symptoms and awareness to be hampered by cognitive deficits in everyday) in both treatment arms following treatment. Self-esteem improved only in RECOS arm at T3, and working memory improved only in CRT arm at T2 and T3, but there were no differences in changes between arms.\tRECOS (specific remediation) and CRT (general remediation) globally showed similar efficacy in the present trial.","_input_hash":-557406775,"_task_hash":-1411690809,"spans":[{"text":"randomized","start":124,"end":134,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"study","start":148,"end":153,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapy","start":197,"end":204,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"therapy","start":274,"end":281,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"randomized","start":324,"end":334,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"score","start":672,"end":677,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"score","start":1199,"end":1204,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"trial","start":1976,"end":1981,"pattern":-622671649}],"meta":{"pattern":"18, 2, 46, 46, 18, 60, 60, 73"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708094870,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

All patients received a 1.5 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Sensitivity, specificity and the corrected predictive values of DST nonsuppression (50 or more ng/ml at 0800 hr, 1600 hr, or 2300 hr), adjusted to a 50% prevalence of endogenous and nonendogenous depression, varied considerably depending on the diagnostic definition used. The highest predictive value (89.9%) was found with the Taylor-Abrams criteria (sensitivity = 43.9%, specificity = 95.0%), and the lowest predictive value (53.3%) with DSM-III (sensitivity = 37.7%, specificity = 68.1%). Eliminating the patients with dexamethasone levels of less than 2000 pg/ml improved the diagnostic specificity of the DST for most of the eight definitions of endogenous depression. This further indicates that plasma dexamethasone levels should be analyzed in studies designed to explore the diagnostic utility of the DST. A significant, chance-corrected association between DST nonsuppression and the diagnosis of endogenous depression was found with clinical diagnosis (according to the International Classification of Diseases), and for four out of eight operational diagnoses (Newcastle Scale I, Newcastle Scale II, Taylor-Abrams Criteria, and Vienna Research Criteria). For the other diagnoses (Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, Michigan Discriminant Index, and Hamilton Endogenomorphy Index), no significant association was found.

The Life Outcomes of Personality Replication (LOOPR) Project was therefore conducted to estimate the replicability of the personality-outcome literature. Specifically, I conducted preregistered, high-powered (median N = 1,504) replications of 78 previously published trait-outcome associations. Overall, 87% of the replication attempts were statistically significant in the expected direction. The replication effects were typically 77% as strong as the corresponding original effects, which represents a significant decline in effect size. The replicability of individual effects was predicted by the effect size and design of the original study, as well as the sample size and statistical power of the replication. These results indicate that the personality-outcome literature provides a reasonably accurate map of trait-outcome associations but also that it stands to benefit from efforts to improve replicability.","_input_hash":803475782,"_task_hash":-1683487068,"spans":[{"text":"literature","start":483,"end":493,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"study","start":982,"end":987,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"literature","start":1110,"end":1120,"pattern":-478699552}],"meta":{"pattern":"5, 2, 5"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708094953,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

We review basic concepts which we believe will prove helpful in interpreting results rapidly emerging from graph theory research in TLE. In addition, we summarize the current state of graph theory findings in TLE as they pertain its pathophysiology. Several common findings have emerged from the many modalities which have been used to study TLE using graph theory, including structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, surface EEG, intracranial EEG, magnetoencephalography, functional MRI, cell cultures, simulated models, and mouse models, involving increased regularity of the interictal network configuration, altered local segregation and global integration of the TLE network, and network reorganization of temporal lobe and limbic structures. As different modalities provide different views of the same phenomenon, future studies integrating data from multiple modalities are needed to clarify findings and contribute to the formation of a coherent theory on the pathophysiology of TLE.","_input_hash":1318910949,"_task_hash":322715559,"spans":[{"text":"review","start":590,"end":596,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"summarize","start":740,"end":749,"pattern":1982627683},{"text":"study","start":923,"end":928,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"mouse","start":1113,"end":1118,"pattern":-1086236359}],"meta":{"pattern":"4, 8, 2, 81"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708094964,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

During 14 days chronic oral treatment of mice with 10 mg/kg, no development of tolerance was observed. The protective indices (TD50/MES ED50) in rats and mice following oral administration are favorable when compared to phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. No motor impairment, evaluated with the rotarod test and by observation in the open field test, was observable following oral administration of doses up to 500 mg/kg. There was no influence on spontaneous motility and learning performance in rats and no interaction with ethanol in mice after administration of doses which are above anticonvulsant effective doses indicating the absence of central side effects.

{"pmid":"28707407","text":"Psychology and psychotherapy^\nSymptom fluctuations, self-esteem, and cohesion during group cognitive behaviour therapy for early psychosis.^\nGroup cohesion has been linked to positive changes in self-esteem and in symptoms during group psychotherapy in people with psychosis. These changes may be linked to changes in symptoms as fluctuations in self-esteem have been linked to symptom fluctuations.\tWe aimed to determine the relationship between these three factors - group cohesion, self-esteem, and symptoms - during group cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (GCBTp). We hypothesized that group cohesion would precede changes in symptoms and self-esteem and that improvements in self-esteem would precede improvements in symptoms.\tThis is an uncontrolled longitudinal study recruiting from a convenience sample within two early psychosis clinics.\tSixty-six individuals from first episode of psychosis treatment programmes participated in this study and received 24 sessions of a validated GCBTp protocol. Participants answered a brief questionnaire at the end of each session, measuring their group cohesion, self-esteem, and perception of their symptoms as worse, same, or better than usual.\tOrthogonal polynomial contrasts for time effects were estimated with a mixed model for repeated measures with a random cluster effect and revealed a quartic trend regarding changes in symptoms over the 24 sessions. Self-esteem, symptoms, and group cohesion were strongly linked during a given session. Also, self-esteem changes predicted changes in symptoms up to two sessions later, and symptoms changes predicted self-esteem changes at the next session. Group cohesion preceded improvements in both self-esteem and symptoms; self-esteem also predicted improvements in group cohesion.\tThese results suggest that self-esteem and symptoms influence each other during therapy, with improvements in one leading to improvements in the other. Group cohesion also appears to be an essential prerequisite to positive changes in self-esteem and symptoms during GCBTp.\tThis study emphasizes the interrelation between self-esteem improvements and symptom improvements, with improvements in one leading to improvements in the other, during group CBT for psychosis. Group cohesion, in this study, is a predictor of self-esteem and symptom improvements, suggesting that a special attention should be given to developing a strong alliance and group cohesion early on during CBT for psychosis.","_input_hash":-333335585,"_task_hash":1097255652,"spans":[{"text":"therapy","start":111,"end":118,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"therapy","start":546,"end":553,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"longitudinal","start":764,"end":776,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"study","start":777,"end":782,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":952,"end":957,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"questionnaire","start":1044,"end":1057,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"random","start":1314,"end":1320,"pattern":-1722231267},{"text":"therapy","start":1868,"end":1875,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"study","start":2067,"end":2072,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":2280,"end":2285,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"46, 46, 52, 2, 2, 57, 24, 46, 2, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708095080,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

Forty percent to 60% of patients with OCD fail to respond to available treatments. Neuroimaging studies have highlighted an association between the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms and an increased activity of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in patients with OCD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a powerful and easy-to-use tool to modulate brain activity. Cathodal tDCS (c-tDCS) is assumed to decrease cortical excitability in the targeted brain region. We hypothesized that c-tDCS applied over the left OFC alleviates symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. We report here the case of a patient who received 10 sessions (2 mA, 20 minutes) of c-tDCS. The tDCS sessions were delivered twice a day with a 2-hour interval, with the cathode (35 cm[2]) placed over the left OFC and the anode (100 cm[2]) placed over the contralateral occipital region. No adverse event was reported. One month after the completion of the tDCS sessions, we observed a 26% reduction in severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores. These findings are consistent with a previous study reporting a similar reduction in obsessive and compulsive symptoms after a low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was given to the left OFC.

{"pmid":"28627925","text":"Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology^\nWill delay discounting predict intention to quit smoking?^\nIntention to quit cigarette smoking is significantly associated with making quitting attempts and actual quitting. Delay discounting is significantly associated with smoking initiation and success in quitting. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the relationship between delay discounting and intention to quit smoking. In 2 separate observational, cross-sectional studies, the current investigation examines the relationship between delay discounting and intention to quit smoking within groups of smokers. Experiment 1 used data collected online and an adjusting-delay discounting task; Experiment 2 used data collected in the laboratory and an adjusting-amount discounting task. A total of 242 participants and 142 participants completed the online and on laboratory experiments, respectively. In both studies, participants with higher intention to quit smoking had significantly lower rates of discounting. These associations between intention to quit smoking and rates of delay discounting further support recent characterizations of delay discounting as a candidate behavioral marker of addiction. Understanding cognitive factors affecting treatment initiation such as intention to change, and the effects of delay discounting on these factors, in addition to the mechanisms by which they influence treatment outcomes might be essential to developing, disseminating, and implementing treatment interventions.

Promoter methylation status of the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is the most important clinical biomarker in glioblastoma, predicting for therapeutic response. However, it does not always correlate with response. This may be due to intratumoral heterogeneity, with a single biopsy unlikely to represent the entire lesion. Aberrations in other DNA repair mechanisms may also contribute. This study investigated intratumoral heterogeneity in multiple glioblastoma tumors with a particular focus on the DNA repair pathways. Transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity was identified in 40% of cases with variability in MGMT methylation status found in 14% of cases. As well as identifying intratumoral heterogeneity at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, targeted next generation sequencing identified between 1 and 37 unique sequence variants per specimen. In-silico tools were then able to identify deleterious variants in both the base excision repair and the mismatch repair pathways that may contribute to therapeutic response. As these pathways have roles in temozolomide response, these findings may confound patient management and highlight the importance of assessing multiple tumor biopsies.","_input_hash":-957033769,"_task_hash":1464492893,"spans":[{"text":"therapeutic","start":459,"end":470,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"study","start":712,"end":717,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1335,"end":1346,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"47, 2, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708095357,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

It is characterized by diffuse infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells with no mass formation and little or no contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interestingly, some lymphoma cells form characteristic spindle shapes; these cells are found in some variants of malignant lymphoma, such as primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma, but they have not been reported in PCNSL or LC. Here, we provide an autopsy case report of LC in a 69-year-old immunocompetent man who developed rapidly progressive cognitive decline and died on day 68 after the episode despite treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone administration. MRI revealed high signal intensities on T2-weighted images of the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord without gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted images. On autopsy, diffuse infiltrative atypical cells were seen; these cells were positive for CD20 and CD79a and negative for GFAP, CD3, and CD5 on immunohistochemistry, resulting in a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, specifically LC. We found characteristic spindle-shaped cells, especially in the cerebral cortex. This is the first report showing that lymphoma cells in PCNSL can take on a spindle-shaped form. It is difficult to recognize these spindle-shaped cells as lymphoma cells on hematoxylin and eosin staining and diagnose them correctly with small biopsy specimens without immunohistochemistry. This case suggests that we should add atypical, spindle-shaped cells to the differential diagnosis of PCNSL.","_input_hash":-265391708,"_task_hash":1986740208,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":110,"end":115,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"case","start":153,"end":157,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"cells","start":329,"end":334,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":462,"end":467,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":510,"end":515,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"case","start":694,"end":698,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"report","start":699,"end":705,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"cells","start":1131,"end":1136,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1154,"end":1159,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1269,"end":1278,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"cells","start":1369,"end":1374,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"report","start":1429,"end":1435,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"cells","start":1458,"end":1463,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1558,"end":1563,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1576,"end":1581,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"case","start":1707,"end":1711,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"cells","start":1765,"end":1770,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1791,"end":1800,"pattern":-1255217628}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 35, 70, 70, 70, 35, 36, 70, 70, 56, 70, 36, 70, 70, 70, 35, 70, 56"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-case-report"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708095484,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

Pooled rates of successful fusion, revision surgery, and complications or adverse events, and their 95% confidence intervals, were also calculated. Two subgroup analyses were performed: one for studies in which only myelopathy or radiculopathy (or both) were stated as surgical indications and the other for studies in which only myelopathy or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (or both) were stated as surgical indications. This study was funded by Providence Medical Technology, Inc. ($32,000).\tThirty-three articles were included in the systematic review, and 31 articles were included in the meta-analysis. For all surgical indications and for the 2 subgroup analyses, every cumulative change in patient-reported outcome improved. Many of the reported changes in patient-reported outcome also exceeded the minimal clinically important differences.

The authors undertook a study of cerebral hemodynamic changes while the plateau waves were observed in five brain-tumor patients. Although the number of cases studied was small, a remarkable decrease in cerebrovascular resistance was seen in all patients during the plateau waves. It is suggested that the plateau waves are caused by a marked cerebral vasodilatation. The present results support the thesis that cerebral blood volume is increased during the plateau waves. The plateau waves are closely related to the intrinsic vasomotor control of cerebral circulation, and can occur as long as cerebral vasodilating ability is maintained, irrespective of the existence of cerebral autoregulation.","_input_hash":-618737537,"_task_hash":-1276439137,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":153,"end":161,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":323,"end":328,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":419,"end":427,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":545,"end":553,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708095553,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

Previous research has shown that therapist addressing defenses (TADs) can produce a positive effect on alliance. The potential value of TADs during the process of alliance rupture and resolution has not yet been documented. We selected patients (n = 17) undertaking a short-term dynamic psychotherapy in which the therapeutic alliance, measured with the Helping Alliance Questionnaire and monitored after each session, showed a pattern of rupture and resolution. Two control sessions (5 and 15) were also selected. Presence of TADs was examined in each therapist interpretation. Compared with control sessions, rupture sessions were characterized by fewer TADs and especially fewer TADs addressing specifically intermediate-essentially neurotic-defenses. Resolution sessions were characterized by more TADs addressing specifically intermediate defenses. This confirms the link between therapist technique and alliance process in psychodynamic psychotherapy.","_input_hash":2093497099,"_task_hash":-1159326228,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":495,"end":503,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapeutic","start":573,"end":584,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"Questionnaire","start":630,"end":643,"pattern":-759522552}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 47, 57"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708095661,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

The degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases is thought to be one of the most important steps in the process of tumor invasion. However, the activity of most matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can be modulated by simultaneously secreted inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs). We have previously shown that an imbalance between the levels of MMPs and TIMPs may be essential in the determination of the invasiveness of certain human malignant astrocytoma cell lines. To determine if the up-regulation of TIMP genes and gene products could modulate the invasiveness of human malignant astrocytoma cells, in the present study we have transfected a highly invasive astrocytoma cell line, SF-188, with an expression vector carrying a full-length TIMP-1 cDNA. The parental SF-188 astrocytoma cell line overexpresses the 72-kDa and 92-kDa type IV collagenases with little expression of TIMPs-1 and -2. Following transfection with TIMP-1, SF-188 astrocytoma clones expressed the 0.9 kb TIMP-1 message by northern analysis, and produced a 21 kDa metalloproteinase inhibitor by reverse zymography. The stable TIMP-1 SF-188 transformants demonstrated morphological changes and diminished growth rates in soft agar when compared to controls. The invasion of successfully TIMP-1 transfected astrocytoma cells across matrigel-coated filters was significantly decreased over controls. These results suggest that upregulation of TIMP-1 expression in SF-188 astrocytoma cells has decreased their in vitro invasive potential.","_input_hash":862650843,"_task_hash":1218434480,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":82,"end":87,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":763,"end":768,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"genes","start":845,"end":850,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"human","start":904,"end":909,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":932,"end":937,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":954,"end":959,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cells","start":1627,"end":1632,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1790,"end":1795,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 0, 78, 0, 70, 2, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708095698,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

Yet there is an under-representation of the older population in the BP literature. We present extensive interview data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, dealing with a population-based sample of Danish twins aged 70-102, and describing the 1-month prevalence of BP and the development of BP over time. The associations between BP and education, self-rated health, other health problems, lifestyle factors, and physical and mental function were also investigated. Data were analysed in a cross-sectional analysis for all answers given at entry into the study and in a longitudinal analysis for participants in all four surveys. Associated factors were analysed for the cross-sectional sample using univariate and multivariate analysis accounting for the non-independence of twins in complete pairs. The overall 1-month prevalence of BP was 25% and differed significantly between men and women. The variations in prevalence between the age groups and over time were negligible. The majority of participants in all four surveys had either not experienced BP during the previous month or had done so on one occasion only. Education was not associated with BP. Self-rated health was associated with BP in a significant 'dose-response' like pattern. BP was associated with bone and joint disorders, migraine headaches, lung disease, cardiovascular disorders and gastric ulcer, but not neurologic or endocrinologic diseases. BP sufferers had significantly lower scores on physical but not on mental functioning. We conclude that BP is a common symptom in old age; however, the prevalence does not change with increasing age. BP may be part of a more general syndrome of poor health among the old.","_input_hash":1749860678,"_task_hash":-869087476,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":247,"end":252,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"literature","start":467,"end":477,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"interview","start":500,"end":509,"pattern":1942352714},{"text":"Longitudinal","start":524,"end":536,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"Study","start":537,"end":542,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"prevalence","start":661,"end":671,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"study","start":965,"end":970,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"longitudinal","start":980,"end":992,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"prevalence","start":1231,"end":1241,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"prevalence","start":1324,"end":1334,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"prevalence","start":1983,"end":1993,"pattern":1787723395}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 5, 58, 52, 2, 53, 2, 52, 53, 53, 53"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708095948,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

We hypothesized that depressive symptoms are also linked to low levels of secondary control (i.e., influencing the psychological impact of objective conditions by adjusting oneself to fit them). To test the hypothesis, we developed the Secondary Control Scale for Children (SCSC), examined its psychometrics, and used it to assess the secondary control-depression symptomatology association. In a large adolescent sample, the SCSC showed factorial integrity, internal consistency, test-retest stability, convergent and discriminant validity, and accounted for more than 40% of the variance in depression symptoms.

Psychopharmacotherapy has a crucial role in the treatment of this complex disorder and targets the respective core symptoms. It comprises basically atypical antipsychotics, antidepressant agents and moodstabilizers, often requiring a combination of these substances in case of complex, multidimensional symptoms. Regarding the predominantly young and female patients the teratogenic risk demands critical consideration. This study focuses on the use of moodstabilizers in the treatment of BPD and gives an overview of the currently available studies on this substance class, in particular on lithium, carbamazepine, divalproex sodium, topiramate and lamotrigine. Results show significant effects on core features of BPD, but nevertheless, there are considerable limits in comparability and validity among the studies because of heterogeneities in the patient groups, study design, additive medication and outcome measures. Disregarding the off-label use in this indication the data reflect however an established clinical practice of use for these substances and underline the pivotal impact of moodstabilizers in the treatment of core symptoms of BPD.","_input_hash":-1223773464,"_task_hash":-811573369,"spans":[{"text":"case","start":609,"end":613,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"patients","start":698,"end":706,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":765,"end":770,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1207,"end":1212,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"35, 34, 2, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708096097,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

Pediatrics^\nMalignant glioma with angiocentric features.^\nAngiocentric glioma is a recently recognized benign brain tumor with unknown histogenesis. Most of these tumors are mitotically low in activity in accord with their benign clinical course. However, increased mitotic activity has been noted in several cases, one of which had an ultimately fatal outcome. Here, the authors present a tumor showing angiocentric glioma and glioblastoma-like features, with recurrence of the lower-grade component after radiotherapy. A 15-year-old boy presented with a 3-month history of progressive left-sided weakness and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large heterogeneous mass in the right frontal lobe, with mild post-Gd enhancement. A gross-total resection was obtained. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue revealed a tumor with 2 distinct appearances: 1) a mildly to moderately cellular infiltrating tumor with angiocentric glioma characteristics, and 2) a markedly cellular glioblastoma-like tissue with necrosis and microvascular proliferation. The patient received a course of postoperative radiotherapy to 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions administered over the course of 6.5 weeks, but his tumor recurred 4 months after resection. A second resection was then performed. The recurrent tumor exhibited radiation-induced changes and persistent characteristics of angiocentric glioma, but it had fewer malignant features; the mitotic activity was lower, and there was no necrosis or microvascular proliferation. The findings in this case, along with those in several previously reported cases, suggest that angiocentric gliomas may have a malignant variant or malignant transformation. Angiocentric gliomas with malignant features tend to recur, for which surgical intervention followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be offered as a therapeutic option.","_input_hash":-488920821,"_task_hash":-217257361,"spans":[{"text":"radiotherapy","start":532,"end":544,"pattern":1529178352},{"text":"history","start":589,"end":596,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"radiotherapy","start":1144,"end":1156,"pattern":1529178352},{"text":"case","start":1574,"end":1578,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"intervention","start":1806,"end":1818,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"radiotherapy","start":1831,"end":1843,"pattern":1529178352},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1884,"end":1895,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"51, 64, 51, 35, 48, 51, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-case-report"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708096105,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

This systematic review and meta-analysis of three scientific databases examined the prevalence of the use of intoxicating substances, those tending to excite or stupefy the user on a psychoactive level, before or during sex, among young adults (18-29 years old). A total of 55 unique empirical studies met the inclusion criteria (48,145 individuals; 39% males), were assessed for risk of bias using the tools of Hoy et al. (2012), and were analyzed via a generalized linear mixed-effects model. The results produced a global mean prevalence of this sexual risk behavior of 36.98% (95% CI: 28.28%, 46.63%). Nonetheless, significant differences were identified between different intoxicating substances, with the use of alcohol (35.10%; 95% CI: 27.68%, 43.31%), marijuana (27.80%; 95% CI: 18.24%, 39.92%), and ecstasy (20.90%; 95% CI: 14.34%, 29.45%) significantly more prevalent than that of cocaine (4.32%; 95% CI: 3.64%, 5.11%), heroin (.67%; 95% CI: .09%, 4.65%), methamphetamine (7.10%; 95% CI: 4.57%, 10.88%), and GHB (6.55%; 95% CI: 4.21%, 10.05%).

However, postischemic angiogenesis is short-lived and may be completely terminated within a few weeks after ischemic insult. The molecular mechanism underlying the dissolution of postischemic angiogenic processes is poorly understood. Although the expression of angiogenic genes has been studied in ischemic stroke models, the activation of angiostatic genes after cerebral ischemia has not been investigated. Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and TSP-2 are naturally occurring angiostatic factors, which inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. The aim of the present study was to explore the expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2 in relation to the evolution of angiogenic process in a focal ischemia model in rats.\tRats underwent cortical ischemia in the middle cerebral artery territory for 60 minutes and reperfusion for up to 2 weeks. Northern and Western blot analysis were used to study the temporal profile of TSP-1 and TSP-2 expression at the mRNA and protein level, respectively. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies were used to examine the spatial expression patterns. Double immunostaining was applied to define the cellular origins of TSP-1 and TSP-2.\tA biphasic expression of TSP-1 was noted after ischemia, peaking at 1 and 72 hours. Endothelial cells in the leptomeninges were the only source of the first TSP-1 peak, whereas endothelial, glial, neuronal, and macrophage cells contributed to the second peak of TSP-1 expression. TSP-2 expression occurred much later and in a monophasic manner, peaking 2 weeks after ischemia. TSP-2 immunoreactivity was observed in endothelial, neuronal, and macrophage, but not glial, cells. TSP-1 was expressed before the peak of angiogenesis, whereas robust TSP-2 expression occurred at the peak of angiogenesis and continued into the period when angiogenesis had completely resolved.\tRobust expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2, 2 major angiostatic factors, was noted in the ischemic brain with different temporal expression profiles from different cellular origins. The expression of these angiostatic factors, especially TSP-2, likely contributes to the spontaneous resolution of postischemic angiogenesis. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance of angiogenic and angiostatic factors in the ischemic brain.","_input_hash":2008141548,"_task_hash":-1467678330,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":237,"end":245,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"genes","start":520,"end":525,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"genes","start":600,"end":605,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"study","start":794,"end":799,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1106,"end":1111,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cells","start":1497,"end":1502,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1623,"end":1628,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1871,"end":1876,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 78, 78, 2, 2, 70, 70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708096168,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

{"pmid":"18346734","text":"Experimental neurology^\nAAV2-mediated gene transfer of GDNF to the striatum of MPTP monkeys enhances the survival and outgrowth of co-implanted fetal dopamine neurons.^\nNeural transplantation offers the potential of treating Parkinson's disease by grafting fetal dopamine neurons to depleted regions of the brain. However, clinical studies of neural grafting in Parkinson's disease have produced only modest improvements. One of the main reasons for this is the low survival rate of transplanted neurons. The inadequate supply of critical neurotrophic factors in the adult brain is likely to be a major cause of early cell death and restricted outgrowth of fetal grafts placed into the mature striatum. Glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor that is crucial to the survival, outgrowth and maintenance of dopamine neurons, and so is a candidate for protecting grafted fetal dopamine neurons in the adult brain. We found that implantation of adeno-associated virus type 2 encoding GDNF (AAV2-GDNF) in the normal monkey caudate nucleus induced overexpression of GDNF that persisted for at least 6 months after injection. In a 6-month within-animal controlled study, AAV2-GDNF enhanced the survival of fetal dopamine neurons by 4-fold, and increased the outgrowth of grafted fetal dopamine neurons by almost 3-fold in the caudate nucleus of MPTP-treated monkeys, compared with control grafts in the other caudate nucleus. Thus, the addition of GDNF gene therapy to neural transplantation may be a useful strategy to improve treatment for Parkinson's disease.","_input_hash":-1610067289,"_task_hash":723911417,"spans":[{"text":"monkeys","start":84,"end":91,"pattern":1842966640},{"text":"monkey","start":1044,"end":1050,"pattern":1909560603},{"text":"animal","start":1172,"end":1178,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"controlled","start":1179,"end":1189,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"study","start":1190,"end":1195,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"monkeys","start":1384,"end":1391,"pattern":1842966640},{"text":"therapy","start":1484,"end":1491,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"84, 83, 67, 27, 2, 84, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708096237,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

A 53-year-old female had developed slowly progressive dementia and atactic gait since the age of 45. No myoclonic jerks and periodic synchronous discharges were observed throughout the illness. The neuropathological study revealed that many amyloid plaques and widespread Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) appeared in the cerebral cortex. Characteristically, the plaques reacted with anti-prion protein and none of them reacted with anti-beta protein, and they were made of many components, including amyloid cores, macrophages laden with lipid granules and/or degenerated neurites. Neuropil threads were seen mainly in amyloid plaques. Moreover, plaques appeared which were confluent and laminar in arrangement in the fifth and sixth cortical layers and had a close relationship to the neuronal loss. There was no spongiform change in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. The cerebellum was almost intact except for a few amyloid plaques. Ultrastructurally, some of the plaques simulated kuru plaques and others had many degenerated neurites possessing paired helical filaments and other accumulated organelles. GSS has been proposed to include cases with progressive ataxia, dementia and massive multifocal plaques in the brain with or without cerebral spongiform changes. The case presented here is a very peculiar case of GSS. Recently, similar cases have been reported in some large families, diagnosed as familial Alzheimer's disease.

The focus now is on the quality of remission, that is, ensuring a minimum of such residual symptoms, because the consequences of low-quality remission also include impairment in psychosocial functioning. The most common residual symptoms are sleep disturbances, fatigue, and disinterest. Sleep-associated residual symptoms are particularly common, and are a major concern because most current treatments fail to adequately address sleep disturbances and may even aggravate them. Other side effects of current treatments, such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction, may also reduce the quality of remission.

We identified trials by searching the included trials lists of systematic reviews, found through searches in 6 databases (e.g.,\u00a0MEDLINE, EMBASE). Trials that had not yet been reviewed were found by searching the same databases. Primary outcome was the mean difference in effectiveness between transported and homegrown interventions to reduce disruptive child behavior. We also compared this\u00a0differential effectiveness for various intervention\u00a0'brands' (e.g., Incredible Years and Triple P Positive Parenting Program) and geographical regions (e.g.,\u00a0North America and Europe).\tTransported and homegrown interventions did not differ in their effectiveness to reduce disruptive child behavior (d\u00a0= 0.10, not significant). Results were robust across intervention brands and geographical regions. Six trials on transported interventions in Hong Kong, Iran, and Panama suggest promising results for transporting interventions to 'nonwestern' countries, whereas one trial in Indonesia does not.\tParenting interventions based on the same principles led to similar outcomes, whether transported or homegrown. This finding supports the selection of interventions based on their evidence base rather than on cultural specificity.","_input_hash":2089616898,"_task_hash":417436199,"spans":[{"text":"intervention","start":507,"end":519,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"intervention","start":596,"end":608,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"randomized","start":718,"end":728,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"trials","start":729,"end":735,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"trials","start":823,"end":829,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"trials","start":856,"end":862,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"systematic","start":872,"end":882,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"Trials","start":955,"end":961,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"intervention","start":1240,"end":1252,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"intervention","start":1556,"end":1568,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"trials","start":1606,"end":1612,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"trial","start":1769,"end":1774,"pattern":-622671649}],"meta":{"pattern":"48, 48, 18, 75, 75, 75, 6, 75, 48, 48, 75, 73"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708096551,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

The study proceeded in the form of a statistical analysis of assessments made on 46 patients according to RLS85 and GCS (i.e., when comparison was with GCS) and on 28 patients according to RLS85 and E2CS(M). In all 74 cases two physicians participating as 'observers' carried out the assessments. They were both contacting the patient--not together but--successively within a time interval of less than 20'. Hence the data appeared as 'pairwise' observations for any of the three scales above. The results of the analysis, arising from a rather strict statistical reasoning, can be summarized as follows: (1) The rank correlation coefficient r(s) between: (i) RLS85 and GCS sum score, (ii) RLS85 and E2CS(M), was found to be at a satisfactory level meaning that all three scales indicate almost the same 'ranking order of severity'. (2) Reliability was compared by taking into account as to what extent the two observers agreed on RLS85 and--simultaneously--disagreed on the other scale. The 'sign' test was applied and as a result RLS85 proved to be more reliable than; (i) GCS (EMY profile), (ii) GCS sum score, and (iii) E2CS(M), in all the above mentioned at a high level of significance. (3) Apart from the test above, some values of the index kappa (kappa) of interobserver agreement were calculated. Those corresponding to RLS85 are considerably higher. In particular the overall value based on 74 pairwise assessments amounted to kappa = 0.733 associated with a standard error sigma(kappa) = 0.061. This was a satisfactory result regarding the features of RLS85. (4) As far as coverage is concerned, again--by the 'sign' test--the predominance of RLS85 versus GCS (EMY profile) was accepted.","_input_hash":-159872828,"_task_hash":-346924793,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":36,"end":41,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":497,"end":502,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":577,"end":585,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":660,"end":668,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"score","start":1171,"end":1176,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"score","start":1600,"end":1605,"pattern":1310160002}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 2, 34, 34, 60, 60"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708096662,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

Themes surrounding current substance use screening practices, barriers to screening, and recommendations for implementation were identified and organized by the Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework.\tIdentifying the problem: Stakeholders unanimously agreed that screening is important, and that universal screening is preferred to targeted approaches. Adapting to the local context: PCPs and MAs agreed that screening should be done annually. Views were mixed regarding the delivery of screening; patients preferred self-administered, tablet-based screening, while MAs and PCPs were divided between self-administered and face-to-face approaches. Assessing barriers: For patients, barriers to screening centered around a perceived lack of rapport with providers, which contributed to concerns about trust, judgment, and privacy. For PCPs and MAs, barriers included lack of comfort, training, and preparedness to address screening results and offer treatment.\tThough stakeholders agree on the importance of implementing universal screening, concerns about the patient-provider relationship, the consequences of disclosure, and privacy appear heightened by the rural context. Findings highlight that strong relationships with providers are critical for patients, while in-clinic resources and training are needed to increase provider comfort and preparedness to address substance use.","_input_hash":1695487266,"_task_hash":-1948628828,"spans":[{"text":"Study","start":103,"end":108,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"systematic","start":227,"end":237,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"study","start":577,"end":582,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":832,"end":840,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1446,"end":1454,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1619,"end":1627,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2199,"end":2207,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 6, 2, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708096698,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

Cerebral small artery disease has been considered as one of the main causes of LA. However, since the term 'venous collagenosis' (VC) was proposed in an atrophy research in 1995, there have been pathological and neuroimaging studies proving the association between the venous system and LA in aging, Alz-heimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease.\tAutopsy studies confirmed that thickening of the lumen wall in venules, which results from the deposition of collagen I and III, leading to vessel stenosis or occlusion, is closely associated with LA. Susceptibility-weighted imaging research revealed a controversial association of deep medullary veins and LA in vivo, regarding which there are no standard criteria currently. Nevertheless, retinal venous changes had been reported to increase the risk of LA development, providing a novel way for in vivo evaluation. As for the internal jugular vein, jugular venous reflux could double the LA score in aging and modulate circulation of cerebral spinal fluids.

The venous pathological changes may induce cerebral hypoperfusion, drainage system disruption, and vasogenic oedema in the veins around the periventricular white matter.

Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinoma (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one). Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS.

However, specific understanding of the roles played, especially the mechanistic and functional roles, by long ncRNAs in AD is still elusive. Using mouse tissue qPCR assays we observe changes in the expression levels of 41 lncRNAs in AD mice of which only 7 genes happen to have both human orthologs and AD associations. Post validation of these 7 human lncRNA genes, MEG3 and MALAT1 shows consistent and significant decrease in AD cell, animal models and human AD brain tissues, but MALAT1 showed a more pronounced decrease. Using bioinformatics, qRT-PCR, RNA FISH and RIP techniques, we could establish MALAT1 as an interactor and regulator of miRs-200a, -26a and -26b, all of which are naturally elevated in AD. We could further show that these miRNAs target the RTK EPHA2 and several of its downstream effectors. Expectedly EPHA2 over expression protects against A\u03b21-42 induced cytotoxicity. Transiently knocking down MALAT1 validates these unique regulatory facets of AD at the miRNA and protein levels. Although the idea of sponging of miRNAs by lncRNAs in other pathologies is gradually gaining credibility, this novel MALAT1- miR-200a/26a/26b - EPHA2 regulation mechanism in the context of AD pathophysiology promises to become a significant strategy in controlling the disease.","_input_hash":1964402294,"_task_hash":1801330857,"spans":[{"text":"mouse","start":500,"end":505,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mice","start":589,"end":593,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"genes","start":610,"end":615,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"human","start":636,"end":641,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":700,"end":705,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"genes","start":713,"end":718,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"animal","start":790,"end":796,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"human","start":808,"end":813,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"FISH","start":913,"end":917,"pattern":-741546164}],"meta":{"pattern":"81, 82, 78, 0, 0, 78, 67, 0, 100"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708097096,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

The strips were then superfused with oxygenated and warmed Krebs solution and precontracted with noradrenaline (3 microM). Glyceryl trinitrate, acetylcholine and histamine were injected as a single bolus in the absence or in the presence of mepyramine and cimetidine. For the in vivo studies, histamine (30-60 micrograms) was injected intracavernously as a single bolus into the right corpus cavernosum 1 cm from the balamo-preputial sulcus. Similar protocols were carried out for papaverine (50 mg). The erectile response was divided into four grades: no response, tumescence, partial and full erection.\tIn vitro studies demonstrated that histamine (3-100 micrograms) caused dose-dependent relaxation of the HCC strips which was significantly inhibited by cimetidine (5-10 microM). The histamine H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine (1 microM) potentiated histamine-induced relaxation. The co-infusion of both mepyramine and cimetidine did not abolish histamine-induced relaxation. When injected intracavernously in humans, histamine (30 micrograms) caused full erection in 13% of the patients, whereas 87% had partial erection or tumescence. A higher dose of histamine (60 micrograms) caused full erection in 26% of the patients and 74% had partial erection or tumescence. Papaverine induced full erection in the majority of patients (66%). In contrast to papaverine, the duration of erection induced by histamine was markedly shorter (mean 200 and 6.5 min, respectively). The penile erections induced by papaverine were associated with complications such as pain, haematoma and priapism. Histamine did not induce any complications. Treatment of eight male patients with psychogenic impotence with the histamine H1 receptor antagonist astemizol (10 mg orally once daily for 1 week) did not affect histamine-induced erectile responses.\tThese results indicate that histamine may play a role in human penile erection. The erection-promoting action of histamine is probably due to H2 receptor activation, although another histamine receptor, possibly H3, also seems to be involved. This study suggests that histamine could be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.","_input_hash":-468143097,"_task_hash":2060919485,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":53,"end":58,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":128,"end":133,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"patients","start":242,"end":250,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Human","start":279,"end":284,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"patients","start":1478,"end":1486,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1614,"end":1622,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1719,"end":1727,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2051,"end":2059,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"human","start":2286,"end":2291,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":2477,"end":2482,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"diagnosis","start":2539,"end":2548,"pattern":-1255217628}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 0, 34, 0, 34, 34, 34, 34, 0, 2, 56"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708097159,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

Signs and symptoms associated with hypopituitarism often mimic the sequellae of TBI, although the severity of symptoms is not necessarily related to the severity of the injury. Patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may benefit both physically and psychologically from appropriate hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Participants at this unique consensus meeting attempted to define and spearhead an approach to increase awareness of the risks of TBI-induced endocrinopathies, in particular growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and to outline necessary and practical objectives for managing this condition.\tSystematic screening of pituitary function is recommended for all patients with moderate-to-severe TBI at risk of developing pituitary deficits. Patients with hypopituitarism benefit from appropriate hormonal replacement and prospects for rehabilitation of patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may be enhanced by appropriate HRT. Further exploration of this possibility requires: (1) active collaboration between divisions of endocrinology and rehabilitation at the local level to perform a screening of pituitary function in patients after TBI, (2) creation of a consultancy service by endocrine societies for use by rehabilitation centres, (3) development of continuing medical education (CME) programmes that can be offered as crossover training to the physicians who manage the care of patients with TBIs, (4) targeting of patient organizations with educational information for dissemination to patients and their families, (5) continued efforts to more clearly define the population at greatest risk of TBI-induced hypopituitarism and (6) monitor results of efficacy studies as they become available to evaluate whether and how much replacement therapy can improve the symptoms of individuals with TBI-induced hypopituitarism.","_input_hash":1663768970,"_task_hash":-1411590477,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":212,"end":220,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":307,"end":315,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Patients","start":637,"end":645,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":764,"end":771,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"Systematic","start":1065,"end":1075,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"patients","start":1131,"end":1139,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Patients","start":1210,"end":1218,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1322,"end":1330,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1596,"end":1604,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1860,"end":1868,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1969,"end":1977,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":2220,"end":2227,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 34, 46, 6, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708097166,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20","_session_id":"2024-02-16_15-39-20"}

Forty-eight publications were identified, of which eight articles and two reports were newly identified and not included in the previous review. These involved checking the health of people with intellectual disabilities from a range of countries including a full range of people with intellectual disabilities. Health checks consistently led to detection of unmet health needs and targeted actions to address health needs. Health checks also had the potential to increase knowledge of the health needs of people with intellectual disabilities amongst health professionals and support staff, and to identify gaps in health services. Health checks are effective in identifying previously unrecognised health needs, including life threatening conditions.

Possible role for ACE in SCZ was also suggested by ACE activity interaction with dopaminergic mechanisms to modulate abnormalities of sensorimotor gating. In addition, we have demonstrated higher ACE activity in blood of SCZ subjects, its implication in cognitive performance in SCZ and its power as a predictor for SCZ diagnosis.Methods: ACE activity was determined in the serum and in selected brain regions of an animal model presenting SCZ-like behaviour, before and after the treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotics, and also in the serum of animals receiving the psychostimulants amphetamine/lisdexamphetamine.Results: Dopaminergic manipulations with antipsychotics and psychostimulants influenced the ACE activity, but with no correlation with the animal blood pressure.Conclusions: The validity of measuring ACE activity in animal blood to predict activity in the CNS, as well as the lack of correlation between the activity and blood pressure, before and after the treatment with antipsychotics, were confirmed here.

Morris water-maze test was utilized to assess the learning ability and memory of the animals. The whole brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, TBARS, GSH levels and MPO activity were evaluated as the biochemical parameters. For histopathological evaluation of the cerebral infarct size, TTC staining was employed.\tAdministration of L-carnosine (500 \u2009 mg/kg, i.p.) successfully attenuated the manifestations of cerebral ischemia. Higher levels of AChE, TBARS, and MPO were observed in BCCAO treated animals, which were successfully attenuated by treatment with L-carnosine and ischemic postconditioning. Whereas administration of L-carnosine and ischemic postconditioning significantly increased the level of GSH in BCCAO treated animals. Moreover, treatment with ranitidine, an H2 blocker (30\u2009NMol, i.c.v) antagonized the neuroprotective actions of L-carnosine evidenced by decrease in MWM performance, increase in the level of AChE and oxidative stress, while decrease in GSH level in brain. The cerebral infarct size was found to be more in BCCAO inflicted animals, which was improved by the administration of L-carnosine, while the cerebral infarct size worsened by treatment with ranitidine (3 \u2009 nmol, i.c.v.).\tIt is concluded that L-carnosine exerts neuroprotective effect via involvement of histidine-histamine pathway since the beneficial effects of L-carnosine were abolished by the H2-blocker.","_input_hash":1735848846,"_task_hash":928476997,"spans":[{"text":"mice","start":152,"end":156,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":217,"end":222,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"animal","start":408,"end":414,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"mice","start":489,"end":493,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"surgery","start":514,"end":521,"pattern":1899085217}],"meta":{"pattern":"82, 2, 67, 82, 49"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708110636,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

The therapeutic effects of an anti-Fgl2 antibody and the role of immune suppression regulation by Fgl2 were determined in immune-competent, NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG), and Fc\u0263RIIB-/- mice (n = 3-18 per group). Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance, log-rank survival analysis, and Pearson correlation. All statistical tests were two-sided.\tIn low-grade gliomas, 72.5% of patients maintained two copies of the FGL2 gene, whereas 83.8% of GBM patients had gene amplification or copy gain. Patients with high levels of FGL2 mRNA in glioma tissues had a lower overall survival (P = .009). Protein levels of FGL2 in GBM lysates were higher relative to low-grade glioma lysates (11.48\u00b15.75ng/mg vs 3.96\u00b11.01ng/mg, P = .003). In GL261 mice treated with an anti-FGL2 antibody, median survival was 27 days compared with only 17 days for mice treated with an isotype control antibody (P = .01). The anti-FGL2 antibody treatment reduced CD39(+) Tregs, M2 macrophages, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). FGL2-induced increases in M2, CD39, and PD-1 were ablated in Fc\u0263RIIB-/- mice.\tFGL2 augments glioma immunosuppression by increasing the expression levels of PD-1 and CD39, expanding the frequency of tumor-supportive M2 macrophages via the Fc\u03b3RIIB pathway, and enhancing the number of MDSCs and CD39(+) regulatory T cells. Collectively, these results show that FGL2 functions as a key immune-suppressive modulator and has potential as an immunotherapeutic target for treating GBM.","_input_hash":1735012772,"_task_hash":264507549,"spans":[{"text":"Therapeutic","start":117,"end":128,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"therapeutic","start":445,"end":456,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"mice","start":626,"end":630,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"patients","start":829,"end":837,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":899,"end":907,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Patients","start":945,"end":953,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"mice","start":1186,"end":1190,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1286,"end":1290,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":1486,"end":1491,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"mice","start":1573,"end":1577,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":1815,"end":1820,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"47, 47, 82, 34, 34, 34, 82, 82, 70, 82, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708110767,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

Moderation analyses revealed that Bad Incident students who received the BMI reported more HED at 9-month follow-up than those who received AO.\tCurrent alcohol use as well as personal reaction to the referral event may have clinical utility in identifying which mandated students benefit from treatments of varying content and intensity.","_input_hash":-963649550,"_task_hash":1147517311,"spans":[{"text":"randomized","start":139,"end":149,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"trial","start":159,"end":164,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"study","start":317,"end":322,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"intervention","start":565,"end":577,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"report","start":1445,"end":1451,"pattern":1226364217}],"meta":{"pattern":"18, 73, 2, 48, 36"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708110971,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

Treatment with stents may be an effective method to treat VADA involving the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and dissection of the dominant vertebral artery (VA). In this article, our personal experience of the treatment of VADAs by using stents and coils is reported.\tSince 1998, 26 cases of VADA have been treated by endovascular surgery by the first author. Of these cases, 6 cases were treated using stents, 3 of which were treated using stent and coils, 2 patients were treated using double overlapping stents, and the remaining one patient was treated using a single stent.\tIn all patients, dissection aneurysms were successfully covered by stents. There was one complication: an intraprocedural rupture during additional coil insertion without neurological deterioration. Follow-up angiography was performed in all 5 surviving patients except for one patient who died due to the severity of his original subarachnoid hemorrhage (mean duration of follow-up angiography 22.8 months, range 15-57 months). Total or subtotal disappearance of the VADA was achieved in all 5 cases. At one year after the treatment, all 5 surviving patients remained clinically stable without any neurological deficit.\tTreatment using stents is an effective alternative for the treatment of VA dissecting aneurysms, especially for lesions of the dominant VA or involving the PICA. However, additional coil insertion should be performed very carefully and may be avoided if stagnation of contrast material is achieved after overlapping stenting.","_input_hash":-433114831,"_task_hash":1571914048,"spans":[{"text":"surgery","start":597,"end":604,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":726,"end":734,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":852,"end":860,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1099,"end":1107,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1396,"end":1404,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"49, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708111054,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

A data-base of parent report of sleep problems of children with autism (N=55), ranging from 5 to 12 years of age (M=8.2 years) was evaluated. Results suggested that fewer hours of sleep per night predicted overall autism scores and social skills deficits. Similarly, stereotypic behavior was predicted by fewer hours of sleep per night and screaming during the night. Increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli in the bedroom and screaming at night predicted communication problems. Finally, sensitivity to environmental stimuli in the bedroom also predicted fewer developmental sequence disturbances. The results indicate that sleep problems and the diagnostic characteristics of autism may be related. However, future research must be completed to determine the specific relationship.","_input_hash":-1200828235,"_task_hash":1734884494,"spans":[{"text":"report","start":469,"end":475,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1102,"end":1112,"pattern":-808942259}],"meta":{"pattern":"36, 55"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708111061,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

{"pmid":"17244569","text":"The International journal of psycho-analysis^\nThinking with, and about, patients too scared to think: can non-interpretive maneuvers stimulate reflective thought?^\nPatients incapable of higher-order (symbolic) thinking can often not tolerate evidence of the analyst's separate existence, particularly when that 'otherness' becomes evident in the process of the analyst's reflecting upon and interpreting how the patient experiences or represents the analyst. The patient's intolerance of the analyst's efforts to think (reflect upon and interpret) renders the usual psychoanalytic maneuvers employed to stimulate reflective thought ineffective with such patients. Such patients have to learn to tolerate multiple perspectives before they can allow the analyst, or themselves, to think in the other's presence. The author presents two clinical vignettes that illustrate how the analyst's efforts to think about the patient were experienced by the patient as both intolerably distancing and as rejecting of an aspect of the patient's subjective reality. Working psychoanalytically with such patients requires the analyst to forego the use of narrow interpretations that elucidate unconscious meanings and motives in favor of alternate technical maneuvers capable of facilitating the development of symbolic thinking and reflective thought (insightfulness). These maneuvers include a demonstration of the analyst's willingness and ability to withstand (rather than 'interpret away') how he is being psychically represented by the patient, without becoming destroyed by, or lost within, the patient's characterization of him. Beside modeling a tolerance of alternate perspectives of one's self, other non-interpretive maneuvers that help facilitate the development of self-reflective thought include: stimulating the patient's curiosity about the workings of his own mind by identifying incompletely understood behaviors or reactions worthy of greater psychological understanding, and insinuating doubt about the adequacy of the patient's explanations of such phenomena.","_input_hash":1683556808,"_task_hash":1843765017,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":72,"end":80,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Patients","start":164,"end":172,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":654,"end":662,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":669,"end":677,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1089,"end":1097,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708111206,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

ADS-5102 is an extended release amantadine capsule formulation, designed for once-daily dosing at bedtime (qhs) to provide high concentrations upon waking and throughout the day, with lower concentrations in the evening. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADS-5102 were assessed in two phase I studies in healthy subjects, and a blinded, randomized phase II/III dose-finding study in PD patients.\tThe first phase I study assessed single ADS-5102 doses (68.5, 137, and 274\u00a0mg) in a crossover design, whereas the second phase I study evaluated ADS-5102 137\u00a0mg for 7\u00a0days followed by amantadine IR 81\u00a0mg twice daily (or reverse order). In the phase II/III double-blind study, PD patients with dyskinesia were randomized to ADS-5102 (210, 274, or 338\u00a0mg) or placebo for 8\u00a0weeks.\tSingle ADS-5102 doses resulted in a slow initial rise in amantadine plasma concentration, with delayed time to maximum concentration (12-16\u00a0h). Amantadine plasma concentrations were higher in PD patients versus healthy volunteers. The steady-state profile of once-daily ADS-5102 was significantly different from that of twice-daily amantadine IR, such that the two formulations are not bioequivalent. PK modeling suggested the recommended daily ADS-5102 dosage (274\u00a0mg qhs) resulted in 1.4- to 2.0-fold higher amantadine plasma concentrations during the day versus amantadine IR.\tADS-5102 can be administered once-daily qhs to achieve high amantadine plasma concentrations in the morning and throughout the day, when symptoms of dyskinesia occur.","_input_hash":233707229,"_task_hash":127972995,"spans":[{"text":"randomized","start":700,"end":710,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"study","start":737,"end":742,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":749,"end":757,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":777,"end":782,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":888,"end":893,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":1028,"end":1033,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1038,"end":1046,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"randomized","start":1068,"end":1078,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"placebo","start":1116,"end":1123,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"patients","start":1332,"end":1340,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"18, 2, 34, 2, 2, 2, 34, 18, 14, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708111238,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

{"pmid":"24837743","text":"Behavioural brain research^\nNeophobia, NQO1 and SIRT1 as premorbid and prodromal indicators of AD in 3xTg-AD mice.^\nIncreased oxidative stress seems to be a key factor underlying natural processes of aging, but also to occur prior to neuropathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. The present work studied the temporal variation of three key antioxidant enzymes in cortex and hippocampus during the development of behavioral and cognitive symptoms in 3xTg-AD mice, and as compared to age-matched controls. At 2 months of age, when no intraneuronal A\u03b2 immunoreactivity has been reported, increased neophobia shown as a delayed and reduced rearing, evidenced the onset of BPSD-like symptoms at premorbid stages of disease. In these animals, NQO1 was found increased in both the hippocampus (800%) and cortex (400%) and progressively diminished at older ages. SOD1 was increased in the hippocampus at 4 months of age, when neuronal A\u03b2 accumulation has been established. These hippocampal increases of antioxidants before the prodromal emergence of cognitive symptoms support their role as defense mechanisms. SIRT1 levels showed opposite age-dependent changes in cortex (increase) and hippocampus (decrease) relative to controls. Prodromal cognitive deficits emerged at 6 months of age, concomitantly to cortical overexpression of SIRT1 but down-regulation of NQO1 and SIRT1 in the hippocampus, suggesting inadequate antioxidative protection to prevent or delay the subjacent neuronal damage. The present data further support the link between oxidative status and the anxious profile. Their crosstalk may underline AD-pathological mechanisms that may lead to deranged physiology and selective neuronal degeneration. It also points out increased neophobia and high expression of NQO1 among the first indicators of disease in the 3xTg-AD mice.","_input_hash":1498021712,"_task_hash":1358962901,"spans":[{"text":"mice","start":471,"end":475,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1845,"end":1849,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"82, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708111395,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

Furthermore, studies suggest that some metals (lead, manganese, cadmium excess, and zinc deficiency) are associated with schizophrenia or psychosis-related phenotype. However, previous studies had multiple methodological limitations. Importantly, metal exposure was often measured after disease development and seldom determined during critical developmental periods. Most studies fell short of depicting the exact timing of exposure and the change in exposure over time. Here, we propose several methods to overcome these methodological limitations.\tThere is a plausible role of early life exposure to metals in the cause of psychosis. Owing to methodological limitations in exposure measurement, this has not been well characterized.

{"pmid":"28928448","text":"Scientific reports^\nIntact animacy perception during chase detection in ASD.^\nWe explored the strength of implicit social inferences in adolescents with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a chasing paradigm in which participants judged the absence/presence of a chase within a display of four seemingly randomly moving dots. While two of these dots always moved randomly, the two others could fulfill the role of being either the chasing (wolf) or chased (sheep) dot. In the chase-present (but not the chase-absent) trials the wolf displayed chasing behavior defined by the degree to which the dot reliably moved towards the sheep (chasing subtlety). Previous research indicated that chasing subtlety strongly influenced chase detection in typically developing (TD) adults. We intended to replicate and extend this finding to adolescents with and without ASD, while also adding either a social or a non-social cue to the displays. Our results confirmed the importance of chasing subtlety and indicated that adding social, but not non-social, information further improved chase detection performance. Interestingly, the performance of adolescents with ASD was less dependent on chasing subtlety than that of their TD counterparts. Nonetheless, adolescents with and without ASD did not differ in their use of the added social (or non-social) cue.","_input_hash":-288720967,"_task_hash":930309337,"spans":[{"text":"randomly","start":317,"end":325,"pattern":985041104},{"text":"randomly","start":376,"end":384,"pattern":985041104},{"text":"trials","start":530,"end":536,"pattern":1849967594}],"meta":{"pattern":"25, 25, 75"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708111488,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

A standardized and anonymous questionnaire which explored behaviors in the previous 6 months was used. Saliva samples were collected to determine human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence. Logistic regression models were used to identify determinants of accepting and passing on used syringes.\tOf the 300 participants, 17.7% and 13.3% accepted and passed on used syringes, respectively. 74.8% practiced front-backloading (to prepare the drug solution in a syringe and then divide it up into other syringes) and 77.9% shared other equipment. The prevalence of HIV was 57.7%. The predictors of accepting used syringes were using more than 4 drugs (odds ratio [OR] = 5.6), having a positive hepatitis C virus status (OR = 7.3), practising front/backloading (OR = 12.6) and having an IDU steady partner (OR = 2.9); and with passing on used syringes were practicing front/backloading (OR = 4.9), having an IDU steady partner (OR = 5.8), and having sexual risk behaviors with casual partners (OR = 4.0). Starting to inject drugs older than 15 years of age was a protective factor (OR = 0.2).\tThe prevalence of risk behaviors related to drug use remains high, especially indirect sharing, just as the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C virus.

The widespread access to TAT makes it a potentially cost-effective and inventive option available for delivery in multiple settings. This study assessed acceptability of the web-based Therapeutic Education System (TES) in hospitalized dual diagnosis patients with SUDs and other psychiatric disorders. Methods: Eligible participants were nonpsychotic, voluntary patients with self-reported drug or alcohol use in the 30 days prior to admission. They were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU, n = 47) or TAU + TES (n = 48). Acceptability of this Internet-based intervention was assessed by observed utilization and self-report.

This study was conducted to assess the perceptions of a group of medical students from Pakistan, a predominantly Muslim country, regarding four drugs namely heroin, charas, benzodiazepines and alcohol.\tIn total, 174 self-reported questionnaires were received (87% response rate). The most commonly cited reasons for why some students take these drugs were peer pressure (96%), academic stress (90%) and curiosity (88%). The most commonly cited justifiable reason was to go to sleep (34%). According to 77%, living in the college male hostel predisposed one to using these drugs. Sixty percent of students said that the drugs did not improve exam performance, while 54% said they alleviated stress. Seventy-eight percent said they did not intend to ever take drugs in the future. Females and day-scholars were more willing to discourage a friend who took drugs. Morality (78%), religion (76%) and harmful effects of drugs (57%) were the most common deterrents against drug intake. Five suggestions to decrease drug abuse included better counseling facilities (78%) and more recreational facilities (60%).\tEfforts need to be made to increase student awareness regarding effects and side effects of drugs.

Repeated OMT misuse was reported by 20% (i.e., 71% of misusers) of patients and was associated with positive OMT misuse experience and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. Admission to the ER because of misuse complications was reported by 34% of patients, this outcome being associated with gender, employment, type of previous opioid abuse and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. OMT dosage was lower than the recommended maintenance dosage.\tWe offered new information on factors associated with intravenous OMT misuse, repeated misuse and ER admission in Italian patients under OMT. Our data indicate that BUP-NLX misuse is not different from that of BUP or MET. Choosing the more expensive BUP-NLX over MET will likely not lead to the expected reduction of the risk of injection misuse of the OMT. Instead of prescribing new and expensive OMT formulations, addiction unit physicians and medical personnel should better focus on patient's features that are associated with a higher likelihood of misuse.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether chronic unpredicted stress (CUS) mediated neurological alterations are associated with impaired hippocampal insulin signaling or not, and studied the effect of quercetin in this scenario. Male Swiss albino mice were subjected to 21day CUS, during which 30mg/kg quercetin treatment was given orally. After 21days, behavioral functions were evaluated in terms of locomotor activity (Actophotometer), muscle coordination (Rota-rod), depression (Tail Suspension Test (TST), Forced Swim Test (FST)) and memory performance (Passive-avoidance step-down task (PASD)). Further, hippocampal insulin signaling was evaluated in terms of protein expression of insulin, insulin receptor (IR) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) and neurogenesis was evaluated in terms of doublecortin (DCX) expression. 21day CUS significantly impaired locomotion and had no effect on muscle coordination. Stressed animals were depressed and showed markedly impaired memory functions. Quercetin treatment significantly improvement stress-mediated behavior dysfunction as indicated by improved locomotion, lesser immobility time and greater frequency of upward turning in TST and FST and increased transfer latency on the day 2 (short-term memory) and day 5 (long-term memory) in PASD test. We observed significantly higher IR expression and significantly lower GLUT-4 expression in the hippocampus of stressed animals, despite of nonsignificant difference in insulin levels. Further, chronic stress impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, as indicated by the significantly reduced levels of hippocampal DCX expression. Quercetin treatment significantly lowered insulin and IR expression and significantly enhanced GLUT-4 and DCX expression in the hippocampus, when compared to CUS. In conclusion, quercetin treatment efficiently alleviated stress mediated behavioral dysfunction by modulating hippocampal insulin signaling and neurogenesis.","_input_hash":-1139513604,"_task_hash":-999540962,"spans":[{"text":"mice","start":124,"end":128,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":397,"end":402,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"mice","start":642,"end":646,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"82, 2, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708111745,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

While the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) expresses AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8, the lack of SLC6A8 in astrocytes around the blood-brain barrier limits the brain capacity to import creatine from the periphery, and suggests that the CNS has to rely mainly on endogenous creatine synthesis through AGAT and GAMT expression. This seems contradictory with SLC6A8 deficiency, which, despite AGAT and GAMT expression, also leads to creatine deficiency in the CNS. We present novel data showing that in cortical grey matter, AGAT and GAMT are expressed in a dissociated way: e.g. only a few cells co-express both genes. This suggests that to allow synthesis of creatine within the CNS, at least for a significant part of it, guanidinoacetate must be transported from AGAT- to GAMT-expressing cells, possibly through SLC6A8. This would explain the creatine deficiency observed in SLC6A8-deficient patients. By bringing together creatine deficiency syndromes, AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8 distribution in CNS, as well as a synthetic view on creatine and guanidinoacetate levels in the brain, this review presents a comprehensive framework, including new hypotheses, on brain creatine metabolism and transport, both in normal conditions and in case of creatine deficiency.","_input_hash":329664389,"_task_hash":-1397195482,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":961,"end":966,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"genes","start":983,"end":988,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"cells","start":1162,"end":1167,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"patients","start":1266,"end":1274,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"review","start":1458,"end":1464,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"case","start":1604,"end":1608,"pattern":1741807605}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 78, 70, 34, 4, 35"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708111753,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

Using a standard recognition memory task, we conducted a pilot study to examine how 24 hours of tobacco abstinence in moderate to heavy smokers would affect memory in males and females. Twenty-five moderate to heavy smokers were tested following a period of smoking normally and following 24 hours of tobacco abstinence. At each session, participants completed a recognition memory task in which items were studied under full- and divided-attention conditions (a standard manipulation of memory encoding) as well as tests of passive short-term and working memory (forward and backward digit span). Tobacco abstinence significantly reduced memory performance under full attention conditions for males but not for females. A significant main effect of smoking status in which abstinence significantly reduced performance, as well as a main effect of encoding condition (divided attention < full attention), were found. Our results demonstrate that there may be substantial sex differences in the cognitive effects of tobacco abstinence. While preliminary, the data suggest the need for further, more extensive study of how males and females differ during tobacco abstinence.

The dental practitioner must recognize patients with needle phobia before the administration of local anesthetics to identify patients who are potentially reactive and to prevent untoward sequelae. Needle phobia is highly associated with avoidance behavior, and the dentist must exhibit compassion and respect. To avoid bradycardia, hypotension, unconsciousness, convulsions, and possibly asystole, oral premedication with benzodiazepines or other antianxiety agents must be considered for patients who are needle phobic. Management of needle phobiaeinduced syncope includes perioperative monitoring, oxygen administration, positioning, atropine, and vasopressors.","_input_hash":1534406251,"_task_hash":-125496596,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":487,"end":495,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":574,"end":582,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":938,"end":946,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112231,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma protein mainly secreted by the liver within a trimolecular TTR-RBP-retinol complex revealing from birth to old age strikingly similar evolutionary patterns with LBM in health and disease. TTR is also synthesized by the choroid plexus along distinct regulatory pathways. Chronic dietary methionine (Met) deprivation or cytokine-induced inflammatory disorders generates LBM downsizing following differentiated physiopathological processes. Met-restricted regimens downregulate the transsulfuration cascade causing upstream elevation of homocysteine (Hcy) safeguarding Met homeostasis and downstream drop of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) impairing anti-oxidative capacities. Elderly persons constitute a vulnerable population group exposed to increasing Hcy burden and declining H2S protection, notably in plant-eating communities or in the course of inflammatory illnesses. Appropriate correction of defective protein status and eradication of inflammatory processes may restore an appropriate LBM size allowing the hepatic production of the retinol circulating complex to resume, in contrast with the refractory choroidal TTR secretory process. As a result of improved health status, augmented concentrations of plasma-derived TTR and retinol may reach the cerebrospinal fluid and dismantle senile amyloid plaques, contributing to the prevention or the delay of the onset of neurodegenerative events in elderly subjects at risk of Alzheimer's disease.","_input_hash":-175047950,"_task_hash":-1985320376,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":288,"end":293,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112278,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

Since CARP is induced by pressure overload to the heart, it is proposed to be a genetic marker for cardiac hypertrophy. We recently identified a novel protein, ankyrin repeat protein with PEST and proline-rich region (ARPP), which is homologous to CARP and is preferentially expressed in type 1 skeletal muscle fibers (cf. slow fibers). We also found that both ARPP and CARP expression is induced in experimentally denervated skeletal muscles in mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that their expression may be induced in skeletal muscles in neurodegenerating disease. This work aimed to determine the expression pattern of ARPP and CARP in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\tIn this study, we immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of ARPP and CARP in skeletal muscles of 9 ALS cases.\tWe found that CARP was aberrantly expressed in atrophic skeletal muscle fibers in ALS. Although ARPP-positive fibers were randomly scattered in a checkerboard-like pattern in normal skeletal muscle, this pattern was absent in ALS muscles. Furthermore, we also found that ARPP was expressed in fast myosin heavy chain-positive fibers (cf. type 2 fiber).\tThese findings suggest that type-specific expression patterns of ARPP and CARP are altered in skeletal muscles of ALS.","_input_hash":854206474,"_task_hash":1735094864,"spans":[{"text":"mice","start":843,"end":847,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":1094,"end":1099,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"randomly","start":1325,"end":1333,"pattern":985041104}],"meta":{"pattern":"82, 2, 25"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112319,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

At present, this population demonstrates decreased participation in physical activities and sport compared to peers due to barriers ranging from body function to accessibility challenges. Sport provides culturally relevant opportunities for social integration, community participation and physical activity and has been shown to improve the fitness, self-esteem, confidence and quality of life of children with disabilities. The Sports Stars physiotherapy group has been designed to support the development of a range of fundamental movement and sports skills through activity skill practice and participation in modified popular Australian sports.\tThis randomised, waitlist controlled, assessor blinded, superiority trial with two parallel groups will aim to compare the effectiveness of Sports Stars to standard care across all ICF domains. Children in the Sports Stars group are expected to demonstrate greater improvement in their individually-selected, sports related goals measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. This study will aim to assess sixty ambulant children aged six to 12 years with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Children will be excluded if they have had recent Botox or neurological/orthopaedic surgery. The Sports Stars intervention includes eight, one-hour, weekly physiotherapy group sessions with four to six participants and one lead physiotherapist. Outcome measures will be collected pre, post and 12\u00a0weeks post the immediate Sports Stars group to assess change immediately after, and at follow up time points.\tThis will be the first study of its kind to investigate a culturally relevant sports-focussed fundamental movement skills physiotherapy group for ambulant children with cerebral palsy. The findings will add to a growing pool of evidence supporting group physiotherapy for children with cerebral palsy and the Sports Stars group will provide an avenue for children to transition from individual physiotherapy to mainstream and modified recreational and competitive sports.\tAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12617000313336 Registered 28, February 2017.

VFC starts in the precapillaries/capillaries in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) and expands to the granule cell and polymorphic cell layer of the DG, and to the stratum lacunosum/molecular in the CA1 sector. Vasculopathy spreads from the tail to the body and, in a few cases, to the head of the hippocampal formation. Light and electron microscopy reveal thickening of the vascular wall with fibrosis, calcification, and enforcement of the astrocyte interface with vessels with anchorage densities associated with hemidesmosome-like structures. In moderately and severely affected cases, fragmentation and removal of calcified and occluded vessels result in local reduction of vascular network. In two AD subjects, severe vascular calcification extending from the tail to the head of the hippocampal formation was associated with loss of almost all neurons in the CA1 sector and in the subiculum proper, corresponding to hippocampal sclerosis. The topography of affected vessels and the patterns of neuronal loss reflect the middle hippocampal artery distribution with its precapillary/capillary network. The similar prevalence of vasculopathy in the AD group and in the age-matched control group, and the presence of hippocampal VFC in only one subject in the DS cohort, 96% of which is affected by Alzheimer-type pathology, oppose the link between AD and this form of vasculopathy. However, severe VFC affects the pattern of AD pathology locally by deletion of neurofibrillary degeneration and beta-amyloidosis in the CA1 sector, subiculum proper, and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal VFC appears to be a form of vascular pathology with a unique predilection for the middle hippocampal artery and corresponding capillary network, which results in patchy neuronal loss in moderately affected subjects and in almost total neuronal loss in the area of impaired blood supply in severely affected subjects. These observations suggest an etiologic link between hippocampal VFC and hippocampal sclerosis.","_input_hash":2042896667,"_task_hash":1483047518,"spans":[{"text":"Vascular","start":23,"end":31,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"Study","start":127,"end":132,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"vascular","start":884,"end":892,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"vascular","start":1188,"end":1196,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"vascular","start":1233,"end":1241,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"prevalence","start":1628,"end":1638,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"cohort","start":1775,"end":1781,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"vascular","start":2147,"end":2155,"pattern":-60508792}],"meta":{"pattern":"66, 2, 66, 66, 66, 53, 1, 66"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112406,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

Although both hallucinating and nonhallucinating patients demonstrated auditory attention impairments when compared to normal subjects, the two patient groups did not differ with respect to these variables.\tResults support the hypothesis that hallucinated voices in schizophrenia arise from disrupted speech perception and verbal working memory systems rather than from nonlanguage cognitive or attentional deficits.","_input_hash":1347451744,"_task_hash":1079172829,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":93,"end":101,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":279,"end":287,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":381,"end":389,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"report","start":440,"end":446,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"patients","start":868,"end":876,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":924,"end":932,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1003,"end":1011,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 34, 36, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112479,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

We aimed to characterize functional and structural alterations in cerebral microvasculature before and after experimental cerebral ischemia in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. We hypothesized that preexisting brain microvascular disease in patients with diabetes might partly explain increased stroke severity and impact on outcome. Diabetes was induced in 4-week-old C57Bl/6J mice by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). After 8 weeks of diabetes, the vasoreactivity of the neurovascular network to CO2 was abolished and was not reversed by nitric oxide (NO) donor administration; endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) mRNA, phospho-eNOS protein, nNOS, and phospho-nNOS protein were significantly decreased; angiogenic and vessel maturation factors (vascular endothelial growth factor a [VEGFa], angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), Ang2, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 [TGF-\u03b2], and platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 [PDGF-\u03b2]) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) occludin and zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) expression were significantly decreased; and microvessel density was increased without changes in ultrastructural imaging.

The aim of this study was to compare the socio-demographic profiles, the practices and drug consumption patterns of the two groups attending specialized centres.\tThe Oppidum Programme (observation of illegal drugs and misuse of psychotropic medications), a multi-centric survey, surveys drug-dependent subjects attending specialized care centres throughout France annually. Data were collected by questionnaire on socio-demographic variables and drug use during the preceding week.\tDuring October 1998, 46 centres took part in the survey. The methadone group (n = 424) was older, with a better economic situation; 16% used cocaine regularly. The HD buprenorphine group (n = 616) consumed more heroin (12% vs. 8%) and engaged in more misuse, such as intravenous use, illicit acquisitions or irregular consumption. These practices were more frequent for patients consuming the drug 'outwith protocol' or for patients obtaining the drug from a general practitioner.\tOur results suggest that patterns of consumption of methadone and buprenorphine are different in several respects: concomitant use of licit or illicit psychoactive substances, route of administration, and illegal acquisition.

Based on the literature and our earlier findings, we believe that the impairments of overall (not emotion specific) facial expression recognition is associated with a more general, non-specific psychiatric distress. Thus, first it was hypothesized that overall facial expression recognition would be correlated negatively with SCL-90 global severity index (GSI). Our second hypothesis was that the severity of the impairment in facial expression recognition would be correlated with symptom severity measured by the BECK Depression Inventory (BDI).\tOne hundred and six depressed subjects participated in the study. We used a 'Virtual Human' for presenting the 35 emotional and neutral facial expressions. Subjects filled in the BDI and SCL-90 questionnaires after the facial expression recognition task.\tSignificant negative association was found between the GSI of SCL-90 and the overall facial expression recognition. Furthermore, significant negative correlation was found between the recognition of happy facial expressions and the depression severity measured by the BDI questionnaire and the SCL-90 depression subscale.\tThe negative association found between overall facial expression recognition and the GSI score provide empirical support to our first hypothesis, which states that the impairment of not emotion specific, overall facial expression recognition may correlate with a general psychiatric distress. Our findings indicate that those depressed subjects who had higher scores on BDI could recognize happy facial expression at a significantly lower rate. Abnormalities in reward sensitivity may explain this association between happy face recognition difficulties and the severity of depressive symptoms among depressive patients. Consequently, we can conclude that the recognition of happy facial expressions can be a useful tool for monitoring the severity of depression.","_input_hash":-1171906498,"_task_hash":1267248631,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":175,"end":180,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"literature","start":319,"end":329,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"study","start":914,"end":919,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"Human","start":940,"end":945,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"questionnaire","start":1382,"end":1395,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"score","start":1521,"end":1526,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"patients","start":2043,"end":2051,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 5, 2, 0, 57, 60, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112610,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

Hereditary polyneuropathy of different types was diagnosed in 28 patients (62%); nine showed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and two showed vasculitic neuropathy. In two more cases polyneuropathy was attributed to toxic agents, while among the rest, one was diagnosed as metachromatic leucodystrophy (juvenile type), one as adrenoleucodystrophy, one as porphyric neuropathy and one as Fabry disease. The high incidence of hereditary neuropathies in teenagers differs from that in adults, but is similar to that encountered in children. In our study, CIDP appears to be a frequent cause of neuropathy in teenagers, while the other causes are broadly similar to those found in studies concerning children rather than adults.","_input_hash":647970600,"_task_hash":329329553,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":84,"end":89,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":127,"end":132,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":311,"end":319,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":444,"end":452,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":947,"end":952,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 2, 34, 34, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112635,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}
{"pmid":"24737903","text":"Postgraduate medical journal^\nRepublished: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides: is it time to split up the group?^\nAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of diseases corresponding to necrotising inflammation of small vessels with a wide range of clinical presentations. At least two of the diseases are believed to exhibit a common ground of pathophysiological mechanisms. These are granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). ANCA directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) are preferentially associated with GPA, and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA are associated mainly with MPA and eosinophilic GPA (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). Anti-MPO and anti-PR3 antibodies can activate neutrophils in vitro. In vivo data are available for humans and mice on the pathogenicity of anti-MPO but it is more controversial for PR3-ANCA. A recent genome-wide association study of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitides confirmed the genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of these conditions, with significant association of PR3-ANCA and human leukocyte antigen-DP and the genes encoding \u03b11-antitrypsin and PR3. MPO-ANCA were significantly associated with human leukocyte antigen-DQ. Thus, recent results from epidemiological studies, genome-wide association study and therapeutic trials have suggested that these entities are, in fact, distinct. We have summarised these results and discuss the idea that these two entities should be studied separately as the nature of the two auto-antigens suggests at a molecular level despite shared ANCA involvement.","_input_hash":-1390312195,"_task_hash":223401970,"spans":[{"text":"mice","start":903,"end":907,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":1017,"end":1022,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1026,"end":1034,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"human","start":1190,"end":1195,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"genes","start":1225,"end":1230,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"human","start":1308,"end":1313,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":1411,"end":1416,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1421,"end":1432,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"trials","start":1433,"end":1439,"pattern":1849967594}],"meta":{"pattern":"82, 2, 34, 0, 78, 0, 2, 47, 75"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112649,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

{"pmid":"16696567","text":"Chemical research in toxicology^\nEbselen induced C6 glioma cell death in oxygen and glucose deprivation.^\nStudies have shown that ebselen is an antiinflammatory and antioxidative agent. Its protective effect has been investigated in oxidative stress related diseases such as cerebral ischemia in recent years. However, experimental evidence also shows that ebselen causes cell death in several different cell types. Whether ebselen will have a beneficial or detrimental effect on cells under ischemic condition is not known. Herein, we studied the effect of ebselen on C6 glioma cells under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro ischemic model. We found that ebselen significantly enhanced cell death after 3 h of OGD as observed by lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cellular morphological changes. Further studies revealed that depletion of cellular glutathione level by the combined action of ebselen and OGD played a role in enhanced cell death as demonstrated by the following evidence: (1) cellular GSH was significantly depleted by the combined effort of ebselen and OGD, compared to that of ebselen or OGD insult alone; (2) exogenous addition of N-acetyl cysteine completely diminished the cell damage induced by ebselen and OGD; (3) supplement of glucose, which provides cellular reducing agents and thus maintains cellular GSH level, to the OGD medium diminished C6 cell damage induced by ebselen. We conclude that depleting cellular glutathione plays an important role in ebselen-induced cell death with OGD. Our results suggest that ebselen can have a beneficial or toxic effect, depending on the availability of GSH.","_input_hash":-1213412721,"_task_hash":-1215222503,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":480,"end":485,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":579,"end":584,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112718,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

Lesions were organized according to segments and correlated with the type and distribution of clinical symptoms or signs. The purpose of the study was to (1) determine the efficacy of clinical localization of cranial nerve V lesions, (2) compare CT and MR for cranial nerve V imaging, (3) develop an MR protocol for effective cranial nerve V imaging, and (4) construct a differential diagnosis by anatomic segment for lesions of cranial nerve V. Clinical localization was found to be extremely inaccurate. CT was not as sensitive as MR for lesions involving the basal cisterns and skull base and will not detect the most common brainstem lesions (small infarcts and multiple sclerosis plaques). The MR protocol developed does not rely heavily on clinical localization. On the basis of lesions found in this series, a differential diagnosis by segment was developed. Patients with cranial nerve V symptoms should undergo MR imaging according to the protocol provided in this article. CT is not as effective as MR in imaging some cranial nerve V segments.

In subjects with increased IMT, serum H. pylori-IgG was positively correlated with serum IL-18 (r = .402, p = .002), and the association was independent of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors (\u03b2 = 0.310, p < .001).\tIn health checkup examinees with increased IMT, serum IL-18 and H. pylori-IgG were independently correlated and were significantly higher than in subjects with normal IMT.","_input_hash":-984675692,"_task_hash":1931719833,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":93,"end":101,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":537,"end":542,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":660,"end":668,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"traditional","start":716,"end":727,"pattern":1983949530},{"text":"traditional","start":1140,"end":1151,"pattern":1983949530}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 34, 10, 10"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112801,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

These subjects carried out the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (which assesses visual rather than linguistic factors) under two conditions: with their chosen coloured overlay and with a control filter. Steps were taken to ensure that a strong placebo effect was associated with the control overlay and, when asked which they preferred, subjects were not significantly more likely to prefer their coloured overlay than the control filter (p=0.11). Nonetheless, the rate of reading was significantly faster with the coloured overlay than with the control (p=0.0019).

At both T0 and T1, each patient underwent: 1) traditional and specific activation techniques during prolonged video-EEG monitoring to detect possible inducing factors; 2) neuropsychological evaluations during video-EEG monitoring either with eyes closed or eyes open to detect any transient cognitive impairment (TCI); 3) detailed neuropsychological assessment without simultaneous EEG recording, to detect any stable cognitive impairment (SCI).\tEEG recordings showed transient, generalized paroxysms in one case and a continuous epileptic activity triggered by eye closure in the other two cases, at both T0 and T1. In all patients, no particular epileptiform discharge-induced factors were identified except for eye blinking (spontaneous, voluntary or induced by corneal reflex). The results of neuropsychological assessment while eyes were closed as compared to performances with eyes open, showed no significant differences at T0 or at T1 in two cases, thus possibly indicating the absence of TCI. Wechsler Intelligence Scales showed a decrease in performance at T1 in the two patients with eye closure-induced, continuous epileptiform activity. Detailed neuropsychological assessment without EEG recordings demonstrated an impairment of facial recognition ability in all three patients at T1.\tThe lack of any differences between the results of neuropsychological tests performed with eyes open and eyes closed in two patients might suggest that not all eye-closure-triggered paroxysms are associated with TCI. On the other hand, our data highlight that EC-triggered, EEG epileptic discharges can produce long-lasting neuropsychological and behavioural effects, and also indicate that EEG discharges recurring over time might exert a disruptive effect on cognitive functions. Our three patients showed extreme variability across the neuropsychological tasks except for a facial recognition deficit that was evident in all cases, thus suggesting a possible dysfunction of temporo-occipital brain structures and/or of the fusiform face area as recently demonstrated by combined fMRI/EEG studies in patients with fixation-off sensitivity.","_input_hash":-1667554584,"_task_hash":-1050266814,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":124,"end":132,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":185,"end":190,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":260,"end":268,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":376,"end":384,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"traditional","start":526,"end":537,"pattern":1983949530},{"text":"case","start":988,"end":992,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"patients","start":1104,"end":1112,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1561,"end":1569,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1762,"end":1770,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1902,"end":1910,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2270,"end":2278,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2580,"end":2588,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 34, 34, 10, 35, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708112836,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08","_session_id":"2024-02-16_16-56-08"}

The main purpose of this study is to determine whether the obesity paradox measured by body mass index (BMI) or by waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is real.\tWe evaluated the association of general obesity measured by BMI, and abdominal obesity measured by WHtR with 1-year all-cause mortality, recurrence of stroke and combined vascular events of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients in a cohort -- the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III). Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were performed to investigate the association between obesity and clinical outcomes.\tA total of 14,146 patients with ischemic stroke were included. When BMI was used as a measure of obesity, compared to the normal weight patients, mortality decreased in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.91], P\u2009=\u20090.0035) and obese patients (HR 0.54 [0.40-0.73], P\u2009<\u20090.0001); and increased in underweight patients (HR 2.55 [1.75-3.73], P\u2009<\u20090.0001). After adjustment for confounding factors, the protective effect of obesity and overweight disappeared. BMI had no association with recurrence of stroke or combined vascular events.

{"pmid":"23665943","text":"The Journal of toxicological sciences^\nBiochemical evaluation of the neurotoxicity of MPTP and MPP[+] in embryonic and newborn mice.^\nOne of the toxicities caused by 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is damage to dopaminergic neurons. When injected into C57BL/6J mice, MPTP penetrates into the brain and is converted to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP[+]) by monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B in astrocytes. MPP[+] has high affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) on dopaminergic neurons, and is taken up into the cell to cause cell death. There have been relatively few researches on the acute MPTP toxicity to embryonic or newborn mice. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the influence of MPTP and MPP[+] on embryonic and newborn mice by measuring sequential changes in major indexes of MPTP toxicity and MPTP metabolism; levels of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), DAT, MAO-A and MAO-B. In addition, we measured the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in the brain of newborn mice. A single injection of MPTP and MPP[+] reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, in the brain of newborn mice about 6-12 hr after the injection.

Concurrent two vessel monitoring using transcranial Doppler ultrasound.^\nTo overcome the technical limitations which have precluded noninvasive Doppler ultrasound in investigation of rapid cerebral haemodynamic responses in two cerebrovascular beds at the same time, we have modified a commercial 2 MHz pulsed Doppler instrument with online spectrum analysis. Two probes are activated intermittently, recording eight averaged Doppler-shifted spectra from each probe sequentially. Concurrent recordings of blood velocity in both middle cerebral arteries were performed during 25 selective iohexol carotid angiography runs in 13 patients with near normal cerebral vasculature. The technique permitted the differentiation between the specific responses confined to the recipient vascular bed, and the general responses occurring in remote brain areas as well. The specific response to iohexol was biphasic; a significant decrease in blood velocity occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, probably due to the high viscocity of iohexol. Between 4 and 12 s. blood velocity was significantly increased, reflecting the cerebrovascular response to hypertonic solutions. The blood velocity on the opposite side increased from less than 4 s through 45 s after iohexol. This concurs with studies using electromagnetic flowmetry, and suggests that these general responses are elicited by anxiety, discomfort and pain. Thus, no general responses were seen during angiography under general anaesthesia. Eight patients investigated during catheter flushing with normal saline showed a biphasic specific response reciprocal to that due to iohexol. A significant blood velocity peak occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, followed by a decrease between 4 and 60 s. The saline injections produced no pain and evoked no significant general response.","_input_hash":-658043034,"_task_hash":1660641219,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":704,"end":712,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"vascular","start":853,"end":861,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"patients","start":1577,"end":1585,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 66, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156029,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

{"pmid":"22363216","text":"PLoS genetics^\nGTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of Parkinson's disease-associated LRRK2 is regulated by ArfGAP1.^\nMutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common cause of autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and also contribute to idiopathic PD. LRRK2 encodes a large multi-domain protein with GTPase and kinase activity. Initial data indicates that an intact functional GTPase domain is critically required for LRRK2 kinase activity. PD-associated mutations in LRRK2, including the most common G2019S variant, have variable effects on enzymatic activity but commonly alter neuronal process morphology. The mechanisms underlying the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of LRRK2 GTPase and kinase activity, and the pathogenic effects of familial mutations, are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a novel functional interaction between LRRK2 and ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 1 (ArfGAP1). LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 interact in vitro in mammalian cells and in vivo in brain, and co-localize in the cytoplasm and at Golgi membranes. PD-associated and functional mutations that alter the GTPase activity of LRRK2 modulate the interaction with ArfGAP1. The GTP hydrolysis activity of LRRK2 is markedly enhanced by ArfGAP1 supporting a role for ArfGAP1 as a GTPase-activating protein for LRRK2. Unexpectedly, ArfGAP1 promotes the kinase activity of LRRK2 suggesting a potential role for GTP hydrolysis in kinase activation. Furthermore, LRRK2 robustly and directly phosphorylates ArfGAP1 in vitro. Silencing of ArfGAP1 expression in primary cortical neurons rescues the neurite shortening phenotype induced by G2019S LRRK2 overexpression, whereas the co-expression of ArfGAP1 and LRRK2 synergistically promotes neurite shortening in a manner dependent upon LRRK2 GTPase activity. Neurite shortening induced by ArfGAP1 overexpression is also attenuated by silencing of LRRK2. Our data reveal a novel role for ArfGAP1 in regulating the GTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of LRRK2; reciprocally, LRRK2 phosphorylates ArfGAP1 and is required for ArfGAP1 neuronal toxicity. ArfGAP1 may represent a promising target for interfering with LRRK2-dependent neurodegeneration in familial and sporadic PD.","_input_hash":269020338,"_task_hash":624470120,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":1015,"end":1020,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156070,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

We used human Tau purified from yeast models to generate new monoclonal antibodies, of which three were further characterized. The first antibody, ADx201, binds the Tau proline-rich region independently of the phosphorylation status, whereas the second, ADx215, detects an epitope formed by the Tau N terminus when Tau is not phosphorylated at Tyr(18). For the third antibody, ADx210, the binding site could not be determined because its epitope is probably conformational. All three antibodies stained tangle-like structures in different brain sections of THY-Tau22 transgenic mice and Alzheimer patients, and ADx201 and ADx210 also detected neuritic plaques in the cortex of the patient brains. In hippocampal homogenates from THY-Tau22 mice and cortex homogenates obtained from Alzheimer patients, ADx215 consistently stained specific low order Tau oligomers in diseased brain, which in size correspond to Tau dimers. ADx201 and ADx210 additionally reacted to higher order Tau oligomers and presumed prefibrillar structures in the patient samples. Our data further suggest that formation of the low order Tau oligomers marks an early disease stage that is initiated by Tau phosphorylation at N-terminal sites. Formation of higher order oligomers appears to require additional phosphorylation in the C terminus of Tau. When used to assess Tau levels in human cerebrospinal fluid, the antibodies permitted us to discriminate patients with Alzheimer disease or other dementia like vascular dementia, indicative that these antibodies hold promising diagnostic potential.","_input_hash":138866746,"_task_hash":1253314775,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":287,"end":292,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"transgenic","start":846,"end":856,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"mice","start":857,"end":861,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"patients","start":876,"end":884,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"mice","start":1018,"end":1022,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"patients","start":1070,"end":1078,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"human","start":1634,"end":1639,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"patients","start":1705,"end":1713,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"vascular","start":1760,"end":1768,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1827,"end":1837,"pattern":-808942259}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 77, 82, 34, 82, 34, 0, 34, 66, 55"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156234,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

Before entering the ciliary compartment, IFT complexes and transported cargoes accumulate at or near the base of the cilium. The spatial organization of IFT proteins at the cilia base is key for understanding cilia formation and function. Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and computational averaging, we show that seven TZ, nine IFT, three Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and one centrosomal protein, form 9-clustered rings at the cilium base of a ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In the axial dimension, analyzed TZ proteins localize to a narrow region of about 30 nm while IFT proteins dock approximately 80 nm proximal to TZ. Moreover, the IFT-A subcomplex is positioned peripheral to the IFT-B subcomplex and the investigated BBS proteins localize near the ciliary membrane. The positioning of the HA-tagged N- and C-termini of the selected proteins enabled the prediction of the spatial orientation of protein particles and likely cargo interaction sites.

For the commercial capsule, a complex formulation is used to maintain the acidic microenvironment required for maximal absorption. Consequently, its efficacy and safety are similar with or without concomitant intake of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). A simplified DE tablet formulation was developed and tested in two studies. One investigated bioequivalence (BE) of the novel DE tablet versus the commercial DE capsule. The other investigated DE bioavailability (BA) under pretreatment with the PPI rabeprazole and assessed the effect of elevated pH on exposure to dabigatran.\tBE of the novel DE tablet versus the DE capsule was assessed in a randomized two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence crossover study (NCT03070171). The effect of rabeprazole on the BA of the DE tablet was assessed in an open-label, single-arm study (NCT03143166). Both studies were conducted at sites in Japan. Participants were healthy male volunteers, aged\u2009\u2265\u200920-40\u00a0years. In the BE study, participants received the DE tablet or capsule (single oral dose, 110\u00a0mg); primary endpoints were area under the concentration-time curve from baseline to the last quantifiable data point (AUC0-tz) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of unconjugated dabigatran. In the relative BA study, participants received the DE tablet (single oral dose, 110\u00a0mg) with or without rabeprazole pretreatment (once daily for 5\u00a0days, 20\u00a0mg); primary endpoints were AUC0-tz and Cmax of total dabigatran.\tIn total, 160 participants were randomized in the BE study; 36 participants were enrolled in the BA study. The 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean (gMean) ratios for AUC0-tz (101.4-116.0%) and Cmax (101.8-116.6%) of unconjugated dabigatran were within pre-defined acceptance criteria for BE. In the relative BA study, the gMeans of AUC0-tz (667 to 192\u00a0ng\u00a0h/mL) and Cmax (83.1 to 21.8\u00a0ng/mL) were decreased by approximately 70% when the tablet was administered under rabeprazole pretreatment. The reduction in BA was observed at a mean gastric pH of 5.3. Treatment was well tolerated; no deaths, serious adverse events (AEs) or significant AEs were reported in either study.\tThe DE tablet demonstrated BE to the capsule; however, at high gastric pH, BA of the tablet was reduced by approximately 70%, which may lead to reduced efficacy. Data indicate the importance of examining not only BE under standard conditions, but relative BA at elevated gastric pH. Such investigations may avoid the reduced BA at elevated pH that is quite common in the target population (the elderly and/or patients treated with gastric-acid modifying co-medications), and therefore reduce treatment failure with DE.

Whilst existing measures are satisfactory for some purposes, none adequately assesses the psychological, somatic and behavioural components of anxiety. The measurement of trait anxiety is also important in some clinical research and as part of the assessment of selected patients. In some circumstances, self report measures of trait anxiety should be used in conjunction with a measure of social desirability. Patients who score low both on trait anxiety and social desirability may respond differently to experimental stressors from those who score low on trait anxiety and high on social desirability. This may have a number of implications, for example in the area of psychoimmunology.

During early brain development 5-HT modulates morphogenetic activities, such as neural differentiation, axon outgrowth, and synaptic modeling. In the adult brain, midbrain raphe serotonergic neurons project to a variety of brain regions and modulate a wide range of physiological functions. Several lines of evidence indicate that genetically determined variability in serotonergic gene expression, as it has been documented for the 5-HT transporter, influences temperamental traits and may lead to psychopathological conditions with increased anxiety, depression, and aggression. Investigation of the regulation of serotonergic gene transcription and its impact on neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis spur interest to identify serotonergic gene-related molecular factors underlying disease states and to develop more effective antidepressant treatment strategies. Gene targeting strategies have increasingly been integrated into investigations of brain function and along with the fading dogma of a limited capacity of neurons for regeneration and reproducibility, it is realized that gene transfer techniques using efficient viral vectors in conjunction with neuron-selective transcriptional control systems may also be applicable to complex disorders of the brain. Given the fact that the 5-HT system continues to be an important target for drug development and production, novel strategies aiming toward the modification of 5-HT function at the level of gene expression are likely to be exploited by enterprises participating actively in the introduction of alternative therapeutic approaches.","_input_hash":-1175367838,"_task_hash":1326273910,"spans":[{"text":"therapeutic","start":1895,"end":1906,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156473,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

In some severe cases, behavioral, environmental, and pharmacological interventions are not sufficient to alleviate these potentially life-threatening symptoms. It has been suggested that in those cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) could be an option. This review summarizes the scientific literature on ECT for agitation and aggression in dementia.\tWe performed a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Two reviewers extracted the following data from the retrieved articles: number of patients and their age, gender, diagnoses, types of problem behavior, treatments tried before ECT, specifications of the ECT treatment, use of rating scales, treatment results, follow-up data, and adverse effects.\tThe initial search yielded 264 articles, 17 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, one was a prospective cohort study, one was a case-control study, and the others were retrospective chart reviews, case series, or case reports. Clinically significant improvement was observed in the majority (88%) of the 122 patients described, often early in the treatment course. Adverse effects were most commonly mild, transient, or not reported.\tThe reviewed articles suggest that ECT could be an effective treatment for severe and treatment-refractory agitation and aggression in dementia, with few adverse consequences. Nevertheless, because of the substantial risk of selection bias, the designs of the studies reviewed, and their small number, further prospective studies are needed to substantiate these preliminary positive results.","_input_hash":-874185320,"_task_hash":2048612736,"spans":[{"text":"Therapy","start":136,"end":143,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"Systematic","start":188,"end":198,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"patients","start":213,"end":221,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":521,"end":528,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"review","start":560,"end":566,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"literature","start":593,"end":603,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"systematic","start":668,"end":678,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"review","start":679,"end":685,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"patients","start":868,"end":876,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"cohort","start":1209,"end":1215,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"study","start":1216,"end":1221,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"case","start":1233,"end":1237,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"study","start":1246,"end":1251,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"retrospective","start":1273,"end":1286,"pattern":1350033973},{"text":"case","start":1302,"end":1306,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"case","start":1318,"end":1322,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"patients","start":1413,"end":1421,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"46, 6, 34, 46, 4, 5, 6, 4, 34, 1, 2, 35, 2, 65, 35, 35, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156560,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

Previous studies showed that UBE3A plays an important role in the first postnatal weeks of mouse brain development, but its precise role is unknown. Since impaired striatal maturation has been implicated in several mouse models for NDDs, we studied the importance of UBE3A in striatal maturation. We used inducible Ube3a mouse models to investigate the maturation of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from dorsomedial striatum. MSNs of mutant mice matured properly till postnatal day 15 (P15) but remained hyperexcitable with fewer excitatory synaptic events at later ages, indicative of stalled striatal maturation in Ube3a mice. Reinstatement of UBE3A expression at P21 fully restored MSN excitability but only partially restored synaptic transmission and the operant conditioning behavioral phenotype. Gene reinstatement at P70 failed to rescue both electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. In contrast, deletion of Ube3a after normal brain development did not result in these electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. This study emphasizes the role of UBE3A in striatal maturation and the importance of early postnatal reinstatement of UBE3A expression to obtain a full rescue of behavioral phenotypes associated with striatal function in AS.","_input_hash":1926967464,"_task_hash":-1582557829,"spans":[{"text":"mouse","start":355,"end":360,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mouse","start":479,"end":484,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mouse","start":585,"end":590,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mice","start":701,"end":705,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":883,"end":887,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"study","start":1298,"end":1303,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"81, 81, 81, 82, 82, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156627,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

The CLA was covalently linked to PTX. The conjugate was stable in PBS and rat plasma in vitro and had no microtubule assembly activity in solution and slight effect of arresting cell cycle progression at the G(2)-M phase. The in vitro cytotoxicity of conjugate was lower than that of PTX (p < 0.05). The conjugate showed higher cellular uptake efficiency on C6 glioma cells. The entire pharmacokinetic index revealed the significant enhancement of the conjugate pharmacokinetics compared with that in PTX (p < 0.01). The conjugate, unlike PTX, could distribute in brain tissue and retained higher concentrations throughout 360 h. The anti-tumor efficacy in brain tumor-bearing rats after administering conjugate was significantly higher than that after giving Taxol (p < 0.01). In conclusion, this CLA-PTX conjugate showed great potential to become a new prodrug of PTX and the methodology can be applied to other anticancer drugs.","_input_hash":1341091986,"_task_hash":-143889798,"spans":[{"text":"therapeutic","start":18,"end":29,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"study","start":384,"end":389,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rat","start":579,"end":582,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"cells","start":873,"end":878,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"methodology","start":1383,"end":1394,"pattern":-2114709687}],"meta":{"pattern":"47, 2, 92, 70, 62"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156691,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

A distinction has been made between three types of social media use: passive, active and problematic. This study examined longitudinal associations between these types of adolescents' social media use and depression/anxiety symptoms and moderation effects of sex or extraversion. At ages 13 (T1) and 14 (T2), 257 adolescents completed an online questionnaire regarding their depression and anxiety symptoms and problematic social media use as well as three social media use diaries. Cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) revealed a positive association between problematic use and later anxiety symptoms (\u03b2 = .16, p = .010). Extraversion moderated the association between active use and anxiety (\u03b2 = -.14, p = .032). Specifically, active use predicted higher subsequent anxiety symptoms only in adolescents with low to moderate levels of extraversion. No sex moderation was found. While social media use (active or problematic) predicted later anxiety symptoms (but not depression), the reverse was not the case. However, highly extraverted individuals seem to be less vulnerable to potential negative effects of social media use.","_input_hash":-1402138392,"_task_hash":1094200825,"spans":[{"text":"Longitudinal","start":80,"end":92,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"study","start":616,"end":621,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"longitudinal","start":631,"end":643,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"questionnaire","start":854,"end":867,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"case","start":1513,"end":1517,"pattern":1741807605}],"meta":{"pattern":"52, 2, 52, 57, 35"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156696,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

In the first follow-up series, borderline psychopathology was associated with higher levels of psychiatric service use (emergency, daycare, and inpatient). Markov analyses indicated that the transition between levels of psychiatric service use followed a stationary, second order process (i.e. the immediate past and current service use, predicted use on the next follow-up, and the relationship did not depend on the point in time examined in the follow-up series). Further, the transition probabilities generated from this model did not depend significantly on diagnosis. Predictions from the Markov model about the cumulative probability that subjects would use the highest level of psychiatric services were tested on a second series of follow-ups on the same subjects 20 months later. The model-based predictions (starting from the observed levels in the first two follow-ups of the second series) clustered into three groups, of high, middle, and low predicted probabilities. The subject group with the lowest predicted likelihood had a cumulative probability of 0.19 for using emergency, daycare, or inpatient hospitalization by 22 months of follow-up, whereas the group with the highest likelihood (containing a disproportionate number of BPD subjects) had a cumulative observed probability of 0.80. The Markov model generated from this second series supported the stationarity of the transition process. BPD subjects began using high levels of psychiatric services, but their transition from one level to another over time followed a process similar to that of non-BPD subjects.","_input_hash":-581002574,"_task_hash":-1027626206,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":194,"end":199,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"diagnosis","start":987,"end":996,"pattern":-1255217628}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 56"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156719,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

Results from multivariate analysis support the hypothesis that the discrepancy between mothers and children is in part a function of the tendency of depressed mothers to view their children as more symptomatic. The use of probands as informants may lead to an overestimation of familial aggregation, if the affected probands suffer from major depression or depressive symptoms.","_input_hash":1297612615,"_task_hash":1593903461,"spans":[{"text":"history","start":63,"end":70,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"study","start":502,"end":507,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"64, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156840,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

In order to study the contribution of neuronal connections and neuron-glia interactions to this variation in neuronal vulnerability, we used hippocampal and neocortical cultures submitted to various periods of histotoxic ischemia. Organotypic cultures were exposed at 37 degrees C for 0, 7, 30 and 60 min to a glucose-free NaCN-containing medium. Histological analysis using thionin staining and MAP2 immunostaining showed differences in the temporal profile of neuronal damage in hippocampal and neocortical structures, i.e., in decreasing order, CA1 (7 min) > CA3 and neocortical layers II, III, V, VI (30 min) > DG and neocortical layer IV (60 min). In parallel to the neurodegeneration study, the time course and the regional pattern of microglial and astroglial changes were also examined using GS-B4 isolectin and GFAP as immunohistochemical markers, respectively. The GS-B4 isolectin staining revealed an early (at 7 min for the hippocampus) and a specific microglial activation located in areas undergoing neuronal damage. For both organotypic cultures, astrogliosis occurred later (after 30 min of stress) with no specific regional distribution. Both hippocampal and neocortical cultures submitted to histotoxic ischemia allowed the replication of many of the cellular events observed in response to global ischemia in vivo. These findings support the hypothesis that neuron-neuron connections as well as interactions between neurons and glial cells are essential to reproduce in vitro the selective neuronal vulnerability described in vivo.","_input_hash":297289872,"_task_hash":62724611,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":299,"end":304,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":977,"end":982,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cells","start":1740,"end":1745,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 2, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708156851,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

The purpose of the study was for quality improvement and to detect cognitive impairment among Medicare readmitted patients.\tThe result shows cognitive impairment is prevalent among the Medicare population. Seventy-one (61%) had evidence of cognitive impairment (i.e., obtained a score below 25). The mean MoCA score for the 71 patients identified as having evidence of cognitive impairment was 17.84 (SD, \u00b15.06; range, 5-24). MoCA is useful in the acute care setting for identifying patients who are at increased risk for readmission. A randomly assigned controlled clinical trial test is warranted to further validate the association between cognitive impairment and readmissions.\tThe ACA aims to improve case management by improving effective outcomes for individuals, care coordination among hospital professionals, economic efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and the collaborative process that services the patient.

An impaired ability to stop or control alcohol intake despite adverse health or social consequences characterize AUD. While AUDs predominantly occur in men, growing evidence suggests the existence of distinct cognitive and biological consequences of alcohol dependence in women. The molecular and physiological mechanisms participating in these differential effects remain unknown. Transcriptomic technology permits the detection of the biological mechanisms responsible for such sex-based differences, which supports the subsequent development of novel personalized therapeutics to treat AUD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of transcriptomics studies regarding alcohol dependence in humans with representation from both sexes. For each study, we processed and analyzed transcriptomic data to obtain a functional profile of pathways and biological functions and then integrated the resulting data by meta-analysis to characterize any sex-based transcriptomic differences associated with AUD. Global results of the transcriptomic analysis revealed the association of decreased tissue regeneration, embryo malformations, altered intracellular transport, and increased rate of RNA and protein replacement with female AUD patients.

Activated macrophages have been shown to induce vascular proliferation and play an important role in ischemic stroke. In this study, we examined the therapeutic effect of GM-CSF on the ischemic brain by activating microglia/macrophages.

Infarct volume, neurological function and histological findings were assessed 48 h later. An intracarotid injection of GM-CSF reduced the infarct volume and improved neurological function at 48 h after reperfusion. Histological analysis revealed that the number of activated microglia/macrophages to be increased and the number of apoptotic cells to be decreased in the area of the penumbra.

Defects in primary cilia lead to a myriad of diseases in humans such as obesity and cancers. In the mature brain, both neurons and astrocytes contain a single primary cilium. Although neuronal primary cilia are not directly involved in synaptic communication, their pathophysiological impacts on obesity and mental disorders are well recognized. In contrast, research on astrocytic primary cilia lags far behind. Currently, little is known about their functions and molecular pathways in the mature brain. Unlike neurons, postnatal astrocytes retain the capacity of cell division and can become reactive and proliferate in response to various brain insults such as epilepsy, ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative \u03b2-amyloid plaques. Since primary cilia derive from the mother centrioles, astrocyte proliferation must occur in coordination with the dismantling and ciliogenesis of astrocyte cilia. In this regard, the functions, signal pathways, and structural dynamics of neuronal and astrocytic primary cilia are fundamentally different.

Safety and tolerability were assessed weekly.\tThe DVP + quetiapine group demonstrated a statistically significantly greater reduction in YMRS scores from baseline to endpoint than the DVP + placebo group (F(1,27) = 5.04, p =.03). Moreover, YMRS response rate was significantly greater in the DVP + quetiapine group than in the DVP + placebo group (87% versus 53%; Fisher exact test, p =.05).

{"pmid":"32213570","text":"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry^\nVisual hallucinations in neurological and ophthalmological disease: pathophysiology and management.^\nVisual hallucinations are common in older people and are especially associated with ophthalmological and neurological disorders, including dementia and Parkinson's disease. Uncertainties remain whether there is a single underlying mechanism for visual hallucinations or they have different disease-dependent causes. However, irrespective of mechanism, visual hallucinations are difficult to treat. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded a research programme to investigate visual hallucinations in the key and high burden areas of eye disease, dementia and Parkinson's disease, culminating in a workshop to develop a unified framework for their clinical management. Here we summarise the evidence base, current practice and consensus guidelines that emerged from the workshop.Irrespective of clinical condition, case ascertainment strategies are required to overcome reporting stigma. Once hallucinations are identified, physical, cognitive and ophthalmological health should be reviewed, with education and self-help techniques provided. Not all hallucinations require intervention but for those that are clinically significant, current evidence supports pharmacological modification of cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic systems, or reduction of cortical excitability. A broad treatment perspective is needed, including carer support. Despite their frequency and clinical significance, there is a paucity of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial evidence where the primary outcome is an improvement in visual hallucinations. Key areas for future research include the development of valid and reliable assessment tools for use in mechanistic studies and clinical trials, transdiagnostic studies of shared and distinct mechanisms and when and how to treat visual hallucinations.","_input_hash":-2089739111,"_task_hash":802586468,"spans":[{"text":"case","start":983,"end":987,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"intervention","start":1241,"end":1253,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"randomised","start":1599,"end":1609,"pattern":337880179},{"text":"placebo","start":1611,"end":1618,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"controlled","start":1619,"end":1629,"pattern":-610699305},{"text":"trial","start":1639,"end":1644,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"trials","start":1861,"end":1867,"pattern":1849967594}],"meta":{"pattern":"35, 48, 19, 14, 27, 73, 75"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708157759,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

Subjective effects were assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) before the drug was taken and 1, 3, and 6 h later. Subjects chose amphetamine a mean of 4.03 times. Compared with placebo, amphetamine produced changes in mood on the POMS including increased Vigor, Elation, Friendliness, Arousal and Positive Mood and decreased Confusion.

Antiepileptic drugs administration is the most commonly used therapeutic strategy in the management of epilepsy. However, 20-30% of epilepsy patients have seizure episodes that are not controlled by these medicines (drug-resistant epilepsy). The management of drug-resistant epilepsy, especially in the children, is challenging and can cause economic and social problems, and lower the patients' quality of life, cognition, and mood. Several therapeutic approaches for drug-resistant epilepsy are available including surgical methods, neurostimulation treatments, and diet therapies which lead to diminishing the epileptic seizures. An increasing number of novel and potential therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy, gene editing, cell therapy, exosome therapy, and molecular network targeting have also been explored.

The severity of this other-directed violence (ODV) in the community may be influenced by insight into illness and adherence to psychotropic medications; however, few studies have tested these associations. Sixty male psychotic inpatients, legally detained at a forensic unit in New York City, were assessed with semi-structured interviews, supplemented with information from hospital and official records, family members and the treating clinician. Results indicated that in this unique sample of detained persons with psychotic disorders; (1) increase in the severity of community violence is associated with medication non-adherence, all dimensions of poor insight into illness, and several previously reported covariates such as substance use comorbidity; (2) no relationship was found between insight and adherence in this particular sample; (3) multivariate analyses showed that select covariates, along with medication adherence, and select insight domains predicted a total of 73% of the magnitude of ODV behavior in this sample. Overall, medication non-adherence explained a large amount of how violently participants behaved toward others. Since non-adherence was independent of poor insight, it may be more worthwhile for clinicians to develop treatment strategies to target medication adherence without directly addressing an elusive target such as insight into illness. Treatment addressing medication adherence needs to concomitantly target substance use behaviors since the latter was responsible for a substantial increase in ODV.","_input_hash":-419705394,"_task_hash":1227588971,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708157832,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

The neural mechanisms that underlie this reorganization may be the same as those normally responsible for skilled behaviors that accompany extended sensory experience and, if better understood, could provide a basis for further promoting recovery of function after injury. The work presented here extends studies of spontaneous cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury to the role of rehabilitative strategies on cortical reorganization. We use a complete spinal transection model to focus on cortical reorganization in response to serotonergic (5-HT) pharmacotherapy without any confounding effects from spared fibers left after partial lesions. 5-HT pharmacotherapy has previously been shown to improve behavioral outcome after SCI but the effect on cortical organization is unknown. After a complete spinal transection in the adult rat, 5-HT pharmacotherapy produced more reorganization in the sensorimotor cortex than would be expected by transection alone. This reorganization was dose dependent, extended into intact (forelimb) motor cortex, and, at least in the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex, followed a somatotopic arrangement. Animals with the greatest behavioral outcome showed the greatest extent of cortical reorganization suggesting that the reorganization is likely to be in response to both direct effects of 5-HT on cortical circuits and indirect effects in response to the behavioral improvement below the level of the lesion.","_input_hash":297005462,"_task_hash":816534768,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":1073,"end":1076,"pattern":-569153227}],"meta":{"pattern":"92"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708157917,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

In vitro, n\u20113 PUFAs inhibited mTORC1 and enhanced autophagy. The n\u20113 PUFA levels and the ratio of n\u20113 PUFA to n\u20116 PUFA in the spinal cord and serum of rats fed a high\u2011n\u20113 PUFA diet were higher before and after operation (P<0.05). Additionally, rats in the high\u2011n\u20113 PUFA group showed improved motor function recovery, spinal cord repair\u2011related protein expression level (MBP, Galc and GFAP). Expression levels if these protiens in the high\u2011n\u20113 PUFA diet group expressed the highest levels, followed by the low\u2011n\u20113 PUFA diet group and finally the control group (P<0.05). high\u2011n\u20113 PUFA diet promoted autophagy ability and inhibited activity of the mTORC1 signaling pathway compared with the low\u2011n\u20113 PUFA diet group or the control group (P<0.05). These results suggest that exogenous dietary n\u20113 PUFAs can inhibit mTORC1 signaling and enhance autophagy, promoting functional recovery of rats with SCI.","_input_hash":564345334,"_task_hash":1348059053,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":194,"end":199,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"randomly","start":439,"end":447,"pattern":985041104}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 25"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708158052,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

{"pmid":"25080285","text":"Brain : a journal of neurology^\nGenetic impact on cognition and brain function in newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: ICICLE-PD study.^\nParkinson's disease is associated with multiple cognitive impairments and increased risk of dementia, but the extent of these deficits varies widely among patients. The ICICLE-PD study was established to define the characteristics and prevalence of cognitive change soon after diagnosis, in a representative cohort of patients, using a multimodal approach. Specifically, we tested the 'Dual Syndrome' hypothesis for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, which distinguishes an executive syndrome (affecting the frontostriatal regions due to dopaminergic deficits) from a posterior cortical syndrome (affecting visuospatial, mnemonic and semantic functions related to Lewy body pathology and secondary cholinergic loss). An incident Parkinson's disease cohort (n = 168, median 8 months from diagnosis to participation) and matched control group (n = 85) were recruited to a neuroimaging study at two sites in the UK. All participants underwent clinical, neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments. The three neuroimaging tasks (Tower of London, Spatial Rotations and Memory Encoding Tasks) were designed to probe executive, visuospatial and memory encoding domains, respectively. Patients were also genotyped for three polymorphisms associated with cognitive change in Parkinson's disease and related disorders: (i) rs4680 for COMT Val158Met polymorphism; (ii) rs9468 for MAPT H1 versus H2 haplotype; and (iii) rs429358 for APOE-\u03b52, 3, 4. We identified performance deficits in all three cognitive domains, which were associated with regionally specific changes in cortical activation. Task-specific regional activations in Parkinson's disease were linked with genetic variation: the rs4680 polymorphism modulated the effect of levodopa therapy on planning-related activations in the frontoparietal network; the MAPT haplotype modulated parietal activations associated with spatial rotations; and APOE allelic variation influenced the magnitude of activation associated with memory encoding. This study demonstrates that neurocognitive deficits are common even in recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease, and that the associated regional brain activations are influenced by genotype. These data further support the dual syndrome hypothesis of cognitive change in Parkinson's disease. Longitudinal data will confirm the extent to which these early neurocognitive changes, and their genetic factors, influence the long-term risk of dementia in Parkinson's disease. The combination of genetics and functional neuroimaging provides a potentially useful method for stratification and identification of candidate markers, in future clinical trials against cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease.","_input_hash":-866791210,"_task_hash":1308898245,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":292,"end":300,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":316,"end":321,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"prevalence","start":372,"end":382,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"diagnosis","start":414,"end":423,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"cohort","start":445,"end":451,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"patients","start":455,"end":463,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"cohort","start":896,"end":902,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"diagnosis","start":934,"end":943,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"study","start":1030,"end":1035,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"Patients","start":1353,"end":1361,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":1909,"end":1916,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"study","start":2169,"end":2174,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":2255,"end":2263,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Longitudinal","start":2469,"end":2481,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"trials","start":2820,"end":2826,"pattern":1849967594}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 53, 56, 1, 34, 1, 56, 2, 34, 46, 2, 34, 52, 75"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708158098,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

However, the specific contribution of the cerebellum to the DMN abnormalities remains unclear in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients. Forty-six unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients and 46 healthy controls were recruited for a resting-state scan. The images were analyzed using the functional connectivity (FC) method. The siblings showed significantly increased FCs between the left Crus I and the left superior medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), as well as between the lobule IX and the bilateral MPFC (orbital part) and right superior MPFC compared with the controls. No significantly decreased FC was observed in the siblings relative to the controls.

Our aim was to perform an expanded extensive assessment of motor and nonmotor manifestations in PD to identify whether RBD was associated with differences in the nature and severity of these manifestations. PD patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) to diagnose the presence of RBD. Participants then underwent an extensive evaluation by a movement disorders specialist blinded to PSG results. Measures of disease severity, quantitative motor indices, motor subtypes, therapy complications, and autonomic, psychiatric, visual, and olfactory dysfunction were assessed and compared using regression analysis, adjusting for disease duration, age, and sex. Of 98 included patients, 54 had RBD and 44 did not. PD patients with RBD were older (P = 0.034) and were more likely to be male (P < 0.001). On regression analysis, the most consistent links between RBD and PD were a higher systolic blood pressure (BP) change while standing (-23.9 \u00b1 13.9 versus -3.5 \u00b1 10.9; P < 0.001), a higher orthostatic symptom score (0.89 \u00b1 0.82 versus 0.44 \u00b1 0.66; P = 0.003), and a higher frequency of freezing (43% versus 14%; P = 0.011). A systolic BP drop >10 could identify PD patients with RBD with 81% sensitivity and 86% specificity.

Throughout the sample, key correlates of grandparent care were maternal age and education. In families without access to paid help with childcare, the child's ordinal position, maternal employment, the mother's recall of parenting by her own mother and the reasons for choosing the type of childcare were also associated with variations in grandparent care. Grandparent care was associated with some elevated rates of hyperactivity and peer difficulties at age 4, but these were largely attributable to variations in the types of families using grandparent care.\tThe popular belief that the extended family is no longer an important part of British life is not borne out by this study.

A second step is to find patterns both of biological markers and of neuropsychiatric symptoms that are linked to the various pathological changes of the disease.","_input_hash":1007289300,"_task_hash":1887687561,"spans":[{"text":"classification","start":68,"end":82,"pattern":-756437862},{"text":"diagnosis","start":123,"end":132,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"classification","start":382,"end":396,"pattern":-756437862},{"text":"classification","start":574,"end":588,"pattern":-756437862},{"text":"classification","start":695,"end":709,"pattern":-756437862}],"meta":{"pattern":"59, 56, 59, 59, 59"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708158268,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03","_session_id":"2024-02-17_08-32-03"}

Questions specifically addressed here are: 1) is the degree of fragility predictive of IQ? 2) are cognitive patterns consistent across fragility levels? and 3) do consistent individual profiles exist? These questions were addressed with the help of 74 heterozygous women, 38 of whom were fra(X)-negative carriers. All women completed the WAIS-R, and full-scale IQ was normally distributed (mean = 99.65). A strong inverse relationship between IQ and fragility levels was found. Also, the group of fra(X)-positive women had a significantly different subtest pattern from that of the fra(X)-negative women. However, when results were analyzed individually, no consistent patterns emerged. The cognitive performance of fra(X)-negative carriers has probably been underestimated due to the lack of differentiation between positive and negative carrier females in previous studies. These women appear to be cognitively unimpaired and should be considered separately from fra(X)-positive women.

These applications involve treatment protocols with automated content delivery and relatively low clinical contact. Whilst such CBT applications are promising, however, further investigation is needed to establish the efficacy of this treatment approach for individuals with OCD. The aim of the present study was to review the efficacy of technology-delivered CBT with minimal clinician support for OCD using a meta-analytic approach.\tRandomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified through PsycINFO, Medline and Scopus resulting in 18 eligible studies\u00a0(n\u2009=\u20091707). Control conditions comprised both passive (namely no treatment, other treatments and waitlist controls) and active.

However, it is unknown whether a caspase-1 inhibitor can modify apoptotic neuronal damage incurred during transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) and whether intranasal administration of a caspase-1 inhibitor is an effective treatment following GCI. The present study was conducted to examine the potential efficiency of post-ischemic intranasal administration of the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK in a 4-vessel occlusion model of GCI in the rat. Herein, we show that intranasal Boc-D-CMK readily penetrated the central nervous system, subsequently inhibiting caspase-1 activity, decreasing mitochondrial dysfunction, and attenuating caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway in ischemia-vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region. Further investigation regarding the mechanisms underlying Boc-D-CMK's neuroprotective effects revealed marked inhibition of reactive gliosis, as well as reduction of the neuroinflammatory response via inhibition of the downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal Boc-D-CMK post-treatment also significantly enhanced the numbers of NeuN-positive cells while simultaneously decreasing the numbers of TUNEL-positive and PARP1-positive cells in hippocampal CA1. Correspondingly, behavioral tests showed that deteriorations in spatial learning and memory performance, and long-term recognition memory following GCI were significantly improved in the Boc-D-CMK post-treated animals. In summary, the current study demonstrates that the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK coordinates anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions to attenuate neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region following GCI. Furthermore, our data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 is a promising neuroprotective strategy to target ischemic neuronal injury and functional deficits following transient GCI.","_input_hash":2136272842,"_task_hash":1958556978,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":508,"end":513,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rat","start":688,"end":691,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"cells","start":1326,"end":1331,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1413,"end":1418,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"summary","start":1661,"end":1668,"pattern":915282476},{"text":"study","start":1682,"end":1687,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 92, 70, 70, 9, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708188465,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

The suggested roles of noncoding RNAs in pathology led us to perform a comparative analysis of the microRNAs expressed in the serum of human ASD patients. The analysis of a cohort of 45 children with ASD revealed that six microRNAs (miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-3613-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-499a-5p) were expressed at low to very low levels compared to those in healthy controls. A similar but less pronounced decrease was registered in the clinically unaffected parents of the sick children and in their siblings but never in any genetically unrelated control. Results consistent with these observations were obtained in the blood, hypothalamus and sperm of two of the established mouse models of ASD: valproic acid-treated animals and Cc2d1a[+/-] heterozygotes. In both instances, the same characteristic miRNA profile was evidenced in the affected individuals and inherited together with disease symptoms in the progeny of crosses with healthy animals. The consistent association of these genetic regulatory changes with the disease provides a starting point for evaluating the changes in the activity of the target genes and, thus, the underlying mechanism(s). From the applied societal and medical perspectives, once properly confirmed in large cohorts, these observations provide tools for the very early identification of affected children and progenitors.","_input_hash":-1219217332,"_task_hash":-1630168836,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":66,"end":74,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"mouse","start":79,"end":84,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"human","start":365,"end":370,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"patients","start":375,"end":383,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"cohort","start":403,"end":409,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"mouse","start":923,"end":928,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"genes","start":1360,"end":1365,"pattern":995975506}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 81, 0, 34, 1, 81, 78"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708188478,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

{"pmid":"33139210","text":"Current problems in pediatric and adolescent health care^\nNocturnal events in children: When and how to evaluate.^\nNocturnal events of wide variety and concern are frequently reported by patients and their caregivers. To evaluate suspected abnormal events, primary care physicians must first be familiar with normal behaviors, movements and breathing patterns. Abnormal nocturnal events can then be categorized as nocturnal seizure, parasomnia, sleep-related movement disorder or sleep-related breathing disorder. Diagnoses in the above categories can be made clinically; however, it is important to know when to refer for additional evaluation. Comprehensive literature review was undertaken of nocturnal and sleep-related disorders. This guide reviews nocturnal seizures, normal and abnormal nonepileptic movements and behaviors, discusses broad indications for referral for electroencephalography (EEG) or polysomnography (PSG), and guides counseling and management for patients and their families, ultimately aiding in interpretation of both findings and prognosis. Epilepsy syndromes can result in seizures during sleep or adjacent periods of wakefulness. Parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders tend to also occur in childhood and may be distinguished clinically. Referral to additional specialists for specific studies including EEG or PSG can be necessary, while other times a knowledgeable and vigilant clinician can contribute to a prompt diagnosis based on clinical features. Nocturnal events often can be managed with parental reassurance and watchful waiting, but treatment or evaluation may be needed. Sleep-related breathing disorders are important to recognize as they present very differently in children than in adults and early intervention can be life-saving. This review should allow both primary and subspecialty non-neurologic pediatric and adolescent health care providers to better utilize EEG and PSG as part of a larger comprehensive clinical approach, distinguishing and managing both epileptic and nonepileptic nocturnal disorders of concern while fostering communication across providers to facilitate and coordinate better holistic long-term care of pediatric and adolescent patients.","_input_hash":-264619113,"_task_hash":-1489971093,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":187,"end":195,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"literature","start":660,"end":670,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"review","start":671,"end":677,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"patients","start":973,"end":981,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1458,"end":1467,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"intervention","start":1756,"end":1768,"pattern":-2001382570},{"text":"review","start":1794,"end":1800,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"patients","start":2215,"end":2223,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 5, 4, 34, 56, 48, 4, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708188536,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

{"pmid":"26747211","text":"Neurobiology of disease^\nOcular inflammation induces trigeminal pain, peripheral and central neuroinflammatory mechanisms.^\nOcular surface diseases are among the most frequent ocular pathologies, with prevalence ranging from 20% of the general population. In addition, ocular pain following corneal injury is frequently observed in clinic. The aim of the study was to characterize the peripheral and central neuroinflammatory process in the trigeminal pathways in response to cornea alteration induced by chronic topical instillations of 0.2% benzalkonium chloride (BAC) in male C57BL/6J mice. In vitro BAC induced neurotoxicity and increases neuronal (FOS, ATF3) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6) markers in primary mouse trigeminal ganglion culture. BAC-treated mice exhibited 7days after the treatment reduced aqueous tear production and increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the cornea. Hypertonic saline-evoked eye wipe behavior was enhanced in BAC-treated animals that exhibited increased FOS, ATF3 and Iba1 immunoreactivity in the trigeminal ganglion. Ocular inflammation is associated with a significant increase in IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression in the trigeminal ganglion. We reported a strong increase in FOS and Iba1 positive cells in particular in the sensory trigeminal complex at the ipsilateral interpolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) transition and Vc/upper cervical cord (Vc/C1) regions. In addition, activated microglial cells were tightly wrapped around activated FOS neurons in both regions and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was markedly enhanced specifically in microglial cells during ocular inflammation. Similar data were obtained in the facial motor nucleus. These neuroanatomical data correlated with the increase in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CCL2) and neuronal (FOS and ATF3) markers. Interestingly, the suppression of corneal inflammation 10days following the end of BAC treatment resulted in a marked attenuation of peripheral and central changes observed in pathological conditions. This study provides the first demonstration that corneal inflammation induces activation of neurons and microglial p38 MAPK pathway within sensory trigeminal complex. These results suggest that this altered activity in intracellular signaling caused by ocular inflammation might play a priming role in the central sensitization of ocular related brainstem circuits, which represents a significant factor in ocular pain development.","_input_hash":-1006419809,"_task_hash":2098544692,"spans":[{"text":"prevalence","start":201,"end":211,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"study","start":355,"end":360,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"mice","start":588,"end":592,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mouse","start":711,"end":716,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mice","start":758,"end":762,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":1238,"end":1243,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1430,"end":1435,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":1607,"end":1612,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":2055,"end":2060,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"53, 2, 82, 81, 82, 70, 70, 70, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708188630,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

TG-DHA treatment protected BV-2 microglia cells from oxidative stress toxicity attenuating NO production and suppressing the induction of inflammatory cytokines. When compared with DHA in the ethyl-ester form, a significant difference in the ability to inhibit NO production in favor of TG-DHA was observed. TG-DHA inhibited significantly splenocyte proliferation but isolated CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation was unaffected. In a mice model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 250 mg/kg/day oral TG-DHA treatment was associated with a significant amelioration of the course and severity of the disease as compared to untreated animals.

Facial emotions are hierarchically organized patterns comprising (1) structural surface features, (2) discrete (primary) emotional categories and (3) secondary dimensions, such as valence and arousal. Categorical decoding was measured using (1) selection of category labels and selection of the named emotion category; (2) matching one facial expression with two choice expressions. Dimensional decoding was assessed by matching one face with two different expressions with regard to valence or arousal. 70 patients with well documented cerebral lesions and 15 matched hospital controls participated in the study. 27 had left brain damage (LBD; 10 frontal, 10 temporal, 7 parietal); 37 had right brain damage (RBD; 15 frontal, 11 temporal, 11 parietal). Six additional patients had lesions involving both frontal lobes. Right temporal and parietal lesioned patients were markedly impaired in the decoding of primary emotions. The same patients also showed a reduced arousal decoding. In contrast to several patients with frontal and left hemisphere lesions, emotional conceptualization and face discrimination was not independent in these groups. No group differences were observed in valence decoding. However, right frontal lesions appeared to interfere with the discrimination of negative valence. Moreover, a distraction by structural features was noted in RBD when facial identities were varied across stimulus and response pictures in matching tasks with differing conceptual load. Our results suggest that focal brain lesions differentially affect the comprehension of emotional meaning in faces depending on the level of conceptual load and interference of structural surface features.","_input_hash":167905861,"_task_hash":1466330541,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":59,"end":67,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":719,"end":727,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":819,"end":824,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":981,"end":989,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1069,"end":1077,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1147,"end":1155,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1219,"end":1227,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 2, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708188685,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

The extent to whichCBFchanges contribute to injury, and whether treatments that ameliorate these changes might be neuroprotective, is still unknown. Higher throughput techniques to monitorCBFchanges in rodent models ofHIEcan help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology. We developed a laser speckle imaging (LSI) technique to continuously monitorCBFin six postnatal-day 10 (P10) rats simultaneously before, during, and after unilateral hypoxia-ischemia (HI, ligation of the left carotid artery followed by hypoxia in 8% oxygen). After ligation,CBFto the ligated side fell by 30% compared to the unligated side (P < 0.0001). Hypoxia induced a bilateral 55% reduction inCBF, which was partially restored by resuscitation.

The purpose of the present study was to ascertain whether sera from patients with MMN can open the BNB, and which component of patient sera is the most important for this disruption.\tWe evaluated the effects of sera from patients with MMN, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and control subjects on the expression of tight junction proteins and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and on the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) in human peripheral nerve microvascular endothelial cells (PnMECs).\tThe sera from patients with MMN decreased the claudin-5 protein expression and the TEER in PnMECs. However, this effect was reversed after application of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) neutralising antibody. The VEGF secreted by PnMECs was significantly increased after exposure to the sera from patients with MMN. The sera from patients with MMN also increased the VCAM-1 protein expression by upregulating the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) signalling. The immunoglobulin G purified from MMN sera decreased the expression of claudin-5 and increased the VCAM-1 expression in PnMECs.\tThe sera from MMN patients may disrupt the BNB function via the autocrine secretion of VEGF in PnMECs, or the exposure to autoantibodies against PnMECs that are contained in the MMN sera. Autoantibodies against PnMECs in MMN sera may activate the BNB by upregulating the VCAM-1 expression, thereby allowing for the entry of a large number of circulating inflammatory cells into the peripheral nervous system.","_input_hash":-313214810,"_task_hash":-307799616,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":62,"end":70,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":315,"end":320,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":356,"end":364,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":509,"end":517,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":528,"end":536,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"vascular","start":643,"end":651,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"human","start":747,"end":752,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":796,"end":801,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"patients","start":826,"end":834,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"vascular","start":974,"end":982,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"patients","start":1132,"end":1140,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1165,"end":1173,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1438,"end":1446,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"cells","start":1787,"end":1792,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 34, 34, 34, 66, 0, 70, 34, 66, 34, 34, 34, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708188916,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

{"pmid":"23095594","text":"L'Encephale^\n[Acute catatonia: Questions, diagnosis and prognostics, and the place of atypical antipsychotics].^\nAcute catatonia is a non-specific, relatively frequent syndrome, which manifests itself through characteristic motor signs that enables its diagnosis. It occurs in association with mood disorders, psychotic disorders and several somatic or toxic diseases. Its short-term prognosis is of paramount importance. Without effective treatment, it is associated with high mortality. Despite the vital risk inherent in this disorder, it is not recognized as an independent diagnostic category by international rankings, which makes its diagnostic detection difficult and consequently does not allow adequate therapeutic care. However, if benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy have proved effective in the treatment of acute catatonia, the role of atypical antipsychotics remains controversial. In fact, despite the progress made by the DSM-IV-TR and CIM 10 by the recognition of the etiologic diversity of catatonia, we deplore the absence to date of a consensus on clinical management and therapy of catatonia, which constitutes a source of confusion for practitioners in their approach to catatonic patients. To illustrate the difficulty in supporting these patients, we report here a clinical vignette.\tMr. M. aged 21, without psychiatric history, has shown a functional acute psychotic episode involving a delirious and hallucinatory syndrome associated with a marked catatonic dimension. Olanzapine was initiated at a dose of 10mg/d on the nineth day of hospitalization; the clinical picture was complicated by a malignant catatonia justifying the halt of olanzapine and the institution, in intensive units, of 15mg per day of lorazepam. After 72hours, the patient has not responded to this treatment. ECT was expected, but the patient died on the 12th day.\tThis case raises a threefold question: the crucial issue of immediate vital prognosis, that of the truthfulness of the positive diagnosis of this psychotic table and finally the issue of therapeutic care, primarily the well-founded or otherwise use of an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of this type of psychotic disorder. For Mr. M., the clinical diagnosis that he has shown, according to the DSM IV-TR, is brief psychotic disorder 'temporary diagnosis'. This diagnosis - brief psychotic disorder - does not actually allow for a specific clinical approach to this type of psychotic table. The immediate vital prognosis inherent in the catatonic dimension may not be properly evaluated and the therapeutic conduct may miss the application of the specific treatment of the catatonic syndrome. The proper diagnosis for this type of psychotic disorder would be 'catatonia' as proposed by Taylor and Fink, instead of 'brief psychotic disorder' if the international rankings have included this disorder as a separate and independent diagnosis. The identification by international rankings of the catatonic syndrome as an independent diagnostic category seems essential for clinicians to allow: its clinical detection, the establishment of a syndromic diagnosis of catatonic disorder, appropriate prognostic evaluation and finally, the application of a suitable therapeutic strategy. Conventional treatment, benzodiazepine- and/or ECT-based, can solve the catatonic episode in a few days, irrespective of its etiology and its severity. Moreover, while all authors agree that conventional antipsychotics may induce a catatonic state or worsen a preexisting catatonia into a malignant catatonia and should thus be avoided for catatonic patients or with prior catatonic episodes, recent data from the literature emphasize the frequent and successful use of atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, in various clinical forms of benign catatonia. However, our patient did not respond to treatment with olanzapine and got even more complicated. Was the malignant catatonia that this patient has shown induced by olanzapine\u00a0? The answer to this question seems difficult since some authors report the efficacy of olanzapine in malignant catatonia. We wonder if we should have kept olanzapine and strengthen its dosage like Cassidy et al. in 2001 and Suzuki et al. in 2010 for the treatment of the malignant form constituted in this patient rather than having stopped it and used lorazepam as indicated by Taylor and Fink in 2003.\tThe non-recognition of catatonia as an independent entity, the lack of a therapeutic consensus and the pending issue on the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of catatonia are at the origin of the difficulties of therapeutic support of catatonic patients.","_input_hash":-318363887,"_task_hash":1366525210,"spans":[{"text":"diagnosis","start":42,"end":51,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":253,"end":262,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnostic","start":578,"end":588,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"diagnostic","start":641,"end":651,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"therapeutic","start":713,"end":724,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"therapy","start":781,"end":788,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"therapy","start":1103,"end":1110,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":1214,"end":1222,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1273,"end":1281,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"report","start":1286,"end":1292,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"history","start":1355,"end":1362,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"case","start":1881,"end":1885,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"diagnosis","start":2004,"end":2013,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"therapeutic","start":2063,"end":2074,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"diagnosis","start":2233,"end":2242,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":2329,"end":2338,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":2346,"end":2355,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"therapeutic","start":2579,"end":2590,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"diagnosis","start":2688,"end":2697,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":2913,"end":2922,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnostic","start":3013,"end":3023,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"diagnosis","start":3131,"end":3140,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"therapeutic","start":3241,"end":3252,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"patients","start":3613,"end":3621,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"literature","start":3677,"end":3687,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"report","start":4067,"end":4073,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"therapeutic","start":4480,"end":4491,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"therapeutic","start":4649,"end":4660,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"patients","start":4682,"end":4690,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"56, 56, 55, 55, 47, 46, 46, 34, 34, 36, 64, 35, 56, 47, 56, 56, 56, 47, 56, 56, 55, 56, 47, 34, 5, 36, 47, 47, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708188981,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Their ictal perfusion patterns were analyzed in relation to temporal and frontal hyperperfusion during TLE seizures using SPECT subtraction.\tThirty-three TLE patients had interictal and ictal SPECT, video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, and volumetric MRI. SPECT subtraction with MRI coregistration was performed using commercial software. The presence of ictal hyperperfusion was determined in the ipsilateral and contralateral temporal lobe, frontal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia.\tAll patients showed ictal hyperperfusion in the temporal lobe of seizure origin. Vermian cerebellar hyperperfusion (CH) was observed in 26 patients (78.8%) and hemispheric CH was found in 25 (75.8%). Compared with the side of the epileptogenic temporal lobe, there were 7 patients with ipsilateral hemispheric CH (28.0%), 15 with contralateral hemispheric CH (60.0%), and 3 with bilateral hemispheric CH (12.0%). CH was observed more frequently in patients with additional frontal hyperperfusion (14/15, 93.3%; 2 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 10 contralateral, and 2 bilateral) than in patients without frontal hyperperfusion (11/18, 61.1%). Among 18 patients with temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion, 11 patients showed hemispheric CH (5 ipsilateral to seizure focus, 5 contralateral, 1 bilateral). Hyperperfusion in the basal ganglia (BGH) was seen in 11 of the 15 patients with temporal and frontal hyperperfusion (73.3%) and in 11 of the 18 with only temporal hyperperfusion (61.1%). In 17 patients with unilateral BGH (13 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 4 contralateral), CH contralateral to the BGH was observed in 14 (82.5%), CH ipsilateral to the BGH was found in 2 (11.8%), and CH bilateral to the BGH was found in 1 (5.9%).\tDuring TLE seizures, hemispheric CH occurred not only in contralateral but also in ipsilateral or bilateral cerebellar hemispheres to the side of seizure origin. Although temporal lobe origin seizures associated with additional frontal hyperperfusion produced more frequent hemispheric CH, seizures showing only temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion could produce BGH and CH. To determine the side of hemispheric CH, the most important factor appears to be the side of BGH, not the side of seizure origin.","_input_hash":783234477,"_task_hash":2007881774,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":347,"end":355,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":549,"end":557,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":894,"end":902,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1029,"end":1037,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1162,"end":1170,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1338,"end":1346,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1480,"end":1488,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1545,"end":1553,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1618,"end":1626,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1780,"end":1788,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1907,"end":1915,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708188995,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Treatment-induced pericystic inflammation and its association with blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, as determined by Evans blue (EB) extravasation, was studied in infected untreated and anthelmintic-treated pigs. We compared the magnitude and extent of the pericystic inflammation, presence of EB-stained capsules, the level of damage to the parasite, expression of genes for proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue remodeling by quantitative PCR assays between treated and untreated infected pigs and between EB-stained (blue) and non stained (clear) cysts. Inflammatory scores were higher in pericystic tissues from EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts from untreated pigs and also from anthelmintic-treated pigs 48 hr and 120 hr after treatment. The degree of inflammation correlated with the severity of cyst wall damage and both increased significantly at 120 hours. Expression levels of the proinflammatory genes for IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 were higher in EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts and unaffected brain tissues, and were generally highest at 120 hr. Additionally, expression of some markers of immunoregulatory activity (IL-10, IL-2R\u03b1) were decreased in EB-stained capsules. An increase in other markers for regulatory T cells (CTLA4, FoxP3) was found, as well as significant increases in expression of two metalloproteases, MMP1 and MMP2 at 48 hr and 120 hr post-treatment. We conclude that the increase in severity of the inflammation caused by treatment is accompanied by both a proinflammatory and a complex regulatory response, largely limited to pericystic tissues with compromised vascular integrity. Because treatment induced inflammation occurs in porcine NCC similar to that in human cases, this model can be used to investigate mechanisms involved in host damaging inflammatory responses and agents or modalities that may control damaging post treatment inflammation.","_input_hash":1785816247,"_task_hash":114230725,"spans":[{"text":"vascular","start":49,"end":57,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"porcine","start":115,"end":122,"pattern":413464754},{"text":"genes","start":734,"end":739,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"genes","start":1310,"end":1315,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"cells","start":1634,"end":1639,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"vascular","start":2001,"end":2009,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"porcine","start":2070,"end":2077,"pattern":413464754},{"text":"human","start":2101,"end":2106,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"66, 89, 78, 78, 70, 66, 89, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189072,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

As oxidative stress seems to play a major role in epileptogenesis in the iron-induced model of posttraumatic epilepsy, it was of interest to examine whether DHEA would exert antiepileptic activity. DHEA at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day administered intraperitoneally for 7, 14, and 21 days to iron-induced epileptic rats prevented epileptiform electrophysiological activity. Morris water maze and open-field tests on iron-induced epileptic rats revealed that DHEA also prevented behavioral alterations related to epileptiform activity. Thus, DHEA attenuated the cognitive defects produced by epileptic activity. Moreover, alterations in epileptogenesis-related biochemical parameters-lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase (sodium pump) activity--were also countered by DHEA.","_input_hash":1989133896,"_task_hash":881718551,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":112,"end":115,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"study","start":131,"end":136,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rat","start":272,"end":275,"pattern":-569153227}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 2, 92"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189112,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

One male patient died of suicide (1.1%) and 18 (19.6%) individuals repeated parasuicide using self-poisoning. The rate of repeated parasuicidal behaviour in this investigation was considerably higher than that reported in comparable studies from developing countries but similar to that from a number of western European cities. The data indicated that the probability of further episodes of parasuicidal behaviour increased in the few months after the index episode. Although the repeaters and non-repeaters were essentially similar in most of their sociodemographic characteristics, the former were a distinctive group in many respects. The factors found to be significantly associated with subsequent parasuicide included self-poisoning by prescribed drugs at the index parasuicide, previous parasuicidal behaviour prior to the index, occupational status of a housewife, past history of depression and/or dependence and precipitating life events in the family environment. Contrary to our hypothesized theory, none of the types of attitudes received by the patients from their family members at the index parasuicide related to outcome. The global level of social readjustment of non-repeaters was about three times higher than that of repeaters of parasuicide. The implications of these findings for future policy making were discussed with respect to prevention of parasuicide.","_input_hash":1772618835,"_task_hash":-1470840335,"spans":[{"text":"cohort","start":107,"end":113,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"study","start":229,"end":234,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"history","start":1173,"end":1180,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"patients","start":1354,"end":1362,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"1, 2, 64, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189127,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Propionic acid (PPA) is a short chain fatty acid, a metabolic end-product of enteric bacteria in the gut, and a common food preservative. Recent evidence indicates that PPA can cause behavioral abnormalities and a neuroinflammatory response in rats. Social behavior was examined in similarly-treated pairs of adult male Long-Evans rats placed in an open field following intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of PPA (4 microl of 0.26 M solution) or control compounds. Behavior was analyzed using both the EthoVision behavior tracking system and by blind scoring of videotapes of social behaviors. Compared to controls, rats treated with PPA displayed social behavior impairments as indicated by significantly greater mean distance apart, reduced time spent in close proximity, reduced playful interaction, and altered responses to playful initiations. Treatment with another short chain fatty acid, sodium acetate, produced similar impairments, but treatment with the alcohol analog of PPA, 1-propanol, did not produce impairments. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue taken from rats treated with PPA revealed reactive astrogliosis, indicating a neuroinflammatory response. These findings suggest that PPA can change both brain and behavior in the laboratory rat in a manner that is consistent with symptoms of human ASD.","_input_hash":-940210917,"_task_hash":1379067809,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":147,"end":150,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"animal","start":172,"end":178,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"rat","start":1570,"end":1573,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"human","start":1622,"end":1627,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"92, 67, 92, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189188,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Change talk in session 4, and reduction in sustain talk from session 1 to 4, was positively associated with improvement, whilst sustain talk in session 4 showed a negative relationship.

Recently, several genetic variants of its key components, which may be clinically relevant and thus prove to be useful in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, have been described. We therefore investigated the association between ACE I/D, AGT M235T, and AT1 A1266C gene polymorphisms and early signs of target organ damage in 215 untreated patients with essential hypertension (EH).\tGenotyping was based on the polymerase chain reaction technique, with further restriction analysis when required. Albuminuria was measured as the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed by echocardiography (LVH = LVMI > or = 125 g/m2), carotid wall thickness (IMT) by an ultrasonographic (US) scan, and retinal vascular changes by direct ophthalmoscopy (Keith-Wagener classification).\tThe prevalence of microalbuminuria (Mi), LVH, and retinal vascular changes was 14, 46, and 74%, respectively. ACE, AGT, and AT1 genotype distribution was in agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no difference in age, duration of disease, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipid profile when data were analyzed on the basis of genotype. Serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were related to the ACE genotype (10.2 +/- 0.5, DD; 8.2 +/- 0.3, ID; 6.5 +/- 0.4 IU/mL, II; P < 0. 0001 by analysis of variance). The ACE genotype independently influences serum ACE levels and accounts for approximately 14% of its variations (F = 26.7, r2 = 0.1393, df 1 to 214, P < 0.0001). Patients with DD and ID genotypes showed higher levels of ACR (1.59 +/- 0.2, DD + ID; 0.8 +/- 0.2 mg/mmol, II; P < 0.006 by ANOVA) and bigger LVMI (124.1 +/- 2.3, DD + ID vs. 117.8 +/- 3.6 g/m2, II; P < 0.01 by ANOVA). No differences in the prevalence and degree of target organ damage (TOD) were found when data were analyzed on the basis of the AGT and AT1 genotypes, respectively. Potentially unfavorable combinations of genotypes were also investigated by K-means cluster analysis. Two subgroups of patients were identified (cluster 1, N = 70; cluster 2, N = 57), and each differed significantly with regards to the presence and degree of TOD and patterns of RAAS gene polymorphisms (F, 15.97 for ACR; F, 7.19 for IMT; F, 217.03 for LVMI; F, 3.91 for ACE; F, 4.06 for AGT; and F, 5. 22 for AT1; df 1 to 214, P < 0.02, for each one of the variables examined).\tThe D allele of the ACE gene may be an independent risk factor for the development of target organ damage, and evaluating it could be useful for assessing cardiovascular risk in EH. Unfavorable patterns of RAAS genotypes seem to predispose patients to subclinical cardiovascular disease in EH.","_input_hash":-1325661336,"_task_hash":-1659242938,"spans":[{"text":"vascular","start":240,"end":248,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"patients","start":603,"end":611,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"vascular","start":1004,"end":1012,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"classification","start":1061,"end":1075,"pattern":-756437862},{"text":"prevalence","start":1082,"end":1092,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"vascular","start":1136,"end":1144,"pattern":-60508792},{"text":"Patients","start":1786,"end":1794,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"prevalence","start":2027,"end":2037,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"patients","start":2289,"end":2297,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2889,"end":2897,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"66, 34, 66, 59, 53, 66, 34, 53, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189214,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Ninety-one percent of our sample was food insecure; 37% did not eat for an entire day in the past month. Those who did not eat for an entire day were more likely to report using alcohol, heroin, or cocaine before sex or exchanging sex for money compared to those who had at least a meal each day. From this pilot study, released prisoners appear to be at risk for food insecurity, and not eating for an entire day is associated with certain HIV risk behaviors. HIV prevention efforts should include longitudinal studies on the relationship between food insecurity and HIV risk behaviors among recently released prisoners.","_input_hash":-1958311956,"_task_hash":-566922190,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":110,"end":115,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"report","start":700,"end":706,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"study","start":848,"end":853,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"longitudinal","start":1034,"end":1046,"pattern":-959651259}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 36, 2, 52"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189234,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

{"pmid":"33076949","text":"Molecular brain^\nBrain transcriptome analysis reveals subtle effects on mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis of mutations in the SORL1 gene implicated in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease.^\nTo prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we must understand its molecular basis. The great majority of AD cases arise sporadically with a late onset after 65 years of age (LOAD). However, rare familial cases of AD can occur due to dominant mutations in a small number of genes that cause an early onset prior to 65 years of age (EOfAD). As EOfAD and LOAD share similar pathologies and disease progression, analysis of EOfAD genetic models may give insight into both subtypes of AD. Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) is genetically associated with both EOfAD and LOAD and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between both forms of AD. Currently, the role of SORL1 mutations in AD pathogenesis is unclear. To understand the molecular consequences of SORL1 mutation, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the orthologous gene in zebrafish. We generated an EOfAD-like mutation, V1482Afs, and a putatively null mutation, to investigate whether EOfAD-like mutations in sorl1 display haploinsufficiency by acting through loss-of-function mechanisms. We performed mRNA-sequencing on whole brains, comparing wild type fish with their siblings heterozygous for EOfAD-like or putatively loss-of-function mutations in sorl1, or transheterozygous for these mutations. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small number of differentially expressed genes due to the sorl1 genotypes. We also performed enrichment analysis on all detectable genes to obtain a more complete view on changes to gene expression by performing three methods of gene set enrichment analysis, then calculated an overall significance value using the harmonic mean p-value. This identified subtle effects on expression of genes involved in energy production, mRNA translation and mTORC1 signalling in both the EOfAD-like and null mutant brains, implying that these effects are due to sorl1 haploinsufficiency. Surprisingly, we also observed changes to expression of genes occurring only in the EOfAD-mutation carrier brains, suggesting gain-of-function effects. Transheterozygosity for the EOfAD-like and null mutations (i.e. lacking wild type sorl1), caused apparent effects on iron homeostasis and other transcriptome changes distinct from the single-mutation heterozygous fish. Our results provide insight into the possible early brain molecular effects of an EOfAD mutation in human SORL1. Differential effects of heterozygosity and complete loss of normal SORL1 expression are revealed.","_input_hash":260779980,"_task_hash":-66216490,"spans":[{"text":"genes","start":493,"end":498,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"fish","start":1358,"end":1362,"pattern":-741546164},{"text":"genes","start":1596,"end":1601,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"genes","start":1686,"end":1691,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"genes","start":1941,"end":1946,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"genes","start":2185,"end":2190,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"fish","start":2494,"end":2498,"pattern":-741546164},{"text":"human","start":2600,"end":2605,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"78, 100, 78, 78, 78, 78, 100, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189321,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

However, in the case of MTLE without hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, amygdalohippocampectomy is associated with decreased postoperative memory function. Hippocampal transection (HT) has been developed to overcome this problem. In HT the hippocampus is not removed; rather, the longitudinal hippocampal circuits of epileptic activities are disrupted by transection of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus. The present study describes a less invasive modification of HT (transsylvian HT) and presents the seizure and memory outcomes for this procedure.\tThirty-seven patients with MTLE (18 men and 19 women; age range 9-63 years; 19 with surgery on the right side and 18 with surgery on the left side; seizure onset from 3 to 34 years) who were treated with transsylvian HT were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had left-side language dominance, and follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 94 months (median 49 months). Seizure outcomes were evaluated for all patients by using the Engel classification.

Recent studies have demonstrated that several antagonists of NMDA receptors have important cardiovascular effects. In this study, we examined whether the cardiovascular effects of ACPC involve the role of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its antioxidant effect in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Male SHRSP were divided into two groups: a control group and an ACPC group administered ACPC at 50 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks by peritoneal injection. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mortality of stroke were significantly lower in the ACPC group than in the control group. Urinary Na(+) and Cl(-) excretion and plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were increased in the ACPC group. Western analysis detected proteins that were immunoreactive to anti-nitrotyrosine antibody and showed lower levels of expression in the cerebral cortex compared to that in the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was reduced in the ACPC group. Quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that administration of ACPC also significantly decreased the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA in the hippocampus and endotherial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA in the cerebral cortex, and drastically increased HO-1 mRNA in the cerebral cortex. Enhanced HO-1 staining on sections from the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was observed in the ACPC group. These data suggest that the normalization by ACPC of blood pressure elevation and mortality of stroke involves induction of the expression of HO-1, which exerts antioxidant and vascular relaxation effects, in SHRSP.","_input_hash":-626144822,"_task_hash":-1025688654,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":598,"end":603,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"vascular","start":2161,"end":2169,"pattern":-60508792}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 66"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189388,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

The present study aimed to examine 1) whether DAX-1 is expressed in human pituitary adenomas, and 2) if it is expressed, what types of adenoma express the factor.\tAdenoma tissues examined included 18 clinically non-functioning adenomas, 14 GH-secreting adenomas and 7 PRL-secreting adenomas. The expression of the following genes were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): DAX-1, Adrenal-4-binding protein/steroidogenic factor-1 (Ad4BP/SF-1), Pit-1, LH beta, FSH beta, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R), GH, PRL, and TSH beta, as well as beta-actin as a control.\tEleven clinically non-functioning adenomas expressed DAX-1, 10 of which also expressed Ad4BP/SF-1. Nine out of the 11 DAX-1 expressing adenomas also expressed LH beta, FSH beta and GnRH-R as well, indicating that these adenomas possessed gonadotrophic properties. Nine clinically non-functioning adenomas expressed Pit-1 as well as GH, PRL and/or TSH beta, thus having somatomammotrophic or thyrotrophic properties, 3 of which overlapped with the above DAX-1-expressing adenomas. One non-functioning adenoma expressed Ad4BP/SF1 and FSH beta but not DAX-1, and another one expressed DAX-1 and Ad4BP/SF-1 with PRL. On the other hand, all GH-secreting and PRL-secreting adenomas expressed Pit-1 and GH and/or PRL, but neither DAX-1 nor Ad4BP/SF-1.\tThe results shown here indicate that DAX-1 is expressed in the majority of human pituitary adenomas of gonadotrophic origin in parallel with Adrenal-4-binding protein/steroidogenic factor-1.","_input_hash":2073611289,"_task_hash":-796275410,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":74,"end":79,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"cells","start":221,"end":226,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"study","start":240,"end":245,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"human","start":296,"end":301,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"genes","start":552,"end":557,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"human","start":1657,"end":1662,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 70, 2, 0, 78, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189416,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

We have confirmed this positive effect of early multisensory rehabilitation on the recovery of motor functions after traumatic brain injury.

However, the pathological significance of CDK4 amplicon in GBM formation remains incompletely understood. In the current study, we show that co-expression of PIKE-A and CDK4 in TP53/PTEN double knockout GBM mouse model additively shortens the latency of glioma onset and survival compared to overexpression of these genes alone. Consequently, p-mTOR, p-Akt and p-ERK pathways are highly upregulated in the brain tumors, in alignment with their oncogenic activities by CDK4 and PIKE-A stably transfected in GBM cell lines.

Some associations, although sporadic, can be particularly challenging both in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management and in terms of theoretical perspective. Here, we report a child affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). The child was diagnosed with classical T1DM at 15 months of age, with a tendency toward hypoglycemia. A few months later, during an acute intercurrent infective episode, the child displayed acute hypotonia of the lower limbs and limbs dystonia. A brain MRI showed bilateral striatal necrosis, suggesting GA1 diagnosis. Treatment with a low-lysine dietary regimen and carnitine supplementation was started and resulted in an improvement in metabolic control and a reduction of hypoglycemic episodes along with an increasing in insulin daily dose.

Loss-of-function mutations in GEMIN5 lead to a neurodevelopmental syndrome among patients presenting with developmental delay, motor dysfunction, and cerebellar atrophy by perturbing SMN complex protein expression and assembly. Currently, molecular determinants of GEMIN5-mediated disease have yet to be explored. Here, we identified SMN as a genetic suppressor of GEMIN5-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo. We discovered that an increase in SMN expression by either SMN gene therapy replacement or the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), Nusinersen, significantly upregulated the endogenous levels of GEMIN5 in mammalian cells and mutant GEMIN5-derived iPSC neurons. Further, we identified a strong functional association between the expression patterns of SMN and GEMIN5 in patient Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)-derived motor neurons harboring loss-of-function mutations in the SMN gene. Interestingly, SMN binds to the C-terminus of GEMIN5 and requires the Tudor domain for GEMIN5 binding and expression regulation. Finally, we show that SMN upregulation ameliorates defective snRNP biogenesis and alternative splicing defects caused by loss of GEMIN5 in iPSC neurons and in vivo. Collectively, these studies indicate that SMN acts as a regulator of GEMIN5 expression and neuropathologies.","_input_hash":-409143650,"_task_hash":-1980046896,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":328,"end":336,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":723,"end":730,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"cells","start":866,"end":871,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 46, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189552,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

The swallowing ability was assessed using the Food Intake Level Scale (FILS). The FILS change was calculated by subtracting FILS at admission from FILS at discharge. Ultrasound images were acquired at admission using B-mode ultrasound imaging. Muscle mass and intramuscular adipose tissue of the quadriceps were assessed based on muscle thickness and echo intensity, respectively. The mean muscle thickness and echo intensity of the right and left quadriceps were used in the analysis. A multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors independently associated with the FILS at discharge and FILS change. The independent variables were the muscle thickness and echo intensity of the quadriceps, FILS at admission, age, sex, body mass index, days from stroke onset, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index, number of medications, unit number of rehabilitation therapy, and Barthel Index score at admission.\tMuscle thickness of the quadriceps was significantly and independently associated with FILS at discharge (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.27) and FILS change (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.40).

Because previous studies have largely been in chronic patients, it is not known whether these membrane abnormalities also occur early in illness. In the present study, red blood cell membrane fatty acid levels were determined by capillary gas chromatography from 24 neuroleptic-naive patients with first episode schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 31 age-matched normal controls. Relative to normal subjects, patients had significant reductions in total PUFA (-13%) but not in monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids. Specifically, significant reductions were found in arachidonic acid (-18%), docosapentaenoic acid (-36%), and docosahexaenoic acid (-26%) concentrations. These reductions were not related to age, gender, smoking status, or cotinine levels. These results confirm previous findings of membrane deficits in schizophrenia and show that significant PUFA reductions occur early in the illness, prior to initiation of treatment, raising the possibility that these deficits are trait related. The findings also suggest that membrane fatty acid losses are quite specific to the highly unsaturated fatty acids.","_input_hash":-232374319,"_task_hash":-1012358431,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":386,"end":394,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":493,"end":498,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":616,"end":624,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":751,"end":759,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 2, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189813,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Advances in neuroimaging have led to expanded application of these approaches to study term- and prematurely-born infants, providing improved understanding of cerebral development and the deleterious effects of early brain injury. Across both modalities, neuroimaging data are conducive to analyses ranging from characterization of individual white matter tracts and/or resting state networks through advanced 'connectome-style' approaches capable of identifying highly connected network hubs and investigating metrics of network topology such as modularity and small-worldness. We begin this review by summarizing the literature detailing structural and functional connectivity findings in healthy term and preterm infants without brain injury during the postnatal period, including discussion of early connectome development.

Group differences in cortical thickness and the age-by-group effects were assessed using vertex-by-vertex and multivariate linear models. The discriminatory ability of MRI variables in distinguishing patients from controls was estimated using the Concordance Statistics (C-statistic) within logistic regression analyses. Correlations between cortical thickness measures and disease progression rate were tested using the Pearson coefficient. Relative to controls, ALS patients showed a bilateral cortical thinning of the primary motor, prefrontal and ventral frontal cortices, cingulate gyrus, insula, superior and inferior temporal and parietal regions, and medial and lateral occipital areas. There was a significant age-by-group effect in the sensorimotor cortices bilaterally, suggesting a stronger association between age and cortical thinning in ALS patients compared to controls. The mean cortical thickness of the sensorimotor cortices distinguished patients with ALS from controls (C-statistic \u2265 0.74). Cortical thinning of the left sensorimotor cortices was related to a faster clinical progression (r = -0.33, p = 0.03).

We report the case of a patient receiving dabrafenib and trametinib for metastatic melanoma who developed intracranial hemorrhage while on therapy. Combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib improves progression-free survival of patients with BRAF V600-positive metastatic melanoma. Nevertheless, it is associated with an increased incidence and severity of any hemorrhagic event. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of intracranial hemorrhage with pathological confirmation.\tWe present the case of a 48-year-old man with metastatic melanoma of unknown primary site. He had metastases to the right clavicle, brain, liver, adrenal gland, and the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. He progressed on treatment with alpha-interferon. He was found to have a 4.5-cm mass in the left frontotemporal lobe and underwent gross total resection followed by adjuvant CyberKnife stereotactic irradiation. He was subsequently started on ipilimumab. Treatment was stopped due to kidney injury. He was then placed on dabrafenib and trametinib. He returned for follow-up complaining of severe headache and developed an episode of seizure. MRI showed a large area of edema at the left frontal lobe with midline shift. Emergency craniotomy was performed. Intracranial hemorrhage was found intra-operatively. Pathology from surgery did not find tumor cells, reported as organizing hemorrhage and necrosis with surrounding gliosis; immunohistochemistry for S100 and HMB45 were negative.\tThis case demonstrates the life-threatening adverse effects that can be seen with the newer targeted biological therapies. It is therefore crucial to maintain a high index of suspicion when patients on this combination therapy present with new neurologic symptoms.","_input_hash":1424846606,"_task_hash":1752320923,"spans":[{"text":"case","start":24,"end":28,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"case","start":40,"end":44,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"therapy","start":117,"end":124,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"therapy","start":163,"end":170,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":289,"end":297,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"report","start":412,"end":418,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"case","start":423,"end":427,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"therapy","start":548,"end":555,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"therapy","start":569,"end":576,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":646,"end":654,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"report","start":846,"end":852,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"case","start":927,"end":931,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"surgery","start":1741,"end":1748,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"cells","start":1768,"end":1773,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"case","start":1908,"end":1912,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"patients","start":2093,"end":2101,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":2122,"end":2129,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"35, 35, 46, 46, 34, 36, 35, 46, 46, 34, 36, 35, 49, 70, 35, 34, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-case-report"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708189844,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

It has been shown to produce medicinal effects against hyperactivity, agitation and mania, as well as schizophrenia. Long-term usage of haloperidol raises the risk of acquiring a neurological condition like Parkinson's disease. Haloperidol causes drug-induced Parkinsonism (DIP) by blocking central dopamine receptors and causing extrapyramidal symptoms during long-term treatment. Quercetin has been shown to reduce the loss of striatal neurons, which may enhance motor capabilities and protect against agents that cause the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a result, present study intended to evaluate the efficacy of quercetin on haloperidol-related motor abnormalities. To develop behavioral impairments, rats (n=24) randomly divided to control and haloperidol group for four weeks. The animals were split into four groups after four weeks: Control, quercetin, haloperidol and haloperidol + quercetin.

Based on our real-world experience in an academic medical center, we performed an economic analysis of a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients taking SSRIs on a course of acute and continuation treatment recommended by the American Psychiatric Association. We used standard costing of antidepressants, sildenafil, and unit costs for physician visits within a managed care environment and cost-of-illness methodology to calculate the annualized cost of depression for different treatment outcomes. After 6 months of SSRI treatment, the sildenafil add-on group had the lowest cost estimates compared with groups that discontinued SSRIs, substituted another SSRI (switching), or added a non-SSRI to the existing SSRI (augmentation). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the physician visit was the single most important cost component in this hypothetical population and relapse/remission the most costly outcome. Sildenafil can be a cost-effective add-on therapy to control SSRI-induced erectile dysfunction.

In contrast, cranial neuropathies related to pneumocephalus are extremely rare, with only a handful of previous reports.\tWe present the rare case of a right partial oculomotor mononeuropathy occurring in a 26-year-old woman 4 hours after a microvascular decompression of her right trigeminal nerve. Postoperative imaging revealed pneumocephalus in the interpeduncular cisterns with an air bubble close to the cisternal segment of the right oculomotor nerve, trapped by a fetal right posterior cerebral artery. The patient was placed on 100% Fio2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) and encouraged to remain in the Trendelenburg position. She was discharged with only modest improvement in her pupil-involved partial oculomotor palsy, but she improved over the course of clinical follow-up and her deficit had completely resolved at 6 months.\tCranial neuropathy secondary to pneumocephalus is a rare and usually self-limiting condition. Although high-concentration oxygen therapy hastens resolution of pneumocephalus, recovery from pneumocephalus-related neuropathies may take weeks to months.

These studies describe application of simultaneous high-speed video kinematics with multichannel electromyography (EMG) to characterize the movement disorder exhibited by tottering mutant mice. These mice provide a uniquely valuable model, because they exhibit paroxysmal dystonia superimposed on mild baseline ataxia, permitting the examination of these two different problems within the same animals. At baseline with mild ataxia, the mutants exhibited poorly coordinated movements with increased variation of stance and swing times, and slower spontaneous walking velocities. The corresponding EMG showed reduced mean amplitudes of biceps femoris and vastus lateralis, and poorly modulated EMG activities during the step cycle. Attacks of paroxysmal dystonia were preceded by trains of EMG bursts with doublets and triplets simultaneously in the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis followed by more sustained coactivation. These EMG characteristics are consistent with the clinical phenomenology of the motor phenotype of tottering mice as a baseline of mild ataxia with intermittent attacks of paroxysmal dystonia. The EMG characteristics of ataxia and dystonia in the tottering mice also are consistent with EMG studies of other ataxic or dystonic animals and humans. These studies provide insights into how these methods can be used for delineating movement disorders in mice and for how they may be compared with similar disorders of humans.","_input_hash":-672750849,"_task_hash":739258230,"spans":[{"text":"rodent","start":181,"end":187,"pattern":778946951},{"text":"mice","start":558,"end":562,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":570,"end":574,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1405,"end":1409,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1553,"end":1557,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1747,"end":1751,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"93, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708190061,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Despite its high morbidity and mortality, its underlying pathogenic mechanisms still remain poorly understood. Although there is increasing evidence for significant changes in the structure and function of synapses on motor neurons, there is a need for a systematic investigation of the role of each synapse subtype in the course of the disease. Here, we focus on large cholinergic synapses on motor neurons, known as C boutons, and investigate their role during ALS progression. We implement a genetic strategy for inactivation of the cholinergic output of C boutons in the SOD1[G93A] transgenic mouse model of ALS. We demonstrate that although C bouton cholinergic inactivation does not alter mouse survival, it exerts a beneficial effect on motor performance in the rotarod motor task, as evidenced by an increased latency to fall in SOD1[G93A] mice lacking C bouton cholinergic output. Our results suggest that C bouton cholinergic transmission exerts a negative effect on motor neuron function in ALS, possibly via aberrant excitation, and render C boutons a potential target for future pharmacological intervention.","_input_hash":44778611,"_task_hash":-703225328,"spans":[{"text":"Mouse","start":115,"end":120,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"systematic","start":579,"end":589,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"transgenic","start":910,"end":920,"pattern":-184412797},{"text":"mouse","start":921,"end":926,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mouse","start":1019,"end":1024,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"mice","start":1172,"end":1176,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"intervention","start":1432,"end":1444,"pattern":-2001382570}],"meta":{"pattern":"81, 6, 77, 81, 81, 82, 48"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708190072,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Approximately 30% of patients fail to respond to present therapies. Therefore, the search for novel antidepressant drugs continues.\tThe most prescribed antidepressants are serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, which only indirectly affect dopaminergic neurotransmission. As a consequence, residual symptoms remain, including impaired motivation and impaired pleasure. This article reviews the development of new broad-spectrum antidepressants, the triple reuptake inhibitors, which also increase brain dopamine levels.\tIn this review, a distinction is made between the subtypes of melancholic and atypical depressions and their associated brain abnormalities and dysfunctions in neurotransmitter systems. Subsequently, we propose a hypothetical model: 'the monoamine hypothesis revisited' to predict what kind of pharmacological treatment will be effective in the different subtypes of depression. It is expected that the triple reuptake inhibitors, inhibiting the reuptake of all three monoamines, can produce a greater efficacy than traditional antidepressants especially in atypical depression. Since triple reuptake inhibitors may also dampen states of hyperglutamatergic activity and subsequent excitotoxicity, it is suggested that these new drugs have a considerable neuroprotective potential in major depression, especially in melancholic depression.","_input_hash":-222400433,"_task_hash":1750469441,"spans":[{"text":"Expert","start":0,"end":6,"pattern":316071577},{"text":"patients","start":343,"end":351,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"review","start":883,"end":889,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"traditional","start":1391,"end":1402,"pattern":1983949530}],"meta":{"pattern":"11, 34, 4, 10"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708190197,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Xenon (Xe) is a general anesthetic with neuroprotective effects.\tHere, we investigate the neuroprotective role of Xe in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced white matter damage (WMD) model.\tThree-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham group (group A, n = 24), an LPS + HI group (group B, n = 24), and an LPS + HI + Xe group (group C, n = 72). The onset of Xe inhalation started at 0, 2, and 5 h in subgroups C1, C2, and C3, respectively. Next, we performed TUNEL and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining; and examined the expression of CLIC4 and Bcl-2 in brain tissues.\tHE staining revealed distorted cytoarchitecture, tangled nerve fibers, and pyknosis in group B, while Xe treatment improved these histological alterations in the group C pups. Following LPS and HI insult, the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased in group B at 48 and 72 h (p < 0.05), and Xe significantly alleviated apoptosis (p < 0.001) at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Similarly, CLIC4 mRNA expression was significantly increased in group B (p < 0.05), and Xe produced a marked reduction in CLIC4 mRNA expression in group C subgroups (p < 0.05). Western blotting demonstrated enhanced Bcl-2 expression in group C when compared to group B (p < 0.05).\tThese results demonstrate that LPS and HI successfully induced WMD, and Xe decreased neuronal apoptosis via Bcl-2- and CLIC4-mediated pathways. Moreover, the therapeutic time window of Xe extended for up to 5 h. These findings suggest that Xe can be used as a protective treatment for WMD in premature infants.","_input_hash":-609402721,"_task_hash":1053312000,"spans":[{"text":"randomly","start":455,"end":463,"pattern":985041104},{"text":"cells","start":1047,"end":1052,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1643,"end":1654,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"25, 70, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708190211,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Among the patients studied, 22 had been acutely exposed to CO while 8 were chronically exposed. One month after CO poisoning, 12 of the 22 patients with acute intoxication showed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities: 6 also had neurological sequelae and 6 were asymptomatic. The remaining 10 patients showed neither MRI abnormalities nor neurological sequelae. During the 3-year follow-up, 4 of the patients with both MRI abnormalities and neurological sequelae improved in both clinical features and MRI findings. One of the 6 asymptomatic patients with MRI abnormalities developed a progressive cognitive impairment 2 months after acute intoxication, with a concomitant severe worsening of the MRI lesions. Among the 10 patients with neither MRI abnormalities nor neurological sequelae, only 1 developed neurological sequelae after a clear period of 4 months. In the group of patients who experienced chronic CO intoxication, only 1 presented with a neuropsychiatric syndrome which improved at follow-up. Brain MRI showed white matter lesions which remained unchanged at control scan after 1 year. In conclusion, we observed that some patients with severe CO poisoning and neurological sequelae may fully regain normal functions after approximately 1 year. The presence of MRI lesions 1 month after CO poisoning did not accurately predict the subsequent outcome. The observation of a clear period longer than the usual 2-40 day interval in 2 patients should be considered for careful planning of follow-up and for prognosis in CO-poisoned patients.","_input_hash":-364016590,"_task_hash":1934958239,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":267,"end":275,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":322,"end":330,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":451,"end":459,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":614,"end":622,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":721,"end":729,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":863,"end":871,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1044,"end":1052,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1200,"end":1208,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1459,"end":1467,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1766,"end":1774,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1863,"end":1871,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708190247,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

Clinically the phenotypes are difficult to distinguish.\tThe objective was to determine and expand the phenotypic spectrum of KCS1 and KCS2 in order to anticipate complications that may arise in these disorders.\tWe clinically and genetically analyzed 10 KCS2 patients from 7 families. Because we found unusual phenotypes in our cohort, we performed a systematic review of genetically confirmed KCS cases using PubMed and Scopus. Evaluation by 3 researchers led to the inclusion of 26 papers for KCS1 and 16 for KCS2, totaling 205 patients. Data were extracted following the Cochrane guidelines and assessed by 2 independent researchers.\tSeveral patients in our KCS2 cohort presented with intellectual disability (3/10) and chronic kidney disease (6/10), which are not considered common findings in KCS2. Systematic review of all reported KCS cases showed that the phenotypes of KCS1 and KCS2 overlap for postnatal growth retardation (KCS1: 52/52, KCS2: 23/23), low parathyroid hormone levels (121/121, 16/20), electrolyte disturbances (139/139, 24/27), dental abnormalities (47/50, 15/16), ocular abnormalities (57/60, 22/23), and seizures/spasms (103/115, 13/16).

In this review, we will summarize the pathological understanding about AD and the related treatments, compare BBB and its effect on brain drug delivery under normal and AD conditions and review the nanotherapeutic strategies that have been developed for AD therapy in recent years.","_input_hash":500785399,"_task_hash":-1548296518,"spans":[{"text":"Therapeutic","start":0,"end":11,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"therapy","start":377,"end":384,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"review","start":543,"end":549,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"summarize","start":559,"end":568,"pattern":1982627683},{"text":"review","start":722,"end":728,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"therapy","start":792,"end":799,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"47, 46, 4, 8, 4, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708190314,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}
{"pmid":"22627142","text":"Neurobiology of disease^\nSubchronic ketamine treatment leads to permanent changes in EEG, cognition and the astrocytic glutamate transporter EAAT2 in mice.^\nKetamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with psychotomimetic, dissociative, amnestic and euphoric effects. When chronically abused, ketamine users display deficits in cognition and information processing, even following long-term abstinence from the drug. While animal studies have shown evidence of behavioral changes and cognitive deficits that mimic those seen in humans within the period immediately following subchronic ketamine, a few animal studies have assessed long-term changes following cessation of ketamine exposure. To this end, the present study assessed event related potentials (ERPs) and EEG oscillations in mice exposed to subchronic ketamine following a 6month period of abstinence from the drug. Ketamine-treated mice showed no change in P20, but did show marked reductions in amplitude of the later N40 and P80 components, consistent with previous studies of acute ketamine exposure. Additionally, ketamine-treated animals showed a significant reduction in stimulus evoked theta oscillations. To assess the functional significance of these changes, mice were also assessed on a series of behavioral and cognitive tests, including progressive ratio (motivation), extinction (behavioral flexibility) and win-shift radial maze (spatial memory). Subchronic ketamine produced marked disruptions in reversal learning and spatial memory. Analysis of brains from ketamine-treated mice failed to show evidence of neuronal degeneration as determined by NueN immunohistochemistry, but did show increased astrocyte proliferation and decreased expression of the glial specific glutamate transporter, GLT-1. These results strongly suggest: 1) that subchronic ketamine induces significant changes in brain function that long exceed exposure to the drug; 2) that ketamine exposure in mice induces lasting cognitive impairments closely resembling those observed in human ketamine abusers; 3) that ERP and EEG measures are highly sensitive to alterations in brain function associated with reduced cognitive function; and 4) that the brain changes induced by chronic ketamine treatment are suggestive of long-term adaptive or plastic, rather than degenerative, changes.","_input_hash":1131219927,"_task_hash":810828324,"spans":[{"text":"animal","start":419,"end":425,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"animal","start":598,"end":604,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"study","start":712,"end":717,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"mice","start":783,"end":787,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":891,"end":895,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1228,"end":1232,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1551,"end":1555,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1947,"end":1951,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"human","start":2027,"end":2032,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"67, 67, 2, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708190329,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

{"pmid":"18165968","text":"American journal of medical genetics. Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics^\nIdentification of pharmacogenetic markers in smoking cessation therapy.^\nPharmacogenetic clinical trials seek to identify genetic modifiers of treatment effects. When a trial has collected data on many potential genetic markers, a first step in analysis is to screen for evidence of pharmacogenetic effects by testing for treatment-by-marker interactions in a statistical model for the outcome of interest. This approach is potentially problematic because (i) individual significance tests can be overly sensitive, particularly when sample sizes are large; and (ii) standard significance tests fail to distinguish between markers that are likely, on biological grounds, to have an effect, and those that are not. One way to address these concerns is to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests [Berger (1985) Statistical decision theory and Bayesian analysis. New York: Springer; Kass and Raftery (1995) J Am Stat Assoc 90:773-795], which are typically more conservative than standard uncorrected frequentist tests, less conservative than multiplicity-corrected tests, and make explicit use of relevant biological information through specification of the prior distribution. In this article we use a Bayesian testing approach to screen a panel of genetic markers recorded in a randomized clinical trial of bupropion versus placebo for smoking cessation. From a panel of 59 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on 11 candidate genes, we identify four SNPs (one each on CHRNA5 and CHRNA2 and two on CHAT) that appear to have pharmacogenetic relevance. Of these, the SNP on CHRNA5 is most robust to specification of the prior. An unadjusted frequentist test identifies seven SNPs, including these four, none of which remains significant upon correction for multiplicity. In a panel of 43 randomly selected control SNPs, none is significant by either the Bayesian or the corrected frequentist test.","_input_hash":-206486819,"_task_hash":219377931,"spans":[{"text":"trials","start":251,"end":257,"pattern":1849967594},{"text":"trial","start":322,"end":327,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"randomized","start":1423,"end":1433,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"trial","start":1443,"end":1448,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"placebo","start":1469,"end":1476,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"genes","start":1582,"end":1587,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"randomly","start":1941,"end":1949,"pattern":985041104}],"meta":{"pattern":"75, 73, 18, 73, 14, 78, 25"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708190420,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

We aim to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke.\tStudies published up to 4 November 2022 on Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched. We included studies of adults with stroke, where depression was assessed at a prespecified time point. Studies excluding people with aphasia and history of depression are excluded. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme(CASP) cohort study tool was used to assess risk of bias. A total of 77 studies were included in the pooled estimates of the prevalence of poststroke depression (PSD). The overall prevalence of depression was 27% (95% CI 25 to 30). Prevalence of depression was 24% (95% CI 21 to 28) by clinical interview and 29% (95% CI 25 to 32) by rating scales. Twenty-four studies with more than one assessment time point reported the natural history of PSD. Among people who were depressed within 3 months of stroke, 53% (95% CI 47 to 59) experienced persistent depression, while 44% (95% CI 38 to 50) recovered. The incidence of later depression (3 to 12 months after stroke) was 9% (95% CI 7 to 12). The cumulative incidence during 1 year after stroke was 38% (95% CI 33 to 43), and the majority (71% (95% CI 65 to 76)) of depression had onset within 3 months after stroke. The main limitation of the present study is that excluding people in source studies with severe impairments may produce imprecise estimates of the prevalence of PSD.\tIn this study, we observed that stroke survivors with early-onset depression (within 3 months after stroke) are at high risks for remaining depressed and make up two-thirds of the incident cases during 1 year after stroke.

{"pmid":"1480765","text":"Progress in brain research^\nBrain banking and the human hypothalamus--factors to match for, pitfalls and potentials.^\nThe study of an increasing number of processes occurring in the human brain can be carried out on autopsy material. The availability of this material, whether fresh, frozen or fixed, makes it possible to develop methodologies for studying the neuroanatomical and neurochemical aspects of the human brain. It has also become possible in recent years to correlate functional changes with neurochemical changes and with neuroanatomical abnormalities in disease states. Some compounds and structures are damaged irreversibly within minutes after death and some brain components are known to disintegrate within seconds. This led to the widespread idea that autopsy material would not be suitable for basic research purposes and would not supply the necessary answers on the various fundamental questions regarding processes occurring in normal or diseased brain. However, from data published in recent years in which autopsy material has been routinely used, it becomes more and more evident that this is a misconception. There is an increasing number of reports based on the use of normal and pathological human brain tissue obtained by autopsies in spite of the fact that there is a worrying continuous decline in autopsy rate which causes serious concern among scientists world-wide (Anderson and Hill, 1989). It also became evident that when using the proper fixation procedures, sufficient structural integrity is retained in the tissue to allow morphological and morphometrical studies (Swaab and Uylings, 1988). Electron microscopic examination of synaptosomal preparations from post-mortem human brain showed them to be only slightly less pure than preparations from fresh tissue although there was some degree of damage (Hardy et al., 1982). Agonal state effects the stability of brain compounds and causes brain hypoxia. This again forms a tremendous difficulty for the study of human neurological and psychiatric diseases as one of the frequent causes of death is bronchopneumonia which leads to brain hypoxia and results in pronounced lactic acidosis. The Netherlands Brain Bank has succeeded to partly circumvent some of the serious problems encountered in providing human tissue for research by performing rapid autopsies with an average post-mortem delay of 2-4 h. This has become possible by a close collaboration of numerous nursing homes in Amsterdam and its vicinity and with the neuropathologists of the Free University in Amsterdam. We also measure the pH of the tissue as indicator of agonal state in order to reveal unsuitable specimens. The human hypothalamus contains various nuclei manifesting a wide variety of changes in different conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","_input_hash":1380506859,"_task_hash":1443784412,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":50,"end":55,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":122,"end":127,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"human","start":182,"end":187,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":410,"end":415,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":1221,"end":1226,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":1712,"end":1717,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":1994,"end":1999,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"human","start":2003,"end":2008,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":2294,"end":2299,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":2679,"end":2684,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708190481,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

The image-based degree of stenosis in the carotid artery and the plaque burden can be predicted using the automated carotid lumen diameter (LD)/inter-adventitial diameter (IAD) measurements from B-mode ultrasound images. The objective of this review is to present the state-of-the-art methods and systems for the measurement of LD/IAD in CCA based on automated or semi-automated strategies. Further, the performance of these systems is compared based on various metrics for its measurements.\tThe automated algorithms proposed for the segmentation of carotid lumen are broadly classified into two different categories as: region-based and boundary-based. These techniques are discussed in detail specifying their pros and cons. Further, we discuss the challenges encountered in the segmentation process along with its quantitative assessment. Lastly, we present stenosis quantification and risk stratification strategies.\tEven though, we have found more boundary-based approaches compared to region-based approaches in the literature, however, the region-based strategy yield more satisfactory performance. Novel risk stratification strategies are presented. On a patient database containing 203 patients, 9 patients are identified as high risk patients, whereas 27 patients are identified as medium risk patients.\tWe have presented different techniques for the lumen segmentation of the common carotid artery from B-mode ultrasound images and measurement of lumen diameter and inter-adventitial diameter.

The effect of ME10092 treatment (1-100 pmol/mouse) on nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, activation of expression of inflammatory mediators and production of nitric oxide were measured in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced brain inflammation model in mice in vivo. The antinociceptive activity of ME10092 was tested in the formalin-induced paw licking test. ME10092 dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, transcription of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements showed that ME10092 inhibited the LPS-induced increase in nitric oxide content in mouse brain tissue in a dose-dependent manner. In the formalin-induced paw licking test, ME10092 (at the dose of 3mg/kg, p.o. twice daily for eight days) significantly reduced nociceptive response.

However, there is a lack of literature in quantitative measures of motor control, which may potentially characterize the nature of the speech impairments in these children. This study investigated speech motor control in children with cerebral palsy (CP) using kinematic analysis.\tWe collected 10 children with mild spastic CP, aged 4.8 to 7.5 years, and 10 age-matched children with typical development (TD) from rehabilitation department at a tertiary hospital. All children underwent analysis of percentage of consonants correct (PCC) and kinematic analysis of speech tasks: poly-syllable (PS) and mono-syllable (MS) tasks using the Vicon Motion 370 system integrated with a digital camcorder. Kinematic parameters included spatiotemporal indexes (STIs), and average values and coefficients of variation (CVs) of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity. An ANOVA was conducted to determine whether PCC and kinematic data significantly differed between groups.\tCP group had relatively lower PCCs (80.0-99.0%) than TD group (p = 0.039). CP group had higher STIs in PS speech tasks, but not in MS tasks, than TD group did (p = 0.001). The CVs of utterance duration for MS and PS tasks of children with CP were at least three times as large as those of TD children (p < 0.01). However, average values of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity and CVs of other kinematic data for both tasks did not significantly differ between two groups.\tHigh STI values and high variability on utterance durations in children with CP reflect deficits in relative spatial and/or especially temporal control for speech in the CP participants compared to the TD participants. Children with mild spastic CP may have more difficulty in processing increased articulatory demands and resulted in greater oromotor variability than normal children. The kinematic data such as STIs can be used as indices for detection of speech motor control impairments in children with mild CP and assessment of the effectiveness in the treatment.","_input_hash":-1808520805,"_task_hash":265109998,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":127,"end":132,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"literature","start":317,"end":327,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"study","start":467,"end":472,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 5, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708190609,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57","_session_id":"2024-02-17_17-35-57"}

The stenoses observed in SCD-related proximal vasculopathy are progressive and can be detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD), a reliable, non-invasive and low-cost imaging method. High velocities (> 2 mls) are associated with a 40% risk of stroke within 36 months, but initiation of a transfusion program maintaining the HbS level under 30% reduces the risk to less than 2%. TCD must be performed in all children at 12-18 months of age to detect cerebral vasculopathy and prevent stroke. This approach has been adopted in our institution, based on a cohort of SCD newborns screened at birth: the risk of stroke was reduced from the expected 11% to less than 2% at 18 years.

Therefore, we herein investigated the relationship between SARC-F scores and functional outcomes in stroke patients. The primary outcome in the present study was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 3 months after stroke. The relationship between SARC-F scores and poor functional outcomes was examined using a logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the applicability of SARC-F scores to the assessment of poor functional outcomes was analyzed based on the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC). Eighty-one out of the 324 patients enrolled in the present study (25%) had poor functional outcomes (mRS \u2265 4). The results of the multivariate analysis revealed a correlation between SARC-F scores (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.05-1.59, p = 0.02) and poor functional outcomes. A cut-off SARC-F score \u2265 4 had low-to-moderate sensitivity (47.4%) and high specificity (87.3%). The present results suggest that the measurement of pre-stroke SARC-F scores is useful for predicting the outcomes of stroke patients.","_input_hash":650024014,"_task_hash":603615542,"spans":[{"text":"Cohort","start":147,"end":153,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"patients","start":404,"end":412,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":449,"end":454,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":826,"end":834,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":859,"end":864,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"score","start":1086,"end":1091,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"patients","start":1291,"end":1299,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"1, 34, 2, 34, 2, 60, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708242025,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

To assess the relation between intra-individual variability of systolic orthostatic blood pressure change (DeltaSBP) and cardiovascular outcomes, an algorithm was developed to identify DeltaSBP instability using repeated supine and standing BP measurements. A cohort of 673 nursing home residents underwent baseline postural BP measurements (supine to 1 minute of standing, four times in a single day) and were followed for up to 2 years. Two groups (stable vs. unstable) were identified based on an analysis of DeltaSBP variance components. Differences in outcomes were compared via Cox survival analysis. At baseline 12.6% were unstable, defined as a one standard deviation difference of at least 20.2 mmHg between DeltaSBP readings. Unstable subjects were more likely to have OH on at least one measurement (systolic BP drop of 20 mmHg or more; 85% vs. 36%, respectively) and to be on psychotropic medication at baseline (47% vs 35%) (P-values <0.001). Other characteristics (including previous stroke) did not differ. During a mean follow-up of 10.3 months, stroke incidence was higher in unstable subjects (13.1% vs. 4.9%; P = 0.012), but ischemic heart disease and mortality rates were not significantly different (respectively, 13.5% vs. 7.4%, P = 0.115; 14.8% vs. 10.7%, P = 0.178). Survival analyses (adjusted for age, sex, psychotropic medications, body mass index, ischemic heart disease, and supine systolic pressure) confirmed a higher risk of stroke in unstable subjects (relative risk = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.6-8.4). Highly variable orthostatic BP measures may reflect impaired BP regulatory mechanisms in elders with occult cerebrovascular disease, or may directly affect cerebral blood flow. Orthostatic BP variability may be a better indicator of future stroke than a single supine or orthostatic change measure.","_input_hash":1744491357,"_task_hash":91804224,"spans":[{"text":"cohort","start":557,"end":563,"pattern":1717037299}],"meta":{"pattern":"1"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708242076,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Psychopathology, medical management and dental implications.^\nMajor depressive disorder, or MDD, is a psychiatric illness in which mood, thoughts and behavioral patterns are impaired for long periods. The illness distresses the person and impairs his or her social functioning and quality of life. MDD is characterized by marked sadness or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, and is accompanied by weight change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, physical impairment and a high suicide rate. In 2000, the World Health Organization, or WHO, identified MDD as the fourth ranked cause of disability and premature death in the world. WHO projected that by 2020, MDD would rise in disease burden to be second only to ischemic heart disease. The disorder is common in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence rate of 17 percent and a recurrence rate of more than 50 percent.\tMDD may be associated with extensive dental disease, and people may seek dental treatment before becoming aware of their psychiatric illness. MDD frequently is associated with a disinterest in performing appropriate oral hygiene techniques, a cariogenic diet, diminished salivary flow, rampant dental caries, advanced periodontal disease and oral dysesthesias. Many medications used to treat the disease magnify the xerostomia and increase the incidence of dental disease. Appropriate dental management requires a vigorous dental education program, the use of saliva substitutes and anticaries agents containing fluoride, and special precautions when prescribing or administering analgesics and local anesthetics.\tDentists cognizant of these signs and symptoms have an opportunity to recognize patients with occult MDD. After confirmation of the diagnosis and institution of treatment by a mental health practitioner, dentists usually can provide a full range of services that may enhance patients' self-esteem and contribute to the psychotherapeutic aspect of management.","_input_hash":1225142716,"_task_hash":-161045810,"spans":[{"text":"prevalence","start":911,"end":921,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"patients","start":1782,"end":1790,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1834,"end":1843,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"patients","start":1977,"end":1985,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"53, 34, 56, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708242133,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

This study investigated the vasodilator and neuroprotective effects of darbepoetin alpha on an experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage model and compared it with erythropoietin.\tForty adult male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups of ten rabbits each: group 1 (control), group 2 (subarachnoid hemorrhage), group 3 (erythropoietin), and group 4 (darbepoetin alpha). Recombinant human erythropoietin was administered at a dose of 1,000\u00a0U/kg intraperitoneally after the induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage and continued every 8\u00a0h up to 72\u00a0h. Darbepoetin alpha was administered at a single intraperitoneal dose of 30\u00a0\u03bcg/kg. Animals were killed 72\u00a0h after subarachnoid hemorrhage.

For this retrospective analysis, 42 women and 42 men from the Innsbruck RLS database matched by age and therapy were included. Demographic data as well as different severity scales (IRLS, RLS-6 and CGI) were evaluated. Laboratory parameters included several indicators of serum iron status. In all patients, polysomnography was performed according to the AASM guidelines, and periodic leg movements during sleep were scored according to the AASM criteria. IRLS, RLS-6 and CGI revealed more severe symptoms in women (IRLS median [range]: 17.5 [0-35] versus 13.5 [0-32], p = 0.028; RLS-6 median [range]: 18 [0-39] versus 12 [1-42], p = 0.014).

Dementia is most prevalent of all. In general scenario, a dementia patient lacks proper guidance in searching out the way to return back at his/her home. Thus, increasing the risk of getting damaged at individual-health level. Therefore, it is important to track their movement in more sophisticated manner as possible. With emergence of wearables, GPS sensors and Internet of Things (IoT), such devices have become available in public domain. Smartphone apps support caregiver to locate the dementia patients in real-time. RF, GSM, 3G, Wi-Fi and 4G technology fill the communication gap between patient and caregiver to bring them closer. In this paper, we incorporated 7 most popular wearables for investigation to seek appropriateness for dementia tracking in recent times in systematic manners. We performed an in-depth review of these wearables as per the cost, technology wise and application wise characteristics. A case novel study i.e. IoT-based Force Sensor Resistance enabled System-FSRIoT, has been proposed and implemented to validate the effectiveness of IoT in the domain of smarter dementia patient tracking in wearable form factor. The results show promising aspect of a whole new notion to leverage efficient assistive physio-medical healthcare to the dementia patients and the affected family members to reduce life risks and achieve a better social life.","_input_hash":-844283681,"_task_hash":320159725,"spans":[{"text":"Systematic","start":30,"end":40,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"Review","start":41,"end":47,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"patients","start":720,"end":728,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"systematic","start":998,"end":1008,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"review","start":1043,"end":1049,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"case","start":1142,"end":1146,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"study","start":1153,"end":1158,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":1498,"end":1506,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"6, 4, 34, 6, 4, 35, 2, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708242204,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Neurocognitive dual-process models attribute substance use disorders and risk behaviours during adolescence to an imbalance between an overactivated affective-automatic system (involved in motivational and affective processing) and a reflective system (involved in cognitive inhibitory control). The aim of the present study was to investigate at the electrophysiological level the degree to which the motivational value of alcohol-related stimuli modulates the inhibition of a prepotent response in binge drinkers. First-year university students (n = 151, 54 % females) classified as binge drinkers (n = 71, \u22656 binge drinking episodes, defined as 5/7 standard drinks per occasion in the last 180 days) and controls (n = 80, <6 binge drinking episodes in the last 180 days) performed a beverage Go/NoGo task (pictures of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks were presented according to the condition as Go or NoGo stimuli; Go probability = 0.75) during event-related potential recording. In binge drinkers but not controls, the amplitude of the anterior N2-NoGo was larger in response to nonalcohol than in response to alcohol pictures. No behavioural difference in task performance was observed. In terms of dual-process models, binge drinkers may require increased activation to monitor conflict in order to compensate for overactivation of the affective-automatic system caused by alcohol-related bias.","_input_hash":-155647871,"_task_hash":893682708,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":602,"end":607,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708242222,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Increased PLS3 levels suppress symptoms in a subset of SMA patients and ameliorate defects in SMA disease models, but the functional connection between PLS3 and SMN is poorly understood.\tWe provide immunohistochemical and biochemical evidence for large protein complexes localized in vertebrate motor neuron processes that contain PLS3, SMN, and members of the hnRNP F/H family of proteins. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) SMA model, we determine that overexpression of PLS3 or loss of the C. elegans hnRNP F/H ortholog SYM-2 enhances endocytic function and ameliorates neuromuscular defects caused by decreased SMN-1 levels. Furthermore, either increasing PLS3 or decreasing SYM-2 levels suppresses defects in a C. elegans ALS model.\tWe propose that hnRNP F/H act in the same protein complex as PLS3 and SMN and that the function of this complex is critical for endocytic pathways, suggesting that hnRNP F/H proteins could be potential targets for therapy development.","_input_hash":327059584,"_task_hash":784056794,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":539,"end":547,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":1441,"end":1448,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708242359,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Based on these techniques, we conducted major and minor psoas muscle phenol block (motor point block or intramuscular nerve block) under ultrasonic monitoring. Phenol block was conducted in nine patients with cerebral infarction (13 blocking procedures) and three with spinal cord injuries (six blocking procedures) while keeping them in a lateral position with the operation side upside. The beginning of the femoral nerves and part of the lumbar artery were visualized by ultrasound in some patients. As a result of the improvement of hip flexor spasticity, the range of hip joint motion (determined by the Mundale technique, prone hip extension and Thomas test) improved shortly after blocking. When physical therapy was conducted after blocking, improvement of skin care management was observed in eight cases, ability to keep in a stable sitting position in nine, improvement of a standing posture in three, increases in the ability to walk in two and alleviation of pain in three.

Over half (257, 57%) of the patients were symptomatic. A variety of stents were implanted percutaneously after predilation of the lesion; a third of the patients received glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa inhibitors intraprocedurally in addition to a standard oral antiplatelet regimen (aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel). Occurrence and management of neurological complications within the 30-day periprocedural period were reviewed.\tThere were 14 (3.1%) transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), 10 (2.2%) minor strokes, and 3 (0.7%) major strokes. Among 6 (1.3%) procedure-related deaths, 4 had neurological causes. The total stroke and death rate was 4.2% (n = 19). All the TIAs, 4 of which occurred between 1 and 14 days poststenting, were treated medically, as were the minor strokes, 3 of which occurred >24 hours after stenting. Only 2 minor stroke patients had mild residual upper extremity motor deficits. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy was administered in 5 cases (2 major strokes survivors and 3 patients who suffered a neurologically-related death); occlusions were identified in the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 3 and the distal MCA in 2. Angiographic improvement was noted in 4 (80%), but only the 2 (40%) with distal MCA occlusions did well clinically.\tNeurological complications following carotid artery stenting are inevitable.

A technical description and initial results.^\nThis study aimed to propose an alternative treatment for carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) using the balloon-assisted sinus coiling (BASC) technique and to describe this procedure in detail. Under general anesthesia, we performed the BASC procedure to treat five patients with traumatic CCF. Percutaneous access was obtained via the right femoral artery, and a 7F sheath was inserted, or alternatively, a bifemoral 6F approach was accomplished. A microcatheter was inserted into the cavernous sinus over a 0.014-inch microwire through the fistulous point; the microcatheter was placed distal from the fistula point, and a 'U-turn' maneuver was performed. Through the same carotid access, a compliant balloon was advanced to cross the point of the fistula and cover the whole carotid tear. Large coils were inserted using the microcatheter in the cavernous sinus. Coils filled the adjacent cavernous sinus, respecting the balloon. Immediate complete angiographic resolution was achieved, and an early angiographic control (mean = 2.6 months) indicated complete stability without recanalization. The clinical follow-up has been uneventful without any recurrence (mean = 15.2 months). An endovascular approach is optimal for direct CCF. Because the detachable balloon has been withdrawn from the market, covered stenting requires antiplatelet therapy and its patency is unconfirmed, but cavernous sinus coiling remains an excellent treatment option. Currently, there is no detailed description of the BASC procedure. We provide detailed angiograms with suitable descriptions of the exact fistula point, and venous drainage pathways. Familiarity with these devices makes this technique effective, easy and safe.","_input_hash":-1723248098,"_task_hash":-708148433,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":272,"end":277,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":528,"end":536,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"therapy","start":1605,"end":1612,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 34, 46"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708242523,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

However, few studies have clearly discussed the protective effects and potential mechanism of PIP in different neurological diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of PIP against 3-nitropropioninc acid (3-NP) induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in animals.Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered control group, received normal saline (p.o.). Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg.b.wt., i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received PIP (10 mg/kg.b.wt., p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP injection. Upon termination of treatment schedule, behavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes. The brain striatal tissue was used for the estimation of monoamine oxidase activity and serotonin level. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by GFAP immunostaining.Results: Our results showed that 3-NP induced behavioral impairments are attenuated by PIP co-treatment. Next, the extent of neuronal loss and astrocytes activation was reduced in the striatal brain region in PIP treated rats. Finally, it was observed that PIP alleviated the behavioral, biochemical, immunohistochemical and histological alterations.Conclusion: The results of the current study reveal the neuroprotective competency of PIP against Huntington disease like symptoms in rats.","_input_hash":-1855553202,"_task_hash":59546905,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":485,"end":490,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"randomly","start":701,"end":709,"pattern":985041104},{"text":"study","start":1692,"end":1697,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 25, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708242733,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Transient global ischemia was produced by four vessel-occlusion, the occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries following the electrocautherization of the vertebral arteries. 3mg/kg of PPS or 300IU/kg of dalteparin was administered i.v. immediately after 7min-occlusion/reperfusion. Seven days after the operation, the animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and paraffinized coronal brain sections measuring 6microm in thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Neuronal damage was then estimated as a ratio of the number of degenerated neurons to that of both the surviving and degenerated neurons in three distinct area of the CA1 subfield. The ratio of neuronal death increased with the length of the occlusion-time, at 5, 7 and 10min. Both PPS and dalteparin significantly inhibited the neuronal damage induced by 7min-occlusion.

{"pmid":"2744979","text":"The International journal of social psychiatry^\nA normality for us without confinement for them: notes on the associations of families of the mentally ill.^\nAssociations of families of the mentally ill arose in Italy in the early 1980s mainly in the country's northern and central regions. They denounced the inadequacies of an extramural service conceived of as an out-patient clinic filling the void left by the shutting down of asylums. The positions elaborated by these associations focus on four main themes: the distribution of the 'burden of care' for the ill between services and families; the ill-conceived interpretation of the families' needs owing to the professional's alleged tendency to 'point the finger of guilt' at the families themselves; the demand for greater power in regard to decisions made by the services; the interaction with the rights and liberties of the mentally ill. Two different ranges of problems are discussed. First, there is the conflict within the family between the interests and rights of its income-producing and its 'dependent' members. This conflict points not to a loss but to an overload of functions shifted to the family at a time of rising expectations for the satisfaction of needs. It therefore calls for services of a new kind, i.e. services capable of making these conflicting interests and rights compatible. Second, extramural services either reject or misinterpret the asylum's labour-saving function. These services thus ascribe care for the material life of the mentally ill to the family's own resources alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","_input_hash":-930979990,"_task_hash":-999337863,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708242846,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}
{"pmid":"15680341","text":"Brain research^\nThe effect of central cholinergic and noradrenergic denervation on hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth and apoptosis-like reactivity in the rat.^\nIn this study, the effect of intraseptal injection of specific cholinotoxin 192-IgG saporin (SAP) +/- intraperitoneal injection of N-[chloroethyl]-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) (noradrenergic fiber neurotoxin) was examined in rat hippocampus. Medial septal lesions resulted not only in selective cholinergic denervation of hippocampus (Medial septal lesion + ganglionectomy; SAP + Gx) but also in hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth (IG) of adrenergic fibers (Medial septal lesion + sham ganglionectomy; SAP + IG). Saporin-induced septal lesions produced a significant reduction in hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity in all tested groups (SAP + IG +/- DSP-4 and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4), and an increase in noradrenaline concentration in the SAP + IG group. Visualization of noradrenergic fibers by histofluorescence revealed a mixture of fine and thick varicosities in the SAP + IG but only fine fibers in control and SAP + Gx animals. SAP + IG + DSP-4 lesions produced significant reduction in noradrenaline concentration in all groups with a concomitant decrease in visualization of central noradrenergic fibers in dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Treatment of SAP + IG animals with DSP-4 left mostly thick fibers, probably derived from peripheral sympathetic ingrowth. No fluorescence was seen in either the control + DSP-4 or SAP + Gx + DSP-4 animals. Apoptotic-like changes, using in situ oligonucleotide ligation techniques, were also assessed. Proapoptotic changes were seen in the SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 group as compared to CON +/- DSP-4 groups. SAP + IG regardless of DSP-4 treatment protected hippocampal cells from apoptotic cell death when compared to positive control and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 groups. In summary, elevated noradrenaline concentration following specific cholinergic denervation probably reflects compensatory hippocampal ingrowth originating from the peripheral sympathetic system which may be responsible for neuroprotective effects, i.e., antiapoptosis-like effect. Since cholinergic and noradrenergic systems are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive function, knowing how these neurotransmitters work after specific lesions may be of importance as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease and as a potential target for Alzheimer's disease drug therapies.","_input_hash":-1882690228,"_task_hash":219038981,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":167,"end":172,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"rat","start":390,"end":393,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"cells","start":1780,"end":1785,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"summary","start":1880,"end":1887,"pattern":915282476},{"text":"animal","start":2374,"end":2380,"pattern":-1575063083}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 92, 70, 9, 67"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708242888,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

No articles have contested the concept, apart from 3 published 13-18 yr ago. This review describes very recent studies on the role of HSV1 but refers also to older studies that provide background for some lesser-known related topics not covered in other recent reviews; these include the relevance of herpes simplex encephalitis and of epilepsy to AD, the action of IFN, and the possible relevance of the different types of DNA damage to AD-in particular, those caused by HSV1-and mechanisms of repair of damage.

Consecutive women referred for suspected OSA and free of previous stroke and CHD were analyzed. Women with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) less than 10 comprised the control group, and those with an AHI greater than or equal to 10 were diagnosed with OSA and classified as CPAP-treated (adherence \u2265 4 h/d) or untreated (adherence < 4 h/d or not prescribed). The follow-up ended in December 2010.\tA total of 967 women were studied (median follow-up, 6.8 yr; interquartile range, 5.2-8.2). The untreated OSA group showed a greater incidence rate of the composite outcome than the control group (2.19 vs. 0.54 per 100 person-years; P < 0.0005). Compared with the control group, the fully adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome incidence were 2.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-5.62) for the untreated OSA group, and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.43-1.95) for the CPAP-treated group.

Build upon successful deep learning techniques, a novel brain tumor segmentation method is developed by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in a unified framework to obtain segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency. We train a deep learning based segmentation model using 2D image patches and image slices in following steps: 1) training FCNNs using image patches; 2) training CRFs as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) using image slices with parameters of FCNNs fixed; and 3) fine-tuning the FCNNs and the CRF-RNN using image slices. Particularly, we train 3 segmentation models using 2D image patches and slices obtained in axial, coronal and sagittal views respectively, and combine them to segment brain tumors using a voting based fusion strategy. Our method could segment brain images slice-by-slice, much faster than those based on image patches. We have evaluated our method based on imaging data provided by the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) 2013, BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method could build a segmentation model with Flair, T1c, and T2 scans and achieve competitive performance as those built with Flair, T1, T1c, and T2 scans.","_input_hash":-385464327,"_task_hash":1869855299,"spans":[{"text":"diagnosis","start":185,"end":194,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"Random","start":426,"end":432,"pattern":-1722231267}],"meta":{"pattern":"56, 24"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243021,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Patient satisfaction after the complicated, high-risk and irreversible procedure of sex change treatment is variously assessed. Recently, there have been reports on successful psychotherapeutic treatment of transsexuals resulting in the preservation of the biologically given sex. In the present article, attention is drawn to the sociocultural change in transsexualism throughout the course of history, to the hypotheses resulting from research into causes, and to diagnostic criteria and therapeutic approaches.","_input_hash":92625509,"_task_hash":240550983,"spans":[{"text":"history","start":971,"end":978,"pattern":-1634665066},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1042,"end":1052,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1066,"end":1077,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"64, 55, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243167,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Here we demonstrate that recombinant Ii proteins with the CLIP region replaced by antigenic self-epitopes are highly efficient in activating and silencing specific T cells in vitro and in vivo. The Ii proteins require endogenous processing by antigen-presenting cells for efficient T cell activation. An Ii protein encompassing the epitope myelin basic protein amino acids 84-96 (Ii-MBP84-96) induced the model autoimmune disease experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) with a higher severity and earlier onset than the peptide. When applied in a tolerogenic manner, Ii-MBP84-96 abolished antigen-specific T cell proliferation and suppressed peptide-induced EAE more effectively than peptide alone. Importantly, i.v. administration of Ii proteins after EAE induction completely abrogated the disease, whereas peptides only marginally suppressed disease symptoms. Ii fusion proteins are thus more efficient than peptide in modulating CD4(+) T cell-mediated autoimmunity, documenting their superior qualities for therapeutic antigen delivery in vivo.","_input_hash":1107079867,"_task_hash":-1077138851,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":501,"end":506,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":597,"end":602,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1352,"end":1363,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 70, 47"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243291,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

We performed a meta-analysis of published case-control and cohort studies exploring lead compound exposure and brain tumor risk. (2) Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase[\u00ae], and Cochrane to find eligible studies. Eighteen studies were selected for assessment of occupational exposure to lead compound and brain tumor. Pooled estimates of odds ratios (ORs) were obtained using random effects models. We assessed the differences through subgroup analysis according to tumor type, study design, measurements of exposure, and tumor outcome. Statistical tests for publication bias, heterogeneity, and sensitivity analysis were applied. (3) Results: Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed a not significant association with lead exposure and risk of benign and malignant brain tumors (pooled OR = 1.11, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.95-1.29). Including only malignant brain tumors, the risk of brain tumor was significantly increased (pooled OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.24).

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of aminocaproic acid (AMICAR), an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, on all hemorrhagic complications of ECMO including intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In 1990, 49 neonates and 5 older children received ECMO therapy. None of these patients received AMICAR. In 1991, 51 neonates and 5 older children received ECMO. Forty-two of these patients who were considered to be at high risk for bleeding complications (preexisting or anticipated surgical procedures, preexisting ICH, or profound hypoxia, acidosis, coagulopathy, or prematurity) were given AMICAR. The remaining 14 low-risk neonates did not receive AMICAR, and for purposes of analysis were combined with the 1990 group. AMICAR was administered just prior to or after cannulation (100 mg/kg, intravenously) and was infused continuously at 30 mg/kg/h until decannulation. Except for the addition of AMICAR, the ECMO protocol was identical for these two patient groups. Patients who received AMICAR had significantly less bleeding while on ECMO (P = .03) and required fewer blood transfusions (P = .01) than patients not receiving AMICAR. This difference was most significant in the congenital diaphragmatic hernia and cardiac subgroups (P = .0001) and was not significant in the meconium aspiration subgroup (P = .1). The incidence of ICH in the neonatal subgroup was also significantly reduced with no patient on AMICAR developing a new or extending a preexisting ICH (P = .007). Reexploration of the cannulation site for bleeding was also reduced in the AMICAR-treated group but the difference failed to reach statistical significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","_input_hash":-1897671263,"_task_hash":1357618021,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":289,"end":294,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"therapy","start":532,"end":539,"pattern":-227782321},{"text":"patients","start":555,"end":563,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":657,"end":665,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"Patients","start":1248,"end":1256,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1386,"end":1394,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 46, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243358,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Pelvic ischemia is a complication of the technique, but reports vary as to the rate and severity. This study reports our experience with IIA embolization and compares the results to those of other published series. The vascular unit database of the Leicester Royal Infirmary was used to identify patients who had undergone IIA coil embolization prior to EVAR. Data were collected from hospital case notes and by telephone interviews. Thirty-eight patients were identified; 29 of these were contactable by telephone. A literature search was performed for other studies of IIA embolization and the results were pooled. In this series buttock claudication occurred in 55% (16 of 29 patients) overall: in 52% of unilateral embolizations (11 of 21) and 63% of bilateral embolizations (5 of 8). New erectile dysfunction occurred in 46% (6 of 13 patients) overall: in 38% of unilateral embolizations (3 of 8) and 60% of bilateral embolizations (3 of 5). The literature review identified 18 relevant studies. The results were pooled with our results, to give 634 patients in total. Buttock claudication occurred in 28% overall (178 of 634 patients): in 31% of unilateral embolizations (99 of 322) and 35% of bilateral embolizations (34 of 98) (p = 0.46, Fisher's exact test). New erectile dysfunction occurred in 17% overall (27 of 159 patients): in 17% of unilateral embolizations (16 of 97) and 24% of bilateral embolizations (9 of 38) (p = 0.33).

PDD participants' baseline neuropsychological test scores were compared to the baseline performance of 18 patients with PD who did not meet criteria for dementia at one-year follow-up (PDND) and 18 normal controls (NC). The three groups were matched on baseline demographic and disease variables. Relative to the PDND group, the incident PDD participants demonstrated significantly poorer performance on digits backward (Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised), word list learning and recognition (California Verbal Learning Test), and perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Each of these baseline neuropsychological variables exhibited adequate diagnostic classification accuracy in predicting PDD and PDND group membership at follow-up. These results suggest that subtle frontal/executive dysfunction is evident during the immediate PDD prodrome and may be of prognostic value in identifying PD patients at risk for dementia.

{"pmid":"32665027","text":"Acta neuropathologica communications^\nThe unfolded protein response is activated in the olfactory system in Alzheimer's disease.^\nOlfactory dysfunction is an early and prevalent symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the olfactory bulb is a nexus of beta-amyloid plaque and tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during early AD progression. To mitigate the accumulation of misfolded proteins, an endoplasmic reticulum stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) occurs in the AD hippocampus. However, chronic UPR activation can lead to apoptosis and the upregulation of beta-amyloid and tau production. Therefore, UPR activation in the olfactory system could be one of the first changes in AD. In this study, we investigated whether two proteins that signal UPR activation are expressed in the olfactory system of AD cases with low or high amounts of aggregate pathology. We used immunohistochemistry to label two markers of UPR activation (p-PERK and p-eIF2\u03b1) concomitantly with neuronal markers (NeuN and PGP9.5) and pathology markers (beta-amyloid and tau) in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex and the CA1 region of the hippocampus in AD and normal cases. We show that UPR activation, as indicated by p-PERK and p-eIF2\u03b1 expression, is significantly increased throughout the olfactory system in AD cases with low (Braak stage III-IV) and high-level (Braak stage V-VI) pathology. We further show that UPR activation occurs in the mitral cells and in the anterior olfactory nucleus of the olfactory bulb where tau and amyloid pathology is abundant. However, UPR activation is not present in neurons when they contain NFTs and only rarely occurs in neurons containing diffuse tau aggregates. We conclude that UPR activation is prevalent in all regions of the olfactory system and support previous findings suggesting that UPR activation likely precedes NFT formation. Our data indicate that chronic UPR activation in the olfactory system might contribute to the olfactory dysfunction that occurs early in the pathogenesis of AD.","_input_hash":-242283671,"_task_hash":-949150132,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":723,"end":728,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"cells","start":1480,"end":1485,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243471,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Transduction by oncogenic lentiviral vectors of neural stem cells (NSCs), astrocytes, or even mature neurons in the brains of mice can give rise to malignant gliomas. All the tumors, irrespective of the site of lentiviral vector injection (the initiating population), shared common features of high expression of stem or progenitor markers and low expression of differentiation markers. Microarray analysis revealed that tumors of astrocytic and neuronal origin match the mesenchymal GBM subtype. We propose that most differentiated cells in the CNS upon defined genetic alterations undergo dedifferentiation to generate a NSC or progenitor state to initiate and maintain the tumor progression, as well as to give rise to the heterogeneous populations observed in malignant gliomas.","_input_hash":-995466729,"_task_hash":-1251518732,"spans":[{"text":"cells","start":277,"end":282,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"cells","start":408,"end":413,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"mice","start":474,"end":478,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"cells","start":881,"end":886,"pattern":-2101317411}],"meta":{"pattern":"70, 70, 82, 70"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243491,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

We investigated the relationship between cigarette/nicotine dependence and co-use of tobacco and cannabis among 4 groups of cigarette smokers aged 18-35: cigarette-only smokers, cigarette-e-cigarette (CIG-ECIG) co-users, cigarette-cannabis (CIG-CAN) co-users, and cigarette-e-cigarette-cannabis (CIG-ECIG-CAN) co-users.\tData were from a 2018 cross-sectional survey based on a national convenience sample of smokers aged 18-35 (n\u2009=\u2009315). Cigarette/nicotine dependence was measured by the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and e-cigarette dependence was measured by the Penn State E-cigarette Dependence Index. Bivariate analyses examined sociodemographic and tobacco/other substance use characteristics by co-use status and multivariable linear regression assessed the relationship between co-use and nicotine dependence.\tIn the sample, 27.6% were cigarette-only smokers, 24.8% were CIG-ECIG, 27.6% were CIG-CAN, and 20.0% were CIG-ECIG-CAN co-users. Significant differences were observed in sociodemographic and tobacco/other substance use characteristics by co-use status. E-cigarette co-users had low e-cigarette dependence, but moderate FTND scores. In adjusted analyses, only CIG-ECIG co-use was associated with higher FTND scores compared to cigarette-only smoking. However, CIG-ECIG and CIG-ECIG-CAN co-use were associated with higher FTND scores compared to CIG-CAN co-use.\tCo-use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes was associated with greater nicotine dependence among smokers aged 18-35.

Here we test the hypothesis that negative biases in brain responses and in social learning of self-related information contribute to the negative self-image and low self-esteem characteristic of SAD. Adult participants diagnosed with social anxiety (N = 21) and matched controls (N = 23) rated their performance and received social feedback following a stressful public speaking task. We investigated how positive versus negative social feedback altered self-evaluation and state self-esteem and used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to characterize brain responses to positive versus negative feedback. Compared to controls, participants with SAD updated their self-evaluation and state self-esteem significantly more based on negative compared to positive social feedback. Responses in the frontoparietal network correlated with and mirrored these behavioral effects, with greater responses to positive than negative feedback in non-anxious controls but not in participants with SAD. Responses to social feedback in the anterior insula and other areas mediated the effects of negative versus positive feedback on changes in self-evaluation. In non-anxious participants, frontoparietal brain areas may contribute to a positive social learning bias. In SAD, frontoparietal areas are less recruited overall and less attuned to positive feedback, possibly reflecting differences in attention allocation and cognitive regulation. More negatively biased brain responses and social learning could contribute to maintaining a negative self-image in SAD and other internalizing disorders, thereby offering important new targets for interventions.","_input_hash":-863146484,"_task_hash":-1277899122,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243618,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

This framework is used to review literature from the past decade on access to health care and health promotion for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Review of the literature indicates an emerging evidence base for health promotion programs for persons with IDD. Research in health care and health promotion access requires improvements in surveillance and measurement of quality of life, as well as increased participation of persons with IDD and their families in its implementation. While international guidelines for primary health care have been developed for people with IDD, US guidelines are specialty focused and address specific conditions. Despite its recognized importance, there is surprisingly little information on training programs for health care providers to improve care of persons with IDD. Financing of health care continues to threaten access to comprehensive care for persons with IDD, particularly regarding coordination of care and availability of providers who accept Medicaid patients. Community-based sources of health care have been slow to emerge, and there is clear need for assumption of responsibility for providing care to persons with IDD.

While the relationship between psychosis and clinical variables has been examined frequently, few studies have examined the relationship between psychosis and the 2 major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease: neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. We characterized the occurrence of psychosis in relation to dementia severity and determined if subjects with Alzheimer disease and psychosis had a greater neurofibrillary tangle or senile plaque burden than subjects with Alzheimer disease and no psychosis.\tOne hundred nine subjects with Alzheimer disease were followed longitudinally with semistructured assessments in order to assign a Clinical Dementia Rating and determine whether psychosis was present. After the subjects died, their brains were obtained for histological examination. Analysis of variance was used to compare the densities of neurofibrillary tangles, total senile plaques, and cored senile plaques in subjects with psychosis vs subjects without psychosis, in several neocortical regions, the hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex.\tPsychosis occurred commonly in Alzheimer disease, affecting 63% of subjects. The frequency of psychosis increased with increasing dementia severity. More importantly, we found that subjects with psychosis had a 2.3-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.9) greater density of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles than did subjects without psychosis.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included a total of 79 patients with ADHD or ASDs and controls in the Van region of Turkey. The control group included subjects of matching age and sex with no ADHD, ASDs, or chronic disease and taking no vitamins. The hematological parameters of the patients, including MPV, vitamin B12, and vitamin D, were assessed. RESULTS The study included a total of 79 children and adolescents aged 2-18 years (32 females and 47 males). Of the patients, 36 were in the ADHD group, 18 in the ASDs group, and 25 in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in hematological parameters between the groups, but there were significant differences in terms of vitamin D and vitamin B12. The patient groups showed lower levels of vitamin B12 and vitamin D. In the ADHD group, there was a negative correlation between both vitamins and MPV (p<0.05). Partial correlation analysis of the ADHD group showed that MPV in particular was negatively correlated to vitamin D, and not to vitamin B12 (p: 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Both ADHD and ASDs may accompany increased risk for cardiovascular disease due to the presence of vitamin B12 and D deficiency and their own characteristics. Therefore, these disorders should be closely followed up.","_input_hash":-573558178,"_task_hash":117466065,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":254,"end":259,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":527,"end":532,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":556,"end":564,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":784,"end":792,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":864,"end":869,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":968,"end":976,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 2, 34, 34, 2, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243752,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Human control and AD postmortem brain tissues were homogenized and sedimented by ultracentrifugation in the presence of sarkosyl to enrich detergent-insoluble protein aggregates including pathologic phosphorylated tau, the core component of neurofibrillary tangles in AD. Western blotting demonstrated the differential solubility of aggregated phosphorylated-tau and the detergent-soluble protein, Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA1) in control and AD brain. Proteomic analysis also revealed enrichment of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), tau, snRNP70 (U1-70K), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of AD brain compared to those of control, consistent with previous tissue fractionation strategies.

{"pmid":"30342963","text":"Experimental neurology^\nKey determinants for morphine withdrawal conditioned context-induced increase in Arc expression in anterior cingulate cortex and withdrawal memory retrieval.^\nAddiction memory is subjected to time-dependent shifts toward neocortex in remote period to promote long-term addiction memory storage, which plays an important role in drug relapse. However, how the activity and neuroplasticity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) change after contextual morphine withdrawal conditioning and what factors determine this change remain to be determined. In this paper, using immunohistochemical and single-cell microinjection techniques, combining behavioral assay, we found that (1) contextual withdrawal conditioning increases the expression of c-Fos, but not Arc, in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (2) at the first day after conditioning, conditioned context has no influence on the expression of c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (3) at the 14th day after conditioning, conditioned context increases the expression of both c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (4) the inhibition of dendritic spines of the ACC or projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC attenuates the conditioned context-induced increase of Arc expression in the ACC and abolishes the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning. These results suggest that the ACC may exhibit a change in neuroplasticity at the 14th day after conditioning, and the dendritic spines of the ACC and the projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC are key determinants for conditioned context induced-increase in Arc expression in the ACC and the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning.","_input_hash":-1105157622,"_task_hash":-1867943839,"spans":[{"text":"mice","start":819,"end":823,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":972,"end":976,"pattern":448964729},{"text":"mice","start":1119,"end":1123,"pattern":448964729}],"meta":{"pattern":"82, 82, 82"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243846,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Choroideremia has been mapped to Xq13-21 by tight linkage to restriction fragment length polymorphism loci. We have recently identified two families in which choroideremia is inherited with mental retardation and deafness. In family XL-62, an interstitial deletion in Xq21 is visible by cytogenetic analysis and two linked anonymous DNA markers, DXYS1 and DXS72, are deleted. In the second family, XL-45, an interstitial deletion was suspected on phenotypic grounds but could not be confirmed by high-resolution cytogenetic analysis. We used phenol-enhanced reassociation of 48,XXXX DNA in competition with excess XL-45 DNA to generate a library of cloned DNA enriched for sequences that might be deleted in XL-45. Two of the first 83 sequences characterized from the library were found to be deleted in probands from family XL-45 as well as from family XL-62. Isolation of these sequences proves that XL-45 does contain a submicroscopic deletion and provides a starting point for identifying overlapping genomic sequences that span the XL-45 deletion. Each overlapping sequence will be studied to identify exons from the choroideremia locus.","_input_hash":-1844392892,"_task_hash":1844009199,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-case-report"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243906,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Although obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is classified as an anxiety disorder, disgust may be involved in its pathogenesis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of disgust-inducing visual stimuli in OCD have suggested disorder specific alterations in brain activation during these tasks.\tSubjects with OCD and healthy controls (HC) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) brain scanning after injection of H(2) (15)O. During PET, subjects either watched slides designed to evoke feelings of disgust (OCD = 5, HC = 11), expected the delivery of an electrical shock (OCD = 11, HC = 13), or rested (OCD = 11, HC = 14). After the anticipatory anxiety and resting tasks, anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal measures were obtained. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to analyze regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data.\tComparison of OCD subjects with controls on differences in rCBF across the disgust-inducing and resting tasks showed that OCD was characterized by greater rCBF in the left insula. In OCD the disgust-inducing task increased right lateral orbitofrontal cortex rCBF compared to resting, whereas in controls there was no difference in rCBF between these tasks. Anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal activity increased during anticipatory anxiety in both groups, and comparison of rCBF in OCD subjects with controls in anticipatory anxiety versus resting state also found no significant differences.\tOCD may be characterized by a disruption in disgust processing, such that there is a decrease in appropriate disgust (such as that evoked by observing disgust in others) and an increase in inappropriate disgust (such as that evoked by contamination stimuli). The insula may play a particularly important role in mediating such putative disruptions. The sample studied here was small, and further work is required to determine whether disgust-induced activation patterns in OCD are more apparent in specific subtypes of this disorder, whether they are specific to OCD, and whether they are normalized by treatment.","_input_hash":1392023912,"_task_hash":808423705,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708243969,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Nevertheless, these modalities are often insufficient for achieving a definite diagnosis. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the combination of these tools.\tThe SPECT radiotracers [I]-N-\u03c9-fluoropropyl-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) and meta-[I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) were used to research presynaptic dopaminergic projections (DAT SPECT) and myocardial adrenergic innervation (MIBG scintigraphy), respectively. PD patients (n=15; age: 61.5\u00b113.6 years) and non-PD patients (n=19; age: 62.6\u00b114.2 years) who underwent both tests were enrolled in this study. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were used to set the cutoff values of the specific binding ratio in DAT SPECT and the heart to mediastinum ratio in delayed scan in MIBG scintigraphy for differentiating PD from non-PD. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and test accuracy of the individual methods and also the combination of these two modalities.\tWhen DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy were used individually, they showed mild accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD (DAT, 67.6%; MIBG, 67.6%). The combination of the two approaches using cutoff values of less than 3.24 for the specific binding ratio and less than 2.745 for the delayed heart to mediastinum ratio enabled more accurate differentiation between PD and non-PD. The accuracy of these indices in distinguishing PD from non-PD was 79.4%.\tThese results suggested that the combination of DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy may improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD.","_input_hash":1551535137,"_task_hash":-1863823477,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":75,"end":80,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"diagnosis","start":613,"end":622,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"aims","start":628,"end":632,"pattern":-2080524606},{"text":"study","start":641,"end":646,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"diagnostic","start":668,"end":678,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":1008,"end":1016,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1057,"end":1065,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":1142,"end":1147,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"diagnostic","start":2065,"end":2075,"pattern":-808942259}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 56, 43, 2, 55, 34, 34, 2, 55"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708244042,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Participants were 250 18-25 year-olds who completed an online survey assessing several factors associated with weight control. After controlling for significant covariates, TIB was significantly associated with BMI. Specifically, 'less than 6 hours/night' TIB was associated with increased BMI compared to the referent category (7 to <8 hours/night) (p = .01). Findings demonstrate that young adults who report shorter TIB are more likely to be classified as having higher BMI.","_input_hash":1801439129,"_task_hash":-728335219,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":283,"end":288,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"report","start":787,"end":793,"pattern":1226364217}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 36"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708244053,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Although almost never malignant and rarely clinically expressed, pituitary tumors may cause significant morbidity in affected patients. First, given the critical location of the gland, large tumors may lead to mass effects, and, second, proliferation of hormone-secreting pituitary cells leads to endocrine syndromes. Acromegaly results from oversecretion of growth hormone (GH) by the proliferating somatotrophs. Despite the significant efforts made over the last decade, still little is known about the genetic causes of common pituitary tumors and even less is applied from this knowledge therapeutically. In this review, we present an update on the genetic syndromes associated with pituitary adenomas and discuss the related genetic defects. We next review findings on sporadic, non-genetic, pituitary tumors with an emphasis on pathways and animal models of pituitary disease. In conclusion, we attempt to present an overall, integrative approach to the human molecular genetics of both familiar and sporadic pituitary tumors.","_input_hash":1714757716,"_task_hash":-1991176261,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":510,"end":518,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"cells","start":666,"end":671,"pattern":-2101317411},{"text":"review","start":1001,"end":1007,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"review","start":1139,"end":1145,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"animal","start":1231,"end":1237,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"human","start":1344,"end":1349,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 70, 4, 4, 67, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708244067,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Double blind assessments were made at weeks 4, 7, 10, 18, 36, 62 and 114. Results are reported to one year. Clomipramine produced significant improvement in rituals, mood and social adjustment, but only in those patients who initially had depressed mood. The clomipramine effect was maximum from weeks 10 to 18 and diminished thereafter. On stopping clomipramine patients often relapsed and improved again on restarting the drug. Relaxation produced little change. Exposure produced significant lasting improvement in rituals, but less change in mood; improvement generalized to social adjustment at follow-up. Clomipramine plus exposure had a slight additive but not interactional effect. Clomipramine enhanced compliance both with exposure and with relaxation. Clomipramine is useful for compulsive ritualizers with depressed mood, but may need continuation for over a year and combination with exposure in vivo. Exposure in vivo remains the treatment of choice for rituals without depressed mood.","_input_hash":-2064030035,"_task_hash":1271643254,"spans":[{"text":"randomly","start":183,"end":191,"pattern":985041104},{"text":"assigned","start":192,"end":200,"pattern":-650468424},{"text":"placebo","start":240,"end":247,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"randomly","start":309,"end":317,"pattern":985041104},{"text":"patients","start":406,"end":414,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":649,"end":657,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":800,"end":808,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"25, 12, 14, 25, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-RCT-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1708244077,"_annotator_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50","_session_id":"2024-02-18_08-38-50"}

Immunocytochemical reactivity in a characteristic filamentous pattern was observed with monoclonal antibodies to nonphosphorylated epitopes of NF-H and NF-M as well as with redundant antibody probes specific for NF-H and NF-M. Immunoblotting studies confirmed the presence of NF-H and NF-M. Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting also demonstrated the presence of NSE, but not of glial fibrillary acidic protein or other glial markers. Immunocytochemical studies also indicated the presence of proline hydroxylase, an enzyme found in fibroblasts but not neurons.
