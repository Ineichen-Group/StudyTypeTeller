0,18379746,Der Radiologe,[Pediatric stroke].,Stroke in childhood has gained increasingly more attention and is accepted as an important disease in childhood. The reasons for this severe event and the consequences for the rest of the life are totally different than for adults. This is also true for the diagnosis and therapy. This paper gives a comprehensive overview on the characteristics of pediatric stroke to assist radiologists in making a rapid and safe diagnosis in order to identify the underlying disease.,Non-systematic-review
1,24660674,Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,Treatment engagement and response to CBT among Latinos with anxiety disorders in primary care.,"In the current study, we compared measures of treatment outcome and engagement for Latino and non-Latino White patients receiving a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program delivered in primary care.	Participants were 18-65 years old and recruited from 17 clinics at 4 different sites to participate in a randomized controlled trial for anxiety disorders, which compared the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention (consisting of CBT, medication, or both) with usual care. Of those participants who were randomized to the intervention arm and selected CBT (either alone or in combination with medication), 85 were Latino and 251 were non-Latino White; the majority of the Latino participants received the CBT intervention in English (n = 77). Blinded assessments of clinical improvement and functioning were administered at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline. Measures of engagement, including attendance, homework adherence, understanding of CBT principles, and commitment to treatment, were assessed weekly during the CBT intervention.	Findings from propensity-weighted linear and logistic regression models revealed no statistically significant differences between Latinos and non-Latino Whites on symptom measures of clinical improvement and functioning at almost all time points. There were significant differences on 2 of 7 engagement outcomes, namely, number of sessions attended and patients' understanding of CBT principles.	These findings suggest that CBT can be an effective treatment approach for Latinos who are primarily English speaking and likely more acculturated, although continued attention should be directed toward engaging Latinos in such interventions.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Each participant completed an arm-crank ramp exercise test to volitional exhaustion. PO was increased by 15 W.min(-1) and 6 W.min(-1) for men and women able-bodied participants, respectively; for the poliomyelitis participants, 9 W.min(-1) and 6 W.min(-1) increments were used for men and women, respectively.

There were significantly higher values for maximum Vo(2) and maximum PO for able-bodied men compared with their counterparts with poliomyelitis (P<.05). However, when the data were controlled for age, there were no significant differences in these values (P>.05). Similar results were observed for the women who were able-bodied as well as for the women who had poliomyelitis (P>.05). The relationships between heart rate and RPE and Ve and RPE for able-bodied patients and patients with poliomyelitis were similar (R(2)>.87). The relationship between Vo(2) and RPE was stronger in the able-bodied participants compared wih the participants with poliomyelitis, regardless of sex (P<.05). However, when the data were controlled for age, there was no significant difference in the strength of this relationship between able-bodied participants and those with poliomyelitis, regardless of sex (P>.05).	RPE is strongly related to physiologic markers of exercise intensity during arm exercise, irrespective of sex or participant's poliomyelitis status.",Remaining
3,11781147,Biochimica et biophysica acta,Characterization of a missense mutation at histidine-44 in a pyruvate dehydrogenase-deficient patient.,"Genetic defects in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) cause lactic acidosis, neurological deficits, and often early death. Most mutations of PDC are localized in the alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. We have kinetically characterized a patient's missense mutation alphaH44R in E1alpha by creating and purifying three recombinant human E1s (alphaH44R, alphaH44Q, and alphaH44A). Substitutions at histidine-15 resulted in decreased V(max) values (6% alphaH44R; 30% alphaH44Q; 90% alphaH44A) while increasing K(m) values for thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) compared to wild-type (alphaH44R, 3-fold; alphaH44Q, 7-fold; alphaH44A, 10-fold). This suggests that the volume of the residue at site 15 is important for TPP binding and substitution by a residue with a longer side chain disrupts the active site more than the TPP binding site. The rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of alphaH44R E1 by E1-kinase and phospho-E1 phosphatase, respectively, were similar to that of the wild-type E1 protein. These results provide a biochemical basis for altered E1 function in the alphaH44R E1 patient.",Remaining
4,31706919,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,The role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).,"Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the major cause of death that affects patients with epilepsy. The risk of SUDEP increases according to the frequency and severity of uncontrolled seizures; therefore, SUDEP risk is higher in patients with refractory epilepsy (RE), in whom most antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are ineffective for both seizure control and SUDEP prevention. Consequently, RE and SUDEP share a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, which is mainly associated with brain overexpression of ABC-transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The activity of P-gp can also contribute to membrane depolarization and affect the normal function of neurons and cardiomyocytes. Other molecular regulators of membrane potential are the inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir), whose genetic variants have been related to both epilepsy and heart dysfunctions. Although it has been suggested that dysfunctions of the cardiac, respiratory, and brainstem arousal systems are the causes of SUDEP, the molecular basis for explaining its dysfunctions remain unknown. In rats, repetitive seizures or status epilepticus induced high expression of P-gp and loss Kir expression in the brain and heart, and promoted membrane depolarization, malignant bradycardia, and the high rate of mortality. Here we reviewed clinical and experimental evidences suggesting that abnormal expression of depolarizing/repolarizing factors as P-gp and Kir could favor persistent depolarization of membranes without any rapid functional recovery capacity. This condition induced by convulsive stress could be the molecular mechanism leading to acquired severe bradycardia, as an ineffective heart response generating the appropriate scenario for SUDEP development.

6,21375489,Current molecular medicine,The Role of immune and inflammatory mechanisms in ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe progressive neurodegenerative disease. The cause is unknown, but genetic abnormalities have been identified in subjects with familial ALS and also in subjects with sporadic ALS. Environmental factors such as occupational exposure have been shown to be risk factors for the development of ALS. Patients differ in their clinical features and differ in the clinical course of disease. Immune abnormalities have been found in the central nervous system by pathological studies and also in the blood and CSF of subjects with ALS. Inflammation and immune abnormalities are also found in animals with a model of ALS due to mutations in the SOD1 gene. Previously it has been considered that immune abnormalities might contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. However more recently it has become apparent that an immune response can occur as a response to damage to the nervous system and this can be protective.",Non-systematic-review
7,16236167,Health and quality of life outcomes,"Differential effect sizes of growth hormone replacement on Quality of Life, well-being and health status in growth hormone deficient patients: a meta-analysis.","Patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) frequently report to suffer from an impaired Quality of Life (QoL) and growth hormone (GH) substitution is found to improve this. However, the same test may be used for measuring QoL, well-being or health status in different studies. QoL has been defined as the subjective appraisal of one's current life based primarily on psychological function. The most important in the appraisal of well-being is mental function and concerning health status patients evaluate physical function as most important. To differentiate the effects of GH replacement on psychological variables in patients with GHD we carried out a number of meta-analyses, classifying questionnaires into instruments measuring QoL, psychological well-being and health status.	We searched the electronic databases PUBMED and PiCarta from 1985 to 2004. Studies were included that evaluated the effect of GH on patient-reported outcomes in adults with GHD (aged 18 years and above). According to generally accepted definitions we classified the questionnaires as instruments measuring QoL, well-being and health status. By means of meta-analyses the average effect size (d) for QoL, well-being and health status was calculated.	Based on open studies GH replacement is found to improve QoL with a small effect size (d = 0.18), well-being with a medium effect size (d = 0.47) and health status with a small effect size (d = 0.26). As the effect size of well-being is most pronounced the generally reported effects of GH replacement on QoL may be overestimated and actually reflect the effect on well-being.	To get more insight in the specific psychological effects of GH treatment it is recommended that instruments selected for these studies should be more consistently classified as instruments measuring QoL, well-being or health status.",Human-systematic-review
8,30760172,Psychological reports,Effects of Psychoeducation and Stress Coping Techniques on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms.,"This study examined the effects of psychoeducation and stress management techniques on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms in Libya. The 41 Libyan patients who volunteered to take part in the study were first assessed using the PTSD Checklist. They attended workshops on PTSD symptoms, stress management techniques, and communication skills on three successive days after which they were asked to answer the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations two weeks after they completed the workshops. Among the 39% of the participants who were diagnosed with PTSD prior to the intervention, 15% met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD after the intervention. The preintervention scores were consistently higher than the postintervention scores, and there were significant differences in the PTSD Checklist total score and the re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptom scores. This study concluded that in mass-trauma events such as war and natural disasters, PTSD education can reduce the PTSD symptoms of those affected. Whether the benefits of psychoeducation on the participants are long term or short term is recommended for further study due to the limitations imposed by the willingness of the participants to participate, the amount of time they are willing to stay with the program, and the duration of the psychoeducation program itself.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Ten cases were collected from a review of the English literature and three new cases were added. All 13 patients presented neurologic symptoms of radiculopathy and/or myelopathy with either no history of trauma or only minor trauma. Pathogenesis of symptoms is due to degenerative arthritis of the adjacent mobile segments, spinal stenosis, and subluxation of the adjacent mobile segments. The significance of coexisting spinal stenosis and segmental instability is emphasized and is related to the symptoms and treatment of the condition. Symptomatic patients can be treated satisfactorily with adequate decompressive laminectomy and fusion of the unstable segments.",Remaining

11,34207317,Biomolecules,Pharmacokinetics and Molecular Modeling Indicate nAChRα4-Derived Peptide HAEE Goes through the Blood-Brain Barrier.,"One of the treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on the use of pharmacological agents capable of binding to beta-amyloid (Aβ) and blocking its aggregation in the brain. Previously, we found that intravenous administration of the synthetic tetrapeptide Acetyl-His-Ala-Glu-Glu-Amide (HAEE), which is an analogue of the 35-38 region of the α4 subunit of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and specifically binds to the 11-14 site of Aβ, reduced the development of cerebral amyloidogenesis in a mouse model of AD. In the current study on three types of laboratory animals, we determined the biodistribution and tissue localization patterns of HAEE peptide after single intravenous bolus administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters of HAEE were established using uniformly tritium-labeled HAEE. Pharmacokinetic data provided evidence that HAEE goes through the blood-brain barrier. Based on molecular modeling, a role of LRP1 in receptor-mediated transcytosis of HAEE was proposed. Altogether, the results obtained indicate that the anti-amyloid effect of HAEE, previously found in a mouse model of AD, most likely occurs due to its interaction with Aβ species directly in the brain.",Animal-drug-intervention

While animal-assisted therapy (AAT) can benefit physical function in older adults and improve symptoms of psychotic disorders, the effect of AAT on middle-aged patients with schizophrenia is unclear. The current randomized controlled trial aimed to explore the efficacy of AAT for middle-aged patients with schizophrenia. Forty participants were randomly assigned to either the AAT or control group. The AAT group participated in one-hour sessions with dog-assisted group activities once a week for 12 weeks. The controls participated in dose-matched, non-animal-related recreational activities. Both groups remained on their usual psychotropic medication during the trial. Evaluations included the Chair Stand Test (CST), Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 5-Meter walk test (5MWT), and Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills (ACIS). The increases in CST repetitions and ACIS scores were larger in the AAT group than in the controls. The two groups did not differ significantly in MoCA scores, TUG performance, or the 5MWT. The AAT group showed a greater increase in lower extremity strength and social skills, but no improvement in cognitive function, agility, or mobility. Further research with more sensitive evaluations and longer follow-up is needed.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention

We aimed to study psychiatric morbidity in people with diabetes and the general population using administrative health care data in Stockholm County.	The study population included all living persons who resided in Stockholm County, Sweden, on January 1, 2011 (N=2,058,408). Subjects with a diagnosis of diabetes were identified with data from all consultations in primary health care, specialist outpatient care and inpatient care during the time span 2009-2013. As outcome, information was obtained on all consultations due to any psychiatric diagnosis as well as, specifically, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders, in 2011-2013. Analyses were performed by age group and gender. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for women and men with diabetes, using individuals without diabetes as referents, were calculated.	Age-adjusted OR for all psychiatric diagnoses among people with diabetes was 1.296 (95% CI 1.267-1.326) for women and 1.399 (95% CI 1.368-1.432) for men.

15,24080672,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,Prevalence of psychotic symptoms in those with melancholic and nonmelancholic depression.,"The best classification of depressive disorders is still to be established. A melancholic subtype has a lengthy history, and recent research demonstrates its relevance. This study compares the prevalence of psychotic symptoms in nonmelancholic and melancholic depression and assesses whether there is a dimensional pattern in the severity of symptoms among the subtypes. Patients with unipolar depression were assessed for melancholic status, psychotic symptoms, and severity of depression. The diagnosis of melancholia was made by both Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), criteria and CORE measure. The DSM criteria assigned a much higher percentage of patients as melancholics (67.4%) than did the CORE (24.9%). Prevalence of psychosis was distinctly higher in the melancholics. Symptoms severity was higher among the melancholics when compared with the nonmelancholics. The presence of psychotic symptoms was not associated with an increase in the intensity of depressive symptoms. Psychotic symptoms are more frequently associated with the melancholic subtype of depression. This suggests clinical contiguity between the melancholic and psychotic subtypes and the clinical relevance of identifying melancholia.",Remaining
16,18383533,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,Oculomotor function in multiple system atrophy: clinical and laboratory features in 30 patients.,"We reviewed the clinical and laboratory oculomotor features in 30 patients with probable multiple system atrophy (MSA), 22 with MSA-P and 8 with MSA-C. Six patients were also examined post mortem, MSA being confirmed in four and excluded in two (Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy). Clinical examination showed the following abnormalities; excessive square wave jerks--21 of 30 patients; mild vertical supranuclear gaze palsy--8 of 30; gaze-evoked nystagmus--12 of 30 patients, three of whom had no extraocular evidence of cerebellar dysfunction; positioning downbeat nystagmus--10 of 25; mild or moderate saccadic hypometria--22 of 30; impaired ('broken up') smooth pursuit--28 of 30; reduced VOR suppression--16 of 24. Electro-oculography and caloric testing did not add significant extra information. In patients presenting with an akinetic-rigid syndrome it can be difficult to differentiate idiopathic Parkinson's disease from MSA-P and other causes of atypical parkinsonism. Our findings suggest that the presence of excessive square wave jerks, mild-moderate hypometria of saccades, impaired VOR suppression, spontaneous nystagmus or positioning downbeat nystagmus may be oculomotor 'red flags' or clues to the presence of MSA. Further, the presence of clinically slow saccades, or moderate-to-severe gaze restriction, suggests a diagnosis other than MSA.",Remaining
17,25359445,Pituitary,Update on radiation therapy in patients with Cushing's disease.,"Radiation therapy is an important therapy for patients with Cushing's disease who are not in remission or relapse after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery and are not considered surgical candidates. The development of stereotactic radiation therapy, using gamma knife, linear accelerators or proton beam based methods, has enabled selective radiation delivery to the target while minimizing exposure of healthy tissues. In patients whose tumors are sufficiently distant from the optic apparatus, stereotactic radiation therapy can be delivered in a single session, a procedure termed radiosurgery, which significantly improves patient convenience.	Original articles on radiation therapy in Cushing's disease, published during the past 12 months (2013-2014), were identified and pertinent data extracted.	Recent studies have reported on the outcomes of patients with Cushing's disease who received mostly stereotactic radiation therapy. While tumor control has been excellent, biochemical remission was less consistently achieved. Some studies suggested that stereotactic radiation may lead to biochemical remission faster than conventional radiation therapy. In addition, retrospective data have suggested that withdrawing medical therapy around the time stereotactic radiation therapy is administered might lead to a faster biochemical response. Regardless of the radiation therapy method, biochemical recurrences may develop and these patients are at long-term risk of developing anterior hypopituitarism and require lifelong periodic endocrine follow-up. Other, less frequent complications may include cranial neuropathies, secondary tumor formation or temporal lobe necrosis. It is plausible that complications may be less frequent after stereotactic radiation therapy, but this requires confirmation.	Radiation therapy is an effective second line therapy in patients with Cushing's disease. Ongoing refinements in delivery of radiation therapy are anticipated to lead to improved patient outcomes, but long-term follow-up data, including adequate control groups, are needed to fully investigate this possibility.",Non-systematic-review

19,21824113,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,Expression of hepatocyte growth factor in the skin of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent survival-promoting factors for motor neurons. Overexpression of neuronal HGF has been shown to result in the attenuation of neuronal cell death and progression of disease in a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) transgenic mouse model. HGF might be beneficial for motor neuron survival and is a good candidate agent for the treatment of ALS. So far, studies of the skin of ALS have shown unique pathological and biochemical abnormalities. However, there has been no study of HGF in ALS skin.	We made a quantitative immunohistochemical study of the expression of HGF in the skin from 19 patients with sporadic ALS and 16 controls.	Hepatocyte growth factor immunoreactivity was positive in the epidermis, some dermal blood vessels, and glands in patients with ALS. These findings became more conspicuous as ALS progressed. The optical density for HGF immunoreactivity of the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the epidermis in ALS was significantly higher (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) than in controls. There was a significant positive relation (r = 0.53, P < 0.02 and r = 0.73, P < 0.001) between HGF immunoreactivity and duration of illness in the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the epidermis in patients with ALS.	These findings suggest that changes in HGF in ALS skin are related to the disease process and that metabolic alterations of HGF may take place in the skin of patients with ALS.",Remaining
20,27477332,Journal of clinical nursing,The experiences of families living with the anticipatory loss of a school-age child with spinal muscular atrophy - the parents' perspectives.,"To probe into parents' anticipatory loss of school-age children with Type I or II spinal muscular atrophy.	Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare disorder that causes death. Children die early due to either gradual atrophy or an infection of the lungs. Therefore, family members experience anticipatory loss, which causes grief before the actual loss. Family members feel physically and mentally exhausted, which results in a family crisis. Therefore, it is important to explore their experiences related to anticipatory loss to assist with the adjustment of the families to their circumstances.	This study applied a phenomenology method and purposive sampling.	The 19 parents who participated in this study were referred to us by two medical centers in Taiwan. Their average age was 32-49 years.	Using in-depth interviews, this study explored parents' anticipatory loss. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Meanings were extracted using Giorgi analysis, and precision was assessed according to Guba and Lincoln, which was treated as the evaluation standard.	Four themes were identified from the parents' interviews. The themes included enduring the helplessness and pressure of care, suffering due to the child's rare and unknown condition, loss of hope and a reinforcement of the parent-child attachment, and avoiding the pressure of death and enriching the child's life.	The research findings help nurses identify anticipatory loss among parents of school-age children with type I or II spinal muscular atrophy. They enhance health professionals' understanding of the panic that occurs in the society surrounding the families, family members' dynamic relationships, and the families' demands for care.	In an attempt to providing intersubjective empathy and support with family having a child with type I and II SMA, nurses may recognize relevant family reactions and enhancing their hope and parent-child attachment. Encourage family members and child go beyond the pressure of death and create customized care plans meeting families' emotional and medical needs.",Remaining

We conducted an exploratory, pilot randomized controlled trial with a mixed-methods design. Twenty persons with mild dementia and carer dyads were randomly assigned to the FindMyApps group (n = 10), receiving either the FindMyApps training and selection tool, or a control condition (n = 10), receiving only a short tablet training. Pre- and post-test measurements at a three month follow-up, consisted of questionnaires and post-test semi-structured interviews.	The FindMyApps tool was mostly perceived as useful and easy to use. Persons with dementia were generally able to learn how to use the tool, though they regularly needed support from informal carers. Persons with dementia found apps through the tool, which they used regularly. Persons with dementia and informal carers were positive about the training and support they received. No significant differences were found on outcome measures of persons with dementia, but based on effect sizes FindMyApps is a promising intervention.	Qualitative results indicate that the FindMyApps intervention has the potential to positively influence the self-management abilities and engagement in meaningful activities of people with dementia.

22,23266819,Gene,A 5-methylcytosine hotspot responsible for the prevalent HSD17B10 mutation.,"Approximately half of the cases of hydroxysteroid (17β) dehydrogenase X (HSD10) deficiency are due to a missense C>T mutation in exon 4 of the HSD17B10 gene. The resulting HSD10 (p.R130C) loses most or all catalytic functions, and the males with this mutation have a much more severe clinical phenotype than those carrying p.V65A, p.L122V, or p.E249Q mutations. We found that the mutated cytosine which is +2259 nucleotide from the ATG of the gene, is >90% methylated in both the active and inactive X chromosomes in two normal females as well as in the X chromosome of a normal male. Since 5-methylcytosine is prone to conversion to thymine by deamination, the methylation of this cytosine in normal X chromosomes provides an explanation for the prevalence of the p.R130C mutation among patients with HSD10 deficiency. The substitution of arginine for cysteine eliminates several hydrogen bonds and reduces the van der Waals interaction between HSD10 subunits. The resulting disruption of protein structure impairs some if not all of the catalytic and non-enzymatic functions of HSD10. A meta-analysis of residual HSD10 activity in eight patients with the p.R130C mutation showed an average 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (MHBD) activity of only 6 (±5) % of the normal control level. This is significantly lower than in cells of patients with other, clinically milder mutations and suggests that the loss of HSD10/MHBD activity is a marker for the disorder.",Remaining

24,18084001,"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",Neuropsychiatric lupus and reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome: a challenging clinical dilemma.,"Reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) has been increasingly recognized and reported in the literature. While the condition has been well described in patients with acute hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, post-transplantation and chemotherapy, RPLS has been increasingly identified in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Though experience in the diagnosis and management of RPLS in patients with SLE is likely accumulating, few have systematically worked out the strategy to distinguish RPLS from neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) and lupus-related complications of the central nervous system (CNS). Prompt recognition of, and differentiation between, these conditions is essential since their clinical presentations substantially overlap and yet their management strategy and subsequent outcomes can be entirely different. Indeed, inappropriate treatment such as augmentation of immunosuppression may be detrimental to patients with RPLS. A high index of suspicion of RPLS, prompt magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, including diffusion imaging, exclusion of CNS infection and metabolic derangement, a comprehensive medication review accompanied by timely and aggressive control of blood pressure and seizure are keys to successful management of RPLS. Such treatment strategy ensures a very high chance of total neurological recovery in lupus patients with RPLS.",Non-systematic-review

We aimed to characterize whether an association exists between diabetes duration and stroke outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).	Between 2015 and 2018, 14,674 patients with ischemic stroke or TIA within 7 days and older than 18 years from the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III) were included in this analysis. Diabetes duration at baseline was collected by face-to-face interviews and further categorized into groups of without diabetes, diabetes < 4, 4 to <8 and ≥8 years. The association between diabetes duration and clinical outcomes, including stroke recurrence, poor function outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6), and all-cause mortality at the 1-year follow-up after stroke onset, was evaluated by a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model, competing risk model and logistic regression model with adjustment for demographic and clinical features.	Among the 14,674 patients included, the average age was 62.0 years, and 68.5% were male. There were 1419 (9.7%) patients who had stroke recurrence, 1912 (13.0%) who had poor function outcome, and 478 (3.3%) who had all-cause mortality at the 1-year follow-up. After adjusting for potential covariates, a diabetes duration ≥8 years was associated with an increased risk of 1-year stroke recurrence (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.64; p = .02) in comparison to those without Diabetes mellitus. Using a competing risk regression model, a diabetes duration ≥8 years was a significant risk factor for stroke recurrence (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53). In contrast, there was no significant association between diabetes duration < 4, 4 to <8 years and clinical outcomes.	Long-term diabetes duration (≥8 years), but not short-term diabetes duration, was associated with an increased risk of 1-year stroke recurrence in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA.",Remaining
26,8726540,Clinical neuropharmacology,Lack of relation between genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P-450IID6 and sporadic idiopathic Parkinson's disease.,"We investigated genetic polymorphism of the cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 gene from white patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). The mutations of the CYP2D6 gene associated with the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype of the debrisoquine/sparteine polymorphism were analyzed in DNA of 130 IPD patients by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA amplification combined with Xba I restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in 105 patients. Another mutation located in exon 6 was analyzed by Hha I RFLP in 94 IPD patients. The frequencies of the different CYP2D6 gene mutations were compared to the frequencies in sex- and age-matched white control population with chronic bronchitis. The rate of genotypically defined PM and the frequencies of the different mutations were not significantly different in IPD patients and controls. These results fail to confirm the previously reported results concerning CYP2D6 gene mutations in IPD. These equivocal results might be related to methodologic problems. However, other hypotheses have been suggested: impairment of neuronal CYP 2D6 expression, transient modification of CYP 2D6 phenotype, or linkage of CYP2D6 gene to the candidate gene locus directly involved in IPD.",Remaining

A total of 14 patients with pituitary adenomas were enrolled in this neurocognitive study. Nine patients had Cushing disease, and five had nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Five patients underwent GKRS for their pituitary adenomas. Other treatment modalities included transsphenoidal resection and conservative management. Comparisons were made between treatment groups and between those with Cushing disease versus those with a nonfunctioning adenoma by the use of psychometric tests of general intellectual functioning, memory, and current mood state. These tests were the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised, Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, Wechsler Memory Scale-third edition, selected subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-third edition, and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System.	When analyzed collectively, the patient group showed deficits in immediate memory (t=-2.70, P=0.02) and high levels of psychological distress (46% of patients) in the presence of intact general intellectual functioning. No neurocognitive differences were found between the GKRS treated group versus participants not treated with GKRS (t≤0.70, P≥0.39). Similarly, no appreciable neurocognitive differences were demonstrated between those with nonfunctioning adenomas as compared with those with Cushing disease (t≤1.56, P≥0.15).	We found no evidence that GKRS impairs the neurocognitive functioning of patients with pituitary disease above any impairment caused by the disease itself. Further studies will require approximately 20 patients in each comparison group to confirm this result.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

This study explores individuals' experiences of a work-directed rehabilitation, provided by occupational therapists and physiotherapists, aiming to promote work capacity in persons with common mental disorders.	A qualitative content analysis was used, and 11 women and 8 men with depression or anxiety disorder were interviewed. They were 25-66 years old, had different occupations and were working full or part-time.	The participants experienced a process interpreted as Increasing belief in one's capacity through supported reflection and practice. This theme reflects the shifting between 'reflecting' and 'doing' through rehabilitation and the growing hope for change. The increasing belief in one's capacity was developed through three stages, comprised of the categories To be supported by a professional, To realise things about oneself and To try new strategies for change.	Strategies suggested by occupational therapists and physiotherapists have the potential to promote work capacity in people who are working while depressed and anxious. The results may deepen the understanding among rehabilitation professionals about the importance of a person-centred approach to people with common mental disorders, and to combine reflection and practical exercises to support the development of work-related strategies.Implications for rehabilitationWork-directed rehabilitation provided by occupational therapists and/or physiotherapists is beneficial to people with common mental disorders.Rehabilitation professionals should focus on facilitating self-efficacy among people with common mental disorders.An individualised person-centred approach seems important in order to initiate change.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
29,2991303,The Journal of cell biology,The exocrine protein trypsinogen is targeted into the secretory granules of an endocrine cell line: studies by gene transfer.,"The exocrine protein rat anionic trypsinogen has been expressed and is secreted from the murine anterior pituitary tumor cell line AtT-20. We examined which secretory pathway trypsinogen takes to the surface of this endocrine-derived cell line. The 'constitutive' pathway externalizes proteins rapidly and in the absence of an external stimulus. In the alternate, 'regulated' pathway, proteins are stored in secretory granules until the cells are stimulated to secrete with 8-Br-cAMP. On the basis of indirect immunofluorescence localization, stimulation of release, and subcellular fractionation, we find that trypsinogen is targeted into the regulated secretory pathway in AtT-20 cells. In contrast, laminin, an endogenous secretory glycoprotein, is shown to be secreted constitutively. Thus it appears that the transport apparatus for the regulated secretory pathway in endocrine cells can recognize not only endocrine prohormones, but also the exocrine protein trypsinogen, which suggests that a similar sorting mechanism is used by endocrine and exocrine cells.",In-vitro-study

Nevertheless, some undesired clinical events, such as suicide have been emerging. As for 2004, the US and European regulatory agencies began implementing verification programs to assess the influence on suicidal behavior from the use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). With the increasing number of reported cases, several newly developed antidepressants were faced with withdrawal from the markets. Despite unclear cause of suicide, researches focusing on revealing the relationship between efficacy and toxicities of antidepressants have been initiated in China and US. To deal with these undesired clinical consequences, new initiatives and revolutionary ideas have been proposed and verified. Hopefully, therapeutic efficacies and outcomes by different types of antidepressant treatments can be improved for clinical trials in future.",Non-systematic-review
31,24238645,BMC nephrology,Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome induced by neoplastic meningitis in a patient receiving maintenance hemodialysis.,"Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome is characterized by neurological symptoms resulting from cerebral edema, which occurs as a consequence of hemodialysis. Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome most often occurs in patients who have just started hemodialysis, during hemodialysis, or soon after hemodialysis; although it may also occur in patients who are under maintenance hemodialysis with pre-existing neurological disease.	A 70-year-old woman, who had been receiving maintenance hemodialysis for one year, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer by ascites cytological examination. Two years later, she reported severe headache and nausea during hemodialysis and was diagnosed with dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. Although brain images revealed mild hydrocephalus without any mass lesions, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells were detected in her cerebrospinal fluid. These findings indicated that DDS was induced by neoplastic meningitis due to ovarian cancer metastasis.	Neoplastic meningitis should be considered and excluded in hemodialysis patients with dialysis disequilibrium syndrome and malignancy by cytological examination of the cerebrospinal fluid even if cerebral imaging shows no obvious lesions. This is the first reported case of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome induced by neoplastic meningitis in a patient receiving maintenance hemodialysis.",Human-case-report

From 1996 through 2002, 24 patients > 70 years underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. Their median age was 75 years (range, 71-82 years), and 15 were male. Eleven (46%) had previous neurological events, 22% presented with hemodynamic instability and aortic rupture was found in 7%. Ten had hypothermic circulatory arrest alone, 3 had it in combination with retrograde cerebral perfusion and 11 had selective antegrade cerebral perfusion as an adjunct. The overall survival rate was 71% (17/24). Temporary neurological dysfunction was found in 3 (12.5%), and permanent neurological dysfunction in 9 (37.5%), leading to death in 3. Comparison of mortality rates and neurological outcome showed a marked tendency towards better outcome in patients who had hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. Surgery for aortic dissections in the elderly can be performed with acceptable mortality, but there is a high rate of neurological complications. Despite the small number of patients, selective antegrade cerebral perfusion seemed to reduce the incidence of neurological events.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Using an anonymized longitudinal patient-level dataset that captures information on medical and pharmacy claims in the United States (October 1, 2014 through March 31, 2020), buprenorphine prescriptions, days' supply, and daily dose were described overall and stratified by induction (month 1) vs. maintenance (month 2-6) treatment, along with duration of concomitant benzodiazepines or opioid analgesics.	Overall, there were 1.5 million buprenorphine treatment episodes initiated between January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2019 (2015: 258,899; 2019: 351,378).

In an effort to better understand how varied these practices are, we surveyed 261 neurosurgeons with an expressed interest in pediatric neurosurgery, of whom 149 (57%) responded. The survey contained questions pertaining to preoperative and intraoperative management, choice of shunt valve, treatment philosophies with respect to shunt revision, evaluation process for potential shunt malfunction, treatment strategies for shunt infections and routine follow-up care.

37,32623545,Behavior genetics,Examining the Role of Genetic Risk and Longitudinal Transmission Processes Underlying Maternal Parenting and Psychopathology and Children's ADHD Symptoms and Aggression: Utilizing the Advantages of a Prospective Adoption Design.,"Although genetic factors may contribute to initial liability for ADHD onset, there is growing evidence of the potential importance of the rearing environment on the developmental course of ADHD symptomatology. However, associations between family-level variables (maternal hostility, maternal depressive symptoms) and child behaviors (developmental course of ADHD and aggression) may be explained by genes that are shared by biologically related parents and children. Furthermore, ADHD symptoms and aggression commonly co-occur: it is important to consider both simultaneously to have a better understanding of processes underlying the developmental course of ADHD and aggression. To addresses these issues, we employed a longitudinal genetically sensitive parent-offspring adoption design. Analyses were conducted using Cohort I (n = 340) of the Early Growth and Development Study with cross-validation analyses conducted with Cohort II (n = 178). Adoptive mother hostility, but not depression, was associated with later child ADHD symptoms and aggression. Mothers and their adopted children were genetically unrelated, removing passive rGE as a possible explanation. Early child impulsivity/activation was associated with later ADHD symptoms and aggression. Child impulsivity/activation was also associated with maternal hostility, with some evidence for evocative gene-environment correlation processes on adoptive mother depressive symptoms. This study provides novel insights into family-based environmental influences on child ADHD and aggression symptoms, independent of shared parental genetic factors, implications of which are further explicated in the discussion.",Remaining

41,12941437,Life sciences,Modulation of MK-801-elicited mouse popping behavior by galantamine is complex and dose-dependent.,"The ability of phencyclidine (PCP), a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, to precipitate a schizophreniform psychosis in susceptible individuals is consistent with the hypothesized pathologic occurrence of NMDA receptor hypofunction in this disorder. Because the psychosis caused by PCP resembles schizophrenia in all of the relevant domains of psychopathology, investigators have sought to characterize animal models of NMDA receptor hypofunction. MK-801 (dizocilpine) binds to the same hydrophobic channel domain in the NMDA receptor-associated ionophore as PCP, and has been shown to elicit intense irregular episodes of jumping behavior in mice, termed 'popping.' MK-801-elicited mouse popping is an animal model of NMDA receptor hypofunction that has been used to screen novel candidate compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia. Recently, a selective abnormality in the transduction of the acetylcholine signal at the level of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor has been described in schizophrenia. The existence of a nicotinic cholinergic abnormality in schizophrenia has stimulated interest in a potential therapeutic role for positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic receptors. Galantamine is a compound that possesses two interesting properties: inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic neurotransmission. Theoretically, galantamine would be expected to increase the efficiency or likelihood that acetylcholine will promote channel opening and ionic conductance at nicotinic receptors. As expected, in the current investigation statistically significant popping behavior was elicited by MK-801 in mice (T(22) = 2.16, P < 0.05). This MK-801-elicited popping was significantly attenuated by 100 mg/kg of galantamine (T(22) = 2.24, P < 0.05).

In many cases paediatricians are the first point of contact. In order to increase recognition rates, screening instruments may be a helpful support for health care professionals. However, there is a lack of valid and economical screening instruments for primary care patients. Thus, the aim of the study was the development of the new Depression Screener for Teenagers (DesTeen) and its validation in a paediatric sample.	326 patients between 13 and 16 years old completed the DesTeen and a diagnostic interview, serving as gold standard. Prevalence rate for any depressive disorder (minor depression, major depression and dysthymia) was 12.6%. Psychometric properties were calculated. For validity measures, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for any depressive disorder and the diagnostic subgroups was computed.	DesTeen showed a high reliability (Cronbach's α=.87) and a high validity (AUC=.91). For the diagnostic subgroups AUC values did not significantly differ from overall accuracy of any depressive disorder (major depression: AUC=.95, p=.179; dysthymia: AUC=.88, p=.605; minor depression: AUC=.87, p=.327). The optimal cut-off point for any depressive disorder according to the Youden-Index yielded a sensitivity of .90 and a specificity of .80. An abbreviated 5-item version of DesTeen showed no loss in validity (AUC=.90, p=.695).	Overall, DesTeen can be regarded as a valid screening instrument for adolescent paediatric patients. For practical use, the 5-item version is even more promising. A replication of these results is essential.",Remaining
44,9109103,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Low rate of membrane lithium transport during treatment correlates with outcome of maintenance pharmacotherapy in bipolar disorder.,"Lithium is transported across cell membranes by an exchange diffusion process (Na(+)-Li+ countertransport) that is inhibited during lithium treatment. We hypothesized that low rates of lithium efflux (a potential manifestation of strong transport inhibition) would be associated with better clinical outcome of maintenance pharmacotherapy. We measured the erythrocyte (RBC) apparent rate constant for lithium efflux (kexch) in 22 patients with bipolar disorder who had been euthymic on lithium for 1 month. Subsequently, clinical mood ratings and in vivo RBC: plasma lithium ratios (LiR) were determined monthly. Outcome was categorized according to whether subjects completed 1 year of successful maintenance treatment (n = 10), experienced a recurrent affective episode (n = 8), or dropped out (n = 4). The kexch at the outset of the study was significantly lower (potentially because of greater transport inhibition) in 1-year completers than in patients with recurrences or those who dropped out (median kexch = 0.09, 0.24, and 0.27 h-1, respectively; P < .03). Moreover, 77% of patients with a kexch of 0.11 h-1 or lower were successfully maintained on lithium for 1 year, whereas only 23% of those with a kexch greater than or equal to 0.12 h-1 had a successful treatment outcome. LiR measured during the course of maintenance treatment was significantly higher (suggesting greater transport inhibition) in 1-year completers than in noncompleters (recurrences and dropouts). Measurement of kexch at an early point in treatment may provide a means for prospectively identifying those bipolar patients at greater risk for failure of maintenance lithium therapy.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

STA OP! aims to identify physical and other needs as causes of behavioral changes and uses a stepwise approach for psychosocial and pharmacological management which was effective in improving challenging behavior.	To assess whether implementation of the stepwise multidisciplinary intervention also reduces pain and improves pain management.	In a cluster randomized controlled trial (Netherlands National Trial Register NTR1967), healthcare professionals of intervention units received the stepwise training, while training of the control group focused on knowledge and skills without the stepwise component.

Two cross-sectional surveys 20 years apart.	The surveys were performed at two Norwegian medical faculties in 1993 and 2015.	One hundred and seventy-four first-year medical students in 1993 were compared with 169 students in 2015.	Mental distress (Hopkins Symptom Checklist 5) and Mental Health Problems in Need of Treatment.	Mental distress increased from 1993 to 2015 (p<0.001) due to a larger increase among female students, which seemed to be of clinical importance (Cohen's d=0.63). There was a significant gender difference in mental distress in 2015 (p=0.007), but not in 1993. Independent factors associated with mental distress in 2015 were female sex (p<0.001), low perceived social support from parents (p=0.023) and low perceived social support from other friends (p=0.048). Additional analyses showed that social support from friends was more important for female students than for their male peers. From 1993 to 2015, there was no significant increase in the proportion of female students reporting previous mental health problems in need of treatment (21.3% vs 27.8%), but we found a significant increase in help-seeking among those in need of treatment over these years from 30.0% (6/20) to 74.3% (26/35; p=0.003).	We found a significant increase in mental distress among female medical students over the past 20 years, but also a promising increase in help-seeking among those in need of treatment. The strong and important association between low social support and mental distress should urge both universities and students to maintain students' social life after entering medical school.",Remaining
48,33860704,Aging & mental health,Medical help-seeking intentions for cognitive impairment by the patient.,"Objectives: Older adults represent one of the fastest growing population groups. As the aged population increases, incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias will also increase. Professionals agree that early intervention is essential for therapeutic and quality of life purposes; however, many older adults wait several months or years to seek medical help after first noticing signs of cognitive impairment. The present study sought to identify the predictors of help-seeking for cognitive impairment by an individual for him/herself after the first detection of symptoms.Method: An online survey was administered to adults (N = 250) 50 years old and older. Individuals responded about their help-seeking intentions in response to a hypothetical vignette depicting symptoms of cognitive decline derived from a similar study with caregivers conducted by Qualls and colleagues. Additional standardized measures measuring constructs such as knowledge of Alzheimer's disease were completed.Results: The present study reveals that cognitive (i.e. symptom identification and disease attribution) and affective (i.e. symptom impact and threat appraisal) factors, as well as an interaction between the two, are predictive of help-seeking intentions with excellent model fit.Conclusion: Help-seeking intentions by individuals with possible cognitive impairment are comparable to those of potential caregivers. Contrary to hypotheses, high threat appraisal positively predicted help-seeking intentions despite the expectation that threat-induced fear would lead to avoidance. Recommendations are made for future research to further investigate both patients' help-seeking intentions and actions in response to signs of cognitive impairment.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1910791 .",Remaining
49,23398776,International journal of older people nursing,How much do residential aged care staff members know about the nutritional needs of residents?,"Undernutrition, weight loss and dehydration are major clinical issues for people with dementia in residential care, with excessive weight loss contributing to increased risk of frailty, immobility, illness and premature morbidity. This paper discusses a nutritional knowledge and attitudes survey conducted as part of a larger project focused on improving nutritional intake of people with dementia within a residential care facility in Brisbane, Australia.	The specific aims of the survey were to identify (i) knowledge of the nutritional needs of aged care facility residents; (ii) mealtime practices; and (iii) attitudes towards mealtime practices and organisation.	A survey based on those used in other healthcare settings was completed by 76 staff members. The survey included questions about nutritional knowledge, opinions of the food service, frequency of feeding assistance provided and feeding assessment practices.	Nutritional knowledge scores ranged from 1 to 9 of a possible 10, with a mean score of 4.67. While 76% of respondents correctly identified risk factors associated with malnutrition in nursing home residents, only 38% of participants correctly identified the need for increased protein and energy in residents with pressure ulcers, and just 15% exhibited correct knowledge of fluid requirements. Further, while nutritional assessment was considered an important part of practice by 83% of respondents, just 53% indicated that they actually carried out such assessments. Identified barriers to promoting optimal nutrition included insufficient time to observe residents (56%); being unaware of residents' feeding issues (46%); poor knowledge of nutritional assessments (44%); and unappetising appearance of food served (57%).	An important step towards improving health and quality of life for residents of aged care facilities would be to enhance staff nutritional awareness and assessment skills. This should be carried out through increased attention to both preservice curricula and on-the-job training.	The residential facility staff surveyed demonstrated low levels of nutrition knowledge, which reflects findings from the international literature. This has implications for the provision of responsive care to residents of these facilities and should be explored further.",Remaining

The Folts model was used in 60 rabbits. After anesthesia, the carotid artery was exposed and a 75% stenosis was induced. A compression injury of the artery triggered a series of cyclic flow reductions (CFRs). After counting baseline CFRs, animals were assigned randomly to one of four groups (n = 15 in each): control, PRP, rFVIIa and placebo. Control animals received 10 mL.kg(-1) of saline while 10 mL.kg(-1) of a hydroxyethyl starch solution (200,000/6%/0.5) were infused in the three other groups. CFRs were measured again, followed by treatment with PRP, rFVIIa or placebo and by a final measurement of CFRs. At the end of each observation period, an ear immersion bleeding time (BT) was measured and a blood sample was drawn for the evaluation of hematological variables. Microvascular bleeding was evaluated at the end of the experiment in grams of blood shed from liver and spleen sections. Results are presented as median (range).	rFVIIa shortened the BT and decreased microvascular bleeding as compared with placebo [60 (35-100) sec vs 110 (50-140) sec, P = 0.0019 and 9 (4-24) g vs 17 (5-28) g, P = 0.002, respectively]. rFVIIa did not increase CFRs [3(0-9) vs |(0-5), P = 0.11].	rFVIIa led to a decrease in BT and microvascular bleeding but did not significantly affect arterial thrombosis in rabbits.",Animal-drug-intervention

We examined within-trial spatial memory by using a relocation search paradigm introduced by Kristjansson (2000) (modified from Horowitz & Wolfe, 1998), in which the display items traded places every 110ms so that the target was never to be found in the same location from one moment to the next (the relocation condition), as compared with a static condition where the display items remained in place for the whole trial duration. To equate appearance between the two conditions, all items changed orientation every 110ms in both conditions, and were masked after each of the briefly presented visual arrays. The results showed that search was disrupted by item relocation for both patients and controls, but importantly this disruption was only seen in the right visual field for the patients, not the left, indicating that their spatial working memory in left visual space is already severely disrupted, and to a greater degree than for their right visual space, in contrast to what has been previously argued.",Remaining
53,11222467,Circulation,Chronic infections and the risk of carotid atherosclerosis: prospective results from a large population study.,"Chronic infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, yet from an epidemiological perspective, this concept remains controversial.	The Bruneck Study is a prospective population-based survey on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In 826 men and women 40 to 79 years old (1990 baseline), 5-year changes in carotid atherosclerosis were thoroughly assessed by high-resolution duplex scanning. The presence of chronic respiratory, urinary tract, dental, and other infections was ascertained by standard diagnostic criteria. Chronic infections amplified the risk of atherosclerosis development in the carotid arteries. The association was most pronounced in subjects free of carotid atherosclerosis at baseline (age-/sex-adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] for any chronic infection versus none, 4.08 [2.42 to 6.85]; P:<0.0001) and applied to all types of chronic (bacterial) infections. It remained independently significant after adjustment for classic vascular risk attributes and extended to low-risk individuals free of conventional risk factors. Among subjects with chronic infections, atherosclerosis risk was highest in those with a prominent inflammatory response. Markers of systemic inflammation, such as soluble adhesion molecules and circulating bacterial endotoxin, and levels of soluble human heat-shock protein 60 and antibodies to mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 were elevated in subjects with chronic infections and predictive of an increased risk of atherosclerosis.	The present study provides solid evidence for a role of common chronic infections in human atherogenesis. Induction of systemic inflammation and autoimmunity may be potential pathophysiological links.",Remaining

An exploratory pragmatic randomised controlled trial.,"Community mental health nurses (CMHNs) are the backbone of specialist mental health services in the UK. This study evaluated the effects of training CMHNs in a systematic psychosocial intervention (PSI), to help family carers manage behavioural changes in their relative with dementia.	One hundred and thirteen family carers received PSI support from a 'trained' (experimental), or a 'usual practice' (control) CMHN. Primary (day-to-day behaviour problems and management) and secondary (carer mood) outcome measures were obtained at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. CMHN training and supervision commenced prior to, and continued throughout, the 18-month study.	Patient cognition declined in both groups, but problem behaviour reduced in experimental group families. However this effect was associated with the practice of some, not all, CMHNs. Carer management and mood improved with PSI support. In contrast, by 18 months, families supported by conventional CMHNs reported reduced coping resources, increased problem behaviour and their level of depression worsened. Only two CMHNs adhered to the PSI-protocol.	Some, but not all, 'trained' CMHNs used the PSI to help family carers reduce behavioural problems. A relatively long but not intensive PSI of 12-18 months was needed to moderate carer mood. Dementia-specific practice arrangements, training and sustained clinical supervision are important for the delivery of effective psychosocial interventions in dementia.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention

57,37578236,Journal of virology,The La Crosse virus class II fusion glycoprotein ij loop contributes to infectivity and replication in vitro and in vivo.,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are an emerging and evolving global public health threat, with limited antiviral treatments or vaccines available. La Crosse virus (LACV) from the Bunyavirales order is responsible for pediatric encephalitis cases in the United States, yet little is known about the infectivity of LACV. Given the structural similarities between class II fusion glycoproteins of LACV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus from the Togaviridae family, we hypothesized that LACV would share similar entry mechanisms with CHIKV. To test this hypothesis, we performed cholesterol-depletion and repletion assays and used cholesterol-modulating compounds to study LACV entry and replication. We found that LACV entry was cholesterol dependent, while replication was less affected by cholesterol manipulation. In addition, we generated single-point mutants in the LACV Gc ij loop that corresponded to known CHIKV residues important for virus entry. We found that a conserved histidine and alanine residue in the Gc ij loop impaired virus infectivity and attenuated LACV replication in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we took an evolution-based approach to explore how the LACV glycoprotein evolves in mosquitoes and mice. We found multiple variants that cluster in the Gc glycoprotein head domain, providing evidence for the Gc glycoprotein as a contributor to LACV adaptation. Together, these results begin to characterize the mechanisms of LACV infectivity and how the LACV glycoprotein contributes to replication and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Vector-borne viruses are significant health threats that lead to devastating disease worldwide. The emergence of arboviruses, in addition to the lack of effective antivirals or vaccines, highlights the need to study how arboviruses replicate at the molecular level. One potential antiviral target is the class II fusion glycoprotein. Alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and bunyaviruses encode a class II fusion glycoprotein that contains strong structural similarities at the tip of domain II. Here, we show that the bunyavirus La Crosse virus uses a cholesterol-dependent entry pathway similar to the alphavirus chikungunya virus, and residues in the ij loop are important for virus infectivity in vitro and replication in mice. These studies show that genetically diverse viruses may use similar pathways through conserved structure domains, suggesting that these viruses may be targets for broad-spectrum antivirals in multiple arboviral families.",Animal-other
58,8825886,American journal of medical genetics,Sensory gating deficits in parents of schizophrenics.,"Although schizophrenia clusters in families, it is not inherited in Mendelian fashion. This suggests that there may be alternative phenotypic expressions of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia, such as more elementary physiological or biochemical defects. One proposed phenotype is impaired inhibitory gating of the auditory evoked potential to repeated stimuli. Normally, the amplitude of the P50 response to the second stimulus is significantly less than the response to the first, but this gating of response is generally impaired in schizophrenia. Clinically unaffected individuals within a pedigree who have both an ancestral and descendant history of schizophrenia may be useful for studying whether this physiological defect is a possible alternative phenotype. We have studied inhibitory gating of the auditory P50 response to pairs of auditory stimuli in 17 nuclear families. In 11, there was one parent who had another relative with a chronic psychotic illness, in addition to the schizophrenic proband. All of the parents with family histories of schizophrenia had gating of the P50 response similar to their schizophrenia offspring, whereas only 7% of the parents without family history had gating of the P50 response in the abnormal range. These results support loss of gating of the auditory P50 wave as an inherited deficit related to schizophrenia and suggest that studies of parents may help elucidate the neurobiological expression of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia.",Remaining

The bibliographic search was conducted using the databases CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane Library and PsycInfo.	The results of research conducted on 7 randomized controlled trials, including 3 pilot studies have shown after expressive writing sessions (experimental group) versus neutral writing (control group) a significant reduction in distress in the experimental group early stages of cancer (p = 0,0183); in patients with a diagnosis of metastatic assigned to the group expressive writing there was a statistically significant relevance in the reduction of mood disorders (p = 0,03).Were determined statistically significant group differences also with respect to some measure on the quality of sleep (p = 0,04). The expressive writing did not produce significant reductions in psychological distress and improvements in physical health (p > 0,20) in patients diagnosed with metastatic disease of long duration and, in the palliative care there have been results of feasibility for poor adherence at follow-up.

Thus, it has been reported recently that both the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) and the IL1beta (IL1B) genes may influence the risk of ALD in Japanese alcoholics. We analysed the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the IL1A, IL1B, IL1R1 and IL1RN genes in alcoholic and non-alcoholic Spanish subjects.	DNA samples were obtained from 139 male alcoholics, 78 of whom were diagnosed as alcohol dependent (32 patients with liver cirrhosis and 46 without ALD) and 61 as alcohol abusers (25 with liver cirrhosis and 36 without ALD). As a control, we studied 81 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers.	Alleles -511 IL1B*1 and IL1RN*1 were represented more in alcoholic patients than in the control group. We did not find any association of alcoholism or ALD with polymorphisms in the IL1A and IL1R1 genes.	We conclude that the proteins encoded by the IL1RN and IL1B genes may be involved in susceptibility to alcoholism in Spanish men, probably through a different pathway from that involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response.",Remaining

The clinical data of PVE patients admitted to Beijing Anzhen Hospital from January 1997 to August 2018 were retrospectively analyzed.	In total, 62 patients with PVE were enrolled (45 males, 17 females). The patients' age ranged from 23 to 79 years (51.69 ± 15.01). Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) was the most common reason for valve replacement. Of the patients, 58 were found to have vegetations by echocardiography. Blood cultures revealed the most common pathogens to be Staphylococcus (12 cases) and fungal infections (n = 7); 18 (29.03%) patients had strokes. There were 12 cases of ischemic stroke, three cases of cerebral hemorrhage, one case of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and two cases of unclear etiology. The most commonly found clinical symptoms of stroke patients were hemiplegia (n = 10) and coma (n = 5). The five patients in coma died during hospitalization. The incidence of RHD, double valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and mitral valve vegetation was significantly higher in the stroke group than in the non-stroke group (p = 0.045, 0.000, 0.033, and 0.045, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratios (ORs) for RHD, double valve replacement, and fungal infection as risk factors of stroke were 7.26 (95% CI: 1.23-42.68), 25.60 (95%CI: 4.33-126.16), and 20.58 (95% CI: 2.13-198.82), respectively, and were statistically significant. Eight patients died during hospitalization and the in-hospital mortality was 12.90%. The OR for in-hospital mortality with concurrent stroke was 5.13 (95% CI: 1.08-24.46, p = 0.028).	Stroke is a common complication in PVE that increases patient mortality.

The main objective of this pilot study was to clearly identify the number of factors present in the SIB and to analyze the relationships between the different cognitive domains explored by the SIB and loss of autonomy. We administered the SIB, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and two scales of dependency to 48 patients with Alzheimer's disease in its late stages. A factorial analysis (Principal Components Analysis) showed a 4-factor solution for the SIB: a cognitive factor, a praxis and visuospatial functions factor, the reactivity to external stimuli factor and the social aptitudes factor. A factorial analysis involving the dependency scales showed a cognitive factor, a dependency and constructional praxis factor, the reactivity to external stimuli factor and the social aptitudes factor. Reactivity to external stimuli and social aptitudes were not significantly correlated to cognitive aspects nor to dependency. The finding of dependency as a factor different from cognitive deterioration suggests that, in setting a treatment strategy for demented patients, attempts should be made to treat dependency in its own right. In addition, since reactivity to external stimuli and social aptitudes are not related to cognitive aspects nor to dependency, these functions should also be encouraged and stimulated.",Remaining

Design Cross-sectional studies of carotid artery atherosclerosis in 24,822 Chinese adults from the China Kadoorie Biobank and 2579 Europeans from the UK Biobank. Methods Mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries and presence of carotid artery plaque were examined in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) findings in Chinese (mean age 59 years) were compared with a European population (mean age 62 years). Results Overall, the mean cIMT in Chinese was 0.70 mm (SD 0.16) and increased with age by 0.08 mm (SE 0.008) per 10-years older age. About 31% of the Chinese had carotid plaques and the prevalence varied 10-fold with age (6% at 40-49 to 63% at 70-89 years) and four-fold by region (range, 14%-57%). After adjustment for age, sex and region, plaque prevalence was higher in smokers than in non-smokers (36% vs. 28%) and two-fold higher in individuals with systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg than those with systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg (44% vs. 22%) in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Mean cIMT was similar in the younger Chinese and European adults, but increased more steeply with age in the Chinese (p = 0.002). Conclusions About one-third of Chinese adults had carotid plaques. The rate of progression of carotid atherosclerosis with age was more extreme in the Chinese compared with the European population, highlighting the need for more intensive strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention in China.",Remaining

To investigate the profiles of neuropsychological functions and the morphologic features of the cerebellum, using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging planimetry in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with radiation and chemotherapy.	Thirteen survivors of childhood ALL with onset at age 2 to 5 years and a uniform protocol of treatment involving cranial radiation of 24 Gy and five doses of intrathecal methotrexate sodium participated in the study. Ten controls matched the patients in age and socioeconomic status. Each child was assessed with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests and with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.	The neuropsychological scores were transformed into z scores and clustered into right and left hemisphere measures. Planimetric measures of the cerebellar vermis and pons were collected in the midsagittal plane.	Consistently observed in survivors of ALL were the following: (1) significant cognitive deficits in visual-spatial-motor coordination and figural memory, functions commonly related to the right side of the brain; and (2) hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, lobuli I through V and particularly VI to VII. Lateralization of the neurobehavioral deficits was not reflected in structural brain abnormalities.

Two (1%), who were identified as being at high risk of suicide or self-harm, were referred for immediate psychological assessment. Use of the system can aid the holistic treatment of patients with TMD through appropriate referral. Early identification of mental health problems and concurrent management are most beneficial in those who have had symptoms of TMD for up to two years, and are therefore essential.",Remaining
73,18703815,Stroke,Dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and risk of ischemic stroke in young women.,"Although cigarette smoking is known to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, there are few data on the dose-response relationship between smoking and stroke risk in a young ethnically diverse population.	We used data from the Stroke Prevention in Young Women Study, a population-based case-control study of risk factors for ischemic stroke in women aged 15 to 49 years to examine the relationship between cigarette smoking and ischemic stroke. Historical data, including smoking history, was obtained through standardized interviews. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using logistic regression. Cases (n=466) were women with stroke in the greater Baltimore-Washington area, and controls (n=604) were women free of a stroke history identified by random digit dialing.	After multivariable adjustment, the OR comparing current smokers to never smokers was 2.6 (P<0.0001); no difference in stroke risk was observed between former smokers and never smokers. Adjusted OR increased with increasing number of cigarettes smoked per day (OR=2.2 for 1 to 10 cigs/d; 2.5 for 11 to 20 cigs/d; 4.3 for 21 to 39 cigs/d; 9.1 for 40 or more cigs/d).	These results suggest a strong dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and ischemic stroke risk in young women and reinforce the need for aggressive smoking cessation efforts in young adults.",Remaining
74,25330102,PloS one,Modeling the dynamics of disease states in depression.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and costly disorder associated with considerable morbidity, disability, and risk for suicide. The disorder is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous. Despite intense research efforts, the response rates of antidepressant treatments are relatively low and the etiology and progression of MDD remain poorly understood. Here we use computational modeling to advance our understanding of MDD. First, we propose a systematic and comprehensive definition of disease states, which is based on a type of mathematical model called a finite-state machine. Second, we propose a dynamical systems model for the progression, or dynamics, of MDD. The model is abstract and combines several major factors (mechanisms) that influence the dynamics of MDD. We study under what conditions the model can account for the occurrence and recurrence of depressive episodes and how we can model the effects of antidepressant treatments and cognitive behavioral therapy within the same dynamical systems model through changing a small subset of parameters. Our computational modeling suggests several predictions about MDD. Patients who suffer from depression can be divided into two sub-populations: a high-risk sub-population that has a high risk of developing chronic depression and a low-risk sub-population, in which patients develop depression stochastically with low probability. The success of antidepressant treatment is stochastic, leading to widely different times-to-remission in otherwise identical patients. While the specific details of our model might be subjected to criticism and revisions, our approach shows the potential power of computationally modeling depression and the need for different type of quantitative data for understanding depression.",Remaining

Recently, cell-based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been explored as an effective treatment for CNS diseases. Among the various tissue-derived MSCs, we have isolated human cranial bone-derived MSCs (cMSCs) in our laboratory. In addition, we have focused on simulated microgravity (MG) as a valuable culture environment of MSCs. However, detailed mechanisms underlying functional recovery from transplantation of MSCs cultured under MG conditions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice. Human cMSCs were cultured under 1G and MG conditions, and cMSCs cultured under MG conditions expressed significantly higher messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). In TBI model mice, the transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions (group MG) showed greater motor functional improvement compared with only phosphate-buffered saline administration (group PBS). Moreover, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/b cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) ratio were significantly lower at brain injury sites in mice of group MG than those of group PBS. In addition, an in vitro study showed that the conditioned medium of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions significantly suppressed the cell death of NG108-15 cells exposed to oxidative or inflammatory stress through anti-inflammatory and antiapoptosis effects. These findings demonstrate that culturing cMSCs under simulated MG increases the neuroprotective effects, suggesting that simulated MG cultures may be a useful method for cell-based therapy strategies for CNS diseases.",Animal-non-drug-intervention
76,22843695,The Journal of biological chemistry,Novel one-step immunoassays to quantify α-synuclein: applications for biomarker development and high-throughput screening.,"Familial Parkinson disease (PD) can result from α-synuclein gene multiplication, implicating the reduction of neuronal α-synuclein as a therapeutic target. Moreover, α-synuclein content in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents a PD biomarker candidate. However, capture-based assays for α-synuclein quantification in CSF (such as by ELISA) have shown discrepancies and have limited suitability for high-throughput screening. Here, we describe two sensitive, in-solution, time-resolved Förster's resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based immunoassays for total and oligomeric α-synuclein quantification. CSF analysis showed strong concordance for total α-synuclein content between two TR-FRET assays and, in agreement with a previously characterized 36 h protocol-based ELISA, demonstrated lower α-synuclein levels in PD donors. Critically, the assay suitability for high-throughput screening of siRNA constructs and small molecules aimed at reducing endogenous α-synuclein levels was established and validated. In a small-scale proof of concept compound screen using 384 well plates, signals ranged from <30 to >120% of the mean of vehicle-treated cells for molecules known to lower and increase cellular α-synuclein, respectively. Furthermore, a reverse genetic screen of a kinase-directed siRNA library identified seven genes that modulated α-synuclein protein levels (five whose knockdown increased and two that decreased cellular α-synuclein protein). This provides critical new biological insight into cellular pathways regulating α-synuclein steady-state expression that may help guide further drug discovery efforts. Moreover, we describe an inherent limitation in current α-synuclein oligomer detection methodology, a finding that will direct improvement of future assay design. Our one-step TR-FRET-based platform for α-synuclein quantification provides a novel platform with superior performance parameters for the rapid screening of large biomarker cohorts and of compound and genetic libraries, both of which are essential to the development of PD therapies.",In-vitro-study
77,32421592,Journal of affective disorders,Anxiety predicts dyadic sleep characteristics in couples experiencing insomnia but not in couples without sleep disorders.,"Anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid with sleep problems. Despite growing acknowledgement that bedpartners are important determinants of sleep quality, few studies have explored mental health as a risk factor for disrupted sleep of the bedpartner. We examined whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted an individual's sleep or their bedpartner's sleep, in couples where one partner experienced insomnia and in couples without sleep disorders.	Fifty-two bed-sharing couples where one individual had insomnia ('Patient'), and 55 non-sleep-disordered couples completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Sleep was monitored for seven nights. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models assessed whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted individual or dyadic sleep (wake transmission).	Greater anxiety symptoms predicted increased vulnerability to being woken by their bedpartner, as well as increased frequency of waking their bedpartner up during the night in Patients with insomnia, but not in non-sleep-disordered couples. Neither anxiety nor depression symptoms predicted an individual's or their bedpartner's sleep efficiency in either subsample. However, ISI was positively predicted by own anxiety and depression symptoms for Patients with insomnia and in non-sleep-disordered couples.	The non-sleep-disordered subsample experienced only mild symptoms of anxiety and depression, potentially reducing predictive power.	Anxiety may help reveal social determinants of sleep in couples experiencing insomnia. These data underscore the importance of considering sleep, the bedpartner, and affective symptoms in mental health and sleep assessments.",Remaining

Youngsters were assessed at age 3 years (n = 60) and 3.5 years later (n = 44). Data were collected from children, parents, teachers, and clinicians. Results revealed that most diagnoses of SAD were not stable during this developmental period, as many children drifted toward subclinical or nonclinical status. In addition, children with clinical SAD, compared to those with subclinical SAD or no symptoms of SAD, had a disproportionately higher number of comorbid diagnoses and experienced significantly greater somatic concerns, anxiety, and general internalizing behavior. In addition, their parents experienced greater depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, phobic anxiety, and general distress. The results preliminarily support prior findings that most children experience a dissipation of SAD symptoms in young childhood but that some children continue to experience stable, significant distress. The results are consistent with prior research on older children that SAD remits for many but not all youth and suggest that parent and family variables may have much to do with cases of poor remission in this population.",Remaining

80,21602685,Current opinion in psychiatry,Psychiatric epidemiological surveys in China 1960-2010: how real is the increase of mental disorders?,"Community psychiatric epidemiological surveys over the last five decades have revealed a dramatic increase in the prevalence of mental disorders in China. This article summarizes the main surveys and attempts to interpret the increase of prevalence from a methodological perspective.	Regional and national surveys conducted in China during 1960-1990 focused on severe mental disorders and revealed very low and stable rates of disorders. By contrast, those performed in the last decade, whether psychiatrists or lay interviewers were used, have shown much higher and more 'reliable' rates comparable to those found in high-income countries. This is especially so for depression and anxiety disorders.	Given the sociopolitical turmoil that had previously plagued people in China, the dramatic rise in prevalence estimates of mental disorders in recent years cannot be simply interpreted as a substantive deterioration of mental health following rapid social change. Global and local factors that shape research methodology aimed at showing that mental disorders are common may play an important role in the dramatic increase. Future research in China should move beyond descriptive epidemiology. It should also address policy relevant issues in view of the limited resources available for mental health interventions.",Remaining

But the impact of intensive rehabilitation on the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of intensive rehabilitation on the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke using data from the National Health Insurance Service database. This is a register-based, retrospective cohort study. Using data from the National Health Insurance Service database, we included the patients who received rehabilitation for stroke from 2006 to 2013. Of the 14,984 patients diagnosed with stroke, 2483 died within 1 year, and 2866 did not receive rehabilitation; hence, they were also excluded. The final sample included 9635 (49.2% men, 50.8% women) patients. After correcting for covariates, the Cox model was used to evaluate the effects of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) on survival. We estimated the independent contribution of each factor to the risk of death from the initiation of rehabilitation. Significant differences in mortality were observed according to age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), income level, and stroke type. Patients with stroke who received both PT and OT had a better long-term prognosis than those who received either treatment alone. Therapy performed by a physical therapist with more than 120 hours of training effectively improved the patients' long-term prognosis. Intensive PT and OT will help improve the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke. This study emphasizes the importance of intensive rehabilitation in these patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

83,7771669,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",The Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale: a self-rated instrument for the quantification of thoughts about alcohol and drinking behavior.,"It has been suggested that a crucial dimension of alcohol 'craving' includes the concept of both obsessive thoughts about alcohol use and compulsive behaviors toward drinking. An interview-based rating scale, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-heavy drinkers (YBOCS-hd), has been found useful in quantifying this concept in alcohol-dependent individuals. A self-rating scale, the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) has been developed by us as a modification of the YBOCS-hd. The YBOCS-hd showed excellent interrater reliability in our hands. The correlation between the YBOCS-hd and the OCDS total scores obtained on 60 alcohol-dependent individuals was 0.83. The test-retest correlation for the OCDS total score was 0.96, and the obsessive and compulsive subscales test-retest correlations were 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. The internal consistency of the items in the OCDS was high (0.86) and did not improve significantly with removal of individual items. The shared variance between the OCDS scores and alcohol consumption during the period of evaluation was only approximately 20%, indicating that the dimension measured by the scale was somewhat independent of actual drinking. As such, it might act as an independent measure of the 'state of illness' for alcohol-dependent individuals. When used during a prospective 12-week treatment research study, initial results indicate that the OCDS seems to validly measure a dimension of alcohol dependence, because it decreased from baseline during alcohol reduction and increased in relationship to relapse drinking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Remaining

To further examine the role of OPTN in ALS, we sought to identify novel ALS variants in OPTN and examine their potential for pathogenicity in vitro. Whole exome sequence data from 74 familial ALS cases were analysed for the presence of novel OPTN mutations. Pathogenicity was assessed by analysing effects on Golgi fragmentation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-linked CHOP activation, and cellular localization of optineurin in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells expressing mutant optineurin. We identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation in OPTN (c.883G > T, p.Val295Phe) in a single familial ALS case. This mutation induced recognized cellular features of ALS pathogenesis including Golgi fragmentation and ER stress in NSC-34 cells. In conclusion, the identification of a novel OPTN mutation in an Australian ALS family, and its capacity to induce ALS-like pathological features in vitro, further strengthens evidence for the role of optineurin in the pathogenesis of ALS.",Remaining

87,21885540,Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,Is it safe to stop anticoagulants after successful surgery for atrial fibrillation?,"A best evidence topic in cardiothoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was: is it safe to stop anticoagulants after successful surgery for atrial fibrillation? Altogether, 177 papers were found using the reported search, of which 14 were selected that represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. Selection criteria included study relevance, primary outcome, size of study population and length of follow-up. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The weight of evidence, including over 10,000 patient-years of follow-up, supports the discontinuation of warfarin following atrial fibrillation correction procedures as being safe, with an associated annual thromboembolic stroke rate of 0-3.8% off warfarin, in studies where warfarin was stopped at a mean of 3.6 months (range 0-8 months) after the procedure. However, the confidence of this conclusion suffers from a paucity of high-quality randomized controlled trials in the field, with the main body of evidence coming instead from observational non-randomized studies. The stroke rate also varies with the exact procedure performed; pulmonary vein isolation procedures are the most extensively evaluated and carry the lowest stroke rate following warfarin discontinuation (0-0.4% per annum when performed as an isolated procedure). By contrast, left atrial appendage occlusion by insertion of a transcatheter device has an associated annual stroke rate of 0-3.8% off warfarin. Thus, discontinuation of warfarin following such transcatheter procedures cannot be recommended at this time. Concomitant heart surgeries, such as mitral valve repair have been shown to increase the thromboembolic rate both unpredictably and dramatically, and this review thus identifies concomitant mitral valve surgery as a potentially substantial risk factor for late thromboembolic stroke in patients undergoing corrective surgeries for atrial fibrillation. This review finds in favour of warfarin discontinuation in selected patients at three months post-procedure, emphasizing consideration of the patient's individual risk-factor profile as paramount. This recommendation is in line with the 2010 guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation produced by the European Society of Cardiology.",Non-systematic-review

High somatic burden may reflect an underlying appraisal about somatic cues, which extend in part to interpretation of cognitive cues.",Remaining
90,18375019,Neurobiology of aging,Interferon-gamma-dependent cytotoxic activation of human astrocytes and astrocytoma cells.,"Astrocytes and microglia become activated in a broad spectrum of inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases. Activated microglia are widely believed to be the principal source of inflammation-induced neuronal degeneration in these disorders. To investigate the neurotoxic potential of human astrocytes, we exposed them and human astrocytic U-373 MG cells to a variety of inflammatory stimulants. We then assessed the effects of their supernatants on human SH-SY5 cells. When astrocytes and U-373 MG cells were stimulated with interferon (IFN)-gamma (150U/ml), their supernatants significantly reduced SH-SY5Y cell viability. Other powerful inflammatory stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide (0.5mug/ml), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (10ng/ml) and interleukin-1beta (10ng/ml), alone or in combination, were without effect. These combinations were also unable to enhance the IFN-gamma effect. The induced cytotoxicities were reversed by JAK inhibitor I, a potent and specific inhibitor of JAKs. This result indicates that the neurotoxic effect was proceeding through the IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR)-JAK-STAT intracellular pathway. To establish that the IFNGR is expressed on both cultured astrocytes and U-373 MG cells, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA extracts to identify a specific IFNGR product. We showed the protein product on these cultured cells by immunocytochemistry using an antibody to IFNGR. Finally, using human postmortem material, we showed sharp upregulation of the IFNGR on activated astrocytes in affected areas in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. These findings suggest that activated astrocytes may become neurotoxic when stimulated by IFN-gamma and may therefore exacerbate the pathology in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases.",In-vitro-study

Drug-naive MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) -lesioned marmosets were treated for 21 days with l-dopa/LEV or l-dopa alone. Subsequently, the animals were left untreated for 1 week and then both groups were challenged with a single dose of l-dopa alone on day 29.

LEV had no significant effect on the appearance of dyskinesia when administered de novo in combination with l-dopa. However, after a week of drug holiday, the 2 groups exhibited a different response to an acute l-dopa challenge. Thus, animals previously treated with l-dopa alone exhibited a similar level of dyskinesia to that seen on day 21 of the repeated treatment phase of the study. However, animals previously treated with l-dopa/LEV demonstrated significantly reduced dyskinesia compared with day 21 of the repeated treatment phase of the study.	LEV does not modify the onset of dyskinesia following de novo treatment with l-dopa. However, concomitant treatment with l-dopa/LEV reduces the level of dyskinesia induced by l-dopa following a drug holiday. Thus, prior treatment with LEV appears to modify the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of l-dopa-induced dyskinesia.",Animal-drug-intervention
93,37308987,Acta neuropathologica communications,Mass cytometric analysis of the immune cell landscape after traumatic brain injury elucidates the role of complement and complement receptors in neurologic outcomes.,"Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), a neuroinflammatory response can persist for years and contribute to the development of chronic neurological manifestations. Complement plays a central role in post-TBI neuroinflammation, and C3 opsonins and the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) have been implicated in promoting secondary injury. We used single cell mass cytometry to characterize the immune cell landscape of the brain at different time points after TBI. To specifically investigate how complement shapes the post-TBI immune cell landscape, we analyzed TBI brains in the context of CR2-Crry treatment, an inhibitor of C3 activation. We analyzed 13 immune cell types, including peripheral and brain resident cells, and assessed expression of various receptors. TBI modulated the expression of phagocytic and complement receptors on both brain resident and infiltrating peripheral immune cells, and distinct functional clusters were identified within same cell populations that emerge at different phases after TBI. In particular, a CD11c+ (CR4) microglia subpopulation continued to expand over 28 days after injury, and was the only receptor to show continuous increase over time. Complement inhibition affected the abundance of brain resident immune cells in the injured hemisphere and impacted the expression of functional receptors on infiltrating cells. A role for C5a has also been indicated in models of brain injury, and we found significant upregulation of C5aR1 on many immune cell types after TBI. However, we demonstrated experimentally that while C5aR1 is involved in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain after injury, it does not alone affect histological or behavioral outcomes. However, CR2-Crry improved post-TBI outcomes and reduced resident immune cell populations, as well as complement and phagocytic receptor expression, indicating that its neuroprotective effects are mediated upstream of C5a generation, likely via modulating C3 opsonization and complement receptor expression.",In-vitro-study

We included randomized controlled trials comparing upper limb BoNT injections with a control intervention in patients with a history of stroke. A total of 1212 unique records were screened by 2 independent reviewers. Forty trials were identified, including 2718 patients with history of stroke.	Outcome data were pooled according to assessment timing (ie, 4-8wk and 12wk after injection), and categorized into 6 main clinical goals (ie, spasticity-related pain, involuntary movements, passive joint motion, care ability, arm and hand use, and standing and walking performance). Sensitivity analyses were performed for the influence of study and intervention characteristics, involvement of pharmaceutical industry, and publication bias.	Robust evidence is shown for the effectiveness of BoNT in reducing resistance to passive movement, as measured with the (Modified) Ashworth Score, and improving self-care ability for the affected hand and arm after intervention (P<.005) and at follow-up (P<.005). In addition, robust evidence is shown for the absence of effect on arm-hand capacity at follow-up. BoNT was found to significantly reduce involuntary movements, spasticity-related pain, and caregiver burden, and improve passive range of motion, while no evidence was found for arm and hand use after intervention.	In view of the robustness of current evidence, no further trials are needed to investigate BoNT for its favorable effects on resistance to passive movement of the spastic wrist and fingers, and on self-care. No trials are needed to further confirm the lack of effects of BoNT on arm-hand capacity, whereas additional trials are needed to establish the suggested favorable effects of BoNT on other body functions, which may result in clinically meaningful outcomes at activity and participation levels.",Human-systematic-review
97,26757674,Scientific reports,Interaction of RNA with a C-terminal fragment of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated TDP43 reduces cytotoxicity.,"A hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disease, is formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) from misfolded proteins in neuronal cells. TAR RNA/DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP43) is an ALS-causative protein forming IBs in ALS patients. The relation between localization of the IBs and neurotoxicity remains largely unknown. We characterized aggregation of fluorescently tagged TDP43 and its carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) by analytical fluorescence imaging techniques. Quantitative time-lapse analysis in individual live cells showed that fluorescent-protein-tagged TDP43 was cleaved and a 35 kDa TDP43 CTF (TDP35) formed ubiquitin (Ub)-negative cytoplasmic IBs. Although TDP35 formed mildly toxic Ub-negative IBs in the cytoplasm, TDP25, another type of a TDP43 CTF, efficiently formed sufficiently toxic Ub-positive IBs. One- or two-color fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) revealed that coaggregation of TDP25 with TDP43 was initiated by depletion of the RNA that binds to TDP25. Moreover, nuclear localization tagging TDP25 reduced the rate of neuronal cell death. These observations point to the need to elucidate the novel sequestration mechanism and details of the toxicity of the misfolded and aggregation-prone TDP43 CTFs (as well as the RNA binding and nuclear retention) in order to identify possible preventive interventions against ALS.",In-vitro-study
98,21669013,Journal of child language,Individual differences in pronoun reversal: evidence from two longitudinal case studies.,"Pronoun reversal, the use of you for self-reference and I for an addressee, has often been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and impaired language. However, recent case studies have shown the phenomenon also to occur in typically developing and even precocious talkers. This study examines longitudinal corpus data from two children, a typically developing girl, and a boy with Asperger's syndrome. Both were precocious talkers who reversed the majority of their personal pronouns for several months. A comparison of the children's behaviors revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in pronoun use: the girl showed 'semantic confusion', using second person pronouns for self-reference, whereas the boy showed a discourse-pragmatic deficit related to perspective-taking. The results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms underlying pronoun reversal and provide qualified support for both the Name/Person Hypothesis (Clark, 1978; Charney, 1980b) and the Plurifunctional Pronoun Hypothesis (Chiat, 1982).",Remaining
99,8687254,Archives of psychiatric nursing,Patients' perceptions of psychiatric home care.,"A qualitative study was designed to explore patients' perceptions of psychiatric home care. Nine patients receiving psychiatric home care from a private home-care agency were interviewed using a tool developed by the researcher. Demographic data was collected from the patients' charts. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze characteristics of the patients. Content analysis was conducted on interview transcripts. The aspects of psychiatric home care that patients described as most valuable include companionship, counseling, assistance with housework, and monitoring of vital signs. Patients described positive effects of psychiatric home care on their compliance with psychotropic medication regimens and on their relationships with family members. All patients in this sample received psychiatric services in addition to psychiatric home care. Psychiatric home care appeared to be a major factor in maintaining patients in the community. Nursing implications, limitations of the study, and recommendations for further research are presented.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
100,22428580,Journal of neurochemistry,Parkinson's disease-associated DJ-1 mutations impair mitochondrial dynamics and cause mitochondrial dysfunction.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction represents a critical event during the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and expanding evidences demonstrate that an altered balance in mitochondrial fission/fusion is likely an important mechanism leading to mitochondrial and neuronal dysfunction/degeneration. In this study, we investigated whether DJ-1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and function in neuronal cells. Confocal and electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that M17 human neuroblastoma cells over-expressing wild-type DJ-1 (WT DJ-1 cells) displayed elongated mitochondria while M17 cells over-expressing PD-associated DJ-1 mutants (R98Q, D149A and L166P) (mutant DJ-1 cells) showed significant increase of fragmented mitochondria. Similar mitochondrial fragmentation was also noted in primary hippocampal neurons over-expressing PD-associated mutant forms of DJ-1. Functional analysis revealed that over-expression of PD-associated DJ-1 mutants resulted in mitochondria dysfunction and increased neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress (H(2) O(2)) or neurotoxin. Further immunoblot studies demonstrated that levels of dynamin-like protein (DLP1), also known as Drp1, a regulator of mitochondrial fission, was significantly decreased in WT DJ-1 cells but increased in mutant DJ-1 cells. Importantly, DLP1 knockdown in these mutant DJ-1 cells rescued the abnormal mitochondria morphology and all associated mitochondria/neuronal dysfunction. Taken together, these studies suggest that DJ-1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics through modulation of DLP1 expression and PD-associated DJ-1 mutations may cause PD by impairing mitochondrial dynamics and function.",Remaining

Impact on growth up to two years of age.,"A study was undertaken to investigate growth in children with different types of early feeding problems without any obvious medical explanation. Altogether 42 children were studied and followed up to the age of two years. Twenty-five children refused to eat (RTE), nine had colic, seven had vomiting and one child displayed hyperirritability at mealtimes. Comparisons were made with controls matched for sex, age and residential area. Attained weight and length were measured frequently; rates of gain were calculated and the growth variables were transformed to standard deviation scores (SD scores). After the onset of the symptoms the SD scores of attained weight and length decreased significantly in the children with RTE and in those with vomiting (p less than 0.05), and the rate of weight gain was significantly lower in the RTE group than in the control group (p less than 0.001). At two years of age the children with vomiting had recovered and showed a complete catch-up growth, while the RTE group had attained significantly lower SD scores of attained weight (p less than 0.001) and length (p less than 0.001) than the control group. It was found that the risk of growth impairment was greatest in children who refused all food or all food except breast milk.",Remaining
102,18776066,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,Reliability and sensitivity of a wrist rig to measure motor control and spasticity in poststroke hemiplegia.,"Objective assessment of impairments after stroke is vital for evidence-based therapy and progress monitoring.	This study determines the utility of outcome measures obtained from an instrumented wrist rig for future rehabilitation trials. The tests undertaken were evaluated in terms of sensitivity to detect differences between normal and impaired participants, test-retest repeatability (repeatability coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]), and interrater agreement (Bland and Altman limits of agreement).	Twelve participants with chronic poststroke hemiparesis (mean 5.6 years); and 12 unimpaired volunteers performed a series of tasks in the rig. The hemiparetic arm (impaired group) and dominant arm (unimpaired group) were tested in 3 sessions on the same day by 2 assessors. Signals were analyzed to derive a tracking index (motor control), stretch index (spasticity), flexor modulation index (FMI) (muscle activation), force angle index (FAI) (stiffness), range of movement, and isometric force.	The means of all tests differed between impaired and unimpaired participants except for range of movement into flexion, the FAI, and the FMI. Repeatability coefficients for each test are presented as benchmark values for use in future trials in which the wrist rig tests may be used to detect change. Test-retest reliability was excellent in the impaired group (ICC = 0.88-0.98) and poor to excellent in the unimpaired group (ICC = 0.06-0.89). The Bland-Altman ranges showed no bias between assessors, and that the interassessor variability was similar to that between repeats by the same assessor for most tests.",Remaining

The patients treated two migraine attacks at home by subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan or placebo for the first attack and the alternative medication, i.e. placebo or sumatriptan, for the second attack (crossover). Following treatment, a neurology resident interviewed and examined the patients.	When sumatriptan was compared to placebo, significantly more of the 209 evaluable patients reported headache relief at 1 h (56% vs 8%, p < 0.001) and 2 h (62% vs 15%, p < 0.001) after the first injection. Resolution of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia was significantly more common in patients on sumatriptan than in those on placebo (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The adverse events were usually transient and of mild or moderate severity; however, three patients withdrew due to adverse events. Ninety-five percent of patients evaluated by a neurology resident met the IHS criteria for migraine.

106,29531139,Diabetes,Altered Brain Dynamics in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes During Working Memory Processing.,"It is now generally accepted that diabetes increases the risk for cognitive impairment, but the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. A critical problem in linking diabetes to cognitive impairment is that patients often have multiple comorbidities (e.g., obesity, hypertension) that have been independently linked to cognitive deficits. In the study reported here we focused on young adults with and without type 1 diabetes who were virtually free of such comorbidities. The two groups were matched on major health and demographic factors, and all participants completed a verbal working memory task during magnetoencephalographic brain imaging. We hypothesized that patients would have altered neural dynamics in verbal working memory processing and that these differences would directly relate to clinical disease measures. Accordingly, we found that patients had significantly stronger neural responses in the superior parietal cortices during memory encoding and significantly weaker activity in parietal-occipital regions during maintenance compared with control subjects. Moreover, disease duration and glycemic control were both significantly correlated with neural responses in various brain regions. In conclusion, young healthy adults with type 1 diabetes already have aberrant neural processing relative to their peers without diabetes, using compensatory responses to perform the task, and glucose management and duration may play a central role.",Remaining

Results were compared to the clinical findings. Questionnaires had closed questions, ranked and non-ranked, as well as open questions and visual analogue scales. Percentages were calculated by SPSS statistical software.	A total of 119 women (89%) returned questionnaires, allowing a mean follow-up interval of 2.8 years; 68% reported that dyspareunia was cured completely, and for 24% it was lessened. Twenty-two percent said they perceived a different pain after surgery, many identifying it as muscular. Eighty-seven percent said they would have the procedure again. Qualitative responses revealed the importance of physical therapy, the complexities of pain issues, the toll on emotions and relationships and suggestions for more education of health practitioners and women generally about this entity.	A large majority of women who underwent superficial vestibule surgery for vestibulodynia found it quite acceptable and instrumental in treating dyspareunia. Many wished they had had it sooner. Individualized, superficial surgery is very effective and should not be withheld if short-term medical and physical therapy have proven to be incomplete therapies.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

However, previous analyses involving LOHS did not consider confounding or indirect factors, or the effects of other factors on LOHS and inpatient costs.	To investigate the direct and indirect effects of LOHS on the hospitalization costs of inpatients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.	This was a population-based, retrospective, and observational study that analyzed data acquired from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2015 and 2020 relating to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in Ningxia, China.	Hospitalizations were identified by the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10). Inpatient costs were described by the median M (P25, P75). We used a quantile regression model to estimate the linear relationships between a group of independent variables X and the quantile of the explained variable hospitalization cost (Y). A structural equation model (SEM) was then used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of LOHS on inpatient costs.	The study included 129,444 patients with ischemic stroke and 15,525 patients with hemorrhagic stroke. The median LOHS was 10 (8-13) days for ischemic stroke and 15 (10-22) days for hemorrhagic stroke. The median M (P25, P75) of inpatient costs was $1020 (742-1545) for ischemic stroke and 2813 (1576-6191) for hemorrhagic stroke. The total effect of LOHS on inpatient costs was 0.795 in patients with ischemic stroke. The effect of yearof discharge (X4) and CCI (X8) on inpatient costs was dominated by an indirect effect through the LOHS. The indirect effect was -0.071 (84.52% of the total effect value) and 0.034 (69.39% of the total effect value), respectively. The total effect of LOHS on inpatient costs in patients with hemorrhagic stroke was 0.754. The influence of CCI on inpatient costs was dominated by an indirect effect through LOHS; the indirect effect value was -0.028 (77.78% of the total effect value). The payment type, surgery, method of discharge, and hospital level also exerted an impact on inpatient costs by direct and indirect effects through the LOHS.	Length of hospital stay (LOHS) was identified as the main factor influencing hospitalization costs. However, other social factors were shown to indirectly influence hospitalization costs through the LOHS. Taking effective measures to further reduce hospitalization costs remains an effective way to control hospitalization costs for stroke patients.",Remaining

The aim of this study was to compare the 2D:4D digit ratio, which is considered to be a morphological indicator of exposure to testosterone in the prenatal period, in individuals with GD.	The study included 99 participants diagnosed with GD comprising 54 assigned the female gender at birth [AFB-GD], 45 assigned the male gender at birth [AMB-GD], and 58 female and 58 male participants making up the control group. The right and the left hands of the participants were photocopied and finger lengths were measured using digital calipers.	The 2D:4D digit ratio on the right hand of the AFB-GD group was significantly lower (p=0.028) than that of the female controls, but it did not differ significantly as compared to male controls. The ratio on the left hand of the AFB-GD group did not significantly differ from that of the female controls, but it was higher than that of the male controls (p=0.045).

The purpose of this study was to confirm that APOE allele polymorphism also represents a risk factor for unfavorable outcomes following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).	A total of 104 patients with aneurysmal SAH were studied. Computed tomography (CT) scan findings of SAH were assessed by Fisher's grade and clinical neurologic assessment was performed using the Hunt and Hess (H&H)grading system. Serum lipids were also analyzed. Outcomes at 3 months after SAH were determined using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.	The distributions of APOE genotypes and alleles of patients were matched with those of control subjects. That 5 of 18 patients with APOE-E4 allele (28%) had an unfavorable outcome was significantly different from those without APOE-E4 (8%, chi2, p = 0.032; OR = 4.34, 95% CI 1.20-15.75). However, the presence or absence of E2 or E3 alleles had no significant difference. The relative hazard of APOE-E4 for unfavorable outcome exited after adjustment for clinical assessment (OR = 6.95, 95% CI 1.21-39.75). Total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B were elevated in patients with unfavorable rather than favorable outcomes.	Our findings confirmed that the patients with APOE-E4 allele were predisposed to unfavorable outcomes after aneurysmal SAH even though an association between APOE and incidence of the SAH may not exist. The effect of APOE on neurobiology and lipoprotein metabolism seems to partially explain the difference in outcomes and deserves further study.",Remaining

The NMDA and GABAA receptors are involved in neurodevelopment and the pathophysiology of various mental disorders in children and adolescents. Male and female juvenile rats were treated orally with risperidone (0.3 mg/kg, 3 times/day), aripiprazole (1 mg/kg), olanzapine (1 mg/kg) or vehicle (control), starting from postnatal day (PD) 23 (±1 day) for 3 weeks (corresponding to the childhood-adolescent period in humans). Quantitative autoradiography was used to detect the binding density of [[3]H]MK-801 (an NMDA receptor antagonist) and [[3]H]muscimol (a selective GABAA receptor agonist). Aripiprazole elevated the [[3]H]MK801 binding levels in the NAcC of male rats, and the NAcS and CPu of female rats. Risperidone increased [[3]H]MK801 levels in the CPu of female rats, and the NAcS of male rats. Aripiprazole upregulated [[3]H]muscimol binding levels in the CPu and NAcC of male rats, while it elevated the [[3]H]muscimol levels in the PFC of female rats, compared to controls.

However, concern about side-effects may deter clinicians from prescribing these life-saving drugs. In reality, absolute contraindications are rare. Only 3-5% of patients are intolerant because of hypotension or bradycardia. Data from randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies show that most patients eligible to receive BB tolerate them well. BB are not contraindicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); in fact, these patients also benefit because of their high cardiovascular risk. In patients with COPD, as in the elderly, BB should be started at a low dose and uptitrated slowly. Monitoring of lung function during initiation is important, as undiagnosed coexistent asthma could be revealed. When patients are unaware of the drug in use, erectile dysfunction (ED) is reported no more often with BB than with any other drug prescribed for heart failure or hypertension. However, when patients are aware of the potential side-effects of BB, the resultant anxiety may cause ED. Patients should be reassured that BB prolong life and in the great majority are not the cause of ED, which may rather be related to the underlying disease (diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis).",Non-systematic-review

The meta-analysis showed that the use of animal derived surfactant rather than protein free synthetic surfactant resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of pneumothorax [typical relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.77; typical risk difference (RD) -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 11 studies, 5356 infants] and a marginal reduction in the risk of mortality (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99; typical RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.00; NNTB 50; 13 studies, 5413 infants).Animal derived surfactant was associated with an increase in the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis [typical RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 50; 8 studies, 3462 infants] and a marginal increase in the risk of any intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05; 10 studies, 5045 infants) but no increase in Grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; 9 studies, 4241 infants).The meta-analyses supported a marginal decrease in the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality associated with the use of animal derived surfactant preparations (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00; 6 studies, 3811 infants). No other relevant differences in outcomes were noted.	Both animal derived surfactant extracts and protein free synthetic surfactant extracts are effective in the treatment and prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Comparative trials demonstrate greater early improvement in the requirement for ventilator support, fewer pneumothoraces, and fewer deaths associated with animal derived surfactant extract treatment. Animal derived surfactant may be associated with an increase in necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage, though the more serious hemorrhages (Grade 3 and 4) are not increased. Despite these concerns, animal derived surfactant extracts would seem to be the more desirable choice when compared to currently available protein free synthetic surfactants.",Human-systematic-review
119,15907750,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Differentiating anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with partial epilepsy.,"Anxiety and depression are separate psychiatric conditions that are often interrelated. This study examines whether they exist independently in this population of patients with partial epilepsy and if they affect all quality-of-life domains. Adult epilepsy patients taking two or more antiepileptic drugs completed a health status survey including demographic items, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-10 (QOLIE-10). The questionnaire was completed by 201 epilepsy patients. Symptom prevalences of anxiety (52% none, 25% mild, 16% moderate, 7% severe) and depression (62% none, 20% mild, 14% moderate, 4% severe) were high. All health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) domains worsened significantly with increasing levels of anxiety and depression: Total QOLIE-10 scores decreased from 72+/-18 in patients with no anxiety to 54+/-13 in those with mild, 48+/-18 in those with moderate, and 40+/-23 in those with severe anxiety (P<0.0001). Total QOLIE-10 scores decreased from 70+/-16 in patients with no depression to 50+/-16 in those with mild, 45+/-16 in those with moderate, and 24+/-21 in those with severe depression (P<0.0001). No significant difference in anxiety scores was observed controlling for seizure frequency or epilepsy duration. Regression analyses showed that anxiety and depression account for different proportions of variance as predictors of HRQOL (R2=0.337 (anxiety) and 0.511 (depression)). The data suggest that patients may benefit from increased attention to the role of anxiety separately from depression.",Remaining

The experimental paradigm employed was the use of electroencephalography to measure the detection of semantic incongruity within written sentences, as indexed by an N400 event-related potential. Whilst the seven controls appropriately demonstrated N400 potentials only to semantically incongruent stimuli, the seven participants with AS inappropriately demonstrated N400 potentials to congruent stimuli. These results are compatible with the possibility that the participants with AS did not use the context within sentences to predict the final word of the sentences.",Remaining

However, clinical studies are conducted with specific populations that differ from the real world. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of alectinib in real-world settings. Patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EML4-ALK fusion were enrolled from two medical centers between June 2018 and June 2020. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) to alectinib. The secondary endpoint was response of brain metastases. The risk factors for disease progression were also investigated. In total, 127 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled into this study. Of them, 54.3% received first-line alectinib. The 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 77.4% and 68.3%, respectively. ORR and disease control rate (DCR) were 53.5% and 91.3%, respectively. Among patients with brain metastases, intracranial ORR and DCR were 63.6% and 88.6%, respectively. In addition, we found that 'crizotinib pretreatment', 'liver metastasis' and 'TP53 co-mutation' were individually associated with shorter PFS in alectinib treatment. In conclusion, this study confirms the salient clinical outcomes of alectinib for ALK-fusion-driven NSCLC patients with or without brain metastases, adding real-world evidence to the priority of alectinib in clinical practice.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
123,26876488,Scientific reports,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor promoter methylation and cortical thickness in recurrent major depressive disorder.,"Recent studies have reported that methylation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene promoter is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to investigate the association between cortical thickness and methylation of BDNF promoters as well as serum BDNF levels in MDD. The participants consisted of 65 patients with recurrent MDD and 65 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Methylation of BDNF promoters and cortical thickness were compared between the groups. The right medial orbitofrontal, right lingual, right lateral occipital, left lateral orbitofrontal, left pars triangularis, and left lingual cortices were thinner in patients with MDD than in healthy controls. Among the MDD group, right pericalcarine, right medical orbitofrontal, right rostral middle frontal, right postcentral, right inferior temporal, right cuneus, right precuneus, left frontal pole, left superior frontal, left superior temporal, left rostral middle frontal and left lingual cortices had inverse correlations with methylation of BDNF promoters. Higher levels of BDNF promoter methylation may be closely associated with the reduced cortical thickness among patients with MDD. Serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in MDD, and showed an inverse relationship with BDNF methylation only in healthy controls. Particularly the prefrontal and occipital cortices seem to indicate key regions in which BDNF methylation has a significant effect on structure.",Remaining

In recent years, several studies pointed out possible biomarkers that could be used alone or in combination with other resources in the diagnosis and follow-up of critically ill patients who develop delirium. In this context, a systematic review was conducted to determine the predictive value of several biomarkers in acutely (critically and noncritically) ill adult patients with delirium. Studies that used the confusion assessment method (CAM) and CAM-intensive care unit as the diagnostic method were considered. The most recent search was performed in November 2017. There was no language restriction. Initially, 626 articles were screened and 39 were included in the study. A comprehensive evaluation of the abstracts resulted in the exclusion of 202 studies, leaving 39 articles as potentially relevant.

If untreated, WD, which is initially a liver disease, can turn into a multi-systemic disease with neurological involvement. Very few studies have described cognitive impairment in WD. The aim of this study is to report the cognitive profile of 31 treated WD patients.	Patients were classed into two groups using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS): WD patients without neurological signs (WD-N(-)) (n=13), and WD patients with neurological signs (WD-N(+)) (n=18). The patients participated in a neuropsychological assessment evaluating memory, executive function and visuo-spatial abilities.	Both groups performed well for verbal intelligence and episodic memory skills. However, the majority of these patients exhibited altered performance for at least one cognitive test, particularly in the executive domain. The WD-N(+) group performed less well than the WD-N(-) group on cognitive tests involving rapid motor function, abstract thinking, working memory and top-down inhibitory control.	Cognitive impairment in treated WD patients essentially affects executive function involving fronto-striatal circuits. Verbal intelligence and episodic memory abilities seem to be remarkably preserved. Neuropsychological assessment is a valuable tool to evaluate the presence and the consequences of these cognitive impairments in WD patients with or without neurological signs in the course of this chronic disease.",Remaining
128,21510828,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Can small molecules provide truly effective enhancement of cognition? Current achievements and future directions.,"The prevalence of age-related diseases that implicate a deterioration of cognitive abilities is increasing. Moreover, cognitive decline occurs in numerous CNS disorders affecting patients at younger ages as well, resulting in reduced functional ability and quality of life. Despite the existence of few medications treating cognition, the need for efficacious treatment options to alleviate, halt or even prevent cognitive decline is generally unmet to date. Consequently, extensive research efforts are undertaken to identify medications that can effectively enhance cognition.	This review covers ongoing clinical trials for cognition and reflects on efforts undertaken to increase the success rates of procognitive drug treatment. The review discusses ways to optimize the drug development process for cognition enhancing agents at the preclinical to clinical interface and provides concrete examples.	The existing efficacy readouts addressing cognition in preclinical research offer little translational validity to the clinical situation. In order to identify truly efficacious drug candidates, biomarkers need to be developed that directly address conserved mechanisms underlying cognitive performances. To this end, technologies such as neuroimaging or electroencephalography constitute promising entry points for identifying both the cognitive domain and the patient population most responsive to drug treatment.",Non-systematic-review

Throughout history, liver transplantation for this population has been controversial, and many policies and regulations have existed to limit access to lifesaving transplant for patients who use alcohol. In recent years, the rates of liver transplantation for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease have increased dramatically; however, disparities persist. For instance, many criteria used in evaluation for transplant listing, such as social support and prior knowledge of the harms of alcohol use, are not evidence based and may selectively disadvantage patients with alcohol use disorder. In addition, few transplant providers have adequate training in the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and few transplant centers offer specialized addiction treatment. Finally, current approaches to liver transplantation would benefit from adopting principles of harm reduction, which have demonstrated efficacy in the realm of addiction medicine for years. As we look toward the future, we must emphasize the use of evidence-based measures in selecting patients for listing, ensure access to high-quality addiction care for all patients pretransplant and posttransplant, and adopt harm reduction beliefs to better address relapse when it inevitably occurs. We believe that only by addressing each of these issues will we be able to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources in liver transplantation for all patients.",Non-systematic-review

A total of 60 male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into four groups: Nourished/Control (NC, n=15), Nourished/Cerebral Palsy (NCP, n=15); Undernourished/Control (UC, n=15) and Undernourished/Cerebral Palsy (UCP, n=15). Animals of cerebral palsy (CP) group were subjected to an experimental model based on the combination of perinatal anoxia associated with sensorimotor restriction of the hindlimb. In the rats were evaluated body weight gain, intake of breast milk, feed post-weaning consumption, parameters of the chewing, intra-oral sensitivity and muscle properties (muscle weight and distribution of types of fibers) of the masseter and digastric. Animals from undernourished CP group showed greater reduction in most data evaluated including body weight (P<0.05), food intake post-weaning (P<0.05), frequency of chewing cycles (P<0.05), duration of the reactions of 'taste' (P<0.05), muscle weight and decrease of the proportion of type IIB fibers in the masseter muscle (P<0.05).

Advances in our knowledge of RRB are hindered by the inconsistencies in how RRB is measured. The present study examined the factor structure of the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) in a sample of 350 children with ASD ages 2-9. Confirmatory factor analysis designed for items with categorical response types was implemented to examine six proposed structural models. The five-factor model demonstrated the most parsimonious fit based on common overall fit indices that was further supported by examination of local model fit indicators, though, the four- and six-factor models evidenced adequate-to-good fit as well. Examination of RRB factor score approaches indicated only minor differences between summed item subscale scores and extracted factor scores with regard to associations with diagnostic measures. All RRB subtypes demonstrated significant associations with cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior.

135,28687401,Neurochemistry international,Pathophysiological role of prostaglandin E2-induced up-regulation of the EP2 receptor in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells and lumbar motor neurons in ALS model mice.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective degeneration of motor neurons. The primary triggers for motor neuronal death are still unknown, but inflammation is considered to be an important factor contributing to the pathophysiology of ALS both clinically and in ALS models. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its corresponding four E-prostanoid receptors play a pivotal role in the degeneration of motor neurons in human and transgenic models of ALS. It has also been shown that PGE2-EP2 signaling in glial cells (astrocytes or microglia) promotes motor neuronal death in G93A mice. The present study was designed to investigate the levels of expression of EP receptors in the spinal motor neurons of ALS model mice and to examine whether PGE2 alters the expression of EP receptors in differentiated NSC-34 cells, a motor neuron-like cell line. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that EP2 and EP3 immunoreactivity was localized in NeuN-positive large cells showing the typical morphology of motor neurons in mice. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that the immunoreactivity of EP2 in motor neurons was significantly increased in the early symptomatic stage in ALS model mice. In contrast, the level of EP3 expression remained constant, irrespective of age. In differentiated NSC-34 cells, bath application of PGE2 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease of MTT reduction. Although PGE2 had no effect on cell survival at concentrations of less than 10 μM, pretreatment with 10 μM PGE2 significantly up-regulated EP2 and concomitantly potentiated cell death induced by 30 μM PGE2. These results suggest that PGE2 is an important effector for induction of the EP2 subtype in differentiated NSC-34 cells, and that not only EP2 up-regulation in glial cells but also EP2 up-regulation in motor neurons plays a pivotal role in the vulnerability of motor neurons in ALS model mice.",Animal-other

In panic disorder there is recurrent attacks of severe anxiety which are unprovoked and unexpected. Dominant symptoms vary from person to person. The syndrome is likely to be heterogeneous as the biological aetiology may be related to abnormalities in the function of a number of neurotransmitters ie serotonin, noradrenaline, gamabutyric acid, dopamine and cholecystokinin. As such different benzodiazepines and anti-depressants are efficacious in the treatment of the disorder. Medications should be titrated to prevent attacks and restore confidence.

This retrospective cohort study included patients who were medically admitted for pneumonia to a 2,059-bed academic medical center or its associated health system hospital. Medical records of 872 admissions from November 1, 2016 to December 15, 2018, were included for all adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder prescribed clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone prior to admission.	There was no significantly increased risk of pneumonia for patients taking olanzapine (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% CI, 0.48-2.41) or quetiapine (OR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.42-2.25) prior to admission compared to risperidone.

Cognition was investigated by means of objective assessment of executive functions (EpiTrack®) and verbal memory and by subjective ratings of self-perceived side effects (cognition, mood, and vegetative). Quality of life was assessed using the QOLIE-10 questionnaire. Patients underwent assessment at baseline and after a median follow-up interval of 32 weeks. Forty-four patients were treated with LCM, 11 with LTG, and 15 with TPM. Treatment arms differed with regard to the age at onset of epilepsy (LTG>TPM) and to seizure control from baseline to follow-up, which was best in patients whose seizures were treated with LTG (55% vs. 16% in patients whose seizures were treated with LCM and 13% in patients whose seizures were treated with TPM). Groups did not differ in the type of epilepsy, daily drug load or drug load change, nor in baseline seizure frequency. Repeated measures statistics controlling for epilepsy onset and seizure outcome showed deteriorated executive functions with TPM (F=7.5, p=0.001). On an individual level (reliable change indices), 53% of the patients whose seizures were treated with TPM showed losses in this domain (LCM 14%, LTG 27%) and none of the patients showed improvement (LCM 23%, LTG 27%; χ(2)=11.8, p=0.019). No differences in memory, quality of life, or mood were noted among patients in the three treatment arms. Subjective cognitive complaints increased in 5 of the 9 patients whose seizures were treated with TPM (LCM 1/9, LTG 0/9; χ(2)=11.9, p=0.025). The findings of this study demonstrate for the first time that the cognitive side effect profile of LCM is comparable to that of LTG and superior to that of TPM. This is indicated by both subjective and objective measures. Given the naturalistic setting and the retrospective nature of the study, a follow-up prospective, randomized trial with larger sample sizes is required to confirm these findings.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Considering possible risks of intrauterine drug exposure of the child, the role of psychopharmacological treatment is ambiguous and various negative obstetric outcomes were inconsistently associated with medication. Consequently, a critical examination of peri- and postnatal phenomena associated with intrauterine exposure to antidepressants based on serotonin reuptake inhibition (SRI) and subsumed under the term 'poor neonatal adaptation syndrome' (PNAS) is urgently called for.	A comprehensive literature search was conducted, revealing a total number of 33 relevant studies and 69 individual outcomes among 3025 screened studies. Seventeen outcomes allowed meta-analytic evaluation (random effects model). Measures for heterogeneity (I[2]) and contour-enhanced funnel plots were generated.	Single studies showed increased risks for deficits in neurological functioning and autonomous adaptation in SRI exposed infants. Meta-analytical evaluation showed increased symptom occurrence or severity in exposed neonates for low APGAR scores, birth weight, size for gestational age, preterm delivery, neuromuscular and autonomous regulation, and higher rates of admission to specialized care. Mostly, increased risk after SRI exposure was supported by comparison to unexposed infants born to mothers diagnosed with depression.	Whereas statistically significant evidence for various effects of intrauterine exposure to SRI was found, the clinical relevance remains unresolved because of inherently low data quality in this research domain and insufficiently defined samples and outcomes. More systematic research under ethical considerations is required to improve multiprofessional counseling in the many women dealing with MDD during pregnancy and the peripartum.",Human-systematic-review
141,4075172,Brain research,Thiamine deficiency depletes cortical norepinephrine and impairs learning processes in the rat.,"Several lines of evidence indicate that thiamine deficiency causes the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a human memory disorder. The present study examined behavioral deficits in rats after recovery from a bout of thiamine deficiency. Following behavioral testing, the brains were dissected into regions and assayed biochemically for levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and the primary metabolites of these monoamines. Based on previous findings in this laboratory, we predicted that thiamine deficiency not only produces behavioral deficits but loss in catecholamines as well. Impairments were observed for a spatial delayed alternation task that had been learned prior to experimental treatment. In addition, experimental animals were impaired in their ability to acquire two novel tasks, active and passive shock avoidance, after recovery from the acute effects of thiamine deficiency. Comparable deficits were not observed for a number of reflex responses that were measured to assess the general neurological state of the animals. Biochemical analyses revealed that the concentration of norepinephrine was reduced significantly in cortex-hippocampus and olfactory bulb but not in other regions, while dopamine and serotonin levels were not altered in any brain region examined. These data demonstrate that a bout of thiamine deficiency can produce persistent deficits in brain norepinephrine and concomitant decrements in behavioral measures of learning and memory. These results are consistent with our hypothesis and evidence that noradrenergic deficits contribute to the amnesic symptoms of Korsakoff's psychosis.",Animal-other

In total, 22.7% did not consult a specialist for UI. SD was persistent in 82.8%; 30.4% did not consult a specialist for SD. SD had a negative impact on the sex life of patients and their partners. After adjustment for cancer stage, prostatectomy was significantly associated with persisting UI and SD at two years.	Two years after treatment, rates of persisting UI and/or SD remain high. Treatment by prostatectomy was significantly associated with an increased risk of persisting adverse effects at two years. The different toxicities between treatments should be presented to patients before initiating therapy in order to encourage the patient to contributed to shared treatment decision-making.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

The Project SIEP-DIRECT'S].,"To evaluate the quality of psychiatric care during the acute psychotic episode and the early post-acute period.	Data concerning 24 indicators, drawn from NICE recommendations, were collected in 19 Departments of Mental Health, in the frame of the SIEP-DIRECT'S Project to evaluate the implementation of NICE recommendations in Italian Mental Health Services.	The treatment of the acute episode in the Italian Mental Health Services is not based only on admissions in Psychiatric Ward in General Hospitals, but also on intensive home based care. The utilization of day hospital facilities for treating acute episodes is less frequent, as the presence of home based follow up after discharge. About 3/4 of Departments of Mental Health did not have clinical guidelines concerning the pharmacological treatment in this area. However usually the standard practices followed NICE recommendations in terms of prescribed dosages, monitoring side effects and rationale for shifting to atypical antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drugs, atypical or conventional, were frequently prescribed concurrently, while utilization of atypical antipsychotic drugs was increasing.	The results show critical points concerning on one hand the scarce diffusion of clinical guidelines, on other hand the connection between standard practices, clinical guidelines and marketing of atypical antipsychotic drugs. It should be reinforced the role of the community and particularly at service level the capacity of community mental health teams to treat the acute patients.",Remaining
144,27503465,Autism : the international journal of research and practice,Equivalence of symptom dimensions in females and males with autism.,"This study investigated equivalence of autism symptom domains in males and females with autism. Symptom data were obtained from 2643 children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (352 females, 2291 males; age range = 4-17 years) included in the Simons Simplex Collection. Items from the Social Responsiveness Scale and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised were mapped to nine a priori symptom dimensions. Multi-group confirmatory factor models, including measurement equivalence and item response theory analyses, examined whether males and females showed measurement or structural differences in autism symptom constructs. Results indicated mean differences in restricted interests that were not due to measurement bias. No other symptom dimension showed evidence of measurement bias and autism symptom structure was highly similar between males and females. Future studies are needed to carefully estimate any sex differences in the content, frequency, or intensity/severity of restricted interests in females and males.",Remaining
145,17364777,Disability and rehabilitation,Depression and occupational disability in five diagnostic groups: a review of recent research.,"To compare the methodologies and results of research across five diagnostic groups in which there was expected to be a high prevalence of depression and occupational disability.	A review of research published since 1994 was carried out concerning depression and occupational disability in five diagnostic groups: Major depressive disorder (MDD), spinal cord injuries (SCI), traumatic brain injuries (TBI), chronic back pain (CP) and myocardial infarction/coronary artery bypass grafting (MI/CABG).	Prospective longitudinal designs were mostly undertaken in MDD studies. Diagnostic interview schedules were utilized in most MDD studies whereas self-report inventories that tend to confound somatic and depressive symptoms were mostly used in CP, SCI, TBI and MI/CABG studies. In longitudinal MDD studies both depression and occupational disability were related to access to enhanced primary care treatment. On the other hand, CP research reported different results concerning the strength of depressive symptoms, cognitive and psychosocial factors in predicting occupational disability. Different trends across diagnostic groups were evident in relation to depression, occupational disability, co-morbidity, socio-demographic factors and psychosocial resources.	Co-morbid, socio-demographic and psychosocial factors provide a framework from which to identify those at greater risk of depression and occupational disability. However, more CP, SCI, TBI and MI/CABG studies with diagnostic schedules, prospective designs and longer follow-up are required.",Non-systematic-review
146,31243911,Early intervention in psychiatry,Transforming youth mental health services in a large urban centre: ACCESS Open Minds Edmonton.,"This paper outlines the transformation of youth mental health services in Edmonton, Alberta, a large city in Western Canada. We describe the processes and challenges involved in restructuring how services and care are delivered to youth (11-25 years old) with mental health needs based on the objectives of the pan-Canadian ACCESS Open Minds network.	We provide a narrative review of how youth mental health services have developed since our engagement with the ACCESS Open Minds initiative, based on its five central objectives of early identification, rapid access, appropriate care, continuity of care, and youth and family engagement.	Building on an initial community mapping exercise, a service network has been developed; teams that were previously age-oriented have been integrated together to seamlessly cover the age 11 to 25 range; early identification has thus far focused on high-school populations; and an actual drop-in space facilitates rapid access and linkages to appropriate care within the 30-day benchmark.	Initial aspects of the transformation have relied on restructuring and partnerships that have generated early successes. However, further transformation over the longer term will depend on data demonstrating how this has impacted clinical outcomes and service utilization. Ultimately, sustainability in a large urban centre will likely involve scaling up to a network of similar services to cover the entire population of the city.",Non-systematic-review

However, its application has been partially impeded by the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the mechanical properties of various tissues within the plaque. Twenty-one human carotid plaques were collected from endarterectomy. The plaque was cut into rings, and different type of atherosclerotic tissues, including media, fibrous cap (FC), lipid and intraplaque haemorrhage/thrombus (IPH/T) was dissected for uniaxial extension testing. In total, 65 media strips from 17 samples, 59 FC strips from 14 samples, 38 lipid strips from 11 samples, and 21 IPH/T strips from 11 samples were tested successfully. A modified Mooney-Rivlin strain energy density function was used to characterize the stretch-stress relationship. The stiffnesses of media and FC are comparable, as are lipid and IPH/T. However, both media and FC are stiffer than either lipid or IPH/T. The median values of incremental Young's modulus of media, FC, lipid and IPH/T at λ=1 are 290.1, 244.5, 104.4, 52.9, respectively; they increase to 1019.5, 817.4, 220.7 and 176.9 at λ=1.1; and 4302.7, 3335.0, 533.4 and 268.8 at λ=1.15 (unit, kPa; λ, stretch ratio). The material constants of each tissue type are suggested to be: media, c1=0.138kPa, D1=3.833kPa and D2=18.803; FC, c1=0.186kPa, D1=5.769kPa and D2=18.219; lipid, c1=0.046kPa, D1=4.885kPa and D2=5.426; and IPH/T, c1=0.212kPa, D1=4.260kPa and D2=5.312.

However, seizures in approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy are difficult to treat with antiepileptic drugs and require high doses or polytherapy. High dosages increase the risk of cognitive side effects. We retrospectively investigated 162 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy to determine whether the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin affect the acquisition and retention of verbal and visual information. We found that patients with high serum levels of these antiepileptic drugs were selectively impaired in the retention but not acquisition of new information. Intelligence, age, duration of epilepsy, and seizure frequency were controlled for and were not factors in the observed results. There were no differences in favor of a certain drug with respect to memory functioning. Our results suggest that patients with refractory epilepsy with high serum levels of the antiepileptic drugs studied are at higher risk of accelerated forgetting.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

This retrospective chart review included veterans who had an active order of lithium during their non-psychiatric or psychiatric inpatient stay over the time period of January 2000 to September 2011. Chi-square tests were used for data analysis. Frequency of appropriate lithium monitoring was assessed using standards set by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines for bipolar disorder.	A total of 200 patients (100 for each group) were included in the final analysis. Psychiatric inpatients had more frequent serum lithium levels measured during inpatient stay (p = 0.0002), whereas nonpsychiatric patients had more frequent renal monitoring (p = 0.0001). Non-psychiatric patients were significantly more likely to have action taken upon abnormal safety assessments (p = 0.0075).	Our results demonstrate significant differences between the non-psychiatric and psychiatric inpatient settings in respect to monitoring lithium. The frequency of serum lithium level monitoring in both groups was below the level set by both the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines. Additionally, frequency of corrective measures in both settings was low, indicating a need for improvement in this area.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into sham-operated group, model group, TAE (110 mg/kg) group, TPNS (115 mg/kg) group, TAE-TPNS combination group and Edaravone (4 mg/kg) group, treated for 4 days, then, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was established by bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) ligation for 20 min followed by reperfusion for 1 and 24 h.	TPNS could increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, TAE and TAE-TPNS combination increased ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) contents and Na[+]-K[+]-ATPase activity, and the effects of TAE-TPNS combination were stronger than those of TAE or TPNS alone after reperfusion for 1 h. After reperfusion for 24 h, TAE, TPNS and TAE-TPNS combination significantly increased neurocyte survival rate and decreased the apoptosis rate as well as down-regulated the expression of phosphorylated c-June N-terminal kinase1/2 (p-JNK1/2), cytochrome C (Cyt C), cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease (Caspase)-9 and Caspase-3. Furthermore, the effects in TAE-TPNS combination were better than those in TAE or TPNS alone.	The combination of TAE 110 mg/kg and TPNS 115 mg/kg could strengthen protective effects on cerebral ischemia injury, the mechanism underlying might be related to improving jointly the early energy metabolism, and relieving the delayed apoptosis via inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway of JNK signal transduction.",Animal-drug-intervention

Fifty patients underwent examination with dynamic CT for nonendocrinologic disease as a control group to establish the normal pattern of pituitary gland enhancement. One hundred seventy microadenomas (65.4%) displayed the usual dynamic CT pattern (ie, they did not show early enhancement before that of the portal system of the pituitary gland: those pituitary microadenomas appeared less enhanced than the normal pituitary gland during the entire examination). On the other hand, in 90 microadenomas (34.6%), early partial or complete enhancement was seen within the microadenoma before the normal portal enhancement of the gland. Therefore, analysis with dynamic CT yields two groups of pituitary microadenomas separable on the basis of blood supply: those with portal blood supply only and those with partial or predominantly direct arterial blood supply; in theory, the second group avoids hypothalamic control.",Remaining

When individual profiles were rescored to remove elevations caused by seizure content, some statistically significant (but not clinically significant) decreases were observed. The MMPI-2 appears to be a valid assessment instrument in epilepsy. In most cases seizure content did not alter clinical interpretation. When the interest is in detecting symptom change, assessing both statistical and clinical significance is recommended in future MMPI-2 research.",Remaining
154,28091879,Pituitary,New medical therapies on the horizon: oral octreotide.,"Somatostatin analog treatment is first line medical treatment in patients with acromegaly. This drug is currently mainly administered by monthly depot preparations of octreotide and lanreotide. With the innovative transient permeability enhancer, a technology enabling the absorption of drug molecules via transient opening of the tight junctions of the gut epithelium, it is possible to achieve therapeutic octreotide levels after oral ingestion. The present review summarized the preclinical work and the recently reported phase I and III study on oral octreotide capsules in patients with acromegaly. Maintenance of control in 155 participating patients was achieved in 65% at the end of core period. Once controlled on oral octreotide, the response was maintained to the end of the extension phase in 85%. Side effects were comparable to currently available preparations. There was a profound suppression of growth hormone levels, and significant symptom reduction. Currently available parental somatostatin analogs are generally well tolerated and are able to achieve longstanding biochemical control in patients with somatostatin sensitive tumors. Potential advantages of an oral alternative is the lack injection-related side effects, but there will be an ongoing need for a very strict compliance with the 2 daily dose regimen and fasting around drug administrations. A second phase III study is currently being conducted. The potential place in the treatment of acromegaly is discussed.",Non-systematic-review

Due to the complexities of cognition–emotion interactions during ongoing CBT, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, which hinders treatment optimization.	We created a laboratory analogue by combining reappraisal, a key ingredient of cognitive restructuring, with Pavlovian conditioning, a key ingredient in behavioral treatments. The novel differential Pavlovian acquisition and extinction task featured social stimuli as conditioned and unconditioned stimuli under unregulated and reappraisal instructions.	Findings indicated that reappraising the conditioned stimuli attenuated acquisition (Study 1) and facilitated extinction (Study 2) of conditioned negative valence. In Study 3, highly socially anxious individuals showed deficient extinction learning relative to low socially anxious individuals but compensated for this by using reappraisal.	Diagnostic status of participants was not assessed in structured clinical interviews.

156,25402009,Developmental neuroscience,Spontaneous pre-existing hypoxia does not affect brain damage after global cerebral ischaemia in late-gestation fetal sheep.,"There is considerable evidence that a mild, non-injurious insult can protect (precondition) against a subsequent injurious insult. Typically, protection is seen when the gap between insults is several days to a week. However, the effect of mild but persistent hypoxia is unknown. In this study we examined the hypothesis that mild pre-existing hypoxia (PaO2<17 mm Hg) would reduce neural injury in chronically instrumented late-gestation (0.85 gestation) fetal sheep exposed to 30 min of global cerebral ischaemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion (normoxia: n=9 vs. pre-existing hypoxia: n=9) or normoxia plus sham ischaemia (sham controls: n=9). Histopathology was assessed after 7 days of recovery. Fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia had lower PaO2 values (16.1±0.6 vs. 26.0±1.1 mm Hg) and were lighter at post-mortem (4,033±412 vs. 5,261±238 g) compared to normoxic fetuses. Cerebral ischaemia was associated with secondary cortical oedema and seizures, reduced final EEG power, loss of sleep state cycling, and significant loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, with no significant effect of pre-existing hypoxia. Pre-existing hypoxia was associated with a significantly attenuated rise in mean arterial pressure between 18 and 36 h and slower resolution of cortical oedema between 96 and 150 h after ischaemia. These data suggest that chronic hypoxia is not associated with a significant preconditioning effect.",Animal-non-drug-intervention
157,8086734,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",Growth and skeletal maturation in children with phenylketonuria.,"Growth and skeletal maturation was evaluated in 82 children participating in the German Collaborative Study of Children Treated for Phenylketonuria (PKU). Height, weight, head circumference and bone age were recorded at regular intervals for the first 6 years of life. The mean SD score (SDS) for height was not significantly different from zero at study entry, but decreased mainly during the second year of life to a nadir of -0.78 in boys and -0.54 in girls at 2.5 years. During the subsequent years, a significant trend towards a regain of height SDS was noted in both sexes. Weight-for-height SDS was close to zero in both sexes, with a significant continuous increasing trend throughout the observation period. Head circumference SDS decreased in boys during the first year of life from -0.28 to -0.68, whereas girls showed only a minor change. During the further follow-up period, head circumference SDS remained at approximately -0.3 in boys and 0.0 in girls. While the mean verbal and performance IQ of the total study population at 5 and 6 years of age did not differ from a group of 212 healthy non-PKU children, patients with a head circumference SDS less than the population median at 2 years of age exhibited poorer cognitive abilities at school age than those patients with a relative head size greater than the population median. The children with a head circumference less than the median at 2 years had smaller head sizes already at birth; in addition, the change in relative head size during the first 2 years was correlated significantly with cognitive abilities at school age in boys. Mean bone age was identical to chronological age at each time point of observation. The rate of maturation was one year of bone age per year of chronological age. No correlation between phenylalanine intake or phenylalanine concentrations and the rates of body or head growth or skeletal maturation could be established. We conclude that despite adequate weight gain, moderate growth retardation occurred during the first 2 years of life in this group of children treated for PKU. Growth was more compromised in boys than in girls and tended to be compensated during later follow-up. Early infantile head circumference and growth appear to be predictors of cognitive development.",Remaining

Infarction suggesting a haemodynamic pathogenesis were demonstrated in seven of the cases by computed tomography. In seven of the eight subjects that were operated on, ICA reconstruction was successful. Since pseudoocclusion of the ICA is likely to progress rapidly to definite occlusion, the patient is severely jeopardized from periocclusive embolism into the major brain arteries.

A cross-sectional correlation design was used. All people with idiopathic PD, according to the UK Brain Bank criteria, who were known to the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust PD service, were asked to participate. Those who consented were assessed by a research nurse during a six month period using a series of rating scales, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the PD Questionnaire-39, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Szasz sexual functioning scale and, for those in long-term relationships, the Golombok Rust Inventory of Marital State.	Concern over sexual function was reported in 22 (25%) of the 88 participants in the study. Males (p = 0.001) and younger people with PD (p = 0.001) were significantly more likely to report problems with sexual function. Gender (p = 0.007) and UPDRS score (p = 0.045) were significant independent predictors of relationship problems. Males with PD and those with increasing functional problems (UPDRS score) were more likely to report problems in their relationship. Disease duration and levels of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) were not associated with sexual or relationship problems.	Sexual and relationship dysfunction was a problem for many people in this study, but these problems were unlikely to be volunteered unless specifically enquired about.

The N-acetylaspartate concentration was significantly reduced in seven of the nine patients studied. The reduction of the N-acetylaspartate-creatine ratio from the lentiform nucleus in the SRO group may reflect neuronal loss, occurring predominantly in the globus pallidus.

162,12395691,Psychopharmacology bulletin,Comparing the methods used to compare antidepressants.,"A wide array of antidepressants are now available to treat depression. However, the conventional wisdom that these medications are equally effective may not be true. It is argued that most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) do not have the power to discriminate between an effective and an even more effective medication. Until RCTs that enroll 300 or more patients per arm are conducted, or more sensitive research designs are developed, it will be difficult to determine if a 'not statistically different' finding reflects true therapeutic equivalence or if it is a false-negative result (or type II error). Statistical methods that evaluate data from a number of studies are used increasingly to compare treatment strategies. The relative merits and limitations of quantitative meta-analysis and pooled analysis of original data are discussed. The former method is preferred when a large number of relevant RCTs can be analyzed. Beyond the number of studies, publication bias ('file drawer' effect) and study selection criteria may influence outcomes of meta-analysis. Pooled analysis, which combines all original patient data, is preferred when there are only a handful of related RCTs. However, the integrity of a pooled analysis can be ruined by selective inclusion of studies ('cherry picking'). The validity of combining the data from different studies also must be demonstrated. Results of studies using these complementary methods suggest that there may be clinically meaningful differences in efficacy between several classes of antidepressants.",Non-systematic-review

In this study, we explored the effects of urate on dopaminergic neurons in nigrostriatal pathway in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilaterally lesioned rats. Uric acid (UA), when given twice daily at 200 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 10 consecutive days, elevated urate (the anionic form of UA) in plasma and striatum by 55% and 36.8%, respectively, as compared with vehicle group. This regimen of UA was found to ameliorate the behavioral deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss as well as dopamine depletion in the nigrostriatal system. Moreover, UA administration was capable of increasing glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity while decreasing malondialdehyde accumulation in striatum. In addition, the phosphorylation of both protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) in the lesioned striata of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was dramatically reduced as compared with sham-operated rats. This reduction was attenuated in the Parkinsonian rats receiving UA treatment. Similarly, in vitro findings showed that UA alleviated the decrease in Akt activation and the increase in GSK3β activity caused by 6-OHDA. Furthermore, neuroprotection by urate and its regulation on GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9 was found to be abolished in the presence of PI3K inhibitor. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that urate was able to protect dopaminergic neurons in rat nigrostriatal pathway against the neurotoxicity of 6-OHDA, and showed that its beneficial effects may be related to its regulation on Akt/GSK3β signaling.",Animal-drug-intervention

The testing battery consisted of a Bobath evaluation, the Brunnstrom scale, the Fugl-Meyer test, the Upper Extremity Functional Test (UEFT) and the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) of the McGill pain questionnaire. A Friedman analysis of variance showed that, except for pain, all the protocols used disclosed significant progress (p less than 0.001) over time in terms of motor recovery. Except for pain, the results of the Bobath evaluation were significantly correlated (Spearman's Rho, p less than 0.001) with the results of the other testing procedures. It is concluded that the new Bobath evaluation proposed in a previous paper is as sensitive in depicting progress in motor recovery over time as are the other testing procedures used.

Medical inclusion criteria: patients (M/F) ≥ 18 years ≤ 75 with symptomatic seizures due to primary brain tumors or brain metastases in stable treatment with antiepileptic drugs; previous surgical resection or biopsy; >70 Karnofsky Performance Status; stable oncological disease. Eligible patients recruited from 100 consecutive patients with BTRE at first visit to our Center from 2011 to 2012. All recruited patients were administered battery of neuropsychological tests exploring various cognitive domains. Patients considered to have a neuropsychological deficit were those with at least one test score for a given domain indicative of impairment. Thirty patients out of 100 showed cognitive deficits, and were offered participation in RehabTr, of which 16 accepted (5 low grade glioma, 4 high grade glioma, 2 glioblastoma, 2 meningioma and 3 metastases) and 14 declined for various reasons. The RehabTr consisted of one weekly individual session of 1 h, for a total of 10 weeks, carried out by a trained psychologist. The functions trained were: memory, attention, visuo-spatial functions, language and reasoning by means of Training NeuroPsicologico (TNP(®)) software. To evaluate the effect of the RehabTr, the same battery of tests was administered directly after cognitive rehabilitation (T1), and at six-month follow-up (T2). Statistical analysis with Student T test for paired data showed that short-term verbal memory, episodic memory, fluency and long term visuo-spatial memory improved immediately after the T1 and remained stable at T2. At final follow-up all patients showed an improvement in at least one domain that had been lower than normal at baseline. Our results demonstrated a positive effect of rehabilitative training at different times, and, for these reasons, should encourage future research in this area with large, randomized clinical trials that evaluate the impact of a cognitive rehabilitation in patients with BTRE and cognitive deficits.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Frequently, sleep-related eating leads to severe weight gain and, so far, there are no treatment options for the condition.	We report the case of a 54-year-old white woman with depression, panic disorder, and sleep apnea under treatment with various antidepressants who developed severe sleep-related eating. Her sleep-related eating completely vanished after addition of agomelatine, it reoccurred after cessation of agomelatine, and vanished again after her re-exposure to another melatonergic drug, extended melatonin.

HLH affecting the CNS mimics several neurological disorders and may be misdiagnosed. The diagnostic and therapeutic problems of this disease are discussed.	We report a case of a 5-year-old girl with a 2-month history of right hemiparesis. The initial magnetic resonance imaging scan mimicked the appearance of malignant glioma or cerebral infarction. By use of neuroimaging alone, it was extremely difficult to reach an appropriate diagnosis.	Pathological examination of a surgical specimen of the lesion revealed histological characteristics typical of HLH. Because of the absence of both physical and blood chemical findings of systemic HLH, the patient was diagnosed as having HLH isolated in the CNS without systemic HLH. Radiotherapy with corticosteroid administration led to complete resolution of the CNS lesions, but the duration of remission was only 3 months. The patient died secondary to refractory progression of the CNS lesion.

The present investigation followed prospectively long-term BZD users over 1 year following graded BZD withdrawal in terms of clinical and withdrawal symptoms.	Clinical symptoms were measured by the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) and by the Newcastle Anxiety and Depression Diagnostic Index (NADDI) in a sample of BZD users over a 50-week period following graded BZD withdrawal.	The results showed that the frequency and severity of clinical symptomatology measured by both scales significantly decreased over time. A detailed analysis of possible patterns of symptoms on both scales revealed four patterns: 1) a gradual decrease over the 50-week time period; 2) an increase in the severity of symptoms at the onset of tapering and a decrease in severity post-tapering; 3) an increase in the severity of symptoms 4 weeks after the cessation of BZD tapering; and 4) no change over the 50-week time period.

We conducted a 3-year retrospective chart audit on the use of our secure room/security guard system at a rural hospital in a town of 3500, located 220 km from our psychiatric referral centre.	Use of our secure room/security guard system occurred at the rate of 1.1 uses/1000 emergency department visits, with the most common indication being physician perception of risk of patient suicide or self-harm. Concern for staff safety was a factor in 10% of uses. Eighty percent of patients were treated locally, with most being released from the secure room after 2 days or less. Fourteen percent of patients required ultimate transfer to our psychiatric referral centre and 6% to a detoxification centre. The average annual cost of security was $16 259.61.	A secure room can provide the opportunity for close observation of a potentially self-harming patient, additional security for staff and early warning if a patient flees the hospital. Most admissions were handled locally, obviating the need for transfer to distant psychiatric referral centres. Most patients who were admitted were already known as having a psychiatric illness and 80% of the patients required the use of the secure room/security guard system for less than a 2-night stay, suggesting that most rural mental health crises pass quickly.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have demonstrated neurochemical alterations in the frontal lobe of alcohol users, although most studies focused on older, alcohol-dependent subjects.	In this study, neurochemical data were acquired using MRS at 4.0 Tesla from emerging adults (18 to 24 years old) who were binge alcohol drinkers (BD, n = 23) or light drinkers (LD, n = 31). Since binge drinking is also associated with increased prevalence of experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout, BD were stratified into alcohol-induced blackout (BDBO) and non-blackout (BDN) groups.	Overall, BD had significantly lower gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) than LD. When stratified by blackout history, BDBO also had lower ACC glutamate (Glu) than LD. No group differences in MRS metabolites were observed in the parietal-occipital cortex. Lower ACC GABA and Glu remained significant after accounting for lower gray matter content in BD, however, NAA differences were no longer evident. In addition, low ACC GABA levels were associated with greater alcohol use consequences, and worse response inhibition and attention/mental flexibility in BD.	These data indicate that binge drinking affects frontal lobe neurochemistry, more so in those who had experienced an alcohol-induced blackout. Characterization of the neurochemical profiles associated with binge alcohol consumption and blackout history may help identify unique risk factors for the later manifestation of alcohol abuse and dependence, in young individuals who are heavy, frequent drinkers, but who do not meet the criteria for alcohol abuse disorders.",Remaining

Similar to many other psychiatric syndromes, advances in genotyping technology, allowing for inexpensive genome-wide assays, has confirmed the contribution of polygenic inheritance involving common alleles of small effect, a handful of which have now been definitively identified. However, the past decade of gene discovery in ASD has been most notable for the application, in large family-based cohorts, of high-density microarray studies of submicroscopic chromosomal structure as well as high-throughput DNA sequencing-leading to the identification of an increasingly long list of risk regions and genes disrupted by rare, de novo germline mutations of large effect. This genomic architecture offers particular advantages for the illumination of biological mechanisms but also presents distinctive challenges. While the tremendous locus heterogeneity and functional pleiotropy associated with the more than 100 identified ASD-risk genes and regions is daunting, a growing armamentarium of comprehensive, large, foundational -omics databases, across species and capturing developmental trajectories, are increasingly contributing to a deeper understanding of ASD pathology.",Remaining
178,28419491,Psychophysiology,Intrinsic neural activity differences among psychotic illnesses.,"Individuals with psychosis have been reported to show either reduced or augmented brain responses under seemingly similar conditions. It is likely that inconsistent baseline-adjustment methods are partly responsible for this discrepancy. Using steady-state stimuli during a pro/antisaccade task, this study addressed the relationship between nonspecific and stimulus-related neural activity, and how these activities are modulated as a function of cognitive demands. In 98 psychosis probands (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychosis), neural activity was assessed during baseline and during a 5-s period in preparation for the pro/antisaccade task. To maximize the ability to identify meaningful differences between psychosis subtypes, analyses were conducted as a function of subgrouping probands by standard clinical diagnoses and neurobiological features. These psychosis 'biotypes' were created using brain-based biomarkers, independent of symptomatology (Clementz et al.,). Psychosis probands as a whole showed poor antisaccade performance and diminished baseline oscillatory phase synchrony. Psychosis biotypes differed on both behavioral and brain measures, in ways predicted from Clementz et al. (). Two biotype groups showed similarly deficient behavior and baseline synchrony, despite diametrically opposed neural activity amplitudes. Another biotype subgroup was more similar to healthy individuals on behavioral and brain measures, despite the presence of psychosis. This study provides evidence that (a) consideration of baseline levels of activation and synchrony will be essential for a comprehensive understanding of neural response differences in psychosis, and (b) distinct psychosis subgroups exhibit reduced versus augmented intrinsic neural activity, despite cognitive performance and clinical similarities.",Remaining

Chronic treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) reduces ictal central apnoea, a risk factor for SUDEP. Reduced medullary serotonergic neurones, modulators of respiration in response to hypercapnia, were reported in a SUDEP post-mortem series. The amygdala and hippocampus have high serotonergic innervation and are functionally implicated in seizure-related respiratory dysregulation. We explored serotonergic networks in mesial temporal lobe structures in a surgical and post-mortem epilepsy series in relation to SUDEP risk. We stratified 75 temporal lobe epilepsy patients with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE/HS) into high (N = 16), medium (N = 11) and low risk (N = 48) groups for SUDEP based on generalised seizure frequency. We also included the amygdala in 35 post-mortem cases, including SUDEP (N = 17), epilepsy controls (N = 10) and non-epilepsy controls (N = 8). The immunohistochemistry labelling index (LI) and axonal length (AL) of serotonin transporter (SERT)-positive axons were quantified in 13 regions of interest with image analysis. SERT LI was highest in amygdala and subiculum regions. In the surgical series, higher SERT LI was observed in high risk than low risk cases in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and subiculum (p < 0.05). In the post-mortem cases higher SERT LI and AL was observed in the basal and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala and peri-amygdala cortex in SUDEP compared to epilepsy controls (p < 0.05). Patients on SRI showed higher SERT in the dentate gyrus (p < 0.005) and CA4 (p < 0.05) but there was no difference in patients with or without a psychiatric history. Higher SERT in hippocampal subfields in TLE/HS cases with SUDEP risk factors and higher amygdala SERT in post-mortem SUDEP cases than epilepsy controls supports a role for altered serotonergic networks involving limbic regions in SUDEP. This may be of functional relevance through reduced 5-HT availability.",Remaining

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of ACE in this model and to compare the treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat with that with the angiotensin II antagonist HR 720. The endothelial layer of the left carotid artery was removed using an inflated balloon catheter. Injured and control vessels were both submitted to histomorphological analysis and DNA content quantification at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 days after injury. Evaluation of neointima thickening demonstrated a slow but steady increase of neointima that was significant after day 6 and reached 30% of the lumen in 2 weeks. This was paralleled by an increase in DNA content, which was significant 4 days after injury. ACE mRNA levels were quantified by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. Measurement of ACE mRNA levels revealed a significant upregulation 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. ACE activity was also significantly enhanced at 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. In addition, the treatment with ramiprilat was more efficient in reducing neointima formation than that with HR 720. These data underlie the role of ACE in this model of restenosis. The early induction of ACE expression after endothelial injury but before significant changes in the vessel structure suggests that ACE activity might be one of the mechanisms that trigger neointima formation in the rat.",Animal-drug-intervention

There have been reports suggesting that circulating non-22K GH isoforms are increased in acromegaly, but the possible implications of such observations in the management of the disease have not been addressed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proportion of circulating non-22K GH isoforms in acromegaly. In addition, the relationships between the amount of non-22K GH and tumor size, biochemical measurements, and body composition also were investigated. Samples with different GH levels were selected from 24-h GH profiles from 15 acromegalic men evaluated before and 1 yr after transsphenoidal surgery and from 13 healthy men. The serum non-22K GH levels, expressed as percentage of total GH concentration, were determined by the 22K GH exclusion assay, which is based on immunomagnetic extraction of 22K GH from serum and quantitation of non-22K GH using a polyclonal GH assay. The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was fairly constant in different samples from the same patient, regardless of the GH level. However, a wide variation of values was observed among acromegalics, both before (14-51%) and after surgery (8-62%). The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was increased in untreated patients, compared with controls (26.6 vs. 17.4%; P < 0.01), and the values correlated significantly to tumor size, mean 24-h GH concentration, serum PRL, and extracellular water. After surgery, patients not truly cured, with mean 24-h GH concentration of 1 microg/L or more, had an increased proportion of non-22K GH, compared with those with levels less than 1 microg/L (P < 0.01). In the former group, the median values were similar than those in untreated acromegalics (34 vs. 26.6%, respectively), whereas in the latter, they were comparable with those in the controls (15.2 vs. 17.4%, respectively). We conclude that acromegalics have an increased proportion of circulating non-22K GH isoforms. The values are fairly constant in different samples from an individual, regardless of GH level, but a large spectrum can be observed among patients. This variability suggests that different pituitary adenomas secrete GH isoforms in variable amounts. Our observation that a higher proportion of non-22K GH isoforms is present in patients not truly cured after surgery suggests that the evaluation of non-22K GH isoforms can be useful in the follow-up of acromegalic patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

190,28797850,Journal of pain and symptom management,Advance Care Planning in Palliative Care for People With Intellectual Disabilities: A Systematic Review.,"Advance care planning (ACP) is defined as a person-centered, ongoing process of communication that facilitates patients' understanding, reflection, and discussion of goals, values, and preferences for future care. There is evidence for the general palliative care population that ACP increases compliance with patients' end-of-life preferences and improves quality of care near the end of life.	To gain insight into what is known about the use and effects of ACP in palliative care for people with intellectual disabilities (IDs).	Four databases were searched systematically: PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and CINAHL. A stepwise procedure was used to identify relevant studies based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement. The review included empirical quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies concerning people with ID who receive palliative care or who died non-acutely, and describing ACP. Methodological quality was graded using a critical appraisal tool.	A total of 14 studies were included. Most studies examined the perspective of professionals and/or relatives. None of the studies focused on the perspective of patients with ID. The studies concerned different elements of ACP, mainly decision-making and organizational policies. No effect studies were found. Obstructing factors were difficulties in recognizing palliative needs and uncertainties among relatives and professionals about their roles and tasks in ACP. Conducive factors were good working relationships between professionals and relatives.	There are some indications that ACP could be useful for people with ID, but more knowledge is needed about whether and how ACP should be used.",Human-systematic-review

Therefore, they would benefit from teaching procedures that minimize their difficulties in acquiring these relations. This study compared two teaching procedures, an error prevention procedure and an error correction procedure, for teaching relations between objects and pictures.	Participants were two groups of children with autism, aged between 3 and 7 years. In the context of picture-to-object requesting, one group was taught using an error correction method and the other group with an error prevention method. The measures for each child were accuracy of correspondences between taught picture and object pairs and accuracy of delayed correspondences in learning outcome tests with all combinations of object and picture pairs presented to them throughout the study.	The group receiving the error prevention-based teaching made significantly fewer errors during the teaching phases and in their learning outcome test for correspondences between all combinations of pictures and objects.	The error prevention teaching procedure would seem to provide a more efficient and ecologically valid method than the error correction procedure for teaching relations between objects and their graphic-based referents. Improvements in the methodology were suggested for providing a stronger basis for comparison between error correction and error prevention teaching methods.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Additionally, the relationship of the scores to chemical, physical, and cognitive findings is described.	With Rutter's Child Behavior Scale A and a modified Werry-Weiss-Peters Activity Scale, 118 Yu-chen children and matched controls were followed biannually from 1985 to 1991.	At each year, the Yu-cheng children scored 7% to 43% worse (mean = 23%) than control children on the Rutter scale. At any fixed age, the Yu-cheng children scored 11% to 63% (mean = 28%) worse. The effect for children born later did not differ from that for those born earlier; neither was there any improvement as the children aged. A similar but weaker picture was seen for the activity score. These behavioral findings were not related to physical or cognitive findings or to serum PCB levels.	In utero exposure to heat-degraded PCBs appears to cause mildly disordered behavior and increased activity level; the effect persists over time and is similar in children born up to 6 years after the mothers were exposed.",Remaining

Using our previously described rat model of IMSCT, we describe a technique for microsurgical tumor resection and present the functional and histopathological analysis of tumor progression.	Twenty-four Fischer 344 rats were randomized into two groups. All animals received a 5-microl intramedullary injection of 9L gliosarcoma cells. Animals were evaluated daily for signs of paralysis using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale. Group 1 continued with daily assessments using the BBB scale following tumor implantation, but received no further treatment. Group 2 underwent surgical removal of intramedullary tumor on postoperative day five. At a BBB score less than 5 (e.g., functional paraplegia), all animals of both groups were killed and sent for histopathological analysis.	Group 1 had a median onset of functional hind limb paraplegia at 15 +/- 1.0 days. Group 2 had a median onset of hind limb paresis at 53 +/- 0.46 days. Hematoxylin-eosin cross-sections confirmed the presence of intramedullary 9L tumor invading the spinal cord in both groups.	Animals with 9L IMSCTs consistently developed hind limb paraplegia in a reliable and reproducible manner. Animals undergoing microsurgical resection of IMSCT had a significant delay in the onset of functional paraplegia compared to the untreated controls. These findings suggest that this model may mimic the behavior of IMSCTs following operative resection in humans and thus may be used to examine efficacy of new treatment options for high-grade intramedullary tumors.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

Ouabain and the vehicle aCSF were microinjected into the left lateral ventricle immediately, after 4h, and after 24h. The results showed that (a) locomotion responses of the Immediate group were significantly decreased compared to those of the aCSF group, particularly the first five minutes. (b) The ouabain-treated rats have longer latency and total distance traveled in the water maze task; however, the velocity was not affected for the ouabain group. (c) The analysis of covariance showed that the latency time (but not the total distance traveled and velocity) of the ouabain group was more impaired than that of the aCSF group, regardless of omitting total distance traveled and cross movement in the open field test. The latency might be more sensitive than the distance traveled and the velocity for assessing spatial learning. Dissociating the spatial learning from the movement may allow testing drug treatments of cognitive deficits independent of locomotor effects associated with bipolar disorder.",Animal-other

An 11-year-old Chinese girl presented with sudden onset of bilateral blurred vision. The clinical history, imaging studies, and molecular analysis results were reviewed. The PubMed and OVID databases were used for literature review.	Nonischemic CRVO in the subject's right eye and tortuosity of small and medium-sized retinal arterioles in the left eye were found at initial presentation. Bilateral optic disc pallor was then noted with recovery of CRVO. Severe headache and several stroke-like episodes occurred subsequently, with elevated lactate levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome was diagnosed, and mitochondrial DNA sequencing revealed G13513A heteroplasmic mutation. Vision was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/800 in the left eye at the last visit.	Mitochondrial DNA G13513A mutation can cause LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome. Nonischemic CRVO is a rare manifestation of LHON/MELAS.

This study must use an objective method to reliably estimate hemodynamic brain ischemia. We devised a method of objectively classifying the severity of hemodynamic ischemia using quantitatively analytical and display software, stereotactic extraction estimation for stereotactic brain coordinates and three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP). We analyzed data from 16 patients registered in the JET study. Our method offers quantitative information and 3-dimensional displays of the CBF at rest and after Diamox challenge, vascular reserve and the severity of the hemodynamic brain ischemia. We compared the maximal projection counts with ROI data from tomographic images in the anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane. The maximal counts data correlated closely with the ROI data of rest and with Diamox SPECT images (both p < 0.0001). The slopes of the linear regression line were 1.15 and 1.12, respectively. The results of this study indicated that our method could simply and objectively evaluate the severity of impaired brain circulation.

To assess the lateral supraorbital keyhole approach for safe and complete clipping of unruptured AcomA aneurysm and evaluate the long-term clinical and radiological outcomes, including cognitive and depressive status.	A total of 63 patients (aged 41-79 yr, mean 64 yr) with relatively small AcomA aneurysms clipped via the lateral supraorbital approach were retrospectively analyzed among the 105 AcomA aneurysms treated by clipping from 2005 to 2014. Neurological and cognitive functions were examined by several scales, including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Mini-Mental Status Examination. The depressive state was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Depression Scale. The state of clipping was assessed 1 yr and then every few years after the operation by 3-dimensional computed tomography angiography.	Complete neck clipping was confirmed in 62 aneurysms (98.4%). Perioperative complications occurred in 5 patients (5/63; mild frontalis muscle weakness in 3, anosmia in 1, and meningitis in 1). The mean clinical follow-up period was 5.2 ± 2.1 yr. No patient showed an mRS score more than 2 and all were completely independent in daily life. The depression scores were significantly improved after surgery. The overall mortality was 0% and overall morbidity (mRS score > 2 or Mini-Mental Status Examination score < 24) was 1.6%.

Migraines are often difficult to diagnose in pediatrics and even more difficult to treat and prevent. In order to decrease the impact of the condition on the child and the family, prophylactic treatment is recommended if the child is experiencing disabling migraines. The medications currently prescribed for the prevention of pediatric migraines often have significant side effects and are of questionable therapeutic value. For those patients and parents who are interested in alternative therapies and natural remedies for preventive treatment of pediatric migraines, butterbur extract derived from the butterbur plant, Petasites hybridus, has emerged as a promising treatment.

204,29408857,PloS one,Intra-aneurysmal flow disruption after implantation of the Medina® Embolization Device depends on aneurysm neck coverage.,"Flow disruption achieved by braided intrasaccular implants is a novel treatment strategy for cerebrovascular aneurysms. We hypothesized that the degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption can be quantified in vitro and is influenced by device position across the aneurysm neck. We tested this hypothesis using the Medina® Embolization Device (MED).	Ten different patient-specific elastic vascular models were manufactured. Models were connected to a pulsatile flow circuit, filled with a blood-mimicking fluid and treated by two operators using a single MED. Intra-aneurysmal flow velocity was measured using conventional and high-frequency digital subtraction angiography (HF-DSA) before and after each deployment. Aneurysm neck coverage by the implanted devices was assessed with flat detector computed tomography on a three-point Likert scale.	A total of 80 individual MED deployments were performed by the two operators. The mean intra-aneurysmal flow velocity reduction after MED implantation was 33.6% (27.5-39.7%). No significant differences in neck coverage (p = 0.99) or flow disruption (p = 0.84) were observed between operators. The degree of flow disruption significantly correlated with neck coverage (ρ = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21-0.59, p = 0.002) as well as with neck area (ρ = -0,35, 95% CI: -0.54 --0.13, p = 0.024). On multiple regression analysis, both neck coverage and total neck area were independent predictors of flow disruption.	The degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption after MED implantation can be quantified in vitro and varies considerably between different aneurysms and different device configurations. Optimal device coverage across the aneurysm neck improves flow disruption and may thus contribute to aneurysm occlusion.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
205,12697002,CNS drugs,The triptan formulations : how to match patients and products.,"The 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists (the 'triptans') are migraine-specific agents that have revolutionised the treatment of migraine. They are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available in various strengths and formulations, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the triptans exist, as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including half-life, time to peak plasma concentrations, peak plasma concentrations, area under the concentration-time curve, metabolism and drug-drug interaction profiles. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability advantages for one agent over another is not well differentiated. However, delivery systems may play an important role in onset of action. Given that the clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle, identification of the most appropriate triptan for an individual patient requires consideration of the specific characteristics of the patient and knowledge of patient preference, an accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute-care medications and individual features of the drug being considered. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug also depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. Individual patient response to the triptans seems to be idiosyncratic and possibly genetically determined. Therefore, a set of specific questions can be used to determine whether a currently used triptan is optimally effective, whether the dose needs to be increased or whether another triptan should be tried. The clinician has in his/her armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of triptans, available in multiple formulations and dosages, which have good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimise therapeutic benefit. Use of the methods outlined in this review in choosing a triptan for an individual patient is probably more likely to lead to migraine relief than making an educated guess as to which triptan is most appropriate.",Non-systematic-review

Therefore, we examined the association of different APOE alleles with common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), carotid plaques, incident myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. We analyzed data from 3327 participants aged 20-79 years of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) from Northeast Germany with a median follow-up time of 14.5 years. Linear, logistic, and Cox-regression models were used to assess the associations of the APOE polymorphism with CCA-IMT, carotid plaques, incident MI and stroke, respectively. In our study, the APOE E2 allele was associated with lower CCA-IMT at baseline compared to E3 homozygotes (β: - 0.02 [95% CI - 0.04, - 0.004]). Over the follow-up, 244 MI events and 218 stroke events were observed. APOE E2 and E4 allele were not associated with incident MI (E2 HR: 1.06 [95% CI 0.68, 1.66]; E4 HR: 1.03 [95% CI 0.73, 1.45]) and incident stroke (E2 HR: 0.79 [95% CI 0.48, 1.30]; E4 HR: 0.96 [95% CI 0.66, 1.38]) in any of the models adjusting for potential confounders. However, the positive association between CCA-IMT and incident MI was more pronounced in E2 carriers than E3 homozygotes. Thus, our study suggests that while APOE E2 allele may predispose individuals to lower CCA-IMT, E2 carriers may be more prone to MI than E3 homozygotes as the CCA-IMT increases. APOE E4 allele had no effect on CCA-IMT, plaques, MI or stroke.",Remaining

Concentric needle electromyography, macro electromyography (including single fibre electromyography) and neurography were performed in various combinations in 688 patients with an alleged history of polio.	Thirty-five patients with paralytic polio had normal or minimally abnormal neurophysiology. In 6 patients the diagnosis of polio was rejected and was instead found to be other diagnoses. Three patients had a very atypical history. Of the 26 with possible paralytic polio, 17 showed a strong suspicion of previous paralytic polio without any neurophysiological signs of degeneration of the anterior horn cells.	If neurophysiological findings are normal in patients with a history of polio, the original diagnosis may be incorrect. However, the absence of electromyography changes does not entirely exclude a previous history of polio with transient functional loss without degeneration of anterior horn cells vulnerable for later functional impairment.",Remaining

In this study the changes in rat PRL cells by estrogen treatment were studied histologically and immunocytochemically. Furthermore, intracellular structures in PRL cells were observed by high resolution scanning electron microscopy using the aldehyde prefix osmium-DMSO-osmium method. These rat pituitary tumors were established in Fischer-344 female rats by weekly injections of 2.5 mg estradiol valerate. The estrogen-induced, autonomous and transplantable rat pituitary tumors (MtT/F84) were also studied in the same manner and the findings were compared with estrogen-induced tumors. The increase of weight of pituitary gland and of serum PRL level correlated significantly with the number of estrogen administration. On the basis of histological findings, estrogen-induced pituitary tumors can be classified into two different stages, that is, hypertrophic hyperplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The former corresponds to the period until 6 weeks after the beginning of estrogen treatment and the latter to the period thereafter. In the former, PRL cells were significantly increased in number and volume, and were diffusely immunoreactive for PRL in the cytoplasm. Cell atypism was rarely found. The extent of acidophil staining was well preserved in hematoxylin-eosin staining. Ultrastructurally, organelles were well developed, especially rough endoplasmic reticulum showed whorl formation. Immature, irregularly shaped secretory granules were frequently observed within the Golgi area.

However, studies on cholesterol measured in late-life and cognitive function have been inconsistent. Few studies have explored nonlinear relationships or considered interactions with other biomarker measures.	A cross-sectional sample of 1,889 participants from four rural counties in the People's Republic of China was included in this analysis. Serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and homocysteine levels were measured in fasting blood samples. A composite cognitive score was derived based on nine standardized cognitive test scores. Analysis of covariance models were used to investigate the association between biomarker measures and the composite cognitive scores.	There was a significant interaction between the homocysteine quartile group and the cholesterol quartile group on cognitive scores (P=0.0478). In participants with normal homocysteine levels, an inverse U-shaped relationship between total cholesterol level and cognitive score was found, indicating that both low and high cholesterol levels were associated with lower cognitive scores. In participants with high homocysteine levels, no significant association between cholesterol and cognition was found.	The relationship between cholesterol levels and cognitive function depends upon homocysteine levels, suggesting an interactive role between cholesterol and homocysteine on cognitive function in the elderly population. Additional research is required to confirm our findings in other populations, and to explore potential mechanisms underlying the lipid-homocysteine interaction.",Remaining

The plasma leptin levels significantly decreased during 36 h fasting by 48.8 +/- 4.5% (pre: 11.3 +/- 2.3, post: 6.2 +/- 1.5 ng/ml) and 38.6 +/- 7.9% (pre: 7.6 +/- 5.0, post: 4.2 +/- 1.0 ng/ml) in SCI and AB, respectively. Plasma leptin started to decrease at 24 h of fasting in the SCI group, whereas plasma leptin started to decrease at 12 h of fasting in the AB group. The current study demonstrated that plasma leptin decreased with fasting in both SCI and AB groups, with the leptin decrease being delayed in the SCI group. The delayed leptin response to fasting in the SCI group may be because of increased fat mass (%body fat, SCI: 33.8 +/- 3.0, AB: 24.1 +/- 2.9) and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.",Remaining
216,8264869,Neuroendocrinology,Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is present in the inferior petrosal sinuses in patients with Cushing's disease.,"Plasma ACTH, beta-endorphin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels were evaluated in the inferior petrosal sinuses and in the periphery of 22 patients affected by Cushing's disease, 11 patients with other pituitary diseases subjected to simultaneous and bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling and in the peripheral blood of 15 normal subjects. In patients with Cushing's disease ACTH, beta-endorphin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels in the inferior petrosal sinus ipsilateral to the adenoma were significantly higher than in the periphery and in the contralateral inferior petrosal sinus (p < 0.01, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). In patients with other pituitary diseases only ACTH and beta-endorphin, but not alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels in both inferior petrosal sinuses were significantly higher than in the periphery (p < 0.01). Furthermore, no difference was found in the peripheral blood among patients with Cushing's disease, patients with other pituitary diseases and normal subjects for ACTH and beta-endorphin level. By contrast, in patients with Cushing's disease peripheral alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels were significantly higher than in patients with other pituitary diseases and in normal subjects (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that only in patients with Cushing's disease, but not in patients with other pituitary diseases, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is released by adenomatous pituitary corticotrophs together with ACTH and beta-endorphin.",Remaining

In susceptible individuals, irritants can trigger migraine attacks, which can be considered as triggers or accelerators.	To describe the precipitating factors, clinical presentation, and treatment of migraine headache in Sudanese patients.	This is a descriptive hospital-based prospective study covering 130 patients during the study period from January 2016 to December 2018. At the National Centre for Neurological Science, Khartoum, participants were Sudanese patients with migraine headache after exclusion of other causes of headache. Data was collected using structured questionnaire entered and analyzed using SPSS version 22.0, p value < .05 is considered significant.	The study covered 130 study participants most of them were females (80%), within 26-35 years of age (56.9%) and a considerable proportion of them were housewives (40%). The majority of the study participants had headache without aura in 81.5% and headache with aura in 18.5% (mainly visual type 87.5%). Photophobia and nausea were the main associated symptoms in 51.5% and 50%, respectively. Acetaminophen was the main prescribed treatment in 46.1%, beta blockers was the main prophylaxis in 29.2%. Environmental triggers were the prevalent predisposing factors (43.8%) followed by fasting, lack of sleep, and exertion (24.6% for each).

Does this suggest some potential correlation between the two diseases? Low bone mass and change of bone biomarker are associated with a higher risk of carotid and cardiac calcification plaques.	Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism marker may contribute to the progression of carotid and cardiac arterial calcifications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether low bone mass and the change of bone biomarker are associated with the prevalence of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in elderly Chinese.	We conducted a five-year prospective study. BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning. Carotid and cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) was conducted using a 64-multidetector row scanner to assess carotid and cardiac arterial plaque at baseline and during follow-up.	Of 1571 community residents over 60 years of age, 184 (11.7%) subjects developed carotid calcified plaque, 510 (32.5%) subjects developed cardiac calcified plaque and 97 (6.2%) subjects developed co-existence calcified plaques in carotid and cardiac arteries. After adjustment for age and all relevant confounders, Q1, Q2 quartile of BMD, and osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin (OC), and C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) were associated with increased risk of calcified plaques.	This study suggested that lower BMD and change of bone metabolism biomarker were associated with a higher risk of carotid and cardiac calcified plaque development.",Remaining

220,8428898,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Atypical antidepressants versus imipramine in the treatment of major depression: a meta-analysis.,"Our investigation involved a quantitative literature review technique known as meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of three newer antidepressants and imipramine.	We examined seven major journals in psychiatry from 1980 through 1990, inclusive, and selected those investigations of imipramine, trazodone, bupropion, and fluoxetine that met our minimal criteria for interpretability. These criteria included: (1) the presence of a placebo control, (2) double-blind status, (3) the use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression as a dependent variable measure, (4) the use of nongeriatric adults with a diagnosis of major depression by DSM or RDC standards, and (5) the presence of reported means and standard deviations in the investigation, or sufficient data that allowed such to be computed. Each study of four antidepressants was analyzed for an effect size of the drug investigated. The effect size allows for a determination of the efficacy of a particular drug as compared with placebo, measured in standard deviation units.	The data indicated that all four agents are effective as compared with placebo. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the newer heterocyclic agents are less effective than imipramine, as an ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference between the effect sizes of the four antidepressants.	These data are discussed in terms of characteristics of the various investigations and the need for further research comparing the efficacy of psychopharmacologic agents.",Human-systematic-review

The interactions between TP and intestinal microbiota suggest that probiotics intervention is a useful method to ameliorate neurological diseases. Now, numerous researches have suggested that TP plays a significant role in modulating intestinal bacteria, especially in the area of sustaining a stable state of intestinal microbial function and abundance. Furthermore, homeostatic intestinal bacteria can enhance the immunity of the host. The close reciprocity between intestinal microbiota and the central nervous system provides a new chance for TP to modulate neural-related diseases depending on intestinal microbiota. Therefore, based on the bidirectional relationship between the brain and the intestines, this review provides a new clue to solve insomnia symptoms and related neurological diseases that will enable us to better study the bidirectional effects of TP and intestinal microbiota on the improvement of host health.

The study is a retrospective observational cohort study.	The study retrieved data from electronic health record from Hospital Authority (HA), HK.	The study included patients aged 18 years old or above, who were admitted to seven institutions under HA with diagnosis of ACS during 2008-2017.	The primary outcome was the frequency of antiplatelet therapy prescription at the point of index hospitalisation discharge each year during 2008-2017. Association between demographics, baseline comorbidities, procedures and antiplatelet prescription were examined as secondary outcome using multivariate logistic regression model, with commonly used antiplatelet groups selected for comparison.	Among the included 14 716 patients, 5888 (40.0%) discharged with aspirin alone, 6888 (46.8%) discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel, and 973 (6.6%) discharged with DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor. Prescribing rate of aspirin alone decreased substantially from 56.8% in 2008 to 27.5% in 2017. Utilisation of DAPT with clopidogrel increased from 33.7% in 2008 to 52.7% in 2017. Use of DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor increased from 0.3% in 2010 to 15.3% in 2017.

Patients with older age (aOR 0.97, 0.96 to 0.97), diabetes (aOR 0.68, 0.52 to 0.88), chronic kidney disease (aOR 0.43, 0.22 to 0.85) or concurrent use of oral anticoagulant (aOR 0.16, 0.07 to 0.42) were more likely to received DAPT with clopidogrel.	Use of DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor was suboptimal yet improving during 2008-2017 in HK patients with ACS. Considering DAPT, predictors for clopidogrel prescription, compared with prasugrel/ticagrelor, were consistent with identified risk factors of bleeding.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
224,32563266,BMC public health,Correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.,"In Korea, higher education has rapidly grown influenced by sociocultural tradition. Parents invest a significant portion of their household income in their children's education. Private education has been considered to greatly affect students' psychology and behavior. However, past research has largely neglected to study parents who pay these costs. Since household income and education level are important determinants of socioeconomic status (SES), education expenditures are likely to cause depressive symptoms. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.	Data were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS, 2015, 2018). The sample analyzed consisted of 397 and 337 fathers and 403 and 370 mothers in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The independent variable in this study was the proportion of private education cost. This proportion was calculated by dividing each household's private education costs by its equivalized household disposable income (EHDI) and multiplying this number by 100. The main dependent variable was parental responses to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-11 (CESD-11). Using a generalized linear model, we investigated the effects of the proportion of private education cost on parental depression.	The results showed that fathers with higher proportions of private education cost exhibited higher CESD-11 scores compared to fathers with lower proportions cost (moderate: β = 0.419, S. E = 0.164, p = 0.0105; high: β = 0.476, S. E = 0.178, p = 0.0076), indicating that a higher ratio of private education cost may negatively affect depression in fathers. However, there was no discernable correlation between mothers' CESD-11 scores and the proportion of private education cost (moderate: β = - 0.078, S. E = 0.250, p = 0.7555; high: β = 0.003, S. E = 0.215, p = 0.9882).	These results may be explained by the tendency for fathers to experience greater economic burdens than mothers in patriarchal Korean society.",Remaining

These views have been informed by the evolution of psychoanalysis over the past 100 years, especially by the perspective provided by an early-life variant on the Oedipus complex (Osman 2000). The author postulates that an important reason for the happy conclusion of this analysis, surprising for its brevity, was that it expedited a mourning process that released a primitive bond to the patient's father, and also, in doing so, facilitated the emergence of a less encumbered and more individuated identity. While accomplishing this, constricting bonds to his late sister Katherine and to his mother were loosened as well.",Non-systematic-review
227,34131185,Scientific reports,Association of age-related cognitive and obstacle avoidance performances.,"An association between cognitive impairment and tripping over obstacles during locomotion in older adults has been suggested. However, owing to its memory-guided movement, whether this is more pronounced in the trailing limb is poorly known. We examined age-related changes in stepping over, focusing on trailing limb movements, and their association with cognitive performance. Age-related changes in obstacle avoidance were examined by comparing the foot kinematics of 105 older and 103 younger adults when stepping over an obstacle. The difference in the clearance between the leading and trailing limbs (Δ clearance) was calculated to determine the degree of decrement in the clearance of the trailing limb. A cognitive test battery was used to evaluate cognitive function among older adults to assess their association with Δ clearance. Older adults showed a significantly lower clearance of the trailing limb than young adults, resulting in greater Δ clearance. Significant correlations were observed between greater Δ clearance and scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and immediate recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory test. Therefore, memory functions may contribute to the control of trailing limb movements, which can secure a safety margin to avoid stumbling over an obstacle during obstacle avoidance locomotion.",Remaining
228,20353432,Headache,Revisiting the role of ergots in the treatment of migraine and headache.,"The harmful side effects of the ergots described by early civilizations have been overcome with efficacious treatment for headaches including migraine, cluster, and chronic daily headache. Use of ergots contributed to initial theories of migraine pathogenesis and provided the substrate for development of the triptans. Triptans are very efficacious for many migraineurs, and since their widespread use, use of ergots has significantly declined. Unfortunately, there remain many migraineurs who benefit little from triptans, yet respond very well to ergots. Discoveries in migraine pathophysiology have given us better understanding of the complex processes involved, although there remain many unknown factors in migraine treatment. Additional, unrecognized therapeutic targets may exist throughout the neuronal connections of the brainstem, cortex, and cerebral vasculature. Ergots interact with a broader spectrum of receptors than triptans. This lack of receptor specificity explains potential ergot side effects, but may also account for efficacy. The role of ergots in headache should be revisited, especially in view of newer ergot formulations with improved tolerability and side effect profiles, such as orally inhaled dihydroergotamine. Redefining where in the headache treatment spectrum ergots belong and deciding when they may be the optimal choice of treatment is necessary.",Non-systematic-review

To study the relationship between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and intima-media thickness.	Ultrasonic evaluation of the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery was included in the 5-year follow-up examination of participants of the Edinburgh Artery Study. We had valid readings of intima-media thickness for 1106 men and women aged 60-80 years. Information on a range of cardiovascular risk factors had been collected during the baseline examination.	For men, in addition to age, lifetime smoking (measured in terms of pack years) was the only cardiovascular risk factor associated with increased intima-media thickness (P< or = 0.01) in the univariate analysis. Both systolic blood pressure (P < or = 0.001) and the high-density lipoprotein (HDL: total cholesterol ratio (P < or = 0.01) were correlated with intima-media thickness for women. When all the variables had been included in a multivariate analysis, pack years of smoking and the HDL:total cholesterol ratio were associated with early atherosclerotic development in men. In an equivalent analysis for women, alcohol consumption, systolic blood pressure and the HDL:total cholesterol ratio were associated with intima-media thickness.	These data suggest that risk factors affecting intima-media thickness differ for men and women. Further sex-specific analyses of prospective population studies are required in order to clarify the role of 'traditional' cardiovascular risk factors in the early stages of carotid atherosclerosis.",Remaining
230,12244316,Nature genetics,"Mutation of TDP1, encoding a topoisomerase I-dependent DNA damage repair enzyme, in spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy.","Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) repairs covalently bound topoisomerase I-DNA complexes and is essential for preventing the formation of double-strand breaks that result when stalled topoisomerase I complexes interfere with DNA replication in yeast. Here we show that a deficiency of this DNA repair pathway in humans does not predispose to neoplasia or dysfunctions in rapidly replicating tissues, but instead causes spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) by affecting large, terminally differentiated, non-dividing neuronal cells. Using genome-wide linkage mapping and a positional candidate approach in a Saudi Arabian family affected with autosomal recessive SCAN1, we identified a homozygous mutation in TDP1 (A1478G) that results in the substitution of histidine 493 with an arginine residue. The His493 residue is conserved in TDP1 across species and is located in the active site of the enzyme. Protein modeling predicts that mutation of this amino acid to arginine will disrupt the symmetric structure of the active site. We propose that loss-of-function mutations in TDP1 may cause SCAN1 either by interfering with DNA transcription or by inducing apoptosis in postmitotic neurons.",Remaining

People with dementia may not be well-supported in this aspect of care; this may lead to spiritual distress. Spiritual needs may be identified by taking the person's spiritual history or, in the case of advanced dementia, by asking a person's significant others about the important spiritual aspects of the person's life. Spiritual care for people with dementia involves reflective practice and meaningful engagement with the person with dementia, so as to facilitate shared understanding.

233,8544909,Neurobiology of aging,Constitutive Alzheimer's-type tau epitopes in a neuritogenic rat CNS cell line.,"Paired helical filaments (PHFs) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) largely comprise hyperphosphorylated forms of the cytoskeletal protein tau. AD-type tau phosphoepitopes, detected by various monoclonal antibodies, are absent from normal adult neurons, but recent studies have shown that their expression may contribute to neuritogenesis and axon differentiation in the developing nervous system. Therefore, we have examined a brain nerve cell line that is spontaneously neuritogenic for possible expression of AD-type tau epitopes. The neuritogenic rat brain cell line B103 was found to constitutively produce two-AD related epitopes of tau, detected by cellular immunofluorescence studies with the PHF-1 and Alz-50 monoclonal antibodies. Biochemical studies showed that the antibodies bound to proteins within the molecular, weight range expected for phosphorylated tau isoforms. Further verification was established by use of tau antisense oligomers, which eliminated cellular immunofluorescence due to the AD-related monoclonals and polyclonal anti-tau but did not eliminate fluorescence due to anti-tubulin. Cells treated with tau antisense were not neurite-free. Neurites that remained, however, were abnormal, generally short and wavy in appearance. Cellular distribution of the tau epitopes was found to be particularly interesting. Alz-50 recognized only cytoplasmic tau whereas PHF-1 recognized nuclear tau as well as cytoplasmic. Thus, the two epitopes, are morphologically segregated within the cell. Because subcellular segregation of tau is compromised in Alzheimer's disease, mechanisms that segregate AD-type phosphotau epitopes in B103 cells may have relevance to this neurodegenerative disorder.",In-vitro-study

The purpose of this scoping review was to understand the type and amount of physical activity interventions performed in this population as well as their effect.	PubMed, Cochran and CINAHL Complete were systematically searched for articles describing physical activity interventions in people with a chronic, stable central nervous system lesion. The outcome measures needed to include physiological or psychological variables, measures of general health or quality of life.	Of the initial 7554 articles, 34 were included after the title, abstract, and full-text screening. Only six studies were designed as randomized-controlled trials. Most interventions were supported by technologies, mainly functional electrical stimulation (cycling or rowing). The duration of the intervention ranged from four to 52 weeks. Endurance and strength training interventions (and a combination of both) were performed and over 70% of studies resulted in health improvements.	Non-ambulatory people with severe motor impairments may benefit from physical activity interventions. However, the number of studies and their comparability is very limited. This indicates the need for future research with standard measures to develop evidence-based, specific recommendations for physical activity in this population.Key messagesPhysical activity interventions can have health benefits in non-ambulatory people with severe motor impairments.Even simple, low-tech interventions allow for health-enhancing training.",Human-systematic-review

Considering the limited knowledge regarding the immune mechanisms involved in narcolepsy whether related to flu vaccination or not and the recent progresses in cytokine measurement technology, we assessed 30 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors using the Luminex technology in either peripheral (serum) or central (CSF) compartments in a large population of 90 children and adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 in comparison to 58 non-hypocretin deficient hypersomniacs and 41 healthy controls. Furthermore, we compared their levels in patients with narcolepsy whether exposed to pandemic flu vaccine or not, and analyzed the effect of age, duration of disease and symptom severity. Comparison for sera biomarkers between narcolepsy (n = 84, 54 males, median age: 15.5 years old) and healthy controls (n = 41, 13 males, median age: 20 years old) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of several pro- and anti-inflammatory serum cytokines and growth factors with interferon-γ, CCL11, epidermal growth factor, and interleukin-2 receptor being independently associated with narcolepsy. Increased levels of interferon-γ, CCL11, and interleukin-12 were found when close to narcolepsy onset. After several adjustments, only one CSF biomarker differed between narcolepsy (n = 44, 26 males, median age: 15 years old) and non-hypocretin deficient hypersomnias (n = 57, 24 males, median age: 36 years old) with higher CCL 3 levels found in narcolepsy. Comparison for sera biomarkers between patients with narcolepsy who developed the disease post-pandemic flu vaccination (n = 36) to those without vaccination (n = 48) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of three cytokines, regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted, CXCL10, and CXCL9, being independently and significantly increased in the group exposed to the vaccine. No significant differences were found between narcoleptics whether exposed to flu vaccination or not for CSF biomarkers except for a lower CXCL10 level found in the exposed group. To conclude, we highlighted the role of sera cytokine with pro-inflammatory properties and especially interferon-γ being independently associated with narcolepsy close to disease onset. The activity of the interferon-γ network was also increased in the context of narcolepsy after the pandemic flu vaccination being a potential key player in the immune mechanism that triggers narcolepsy and that coordinates the immune response necessary for resolving vaccination assaults.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

TH insufficiency showed a decrease in the expression of parvalbumin (PV) in the cortex and hippocampus of pups at postnatal day (PD) 14, while treatment with thyroxine from PD 0 to PD 14 ameliorated the PV loss. On the other hand, treatment with antithyroid agents in adulthood did not result in a decrease in the expression of PV in these areas. These results indicate the existence of a critical period of TH action during the early postnatal period. A decrease in MeCP2-positive neuronal nuclei was also observed in the cortical layers II-IV of the cerebral cortex. The brains were then stained with CUX1, a marker for cortical layers II-IV. In comparison with normal mice, CUX1 signals were decreased in the somatosensory cortex of the hypothyroid mice, and the total thickness of cortical layers II-IV of the mice was lower than that of normal mice.

The association of FKSB risk status and WRAT-R reading subtest for predicting general reading disability in the overall sample at age 8 years resulted in a sensitivity of 0.68, specificity of 0.48, and a likelihood ratio of 1.3. Of the 43 'normal' children at age 5 years with no neurosensory impairments and IQ > or = 84 (McCarthy GCI), 49% were considered to be at 'mild' to 'high' risk for future LD. The prevalence of specific LD (reading disorder) at age 8 years in children with normal IQ (WISC-R > or = 85) was 28%. The positive predictive value of the 5-year FKSB for identifying children with specific LD at age 8 years was 0.20 (sensitivity 0.33, specificity 0.48).

Supplement,Some factors relating to intelligence in treated children with spina bifida cystica.,"The 83 survivors of a consecutive series of children with spina bifida cystica, born between 1963 and 1971 and treated non-selectively since birth, were assessed by intelligence and developmental testing. In nine of the children who had not required shunts the distribution of intelligence was within the normal range. The need for a shunt was significantly related to the presence of craniolacunae and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Seven of the 74 shunt-treated children had suffered ventriculitis, meningitis or septicaemia, and their intelligence was significantly worse than the others. In the 67 shunt-treated children who had not suffered infection, intelligence was significantly related to the thickness of the pallium when the shunt was inserted during the first four weeks of life, and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Intelligence was not related to the function of the shunt at time of assessment, to the number of revisions of the shunt, or to the rate of increase in head size during the first four weeks of life. It is concluded that the best indication of later intelligence can be gained at birth from the thickness of the pallium and the sensory level of the lesion.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

We employed FISH and array CGH techniques for a better definition and refinement of a double chromosome aberration associating a 17p microdeletion with partial monosomy 21q due to 1:3 meiotic segregation of a maternal reciprocal translocation t(17;21)(p13.3;q21.2) revealed after banding analysis. Brain MRI depicted partial callosal and mild diffuse cerebral atrophies, but without expected signs of lissencephaly. The patient's karyotype formula was: 45,XY,der(17)t(17;21)(p13.3;q21.2)mat,-21. FISH study confirmed these rearrangements and array CGH analysis estimated the loss sizes to at least 635 kb on chromosome 17 and to 15.6 Mb on chromosome 21. The absence of lissencephaly and major brain malformations often associated with 17p terminal deletions could be attributed to the retention of PAFAH1B1, YWHAE and CRK genes. Dysmorphic features, moderate mental impairment and minor brain malformations could result from the 21q monosomy and particularly the partial deletion of the APP-SOD1 region. Azoospermia should result from gamete apoptosis induced by a control mechanism triggered in response to chromosome imbalances. Our study provides an additional case for better understanding and delineating both 17p and 21q deletions.",Human-case-report

A case-control study.,"Experience in practice has suggested that children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tend to have higher numbers of diseased, missing and filled teeth (DMFT score) than children without the condition. To date, however, this impression has not been systematically investigated. A case-control study of children in Otago, New Zealand (case DMFT > or = 5; control DMFT <5; case status determined from School Dental Service dental records) was conducted by postal survey and reference to the School Dental Service records. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, and school socio-economic status. The purpose of the study was to assess whether having ADHD was associated with higher odds of having high caries experience. Questionnaires were returned for a total of 128 case-control pairs. Conditional logistical regression analysis showed that, after controlling for fluoride history, medical problems, diet, and self-reported oral hygiene, children with ADHD had nearly 12 times the odds of having a high DMFT score than children who did not have ADHD (OR = 11.98; 95% CI 1.13, 91.81).

244,16226047,Journal of clinical forensic medicine,Near miss incidents in police custody suites in London in 2003: a feasibility study.,"Potentially preventable deaths in police custody include those which involve illicit drugs, alcohol and deliberate self-harm. Near miss incidents (NMI) that did not result in death have a crucial role in understanding risk factors in custody. Such research has not previously been undertaken. A program of research has been developed to study NMI, in order to better identify those at risk in police custody. For the purposes of this research, NMI have been defined as 'an unplanned and unforeseeable or unforeseen event that could have resulted, but did not result, in human death or may have resulted in injury or other adverse outcomes'. It was intended that the definition although broad, would not include simple accidents (e.g. slipping on urine in a cell) or trivial injury.	The two aims of the study are (a) to determine whether it is realistic to attempt to assess NMI with the intention of identifying information of use in enhancing detainee care and (b) to assess how frequently NMIs occur and whether there are specific patterns. Pilot interviews were conducted with three forensic physicians practising in London, UK to create a structured questionnaire for all forensic physicians working in London. The questionnaire provided the basis of a retrospective recall survey of all forensic physicians working in London as Forensic Medical Examiners. The questionnaire was designed to assess the numbers of NMI, patterns in occurrence and relevant learning points within the previous 6 months. A covering letter, background questionnaire (exploring the background of the medical practitioner), copies of the survey, and reply paid envelopes were sent to each Forensic Medical Examiner (n=134) in London, contracted to provide forensic medical services for the Metropolitan Police Service. Data about all incidents were anonymized.	Ninety six (73%) Forensic Medical Examiners responded. Of these 18% were Principal grade, the remainder were Senior (24%), Standard (35%) and Assistant (23%). Thirty eight NMI were reported by 27 Forensic Medical Examiners (of all levels). The initial reason for police contact was recorded as alcohol (n=8), theft and robbery (n=7), warrants (n=4), violence (n=3), traffic violations (n=2) and single cases of drugs, murder and immigration offences. Of the main perceived cause of each NMI, illicit drugs were involved in 12/38, alcohol in 17/38, deliberate self-harm in 11/38, issues concerning searches, checks or rousing in 8/38, failure of inter-agency communications in 5/38, and possible resource issues in 4/38. In a number of cases more than one factor was involved.	The information established about NMI is broadly consistent with documented patterns of deaths in police custody in England and Wales which supports the validity of the data. The next stage of this research will be a prospective six month study in which NMI will be analysed in order to learn lessons which may be utilised to attempt to prevent potentially avoidable deaths in police custody.",Remaining
245,30094499,Neurosurgical review,"Depression and glioblastoma, complicated concomitant diseases: a systemic review of published literature.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer. Depression is a common co-morbidity of this condition. Despite this common interaction, relatively little research has been performed on the development of GBM-associated depression. We performed a literary search of the PubMed database for articles published relating to GBM and depression. A total of 85 articles were identified with 46 meeting inclusion criteria. Depression significantly impacts care, decreasing medication compliance, and patient survival. Diagnostically, because depression and GBM share intricate neuro-connectivity in a way that effect functionality, these diseases can be mistaken for alternative psychological or pathological disorders, complicating care. Therapeutically, anti-depressants have anti-tumor properties; yet, some have been shown to interfere with GBM treatment. One reason for this is that the pathophysiological development of depression and GBM share several pathways including altered regulation of the 5-HT receptor, norepinephrine, and 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. Over time, depression can persist after GBM treatment, affecting patient quality of life. Together, depression and GBM are complicated concomitant diseases. Clinicians must be aware of their co-existence. Because of overlapping molecular pathways involved in both diseases, careful medication selection is imperative to avoid potential adverse interactions. Since GBMs are the most common primary brain cancer, physicians dealing with this disease should be prepared for the development of depression as a potential sequela of this condition, given the related pathophysiology and the known poor outcomes.",Human-systematic-review

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether cognitive and nutritional status are associated with functional improvement after rehabilitation in old persons.	2650 patients (aged > or =60 years) consecutively admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation unit in Italy between August 2001 and December 2005, were included. Functional status was evaluated with the Tinetti scale, cognitive status with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and nutritional status with the Mini-Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF). To identify predictors of functional recovery, multiple logistic regression models were run, with improvement on the Tinetti scale score as dependent variable.	Eighty per cent of old persons functionally improved after rehabilitation, ranges being 84% of those with MMSE> or =24 to 58% of those with MMSE<10. Persons with both good cognition and good nutritional status were most likely to improve [odds ratio (OR)=2.5; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.9-3.2]. Stratifying the sample according to cognitive status, we found that in patients with MMSE> or =18 better nutritional status emerged as a factor associated with functional improvement, whereas in patients with severe cognitive impairment (MMSE<18), the only associated factor was a higher MMSE score.	The results of the present study suggest that both good cognition and good nutritional status are associated with functional improvement in older persons. However, patients with poor cognition can also improve, depending on their degree of cognitive impairment, and they should not be routinely excluded from rehabilitation.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

All patients with isolated MCA-M1 occlusion who achieved complete reperfusion(mTICI2C-3), had a witnessed symptom onset and follow-up MRI were included. IGR was calculated as final infarct volume (FIV)(ml)/symptom onset to reperfusion time(hours) and was dichotomized according to the median value into slow-(SP) versus fast-progressors (FP). The primary analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of symptom-reperfusion time on 90-day mRS in SP and FP. Secondary analysis was performed to identify predictors of IGR.	A total of 137 patients were eligible for analysis. Mean age was 63 ± 15.4 years and median IGR was 5.13ml/hour. SP(n = 69) had higher median ASPECTS, lower median rCBF<30% lesion volume, higher proportion of favorable collaterals and hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR)<0.4, higher minimal mean arterial blood pressure before reperfusion, and lower rates of general anesthesia compared to FP(n = 68). Symptom-reperfusion time was comparable between both groups. SP had higher rates of 90-day mRS0-2(71.9%vs.38.9%,aOR;7.226,95%CI[2.431-21.482],p < 0.001) and lower median FIV.

The active form of thyroid hormone is T(3), which binds to nuclear receptors. Recently, a transporter specific for T(3), MCT8 (monocarboxylate transporter 8) was identified. MCT8 is highly expressed in liver and brain. The gene is located in Xq13 and mutations in MCT8 are responsible for an X-linked condition, Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS). This syndrome is characterized by congenital hypotonia that progresses to spasticity with severe psychomotor delays. Affected males also present with muscle hypoplasia, generalized muscle weakness, and limited speech. Importantly, these patients have elevated serum levels of free T(3), low to below normal serum levels of free T(4), and levels of thyroid stimulating hormone that are within the normal range. This constellation of measurements of thyroid function enables quick screening for AHDS in males presenting with cognitive impairment, congenital hypotonia, and generalized muscle weakness.",Remaining
251,14655759,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",TRAIL triggers apoptosis in human malignant glioma cells through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.,"Many malignant glioma cells express death receptors for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), yet some of these cells are resistant to TRAIL. Here, we examined signaling events in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and searched for therapeutic agents that could overcome TRAIL resistance in glioma cells. TRAIL induced apoptosis through death receptor 5 (DR5) and was mediated by caspase-8-initiated extrinsic and intrinsic mitochondrial pathways in sensitive glioma cell lines. TRAIL also triggered apoptosis in resistant glioma cell lines through the same pathways, but only if the cells were pretreated with chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin, camptothecin and etoposide. Previous studies suggested that this was due to an increase in DR5 expression in wild-type TP53 cells, but this mechanism did not account for cells with mutant TP53. Here, we show that a more general effect of these agents is to downregulate caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP(S) (the short form of cellular Fas-associated death domain-fike interleukin-1-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein) and up-regulate Bak, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, independently of cell's TP53 status. Furthermore, we showed that TRAIL alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, induced apoptosis in primary tumor cultures from patients with malignant gliomas, reinforcing the potential of TRAIL as an effective therapeutic agent for malignant gliomas.",In-vitro-study

254,30544301,Journal of neurosurgery,A novel method to determine the natural course of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations without the need for follow-up information.,"OBJECTIVEThere is a strong clinical need to accurately determine the average annual hemorrhage risk in unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This need motivated the present initiative to use data from a uniquely large patient population and design a novel methodology to achieve a risk determination with unprecedented accuracy. The authors also aimed to determine the impact of sex, pregnancy, AVM volume, and location on the risk for AVM rupture.METHODSThe present study does not consider any specific management of the AVMs, but only uses the age distribution for the first hemorrhage, the shape of which becomes universal for a sufficiently large set of patients. For this purpose, the authors collected observations, including age at first hemorrhage and AVM size and location, in 3425 patients. The average annual risk for hemorrhage could then be determined from the simple relation that the number of patients with their first hemorrhage at a specific age equals the risk for hemorrhage times the number of patients at risk at that age. For a subset of the patients, the information regarding occurrence of AVM hemorrhage after treatment of the first hemorrhage was used for further analysis of the influence on risk from AVM location and pregnancy.RESULTSThe age distribution for the first AVM hemorrhage was used to determine the average annual risk for hemorrhage in unruptured AVMs at adult ages (25-60 years). It was concluded to be 3.1% ± 0.2% and unrelated to AVM volume but influenced by its location, with the highest risk for centrally located AVMs. The hemorrhage risk was found to be significantly higher for females in their fertile years.CONCLUSIONSThe present methodology allowed the authors to determine the average annual risk for the first AVM hemorrhage at 3.1% ± 0.2% without the need for individual patient follow-up. This methodology has potential also for other similar types of investigations. The conclusion that centrally located AVMs carry a higher risk was confirmed by follow-up information. Follow-up information was also used to conclude that pregnancy causes a substantially greater AVM hemorrhage risk. The age distribution for AVM hemorrhage is incompatible with AVMs present at birth having the same hemorrhage risk as AVMs in adults. Plausibly, they instead develop in the early years of life, possibly with a lower hemorrhage risk during that time period.",Remaining

Despite a strong relationship between these 2 important factors in population health, there are few studies quantifying the mortality risk associated with their co-occurrence in the general population. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality according to self-reported mental health problems and alcohol intake in the general population.	We followed 243,372 participants in Norwegian health surveys (1994-2002) through 2014 for all-cause and CVD mortality by data linkage to national registries. The mean (SD) age at the time of participation in the survey was 43.9 (10.6) years, and 47.8% were men. During a mean (SD) follow-up period of 16.7 (3.2) years, 6,587 participants died from CVD, and 21,376 died from all causes. Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs according to a mental health index (low, 1.00-1.50; high, 2.01-4.00; low score is favourable) based on the General Health Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and according to self-reported alcohol intake (low, <2; light, 2-11.99; moderate, 12-23.99; high, ≥24 grams/day). HRs were adjusted for age, sex, educational level, marital status, and CVD risk factors. Compared to a reference group with low mental health index score and low alcohol intake, HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality were 0.93 (0.89, 0.97; p = 0.001), 1.00 (0.92, 1.09; p = 0.926), and 1.14 (0.96, 1.35; p = 0.119) for low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively.

Efficacy was defined as the ability to implant the WM with no peridevice leak; safety was defined as the occurrence of in-hospital and 45-day events, including stroke, pericardial effusion and device migration.	Twenty-three patients (mean age: 77.6 years; 16 men [69.6%]; mean CHA2DS2-VASc score: 5) underwent WM implantation. The indication was gastrointestinal bleeding in 14 (60.9%) patients, cerebral haemorrhage in eight (34.8%) and need for long-term ticagrelor after stent thrombosis on clopidgrel in one (4.3%). Procedural success was 95.7% (95% confidence interval: 77.3-100.0); efficacy was 90.9% (95% confidence interval: 71.0-98.7). The size of the implanted WATCHMAN™ device was in agreement with the prespecified size, based on measurement of the LAA, in 56.5% of cases. In five cases, the criteria were not met, but the device was successfully implanted in four of these, with a good result (80.0%). Treatment at discharge was a reduced dose of anticoagulant plus aspirin in three cases (13.0%) or antiplatelet therapy alone in 20 cases (90.9%). No adverse event occurred during the index hospitalization or at 45 days. At 45 days, the LAA was sealed in 18/19 patients (94.7%) on TOE, with no difference between those who did or did not have an implanted device of the prespecified size.	When performed by an operator trained in the procedure, WM implantation appears to be safe and effective. This procedure may be considered in patients at high-risk of stroke who are ineligible for long-term OAC.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
259,17765746,Progress in brain research,Dentate gyrus neurogenesis and depression.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating and complex psychiatric disorder that involves multiple neural circuits and genetic and non-genetic risk factors. In the quest for elucidating the neurobiological basis of MDD, hippocampal neurogenesis has emerged as a candidate substrate, both for the etiology as well as treatment of MDD. This chapter critiques the advances made in the study of hippocampal neurogenesis as they relate to the neurogenic hypothesis of MDD. While an involvement of neurogenesis in the etiology of depression remains highly speculative, preclinical studies have revealed a novel and previously unrecognized role for hippocampal neurogenesis in mediating some of the behavioral effects of antidepressants. The implications of these findings are discussed to reevaluate the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in MDD.",Non-systematic-review
260,24009395,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",A causative link between inner ear defects and long-term striatal dysfunction.,"There is a high prevalence of behavioral disorders that feature hyperactivity in individuals with severe inner ear dysfunction. What remains unknown is whether inner ear dysfunction can alter the brain to promote pathological behavior. Using molecular and behavioral assessments of mice that carry null or tissue-specific mutations of Slc12a2, we found that inner ear dysfunction causes motor hyperactivity by increasing in the nucleus accumbens the levels of phosphorylated adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein (pCREB) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), key mediators of neurotransmitter signaling and plasticity. Hyperactivity was remedied by local administration of the pERK inhibitor SL327. These findings reveal that a sensory impairment, such as inner ear dysfunction, can induce specific molecular changes in the brain that cause maladaptive behaviors, such as hyperactivity, that have been traditionally considered exclusively of cerebral origin.",Animal-other

This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CompCog, a computerized cognitive screening battery focusing on reaction time measurements.	A sample of 52 older adults underwent neuropsychological assessments, including CompCog, and medical appointments, to be classified as a control group or be diagnosed with MCI. The accuracy of CompCog for distinguishing between the two groups was calculated.	The results from diagnostic accuracy analyses showed that the AUCs of ROC curves were as high as 0.915 (CI 0.837-0.993). The subtest with the highest sensitivity and specificity (choice reaction time subtest) had 91.7% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity. The logistic regression final model correctly classified 92.3% of individuals, with 92.9% specificity and 91.7% sensitivity, and included only four variables from different subtests.	In summary, the study showed that reaction time assessed through CompCog is a good screening measure to differentiate between normal aging and MCI. Reaction time measurements in milliseconds were more accurate than correct answers. This test can form part of routine clinical tests to achieve the objectives of screening for MCI, indicating further procedures for investigation and diagnosis and planning interventions.

262,33837088,Science advances,C9orf72-derived arginine-containing dipeptide repeats associate with axonal transport machinery and impede microtubule-based motility.,"A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). How this mutation leads to these neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Here, we show using patient stem cell-derived motor neurons that the repeat expansion impairs microtubule-based transport, a process critical for neuronal survival. Cargo transport defects are recapitulated by treating neurons from healthy individuals with proline-arginine and glycine-arginine dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced from the repeat expansion. Both arginine-rich DPRs similarly inhibit axonal trafficking in adult Drosophila neurons in vivo. Physical interaction studies demonstrate that arginine-rich DPRs associate with motor complexes and the unstructured tubulin tails of microtubules. Single-molecule imaging reveals that microtubule-bound arginine-rich DPRs directly impede translocation of purified dynein and kinesin-1 motor complexes. Collectively, our study implicates inhibitory interactions of arginine-rich DPRs with axonal transport machinery in C9orf72-associated ALS/FTD and thereby points to potential therapeutic strategies.",Remaining
263,34309908,Journal of pineal research,Treatment of isolated REM sleep behavior disorder using melatonin as a chronobiotic.,"Melatonin is recommended as a first-line treatment in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), although no large patient group has been reported. To assess effects, time course and confounding factors in the treatment of patients with iRBD using melatonin, 209 consecutive patients were included in this single-center, observational cohort study. A total of 171 patients had taken melatonin according to our chronobiotic protocol (2 mg, ≥6 months, always-at-the-same-clock time, 10-11pm, corrected for chronotype), 13 had applied melatonin for about 1-3 months, and 25 underwent mixed treatments. In total, 1529 clinical evaluations were performed, including Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and a newly developed RBD symptom severity scale (Ikelos-RS), analyzed using linear mixed models. Validation of Ikelos-RS showed excellent inter-rater reliability (ρ = 0.9, P < .001), test-retest reliability (ρ = 0.9, P < .001) and convergent validity (ρ = 0.9, P < .001). With melatonin, RBD symptom severity gradually improved over the first 4 weeks of treatment (Ikelos-RS: 6.1 vs. 2.5; CGI Severity: 5.7 vs. 3.2) and remained stably improved (mean follow-up 4.2 ± 3.1years; range: 0.6-21.7years). Initial response was slowed to up to 3 months with melatonin-suppressing (betablockers) or REM sleep spoiling co-medication (antidepressants) and failed with inadequately timed melatonin intake. When melatonin was discontinued after 6 months, symptoms remained stably improved (mean follow-up after discontinuation of 4.9 ± 2.5years; range: 0.6-9.2). When administered only 1-3 months, RBD symptoms gradually returned. Without any melatonin, RBD symptoms persisted and did not wear off over time. Clock-timed, low-dose, long-term melatonin treatment in patients with iRBD appears to be associated with the improvement of symptoms. The outlasting improvement over years questions a pure symptomatic effect. Clock-time dependency challenges existing prescription guidelines for melatonin.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Pathological changes occur mostly in the pallidium and stratium.	We report seven patients with a new form of chronic manganese toxicity due to long-term intravenous use of a solution consisting of ephedrine, acetylsalicylic acid and potassium permanganate as a psycho-stimulant, popularly known as 'Russian Cocktail'.	The age of the patients ranged between 19 and 31 years, and the duration of substance abuse was between nine and 106 months. The onset of symptoms from first use ranged seven to 35 months. The initial symptom was impaired speech followed by gait disturbance and bradykinesia. In addition to these symptoms, choreic movements, ataxia presenting as backward falls and dystonia were also seen. Serum and urine samples revealed high levels of manganese. Hyperintense lesions on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were seen in bilateral basal ganglia and brainstem, dentate nuclei, features consistent with manganese intoxication.	Manganese toxicity, which may cause a distinctive irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, can be seen frequently with 'Russian Cocktail' abuse, a substance which can be accessed very easily and at a low cost.",Remaining
265,34048402,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension.,"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a disorder caused by spinal CSF leakage. This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.	The hallmark symptom of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is acute orthostatic headache; however, clinical presentations can be heterogeneous. New evidence shows that lumbar puncture is not always necessary or sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Some patients may have normal opening pressure, which suggests that insufficiency of CSF volume (hypovolemia) rather than CSF pressure might be the underlying mechanism. Several neuroimaging modalities can aid in diagnosis and localization of the CSF leakage, including brain MRI, spinal MRI, CT myelography, digital subtraction myelography, and radionuclide cisternography. Complications, such as subdural hematoma, can lead to a change in the headache pattern and potentially life-threatening consequences. Conservative treatments, such as fluid supplementation, can provide temporary relief; however, epidural blood patches, especially targeted ones, are more effective and definitive. For patients with refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension, surgical repair of spinal CSF leakages should be considered.	Brain and spinal MRIs are important for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Early treatment with epidural blood patches may be considered to shorten the disease duration and minimize the potential risk of complications.",Non-systematic-review

VRK2 is considered to be related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between VRK2, rs4380187 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and schizophrenia.	Peripheral blood DNA was extracted using a genomic DNA extraction kit. The DNA samples were genotyped using the Agena MassARRAY platform, and four genetic models were applied to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional logistic regression. The p value was obtained by the chi-square and t test for independent samples.	The C allele of rs4380187 SNP was significantly (p = 0.008) associated with decreased risk of SZ. The AA genotype of rs4380187 showed significantly (p = 0.009) lower frequency in cases with SZ than in controls and was associated with decreased risk of the disease. The frequency of the CA genotype of rs4380187 correlated with a 0.73-fold decreased risk of SZ (p = 0.033). In the co-dominant genetic model, the genotype of rs4380187 was associated with a decreased risk of SZ (p = 0.010). We also found that the log-additive model of rs4380187 significantly reduced the risk of SZ disease (p = 0.007).	This study provides further evidence that rs4380187 SNP is associated with SZ.

The beverage-specific effects of ethanol consumption on GGT level and MCV value were analyzed cross-sectionally and retrospectively among middle-aged Japanese men who underwent a retirement health checkup (n = 974).	Both the consumption of distilled alcohol and that of fermented alcohol positively correlated with the logarithm of GGT [standard regression coefficient (beta) 0.261 and 0.174, respectively].

The MCV value correlated with distilled alcohol consumption (beta: 0.212, p < 0.0001) but not with fermented alcohol consumption (beta: 0.043, not significant). The prevalence rate of an elevated MCV (> or = 97 fL) was higher among heavy drinkers of distilled alcohol than among heavy drinkers of fermented alcohol (35.3% vs. 16.8%, p < 0.001).

Comparison of single bilateral and double bilateral lesions.,"For future investigation of possible perturbation of circadian rhythm in animal models of Parkinson's disease we needed an animal model providing lasting 80-100% striatal dopaminergic depletion in rats, but without induced mortality. We have thus compared the effects of a single hydroxydopamine bilateral striatal lesion (SB-hydroxydopamine) with those of a double hydroxydopamine bilateral lesion (DB-hydroxydopamine) at the same dose (16 microg/striatum) by HPLC determination of dopamine and 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (dopac) levels in the striatum. Two weeks after neurosurgery, SB-hydroxydopamine and DB-hydroxydopamine induced dopaminergic depletion of at least 81% compared with control groups. After eight weeks striatal dopaminergic depletion was only 60.97% in SB-hydroxydopamine rats, suggesting a compensatory phenomenon, whereas in DB-hydroxydopamine rats dopaminergic loss was stable at 88%. For the DB-hydroxydopamine group the dopac/dopamine ratio was significantly increased at week 2 only, whereas no significant change was observed for other groups. This increase might be explained by increased dopamine turnover. We have demonstrated that striatal DB-hydroxydopamine injection induces lasting 80-100% neuronal loss, close to that observed in the disease in man, without induced mortality, and provides a tool which meets our experimental requirements.",Animal-other

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of mutations occurring in exon 14 of ATP7B gene in Romanian patients referred to a tertiary gastroenterology center, with known or suspected WD and in asymptomatic first degree relatives of index cases.	93 patients were included in the study. Exon 14 of ATP7B gene has been amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and mutations identified by sequencing.	Only H1069Q missense mutation was detected in our study group.

In paediatric WD patients (12 cases) 25% were heterozygous and 16.7% were homozygous (not significant versus adult population). Among asymptomatic first degree relatives of patients with WD (12 siblings, 25 parents) there were 40.5% cases heterozygous for H1069Q. In patients with suspected WD (17 cases), only 5.9% were heterozygous and no homozygous patient was identified. In our study group, H1069Q screening alone could not raise the Leipzig score to confirm diagnosis in patients with suspected WD or in asymptomatic first degree relatives.

Hundred ischemic stroke patients admitted to the hospital within the first 24 h of stroke onset were consecutively recruited and followed up for 14 days. The 17-item HDRS and MADRS were used to assess the severity of major depressive symptoms on day 3, day 7, and day 14 after admission. The diagnoses of depression were made in accordance with DSM-IV criteria for post-stroke depression (PSD).

Meanwhile, 50 healthy control subjects were also recruited and underwent measurement of serum BDNF and tPA once.	We found that 37 patients (37.0%) were diagnosed of major depression at the end of the follow-up. Serum BDNF on day 1 was significantly higher in non-PSD stroke patients than in normal controls, while PSD patients had significantly lower BDNF than non-PSD patients. There was a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF and tPA on day 1 only in PSD patients (r = -0.440, p = 0.006).

273,17524565,Neuroscience,Functional recovery in rats with ischemic paraplegia after spinal grafting of human spinal stem cells.,"Transient spinal cord ischemia in humans can lead to the development of permanent paraplegia with prominent spasticity and rigidity. Histopathological analyses of spinal cords in animals with ischemic spastic paraplegia show a selective loss of small inhibitory interneurons in previously ischemic segments but with a continuing presence of ventral alpha-motoneurons and descending cortico-spinal and rubro-spinal projections. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of human spinal stem cells (hSSCs) implanted spinally in rats with fully developed ischemic paraplegia on the recovery of motor function and corresponding changes in motor evoked potentials. In addition the optimal time frame for cell grafting after ischemia and the optimal dosing of grafted cells were also studied. Spinal cord ischemia was induced for 10 min using aortic occlusion and systemic hypotension. In the functional recovery study, hSSCs (10,000-30,000 cells/0.5 mul/injection) were grafted into spinal central gray matter of L2-L5 segments at 21 days after ischemia. Animals were immunosuppressed with Prograf (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg) for the duration of the study. After cell grafting the recovery of motor function was assessed periodically using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system and correlated with the recovery of motor evoked potentials. At predetermined times after grafting (2-12 weeks), animals were perfusion-fixed and the survival, and maturation of implanted cells were analyzed using antibodies recognizing human-specific antigens: nuclear protein (hNUMA), neural cell adhesion molecule (hMOC), neuron-specific enolase (hNSE) and synapthophysin (hSYN) as well as the non-human specific antibodies TUJ1, GFAP, GABA, GAD65 and GLYT2. After cell grafting a time-dependent improvement in motor function and suppression of spasticity and rigidity was seen and this improvement correlated with the recovery of motor evoked potentials. Immunohistochemical analysis of grafted lumbar segments at 8 and 12 weeks after grafting revealed intense hNSE immunoreactivity, an extensive axo-dendritic outgrowth as well as rostrocaudal and dorsoventral migration of implanted hNUMA-positive cells. An intense hSYN immunoreactivity was identified within the grafts and in the vicinity of persisting alpha-motoneurons. On average, 64% of hSYN terminals were GAD65 immunoreactive which corresponded to GABA immunoreactivity identified in 40-45% of hNUMA-positive grafted cells. The most robust survival of grafted cells was seen when cells were grafted 21 days after ischemia. As defined by cell survival and laminar distribution, the optimal dose of injected cells was 10,000-30,000 cells per injection. These data indicate that spinal grafting of hSSCs can represent an effective therapy for patients with spinal ischemic paraplegia.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

IDUs are a significant source of syringes disposed of outside the health care system. Involving IDUs in safe community sharps disposal programs is an important public health goal, but may be frustrated by legal barriers.

Mounting evidence indicates that chromatin remodelers play important roles during normal development and their mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental defects, with CHD7 haploinsuficiency being the cause of CHARGE syndrome and CHD8 being one of the strongest autism spectrum disorder (ASD) high-risk-associated genes. Herein, we report on uncharacterized functions of the chromatin remodelers Chd7 and Chd8 in OPCs. Their OPC-chromatin binding profile, combined with transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analyses of Chd7-deleted OPCs, demonstrates that Chd7 protects nonproliferative OPCs from apoptosis by chromatin closing and transcriptional repression of p53 Furthermore, Chd7 controls OPC differentiation through chromatin opening and transcriptional activation of key regulators, including Sox10, Nkx2.2, and Gpr17 However, Chd7 is dispensable for oligodendrocyte stage progression, consistent with Chd8 compensatory function, as suggested by their common chromatin-binding profiles and genetic interaction. Finally, CHD7 and CHD8 bind in OPCs to a majority of ASD risk-associated genes, suggesting an implication of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in ASD neurological defects. Our results thus offer new avenues to understand and modulate the CHD7 and CHD8 functions in normal development and disease.",Remaining

A cranial computed tomography (CCT) was carried out in a radiologic practice. A native homogeneous, smooth-edged hyperdense intracerebral mass of about 5.5 cm diameter on the right parietooccipital region with density values of +50 HU was found. Only a small proportion of about 2 cm diameter was more hyperdense with density values of +65 HU. Following intravenous administration of contrast medium, a patchy increase in density of about 1 cm was seen. The mass had only a thin hypodense rim. The patient was informed that she had a tumor. Three days later, magnetic resonance imaging was to be done for further evaluation. After the patient had returned home, she had headaches, nausea and vomiting in the evening. At night, she was admitted to a hospital as emergency case. With further increase of intracranial pressure, a craniotomy was done and a hemorrhage was removed. Histologically, a bleeding of a cavernous hemangioma was found. The patient appealed to the fact-finding board for medical liability questions because she had not been admitted to a hospital immediately after the CCT. Therefore, surgery was done delayed. The board found that the behavior of the radiologist was wrong. However, it cannot be proven that this medical malpractice is of importance for the existing postoperative complaints.",Human-case-report

This observational study of 1507 depressed adults examined baseline screens for hazardous drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score ≥ 8), severe anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item score ≥ 15) and bipolar disorder [Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ) positive screen]; 6-month depression remission; primary care, psychiatric, emergency department (ED) and inpatient visits 1 year postbaseline; and multiple covariates. Analyses included logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression.	At unadjusted baseline, 60.7% had no positive screens beyond depression, 31.5% had one (mostly severe anxiety), 6.6% had two and 1.2% had all three. In multivariate models, positive screens reduced odds of remission versus no positive screens [e.g., one screen odds ratio (OR) = 0.608, p = .000; all three OR = 0.152, p = .018]. Screening positive for severe anxiety predicted more postbaseline visits of all types; severe anxiety plus hazardous drinking predicted greater primary care, ED and inpatient; severe anxiety plus MDQ and the combination of all three positive screens both predicted greater psychiatric visits (all p < .05). Regression-adjusted utilization patterns varied across combinations of positive screens.	Positive screens predicted lower remission. Severe anxiety and its combinations with other positive screens were common and generally predicted greater utilization. Practices may benefit from assessing collaborative care patients presenting with these screening patterns to determine resource allocation.",Remaining

The NG97 cell line has been subcultured for more than 100 passages in standard culture media without feeder layer or collagen coatings. 3. NG97 cells grow in vitro as two subpopulations with distinct morphological appearance: stellate cells with pleomorphic nuclei, and small round cells with few processes. The cells have a doubling time of about 72 h and a plating efficiency of 1%. The injection of NG97 cells into congenitally athymic mice induced the formation of solid tumor masses that could be retransplanted every 4 weeks. The cells obtained from tumor mass when cultivated in vitro had a morphology comparable to those of the initial culture. 4.

Therefore, we investigated the influence of acute hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia induced by glucose or insulin infusion on neuronal and humoral control of vascular tone in rats. Euglycemic male Wistar rats were pithed under anesthesia and arterial blood pressure was measured. Changes in vascular responses to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and intravenous bolus injections of noradrenaline, angiotensin II, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were studied by infusing various concentrations of glucose or insulin. Continuous glucose infusion, which increased both blood glucose and serum insulin levels, significantly augmented adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses to SCS without affecting pressor responses to injection of noradrenaline or angiotensin II. In pithed rats with artificially increased blood pressure and blockade of autonomic outflow, glucose infusion attenuated CGRPergic nerve-depressor responses to SCS without affecting depressor responses to injection of CGRP, acetylcholine or SNP. In pithed rats treated with octreotide, which increased blood glucose without increasing serum insulin levels, glucose infusion caused only significant augmentation of adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses. Combined infusion of insulin and glucose, which resulted in increased serum insulin levels with euglycemia, significantly augmented adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses and attenuated CGRPergic nerve-mediated depressor responses. The present results suggest that acute hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia increase adrenergic nerve-mediated vasoconstriction, which in turn blunts CGRPergic nerve function, and that the increase in plasma insulin concentration associated with hyperglycemia may be responsible for the alteration of neuronal vascular regulation.",Animal-other

Adult,An ecologically sensitive measure of executive cognition (the Breakfast Task) improves prediction of functional outcome in schizophrenia.,"Previous work has found that the Breakfast Task (BT), a computerized, ecologically informed executive ability measure, is sensitive to group differences in aging, acquired brain injury, and Parkinson's disease. We investigated whether this measure improves the prediction of functional status over and above standard measures of general intellectual ability, relationship perception, life skills, and symptom severity in individuals with schizophrenia. Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the joint and incremental validity of the BT in predicting functional disability scores on the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS 2.0). Analyses with combined patient (n = 25) and control (n = 32) participants showed that participant status (patients versus control) was the only significant predictor of functional outcome. However, in the patient data, the proportion of variance accounted for improved significantly (model R[2] of 4% vs. 25%) when BT scores were added to a model containing clinical (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), social (Relationships Across Domains), intellectual (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), and life skills (Canadian Objective Assessment of Life Skills) measures.

285,22440072,Behavior therapy,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy improves emotional reactivity to social stress: results from a randomized controlled trial.,"The high likelihood of recurrence in depression is linked to a progressive increase in emotional reactivity to stress (stress sensitization). Mindfulness-based therapies teach mindfulness skills designed to decrease emotional reactivity in the face of negative affect-producing stressors. The primary aim of the current study was to assess whether Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is efficacious in reducing emotional reactivity to social evaluative threat in a clinical sample with recurrent depression. A secondary aim was to assess whether improvement in emotional reactivity mediates improvements in depressive symptoms. Fifty-two individuals with partially remitted depression were randomized into an 8-week MBCT course or a waitlist control condition. All participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) before and after the 8-week trial period. Emotional reactivity to stress was assessed with the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory at several time points before, during, and after the stressor. MBCT was associated with decreased emotional reactivity to social stress, specifically during the recovery (post-stressor) phase of the TSST. Waitlist controls showed an increase in anticipatory (pre-stressor) anxiety that was absent in the MBCT group. Improvements in emotional reactivity partially mediated improvements in depressive symptoms. Limitations include small sample size, lack of objective or treatment adherence measures, and non-generalizability to more severely depressed populations. Given that emotional reactivity to stress is an important psychopathological process underlying the chronic and recurrent nature of depression, these findings suggest that mindfulness skills are important in adaptive emotion regulation when coping with stress.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention

287,31132877,Foot & ankle international,New Persistent Opioid Use and Associated Risk Factors Following Treatment of Ankle Fractures.,"The aim of this study was to define the rate of new persistent opioid use and risk factors for persistent opioid use after operative and nonoperative treatment of ankle fractures.	Using a nationwide insurance claims database, Clinformatics DataMart Database, we identified opioid-naïve patients who underwent surgical treatment of unstable ankle fracture patterns between January 2009 and June 2016. Patients who underwent closed treatment of a distal fibula fracture served as a comparative group. We evaluated peritreatment and posttreatment opioid prescription fills. The primary outcome, new persistent opioid use, was defined as opioid prescription fulfillment between 91 and 180 days after the procedure. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of patient factors, and the differences of the effect were tested using Wald statistics. The adjusted persistent use rates were calculated. A total of 13 088 patients underwent treatment of an ankle fracture and filled a peritreatment opioid prescription.	When compared with closed treatment of a distal fibula fracture, only 2 surgical treatment subtypes demonstrated significantly increased rates of persistent use compared with the closed treatment group: open treatment of bimalleolar ankle fracture (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.58; P = .002) and open treatment of trimalleolar ankle fracture with fixation of posterior lip (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04-2.07; P = .027). Rates were significantly increased (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.34-1.82; P < .001) among patients who received a total peritreatment opioid dose that was in the top 25th percentile of total oral morphine equivalents. Factors independently associated with new persistent opioid use included mental health disorders, comorbid conditions, tobacco use, and female sex.	All ankle fracture treatment groups demonstrated high rates of new persistent opioid use, and persistent use was not directly linked to injury severity. Instead, we identified patient factors that demonstrated increased risk of persistent opioid use. Limiting the peritreatment opioid dose was the largest modifiable risk factor related to new persistent opioid use in this privately insured cohort.

The state of the astrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). HCP and TET caused a dose-related spongiosis, but cuprizone had no significant effect on the brain. With chronic HCP treatment, the spongiosis was accompanied by astrocyte hypertrophy and proliferation, and the extent of the gliotic reaction was related to the dose of HCP. The results demonstrate that HCP can produce and maintain astrocyte proliferation in the rat brain. Such an agent was required for use in an investigation of a putative tumour promoter in the rat.",Animal-other

We describe two young men with various neurological symptoms after traffic accident, who were diagnosed with Barrè-Lièou syndrome. Both case 1 (41-year-old man) and case 2 (34-year-old man) showed no abnormal findings in head and cervical X-ray, CT-scan and MRI. Only radionuclide cisternography (RNC) showed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak into epidural space at thoracolumbar level. Three months (case 1) and four years (case 2) had passed after each accident. Two patients underwent epidural blood patch (EBP) for total of three times. The average volumes of the blood used for EBP were 30 ml (case 1) and 24 ml (case 2). The procedure improved various symptoms except for neck stiffness and dizziness. EBP had led to low back pain, which disappeared within three days. CSF leak vanished in RNC after EBP. Severe complication, for example epidural infection or neurological disorders due to hematoma, was not noticed. While neural blockade did not relieve pain before EBP, we could get good effect from neural blockade for remaining symptoms after EBP.

Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief preventive group intervention for postpartum depression (PPD) in a naturalistic setting, and study the effect of this on social and psychological risk factors.	We conducted a randomized controlled trial (n = 1,719) in south-eastern Hungary in 62 antepartum centers. Pregnant women (n = 710) underwent a 4-session preventive group intervention whereas a control group (n = 1,009) attended 4 sessions providing the same information given in usual care.	Our intervention appeared to significantly reduce the risk of PPD, as defined by Leverton Questionnaire total scores (OR = 0.69). It resulted in an absolute risk reduction of about 18% in those with antepartum depression and 0.5% in those with no depression at recruitment. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a much reduced risk in those with a perceived lack of partner support (OR = 0.4) in the treatment group. Unplanned pregnancy, an irreversible risk factor affecting every fifth woman, also seemed to have a reduced effect on PPD after our group intervention (OR = 0.81).

291,3748456,Neuroscience letters,A comparison of platelet monoamine oxidase activity and phosphatidylserine content between chronic paranoid schizophrenics and normal controls.,"Mitochondrial monoamine oxidase (MAO), type B, has been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia. We have found the phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS) to be a highly specific inhibitor of MAO-B, which has led us to postulate that the PS-MAO interaction might offer a basis for the lower MAO levels observed in platelets from certain schizophrenic populations. In this study we compared platelet MAO activity with phospholipid composition in a group of normals and chronic paranoid schizophrenics. The phospholipids in platelets and erythrocytes were extracted and separated by high-performance liquid chromatography into major classes phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and PS. The paranoid subjects showed statistically significantly lower MAO activity as well as higher mean levels of PS and lower levels of PC in both platelets and erythrocytes, consistent with our hypothesis. The Ca2+-stimulated synthesis of serine-lipid in platelets was also monitored by incorporation of radioisotope into lipid extracts from 14C-labelled serine substrate, and no significant differences were found between subjects groups with respect to this parameter.",Remaining
292,16268859,Journal of advanced nursing,Agitation in dementia: concept clarification.,"The aim of this paper is to clarify the concept of agitation in dementia through analysing definitions, critical attributes, components, boundaries, antecedents and consequences of agitation.	The concept of agitation is not well defined. In addition, there exists much confusion about the characteristics and boundaries of agitation, as well as the distinction between agitation and related concepts. Recently developed theoretical models for agitation in dementia require new interpretation and conceptualization of agitation.	Morse's method of critical appraisal of the literature was used. In addition, some parts of Rodgers' evolutionary method were employed. Data were selected using six electronic databases and the key words 'agitation', 'agitated', 'dementia', 'demented' and 'Alzheimer'. The analysis included 86 empirical or theoretical papers and one book.	A transition from the observer's perspective to the patient's perspective in the interpretation of agitation was found. Five critical attributes of agitation in dementia were identified: excessive, inappropriate, repetitive, non-specific and observable. Patient factors, interpersonal factors, environmental factors and restraint were identified as precipitating antecedents. Mediating antecedents included discomfort, unmet need and misinterpretation. Consequences of agitation were identified at the levels of patient, caregiver and others.	This transition in perspectives has important implications as it can change health providers' attitudes and responses to agitation and lead to patient-focused and individualized care. Researchers and clinicians are encouraged to avoid labelling agitated behaviour as 'disturbing behaviour'.",Non-systematic-review

294,1283445,Neurobiology of aging,Reduced GAP-43 message levels are associated with increased neurofibrillary tangle density in the frontal association cortex (area 9) in Alzheimer's disease.,"We previously suggested the hypothesis that defective neuronal plasticity is a major neurobiological deficit causing the dementia of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used message levels of the growth-associated protein, GAP-43, as a marker of axonal plasticity to examine the hypothesis of defective neuronal plasticity in AD. When all AD cases are combined, the average level of GAP-43 message in area 9 of the AD frontal association cortex was not significantly different from the level in the comparably aged control cortex. Differentiation of AD cases on the basis of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) density revealed that in AD cases with high tangle density average GAP-43 message level was reduced fivefold relative to levels in AD cases with low NFT density. AD cases with low neurofibrillary tangle density had levels of GAP-43 message that were not significantly different from the levels of normal controls. Differentiation of AD cases on the basis of neuritic plaque density did not indicate as strong a relationship to GAP-43 message level. The association between neurofibrillary tangle density and GAP-43 message level suggests the hypothesis that neurofibrillary tangles may reduce GAP-43 expression. Data of others show a relationship between high NFT density and reduced levels of synaptophysin-like immunoreactivity and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism. These data combine to suggest a set of AD cases with high NFT density, reduced axonal plasticity, reduced synaptic density, and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism--all variables that may be directly related to the functioning of the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Remaining
295,15221931,The Journal of pathology,Prevalence of lymphoreticular prion protein accumulation in UK tissue samples.,"This study aims to provide an estimate of the number of individuals in the UK who may be incubating variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and at risk of causing iatrogenic spread of the disease. Lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein is a consistent feature of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob at autopsy and has also been demonstrated in the pre-clinical phase. Immunohistochemical accumulation of prion protein in the lymphoreticular system remains the only technique that has been shown to predict neurological disease reliably in animal prion disorders. In this study, immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate the presence of prion protein, with monoclonal antibodies KG9 and 3F4, in surgically removed tonsillectomy and appendicectomy specimens. The samples were collected from histopathology departments across the UK and anonymised prior to testing. Samples were tested from 16 703 patients (14 964 appendectomies, 1739 tonsillectomies), approximately 60% of whom were from the age group 20-29 years at operation. Twenty-five per cent of the samples were excluded from the final analyses because they contained inadequate amounts of lymphoid tissue. Three appendicectomy samples showed lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein, giving an estimated prevalence of 3/12 674 or 237 per million (95% CI 49-692 per million). The pattern of lymphoreticular accumulation in two of these samples was dissimilar from that seen in known cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Although it is uncertain whether immunohistochemical accumulation of prion protein in the lymphoreticular system is specific for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, it has not been described in any other disease, including other forms of human prion disease or a range of inflammatory and infective conditions. These findings reinforce the importance of measures taken by the UK Department of Health to reduce the risk of spread of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob via blood products and surgical instruments, and of the urgency to proceed with large-scale screening of fresh tonsil specimens for the presence of prion protein.",Remaining

298,37905374,Cognitive science,Repeat After Me? Both Children With and Without Autism Commonly Align Their Language With That of Their Caregivers.,"Linguistic repetitions in children are conceptualized as negative in children with autism - echolalia, without communicative purpose - and positive in typically developing (TD) children - linguistic alignment involved in shared engagement, common ground and language acquisition. To investigate this apparent contradiction we analyzed spontaneous speech in 67 parent-child dyads from a longitudinal corpus (30 minutes of play activities at 6 visits over 2 years). We included 32 children with autism and 35 linguistically matched TD children (mean age at recruitment 32.76 and 20.27 months). We found a small number of exact repetitions in both groups (roughly 1% of utterances across visits), which increased over time in children with autism and decreased in the TD group. Partial repetitions were much more frequent: children reused caregivers' words at high rates regardless of diagnostic group (24% of utterances at first visit), and this increased in frequency (but not level) over time, faster for TD children (at final visit: 33% for autism, 40% for TD). The same happened for partial repetition of syntax and semantic alignment. However, chance alignment (as measured by surrogate pairs) also increased and findings for developmental changes were reliable only for syntactic and semantic alignment. Children with richer linguistic abilities also displayed a higher tendency to partially re-use their caregivers' language (alignment rates and semantic alignment). This highlights that all children commonly re-used the words, syntax, and topics of their caregivers, albeit with some quantitative differences, and that most repetition was at least potentially productive, with repeated language being re-contextualized and integrated with non-repeated language. The salience of echolalia in ASD might be partially explained by slight differences in frequency, amplified by lower semantic alignment, persistence over time, and expectations of echolalia. More in-depth qualitative and quantitative analyses of how repetitions are used and received in context are needed.",Remaining

The administration of PF (2.5 and 5 mg kg(-1), s.c.) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both neurological impairment and the histologically measured infarction volume. Similar results were also obtained when PF (2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was given in permanent ischemia model. The neuroprotective effect of PF (10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was abolished by pretreatment of DPCPX (0.25 mg kg(-1), s.c.), a selective adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) antagonist. PF (10, 40, and 160 mg kg(-1), i.v.) had no effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rates (HR) in the conscious rat. Additionally, PF (10(-3) mol l(-1)) had no effect on noradrenaline- (NA-) or high K+ concentration-induced contractions of isolated rabbit primary artery. In competitive binding experiments, PF did not compete with the binding of [3H]DPCPX, but displaced the binding of [3H]NECA to the membrane preparation of rat cerebral cortex. This binding manner was distinguished from the classical A1R agonists. The results demonstrated that activation of A1R might be involved in PF-induced neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia in rat. However, PF had no 'well-known' cardiovascular side effects of classical A1R agonists. The results suggest that PF might have the potential therapeutic value as an anti-stroke drug.",Animal-drug-intervention
303,32279420,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,HOTAIR/miR-125 axis-mediated Hexokinase 2 expression promotes chemoresistance in human glioblastoma.,"Drug resistance is one of the major obstacles in glioblastoma (GBM) treatments using temozolomide (TMZ) based conventional chemotherapy. Recent studies revealed that Hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated glycolysis is one of the sources, as the association of chemoresistance and the expression of HK2 was confirmed in multiple cancers. However, there has been little knowledge of the functional contribution of HK2 to TMZ resistance in GBM. In our study, we found that HK2 expression is crucial for GBM proliferation and chemoresistance. In contrast to the healthy brain, HK2 expression is much higher in human GBM, especially in those patients with GBM recurrence. High HK2 expression is negatively related to the overall survival in GBM patients. HK2 depletion in GBM cells suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to TMZ-induced apoptosis. Both HK2-mediated glycolysis and mitochondria permeability transition pore opening (MPTP) were associated with its function in chemoresistance. Furthermore, we also revealed that the abnormal expression of HK2 was modulated by the expression of HOTAIR, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The absence of HOTAIR in GBM cells suppressed the HK2 expression in protein and mRNA level and, therefore, inhibited the cell proliferation and enhanced the cytotoxicity of TMZ both in vivo and in vitro. HOTAIR promoted the expression of HK2 by targeting mir-125, which suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased the TMZ-induced apoptosis. These findings shed light on a new therapeutic strategy in modulating HOTAIR/miR-125, which may interfere with the expression of HK2, and enhance the therapeutic sensitivity of GBM to TMZ.",Remaining
304,9733408,Seizure,The neurophysiological evaluation of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.,"The most reliable technique for the diagnosis of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is nocturnal video-polysomnography, which is an expensive procedure and unavailable in many Departments of Neurology and Epileptology around the world. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of routine video-EEG and video-EEG after sleep deprivation, during the daytime, in the diagnosis of NFLE. We studied 23 patients complaining of repeated nocturnal motor attacks using a 3-level neurophysiological evaluation, including video-EEG when awake (level 1), video-EEG after sleep deprivation, during the daytime (level 2) and nocturnal video-polysomnography (level 3). All the patients had a normal video-EEG when awake. The video-EEG after sleep deprivation (level 2) allowed a diagnosis of NFLE in 52.2% of the patients, while the nocturnal video-polysomnography (level 3) allowed this diagnosis in 87.0% of the same sample. In the patients complaining of repeated nocturnal motor attacks, a video-EEG after sleep deprivation performed during the daytime, could be useful for diagnosis in about one half of cases. This methodology is routinely performed in many Departments of Neurology and Epileptology, and is much less binding and expensive than nocturnal video-polysomnography and so it could be important economically for the health service.",Remaining
305,19734013,Schizophrenia research,The impact of context processing deficits on task-switching performance in schizophrenia.,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been described as important for maintaining and implementing contextual information in the service of goal-oriented behavior. Accordingly, impairments in context processing are thought to underlie cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, a clinical disorder that has been linked to PFC dysfunction (Servan-Schreiber et al., 1996). However, task switching, a cognitive ability linked to PFC function, has not been consistently impaired in schizophrenia. In this experiment, we assessed whether task-switching performance would be selectively impaired for patients when context demands were high. In the rule-switching condition, a switch required the updating of the relevant task response rules whereas perceptual switching did not entail a switching of contextual information. Instead, a perceptual switch entailed a shift of visuospatial attention to the relevant feature. A second goal was to determine whether potential deficits in context switching would be observed in schizophrenia even in situations when these patients do not need to overcome a prepotent response. Studies of context processing have typically required patients with schizophrenia to use contextual rules to overcome prepotent response tendencies whereas our switching paradigm did not require the inhibition of a competing response. Patients were much slower to switch tasks than controls when contextual rules switched from one trial to the next whereas their performance was intact when the switch occurred between different feature sets and contextual demands were low. Our results demonstrate that context processing deficits are observable in schizophrenia even when there is no prepotent response tendency to inhibit. Moreover, our results suggest that PFC impairments influence performance primarily when patients are required to switch the application of one explicit rule to another.",Remaining

TOP2B is expressed in the developing nervous system and is involved in brain development and neural differentiation. Recently, a de novo missense TOP2B variant (c.187C>T) has been identified in an individual with neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). However, the association between TOP2B variants and NDDs remains uncertain.	Trio-based whole-exome sequencing was performed on a 7-year-old girl, presenting muscle hypotonia, stereotypic hand movements, epilepsy, global developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder. Brain magnetic resonance images were normal. She was unable to walk independently and spoke no meaningful words.	We found a de novo variant in TOP2B (NM_001330700.1:c.187C>T, p.(His63Tyr)), which is identical to the previous case. The clinical features of the two individuals with the c.187C>T variant overlapped.	Our study supports the finding that TOP2B variants may cause NDDs.",Remaining

Secondly, to investigate whether the HRQoL of spouses was correlated with the assessment of their partner's depression, their own depression and the self-perceived level of care burden experienced by the caregiver partner.	Assessment of patients was based on the clinical diagnosis of a major depressive disorder as established by the criteria of the DSM-IV-TR, the geriatric depression scale GDS-15 and the LEIPAD questionnaire specific to subjects aged 65 or over living at home. Spouses were assessed by GDS-15, the Zarit scale for assessing caregiver burden and the LEIPAD questionnaire. The HRQoL of controls, who were matched for age, sex and educational level, was assessed by LEIPAD.	The study sample (n=38) was made up of 19 patients (mean age of 76.6 years, standard deviation 8.1) and their spouses (mean age of 75.3 years, standard deviation 8.2). The HRQoL score of the spouses was significantly poorer for the scale 'Sexual functioning' (P=0.0007) than that of controls and was negatively affected by their partner's depression (P=0.02). The HRQoL scores of the spouses for 'Physical function', 'Depression and anxiety' and 'Sexual functioning' were negatively affected by their own depression (correlation coefficients r=0.50, 0.53 and 0.54, respectively). The HRQoL scores for 'Self-care', 'Sexual functioning' and 'Life satisfaction' were also negatively affected in spouses by the self-perceived burden of care (correlation coefficients r=0.59, 0.57 and 0.51, respectively).	The sexual quality of life of spouses of elderly patients suffering from a major depressive disorder was significantly impaired. The patients' and spouses' depression and the caregivers' burden also had a negative impact on several aspects of the HRQoL of the spouses. It seems to be important, therefore, to assess the mental state, care burden and HRQoL of spouses caring for elderly patients suffering from depression so as to offer help when required to partners in difficulty.",Remaining

The present study aims to compare the results obtained by low-risk preterm and full term children in the NBAS, and relate possible differences to biological and contextual factors.	Early neurobehavioral development of 150 preterm (PR) children is compared to that of 49 full term children (FT). The children were assessed at the age of 15 days (corrected age for preterm children) with the NBAS. Biological and environmental variables were collected through an extended interview with the mothers as well as medical data.	Significant differences were found between preterm and full term children in the following areas: motor, range of state, and regulation of state. Differences were also found in relation to birth weight in these same three areas, following a parallel pattern. These differences between the two groups were not, however, necessarily more favorable for the FT group; the PR group had higher results in the motor and range of state areas, and lower results in the regulation of state area. The mothers' smoking habit had a negative effect on infants' regulation and orientation.	No general maturation delay in this particular sample of preterm children was found.",Remaining

On the 4th week of the study, daily doses of 200 micrograms EE2 were also given to each subject for 4 days. Twelve postmenopausal women were given sulpiride orally in a daily dose of 150 mg throughout the study. Serum levels of prolactin were raised in all 12 subjects given sulpiride. In the 12 sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemic postmenopausal women, EE2 was given in the same manner as in normal postmenopausal women. The negative feedback effect of estrogen with low doses of EE2 (40 micrograms/day for 4 weeks) and the positive feedback effect of estrogen after the subsequent administration of EE2 (200 micrograms/day for 4 days) were demonstrated in both normoprolactinemic and hyperprolactinemic groups. The result of the present study suggests that sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemia does not affect the negative and positive feedback effect of estrogen in postmenopausal women.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
311,29233751,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",Differential binding of antibodies in PANDAS patients to cholinergic interneurons in the striatum.,"Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus, or PANDAS, is a syndrome of acute childhood onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in the aftermath of an infection with Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS). Its pathophysiology remains unclear. PANDAS has been proposed to result from cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against GABHS with brain antigens, but the targets of these antibodies are unclear and may be heterogeneous. We developed an in vivo assay in mice to characterize the cellular targets of antibodies in serum from individuals with PANDAS. We focus on striatal interneurons, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of tic disorders. Sera from children with well-characterized PANDAS (n = 5) from a previously described clinical trial (NCT01281969), and matched controls, were infused into the striatum of mice; antibody binding to interneurons was characterized using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Antibodies from children with PANDAS bound to ∼80% of cholinergic interneurons, significantly higher than the <50% binding seen with matched healthy controls. There was no elevated binding to two different populations of GABAergic interneurons (PV and nNOS-positive), confirming the specificity of this phenomenon. Elevated binding to cholinergic interneurons resolved in parallel with symptom improvement after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Antibody-mediated dysregulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons may be a locus of pathology in PANDAS. Future clarification of the functional consequences of this specific binding may identify new opportunities for intervention in children with this condition.",Animal-other
312,33922322,Cells,Mind the Gap: LRRK2 Phenotypes in the Clinic vs. in Patient Cells.,"Mutations in the Parkinson's disease (PD) protein Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been under study for more than 15 years and our understanding of the cellular phenotypes for the pathogenic mutant forms of LRRK2 has significantly advanced. In parallel to research on LRRK2 mutations in experimental systems, clinical characterization of patients carrying LRRK2 mutations has advanced, as has the analysis of cells that are derived from these patients, including fibroblasts, blood-derived cells, or cells rendered pluripotent. Under the hypothesis that patient clinical phenotypes are a consequence of a cascade of underlying molecular mechanisms gone astray, we currently have a unique opportunity to compare findings from patients and patient-derived cells to ask the question of whether the clinical phenotype of LRRK2 Parkinson's disease and cellular phenotypes of LRRK2 patient-derived cells may be mutually informative. In this review, we aim to summarize the available information on phenotypes of LRRK2 mutations in the clinic, in patient-derived cells, and in experimental models in order to better understand the relationship between the three at the molecular and cellular levels and identify trends and gaps in correlating the data.",Non-systematic-review

The previously healthy child presented with lethargy and headache, and initial imaging revealed only ventriculomegaly with trace intraventricular blood. His mental status improved with CSF diversion via an external ventricular drain. Further workup revealed a spinal AVF that was treated via endovascular embolization. His course was complicated by vasospasm requiring endovascular treatment and he eventually required ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. He made a full recovery and has returned to his normal activities. This is a unique case of spinal AVF presentation and highlights the importance of considering imaging of the entire neuroaxis during workup for hydrocephalus.",Human-case-report

We gave the transgenic (Tg) mice either atorvastatin or pitavastatin from 5-20 months (M) of age, and performed immunohistological analysis [4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE)-positive, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R)-positive neurons, apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-positive senile plaque (SP), and insulin receptor (IR)-positive endothelium], and biochemistry analysis (adiponectin and leptin).	The numbers of 4-HNE- and AGE-positive neurons and the sum of ApoE-positive SP size progressively increased with age in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-Tg mice, while the amount of IR-positive endothelium and the number of LDL-R-positive neurons decreased. Adiponectin and leptin serum levels were lower in APP-Tg mice than in non-Tg mice. Treatment with statins reduced the number of AGE-positive neurons from as early as 10 M, preserved the numbers of 4-HNE- and LDL-R-positive neurons and the amount of IR-positive endothelium at 15 M, and reduced the sum of ApoE-positive SP size and adiponectin serum level at 20 M.	Atorvastatin and pitavastatin reduced the level of oxidative stress, as revealed by the presence of 4-HNE and AGE, in AD mouse brains, and that treatment with statins improves insulin signaling and LDL-R/ApoE systems.

317,21951913,Molecular brain,Transplantation of human neural stem/progenitor cells overexpressing galectin-1 improves functional recovery from focal brain ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil.,"Transplantation of human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSPCs) is a promising method to regenerate tissue from damage and recover function in various neurological diseases including brain ischemia. Galectin-1(Gal1) is a lectin that is expressed in damaged brain areas after ischemia. Here, we characterized the detailed Gal1 expression pattern in an animal model of brain ischemia. After brain ischemia, Gal1 was expressed in reactive astrocytes within and around the infarcted region, and its expression diminished over time. Previously, we showed that infusion of human Gal1 protein (hGal1) resulted in functional recovery after brain ischemia but failed to reduce the volume of the ischemic region. This prompted us to examine whether the combination of hNSPCs-transplantation and stable delivery of hGal1 around the ischemic region could reduce the ischemic volume and promote better functional recovery after brain ischemia. In this study, we transplanted hNSPCs that stably overexpressed hGal1 (hGal1-hNSPCs) in a model of unilateral focal brain ischemia using Mongolian gerbils. Indeed, we found that transplantation of hGal1-hNSPCs both reduced the ischemic volume and improved deficits in motor function after brain ischemia to a greater extent than the transplantation of hNSPCs alone. This study provides evidence for a potential application of hGal1 with hNSPCs-transplantation in the treatment of brain ischemia.",Animal-non-drug-intervention
318,30875614,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,Early prediction of long-term tactile object recognition performance after sensorimotor stroke.,"Until now tactile agnosia has been reported only in small, but detailed cross-sectional case studies. Here we show that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of early diffusion-weighted lesion maps can be used to accurately predict long-term recovery of tactile object recognition (TOR) in 35 subjects with varying hand skill impairment and associated specific daily activity limitation after cortical sensori-motor stroke. Multiple regression analysis revealed the essentially dysfunctional subprocesses for object recognition in the specifically impaired subjects, i.e., grasping as determined by a subtest of Jebsen Taylor hand function test, and perception of macrogeometrical object properties. The Gaussian process regression of MVPA represents a function that relates a selection of lesioned voxels as input variables to TOR performance scores as target variables. On the behavioural level, patients fell into three recovery subgroups, depending on TOR performance over the observation period. Only baseline motor hand skill and shape discrimination were significantly correlated with the TOR trajectories. To define functionally meaningful voxels, we combined information from MVPA of lesion maps and a priori knowledge of regions of interest derived from a data bank for shape recognition. A high significance for the predicted TOR performances over nine months could be verified by permutation tests, leading us to expect that the model generalises to larger patient cohorts with first cortical ischemic stroke. The lesion sites of the persistently impaired subjects exhibited an overlap with critical areas related to the MVPA prediction map in the cytoarchitectonic areas PFt of inferior parietal lobule and OP1 of parietal operculum which are associated with higher order sensory processing. This ultimate check corroborated the significance of the MVPA map for the prediction of tactile object recognition. The clinical implication of our study is that neuroimaging data acquired immediately after first stroke could facilitate individual forecasting of post-stroke recovery.",Remaining

Here we use such a model, termed APPsi:tTA, to determine what phenotypes persist in mice with high amyloid burden after new production of APP/Aβ has been suppressed. We find that 12- to 13-month-old APPsi:tTA mice are impaired in cognitive tasks that assess short- and long-term memories. Acutely suppressing new APPsi/Aβ production produced highly significant improvements in performing short-term spatial memory tasks, which upon continued suppression translated to superior performance in more demanding tasks that assess long-term spatial memory and working memory. Deficits in episodic-like memory and cognitive flexibility, however, were more persistent. Arresting mutant APPsi production caused a rapid decline in the brain levels of soluble APP ectodomains, full-length APP, and APP C-terminal fragments. As expected, amyloid deposits persisted after new APP/Aβ production was inhibited, whereas, unexpectedly, we detected persistent pools of solubilizable, relatively mobile, Aβ42. Additionally, we observed persistent levels of Aβ-immunoreactive entities that were of a size consistent with SDS-resistant oligomeric assemblies. Thus, in this model with significant amyloid pathology, a rapid amelioration of cognitive deficits was observed despite persistent levels of oligomeric Aβ assemblies and low, but detectable solubilizable Aβ42 peptides. These findings implicate complex relationships between accumulating Aβ and activities of APP, soluble APP ectodomains, and/or APP C-terminal fragments in mediating cognitive deficits in this model of amyloidosis.",Animal-other

In October 1986 a Massachusetts state psychiatric facility opened a rehabilitative program for such patients in a separate 40-bed unit on the hospital grounds. All patients admitted to the Specialized Habilitative and Rehabilitative Environment (SHARE) program had long histories of institutionalization, and many had been treated with neuroleptic drugs for several years. Most patients now attend day programming, and a few have been able to move on to less restrictive environments. Patients' average neuroleptic dosage has been substantially reduced. This progress has been made in spite of such program-development problems as the need to change staff's long-held perspectives about dual-diagnosis patients, lack of funding, and high staff turnover.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
328,23461676,The European journal of neuroscience,Uncovering novel actors in astrocyte-neuron crosstalk in Parkinson's disease: the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade as the common final pathway for neuroprotection and self-repair.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neuronal cell bodies in the substantia nigra pars compacta and gliosis. The cause and mechanisms underlying the demise of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons are ill-defined, but interactions between genes and environmental factors are recognized to play a critical role in modulating the vulnerability to PD. Current evidence points to reactive glia as a pivotal factor in PD pathophysiology, playing both protective and destructive roles. Here, the contribution of reactive astrocytes and their ability to modulate DAergic neurodegeneration, neuroprotection and neurorepair in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) rodent model of PD will be discussed in the light of novel emerging evidence implicating wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin signaling as a strong candidate in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic plasticity. In this work, we highlight an intrinsic Wnt1/frizzled-1/β-catenin tone that critically contributes to the survival and protection of adult midbrain DAergic neurons, with potential implications for drug design or drug action in PD. The dynamic interplay between astrocyte-derived factors and neurogenic signals in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic neurotoxicity and repair will be summarized, together with recent findings showing a critical role of glia-neural stem/progenitor cell (NPC) interactions aimed at overcoming neurodegeneration and inducing neurorestoration. Understanding the intrinsic plasticity of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons and deciphering the signals facilitating the crosstalk between astrocytes, microglia, DAergic neurons and NPCs may have major implications for the role of stem cell technology in PD, and for identifying potential therapeutic targets to induce endogenous neurorepair.",Animal-other

We examined whether negative age stereotypes, which older individuals tend to assimilate from the environment across their lifespan, contributed to an increased risk of developing four psychiatric conditions, and, if so, whether this risk was reduced through active coping.	The sample consisted of participants aged 55 years and older, free of the psychiatric conditions at baseline, drawn from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative sample. New cases of posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder were assessed during three waves spanning a four-year period.	As predicted, participants holding more-negative age stereotypes were more likely to develop the psychiatric conditions, and their engagement in active coping reduced the risk of their developing these conditions.

330,1358438,Cancer research,Evidence for the involvement of a potential second tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 17 distinct from p53 in malignant astrocytomas.,"Molecular analysis of malignant astrocytomas demonstrated three distinct groups of tumors with chromosome 17p abnormalities, which include (a) deletion of the p53 locus (17p13.1) and mutations in the remaining allele, (b) deletion of the p53 locus but no detectable mutations in the remaining allele, and (c) deletions not including the p53 locus but mutations in one of the alleles. Furthermore, deletion mapping analysis demonstrated allelic loss of genes distal to D17S28/D17S5 markers (17p13.3) in group C tumors. The loss of heterozygosity of genes on chromosome 17 without detectable mutation (group B) or deletion (group C) in the p53 gene implies the presence of a second tumor suppressor gene in the telomeric region of 17p, the homozygous functional inactivation of which may play a role, either alone or in conjunction with p53, in the initiation and/or progression of astrocytic neoplasms.",Remaining

Five males with tetraplegia (TP) and four males with paraplegia (PR) exercised 1) sitting, 2) supine, and 3) sitting with the addition of a) an anti-gravity suit (anti-G), b) elastic stockings and abdominal binder, and c) functional electrical stimulation of the leg muscles. Compared to sitting, the following significant changes were observed: in the supine position, heart rate (HR) decreased (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 76 vs 92 b/min) and stroke volume (SV) increased (PR: 132 vs 116 ml, TP: 96 vs 83 ml). The anti-G suit induced a decrease in heart rate (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 87 vs 92 b/min) and a decrease in oxygen uptake (VO2) in PR. Stockings only affected TP, i.e. a decrease in heart rate with 5 b/min and an increase in stroke volume with 13 ml/beat. Functional electrical stimulation produced an increase in VO2 (PR: 1.00 vs 0.95 l/min, TP: 0.68 vs 0.53 l/min) and a rise in stroke volume in TP. Results indicate that the methods employed to support the circulatory redistribution have different working mechanisms and, in addition, that the effects are different for TP and PR probably because of differences in active muscle mass, sympathetic impairment and blood pressure values.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
332,20346443,Biological psychiatry,Characterization of a family with rare deletions in CNTNAP5 and DOCK4 suggests novel risk loci for autism and dyslexia.,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by social, communication, and behavioral deficits and complex genetic etiology. A recent study of 517 ASD families implicated DOCK4 by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association and a microdeletion in an affected sibling pair.	The DOCK4 microdeletion on 7q31.1 was further characterized in this family using QuantiSNP analysis of 1M SNP array data and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Extended family members were tested by polymerase chain reaction amplification of junction fragments. DOCK4 dosage was measured in additional samples using SNP arrays. Since QuantiSNP analysis identified a novel CNTNAP5 microdeletion in the same affected sibling pair, this gene was sequenced in 143 additional ASD families. Further polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis included 380 ASD cases and suitable control subjects.	The maternally inherited microdeletion encompassed chr7:110,663,978-111,257,682 and led to a DOCK4-IMMP2L fusion transcript. It was also detected in five extended family members with no ASD. However, six of nine individuals with this microdeletion had poor reading ability, which prompted us to screen 606 other dyslexia cases. This led to the identification of a second DOCK4 microdeletion co-segregating with dyslexia. Assessment of genomic background in the original ASD family detected a paternal 2q14.3 microdeletion disrupting CNTNAP5 that was also transmitted to both affected siblings. Analysis of other ASD cohorts revealed four additional rare missense changes in CNTNAP5. No exonic deletions of DOCK4 or CNTNAP5 were seen in 2091 control subjects.	This study highlights two new risk factors for ASD and dyslexia and demonstrates the importance of performing a high-resolution assessment of genomic background, even after detection of a rare and likely damaging microdeletion using a targeted approach.",Remaining

Despite successful recanalization, a limited subset of patients benefits from the new treatment. Human MRI studies have shown that during removal of the thrombus, a shower of microclots is released from the initial thrombus, possibly causing new ischemic lesions. The aim of the current study is to quantify tissue damage following microembolism.	In a rat model, microembolism was generated by injection of a mixture of polystyrene fluorescent microspheres (15, 25 and 50 µm in diameter). The animals were killed at three time-points: day 1, 3 or 7. AMIRA and IMARIS software was used for 3D reconstruction of brain structure and damage, respectively.

The data were obtained from a health system with 19 emergency departments in northeast Ohio in the United States. Baseline period from January 1 to March 8, 2020, was compared with the COVID period from March 9, to April 2, 2020. The variables included were total daily stroke alerts across the hospital emergency departments, thrombolysis, time to presentation, stroke severity, time from door-to-imaging, time from door-to-needle in thrombolysis, and time from door-to-puncture in thrombectomy. The 2 time periods were compared using nonparametric statistics and Poisson regression.	Nine hundred two stroke alerts during the period across the emergency departments were analyzed. Total daily stroke alerts decreased from median, 10 (interquartile range, 8-13) during baseline period to median, 8 (interquartile range, 4-10, P=0.001) during COVID period. Time to presentation, stroke severity, and time to treatment were unchanged. COVID period was associated with decrease in stroke alerts with rate ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.28). Thrombolysis also decreased with rate ratio, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.28-0.97) but thrombectomy remained unchanged rate ratio, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.52-1.62) Conclusions: We observed a significant decrease in acute stroke presentations by ≈30% across emergency departments at the time of surge of COVID-19 cases. This observation could be attributed to true decline in stroke incidence or patients not seeking medical attention for emergencies during the pandemic.",Remaining

337,31911024,The International journal on drug policy,New psychoactive substance use as a survival strategy in rural marginalised communities in Hungary.,"New psychoactive substance (NPS) use has become a widespread phenomenon among marginalised communities in Hungary. Since 2010, a growing number of reports in grey literature and anecdotal information among professionals have become available on NPS use among previously unaffected groups, such as people living in rural, socioeconomically deprived communities. In our research, we aimed to explore NPS use among these communities.	We conducted a mixed method research with convergent parallel design. Data collection took place in 2017 in marginalised communities in villages in two regions in Hungary, where 150 questionnaires were recorded and 50 interviews were conducted with current NPS users.	According to the survey results, NPS is very easy to access, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist (SCRA) are easily bought in marginalised rural communities (79% found SCRA easy to obtain). Both SCRA and synthetic cathinones are used regularly; 57% of SCRA users and 37% of synthetic cathinone users used the respective substance at least once a week in the past 30 days. Besides NPS, sedative use (without prescription) and alcohol consumption are common among the respondents. 17% of the sample has already injected NPS. The overwhelming majority of the respondents rated regular consumption of NPS as 'very dangerous' (SCRA: 75%, synthetic cathinones 72%). NPS users have limited knowledge of consequences and the social and health treatment options available. Most themes in the interviews are associated with surviving stress, crisis and anxiety, as well as the wish to escape from insecurity and chaotic life. Positive effects of substance use (community, joy, energy) are rarely present.	People who use drugs (PWUD) living in these rural communities face the consequences of the rural risk environment: easy access to NPS, inadequate access to services, poor labour market situation and attributions of marginalised groups, for example disaffiliation. NPS use is not a recreational activity in this population; individuals mainly use NPS to get away from reality, problems, pain, poverty and marginalisation. NPS use is a survival strategy.

339,20012471,Journal of gambling studies,The impacts of gaming expansion on economic growth: a theoretical reconsideration.,"This paper employs a general equilibrium framework to analyze the effects on economic growth of global expansions in casino gaming, which exports gambling services largely to non-residents. Both domestic and foreign investments in the gaming sector bring in not only substantial revenues but also positive spillover effects on related sectors and even on the entire local economy. However, an over-expansion of commercial gambling may lead to deterioration in the terms of trade with an adverse impact on real income. If this situation persists, it would not be impossible for immiserizing growth to occur. As a highly profitable sector, casino gaming may enable its operators to diversify out of this risk if they invest retained profits in non-gaming sectors to cash in on the spillover effects it has created. The gaming-dominant economy can then be directed on a more balanced and sustainable growth path, and will become less susceptible to business cycles. Indeed, economic experiences in the world's major casino resorts are consistent basically with this argument for diversification. We believe that after the current global crisis fades away, economic growth and resulting surges in global demand for gambling services can provide further opportunities for the expansion of existing casino resorts and the development of new gaming markets.",Non-systematic-review

341,37465679,Frontiers in immunology,Guizhi Fuling capsule relieves memory deficits by inhibition of microglial neuroinflammation through blocking JAK2/STAT3 pathway in presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout mice.,"Chronic neuroinflammation has been regarded as an important part of the pathological initiation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is associated with the regulation of microglial activation. Preventing microglial activation to inhibit neuroinflammation may become a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Guizhi Fuling capsule (GZFL) has a strong repression on inflammatory responses. Here, the presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, a well-established mouse model of AD, were divided into: WT mice (WT), WT mice+GZFL (WT+GZFL), PS cDKO mice (cDKO), and PS cDKO mice+GZFL (cDKO+GZFL). Mice in the WT+GZFL and cDKO+GZFL group were fed standard chow containing 2000 ppm GZFL for 90 days. After 60 days of GZFL treatment, mice were given to behavioral tests for 30 days in order to explore the effects of GZFL on cognitive and motor function. Then, mice were sacrificed for examining the effects of GZFL on inflammation. Furthermore, primary microglia were obtained from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats and pretreated with or without GZFL (50 μg/ml) for 1 h in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) stimulation to speculate whether the underlying mechanism of GZFL's anti-inflammatory potential was closely associated with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that GZFL has the ability to alleviate memory deficits in PS cDKO mice, which attributes to the improvement of neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. In addition, GZFL could inverse the tau hyperphosphorylation and the lessened expression of synaptic proteins in hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Furthermore, GZFL prevented LPS-induced neuroinflammatory responses in primary microglia by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. It is noteworthy that therapeutic effects of GZFL on memory impairment are depended on the inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses by the blockage of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, GZFL may be an effective compound Chinese medicine for the improvement and postponement of neurodegenerative progression in AD.",Animal-drug-intervention

In this study, C57Bl/6J mice were injected intracerebrally with [3H]inositol, and poly-PI turnover in brain was assessed by determining the levels of labeled inositol monophosphates (IP1) accumulated after intraperitoneal injection of LiCl (6 meq/kg body weight) 4 hr before killing. Using this experimental protocol, acute ethanol administration (by gavage) resulted in time- and dose-dependent decreases in the levels of labeled IP1 in both cerebrum and cerebellum as compared with controls. The ethanol-induced decrease in labeled IP1 correlated well with the decrease in levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (as measured by the radioreceptor assay) and the increase in blood ethanol concentration. Despite a 4-fold higher accumulation of labeled IP1 in the cerebrum compared with the cerebellum, there were no major differences in the steady-state levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (based on tissue weight) in either brain region. Intraperitoneal injection of atropine (50 mg/kg) (a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist) to the lithium-treated mice resulted in a 34% decrease in labeled IP1 as compared with controls. This result suggests that a substantial proportion of the signals transduced were due to activation of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor. Administration of ethanol (5 g/kg) to the atropine-treated mice resulted in a further decrease in labeled IP1 and longer sleep time as compared with those given ethanol alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Animal-other

There was minimal or no toxicity. Twenty of 30 patients (66%) receiving at least twice weekly poly-ICLC showed regression or stabilization of gadolinium-enhancing tumor, as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (median = 65% volume decrease). All but one patient with anaplastic astrocytomas who received continuous poly-ICLC remain alive, with a median progression-free survival of 54 months from diagnosis. Median Kaplan-Meier survival is 19 months for patients with glioblastomas who receive at least twice weekly poly-ICLC treatments. Tumor response was associated with 2',5' -oligoadenylate synthetase activation (P = 0.03) but not with serum interferon. We hypothesize clinical activation by poly-ICLC of a basic host tumor suppressor system. Prolonged, quality survival with tumor stabilization or regression confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging for most patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas suggests that more extensive laboratory and controlled clinical studies are warranted. The concept of long-term, broad spectrum stimulation of host defenses with nontoxic, inexpensive double-stranded ribonucleic acids, such as low-dose poly-ICLC, may be applicable to the treatment of other malignancies.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

AHF was surgically induced by portocaval shunting followed by hepatic artery ligation 48 hr later. In the infusion group the dose of NH4-Ac, initially 0.78 mmol/kg/hr, was increased every 2 hr by 0.13 mmole/kg/hr during a 10-hour period to simulate the arterial NH3 concentrations observed in AHF. Ammonia levels in rabbits administered the NH4-Ac infusion were identical to those observed in AHF, with the exception of the higher initial value in the AHF group. Moreover, the mean rates of increase in grade of encephalopathy in the two groups were similar, although the EEG grades in the infusion group were significantly less at all time points. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a more pathophysiological approach to identification of the putative toxins in hepatic encephalopathy is feasible. Some of the EEG abnormalities of acute hepatic encephalopathy in rabbits are presumably due to hyperammonemia; the encephalopathy observed in AHF at zero time is probably caused by the previously constructed portocaval shunt via an undefined, but possibly also ammonia-related, mechanism.",Animal-other

Normalized nonsynonymous substitutions were more frequent at the divergence of lymphoid and brain sequences, indicating stronger adaptive selection in brain compared to lymphoid tissue. Brain-specific nonsynonymous substitutions were found within an NH(3)-terminal CTL epitope, the PACS1 binding motif, or positions predicted to be important for activation of the myeloid-restricted Src family tyrosine kinase Hck.

Reports of variability in chronic pain and its clinical significance over time have yet to be investigated in patients with prescription OUD. The present study examined variability in chronic pain status from entry into prescription OUD treatment through 3.5-year follow-up. Additionally, we examined the association between concurrent chronic pain and opioid use at three follow-up time points.	This secondary analysis (N = 309) of a national, randomized, controlled trial of prescription OUD treatment used generalized estimating equations to assess variability in the prevalence of chronic pain from study entry to 3.5-year follow-up, and the association between chronic pain status and concurrent opioid use.	Fifty-three percent of participants reported variability in chronic pain status over time. The prevalence of chronic pain decreased from study entry through follow-up (aOR = 0.47, p < 0.001). Chronic pain was associated with increased opioid use at each follow-up assessment (aOR = 3.56, p < 0.001).	Chronic pain status may vary over time in those with prescription OUD, and chronic pain appears to be associated with concurrent opioid use. The present findings highlight the importance of assessing chronic pain throughout the course of prescription OUD.",Remaining

We analyzed herein the role of MIF in the host control of toxoplasmosis using MIF(-/-) mice backcrossed to either the BALB/c or the C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds. Both, wild-type (WT) BALB/c and MIF(-/-) BALB/c mice were susceptible to infection with highly virulent RH as well as moderately virulent ME49 strains of T. gondii. MIF(-/-) mice, however, showed greater liver damage and more brain cysts, produced less proinflammatory cytokines, and succumbed significantly faster than WT mice. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from MIF(-/-) mice produced less interleukin-1beta, interleukin-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha than WT BMDCs after stimulation with soluble Toxoplasma antigen (STAg). Similar observations were made in CD11c(+) low-density cells isolated from the spleens of MIF(-/-) mice challenged with STAg. MIF(-/-) C57BL/6 mice succumbed to ME49 infection faster than their WT counterparts. C57BL/6 mice that succumbed to infection with the ME49 strain produced less MIF than resistant BALB/c mice similarly infected. Interestingly, an analysis of brains from patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis showed low levels of MIF expression. Together, these findings demonstrate that MIF plays a critical role in mediating host resistance against T. gondii.",Animal-other
354,35274469,Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,Attribution of intentions in autism spectrum disorder: A study of event-related potentials.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social cognition deficits, including difficulties inferring the intentions of others. Although deficits in attribution of intentions (AI) have been consistently replicated in ASD, their exact nature remains unexplored. Here we registered the electrophysiological correlates of a nonverbal social cognition task to investigate AI in autistic adults. Twenty-one male autistic adults and 30 male neurotypical volunteers performed a comic strips task depicting either intentional action (AI) or physical causality with or without human characters, while their electroencephalographic signal was recorded. Compared to neurotypical volunteers, autistic participants were significantly less accurate in correctly identifying congruence in the AI condition, but not in the physical causality conditions. In the AI condition a bilateral posterior positive event-related potential (ERP) occurred 200-400 ms post-stimulus (the ERP intention effect) in both groups. This waveform comprised a P200 and a P300 component, with the P200 component being larger for the AI condition in neurotypical volunteers but not in autistic individuals, who also showed a longer latency for this waveform. Group differences in amplitude of the ERP intention effect only became evident when we compared autistic participants to a subgroup of similarly performing neurotypical participants, suggesting that the atypical ERP waveform in ASD is an effect of group, rather than a marker of low-task performance. Together, these results suggest that the lower accuracy of the ASD group in the AI task may result from impaired early attentional processing and contextual integration of socially relevant cues. LAY SUMMARY: To understand why autistic people have difficulties in inferring others' intentions, we asked participants to judge the congruence of the endings of comic strips depicting either intentional actions (e.g., fetching a chair to reach for something) or situations solely following physical rules (e.g., an apple falling on someone's head), while their electrical brain activity was recorded. Autistic individuals had more difficulties in inferring intentions than neurotypical controls, which may reflect impaired attention and contextual integration of social cues.",Remaining

A Multicenter Retrospective Comparative Analysis.,"Surgery in patients with highly eloquent glioblastoma (GB) remains challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate influence of use of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) on extent of resection (EOR), clinical outcome, and survival in patients with preoperatively intended subtotal resection of GB.	Retrospective assessment was performed in 3 neurosurgical centers (2008-2013). All patients with primary GB, unilocular growth, and adjuvant radiochemotherapy in whom subtotal resection was intended were included. Imaging data were pseudonymized and volumetrically assessed by a central reviewer. Clinical outcome was evaluated based on complications, new permanent neurologic deficits, and survival. Based on subtraction of potential EOR (as defined by reviewer) from effective EOR, EOR change (ΔEOR) was calculated for each case. We calculated multivariate linear regressions to assess influence on effective EOR and ΔEOR, binary regressions to assess influence on complications and new permanent neurologic deficits, and Cox regression models to assess survival.	Assessment included 70 patients. In iMRI group, a significantly lower ΔEOR (4% vs. 22%, P = 0.008) was found. In linear regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, only iMRI influenced ΔEOR significantly (P = 0.03, odds ratio 0.27). In binary regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, effective EOR, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, none of the variables showed a significant difference concerning complications and new permanent neurologic deficits. Overall survival was significantly influenced by age (P = 0.03, odds ratio 1.02) and iMRI (P = 0.026, odds ratio 0.51).	Maximum safe resection is an important prognostic factor for patients with eloquent GBs. iMRI seems to be a relevant tool to achieve this goal.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

However, studies are inadequate on the utility of prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy in patients with hemorrhagic stroke, and the results remains controversial.	This study aims to determine if short-duration sodium valproate prevents seizure onset or improves the survival and neurological outcome in adults after acute spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage.	In this randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 258 patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital. In addition to standard care, patients will be randomly assigned to receive seven-day prophylaxis of sodium valproate 500 mg daily (alternatively 400 mg daily by intravenous infusion in 250 ml 0·9% normal saline) or matching placebo. Patients will be followed up at seven-days, 3, 6, and 12 months.	The primary outcomes are early (≤7 days) and late onset seizures (>7 days). Secondary outcomes include midline shift, enlargement of hematoma, death (all cause), adverse effects, and functional outcome assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale and modified Rankin Scale.	Given the lack of evidence for seizure prophylaxis in patients with acute supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage, randomized controlled trials are desperately needed.

359,23270420,Behavioral and brain functions : BBF,Genetic association between APOE*4 and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease is dependent on the psychosis phenotype.,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as psychosis are prevalent in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Because these disabling symptoms are generally not well tolerated by caregivers, patients with these symptoms tend to be institutionalized earlier than patients without them. The identification of protective and risk factors for neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD would facilitate the development of more specific treatments for these symptoms and thereby decrease morbidity and mortality in AD. The E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a well-documented risk factor for the development of AD. However, genetic association studies of the APOE 4 allele and BPS in AD have produced conflicting findings.	This study investigates the association between APOE and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a large sample of clinically well-characterized subjects with probable AD (n=790) who were systematically evaluated using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Behavioral Rating Scale for Dementia (BRSD).	Our study found that hallucinations were significantly more likely to occur in subjects with no APOΕ4 alleles than in subjects with two Ε4 alleles (15% of subjects and 5% of subjects, respectively; p=.0066), whereas there was no association between the occurrence of delusions, aberrant motor behavior, or agitation and the number of Ε4 alleles. However, 94% of the subjects with hallucinations also had delusions (D+H).	These findings suggest that in AD the Ε4 allele is differentially associated with D+H but not delusions alone. This is consistent with the hypothesis that distinct psychotic subphenotypes may be associated with the APOE allele.",Remaining

To address this, Tg mouse model of AD, Tg-NSE/PS2m, which expresses human mutant PS2 in the brain, was chosen. Animals were subjected to treadmill exercise for 12 weeks from 24 months of age. The exercised mice were treadmill run at speed of 12 m/min, 60 min/day, 5 days/week on a 0% gradient for 3 months. Treadmill exercised mice improved cognitive function in water maze test. Treadmill exercised mice significantly reduced the expression of Aβ-42, Cox-2, and caspase-3 in the hippocampus. In parallel, treadmill exercised Tg mice decreased the phosphorylation levels of JNK, p38MAPK and tau (Ser404, Ser202, Thr231), and increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK, PI3K, Akt and GSK-3α/β. In addition, treadmill exercised Tg mice up-regulated the expressions of NGF, BDNF and phospho-CREB, and the expressions of SOD-1, SOD-2 and HSP-70. Treadmill exercised Tg mice up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and down-regulated the expressions of cytochrome c and Bax in the hippocampus. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus in mice was significantly decreased after treadmill exercise. Finally, serum TC, insulin, glucose, and corticosterone levels were significantly decreased in the Tg mice after treadmill exercise. As a consequence of such change, Aβ-dependent neuronal cell death in the hippocampus of Tg mice was markedly suppressed following treadmill exercise. These results strongly suggest that treadmill exercise provides a therapeutic potential to inhibit both Aβ-42 and neuronal death pathways. Therefore, treadmill exercise may be beneficial in prevention or treatment of AD.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

To improve rates of sustained remission from SUD, there is a need to shift the existing treatment paradigm away from an acute care model and toward a model of ongoing recovery management. Telephone recovery support (TRS) is a promising recovery management tool, consisting of weekly calls from volunteers, including peer workers, to people in recovery to offer support and connect participants with resources. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of a TRS program in Central Kentucky, United States.	Participants (n = 506) were recruited for the program from a variety of settings, such as sober living/halfway houses, drug court, residential treatment transitional living, and outpatient and intensive outpatient treatment. For each call, participant status (e.g., experiencing psychosocial stressors, concerned about relapse) was recorded. To assess acceptability, we performed semi-structured interviews with participants (n = 7), which were subsequently transcribed and analyzed via content analysis.	Volunteers completed 35.7% of calls (a completed call was defined as either answered or returned) with 88% of participants reporting being okay, 9% reporting psychosocial stressors, and 3% reporting relapse or concerns about relapse. Participants reported that TRS provided a felt sense of support and consistent recovery engagement, and appreciated that volunteers took the initiative to reach out to them. Multiple participants reported a desire to increase the frequency of TRS contact.	TRS holds promise as a resource to promote long-term recovery support.

We also sought to determine if a drug-induced panic attack releases substance P in brain, as measured by decreased binding of [(18)F]SPA-RQ.	Positron emission tomography scans with [(18)F]SPA-RQ were performed in 14 patients with panic disorder and 14 healthy subjects.

NK(1) receptor binding in patients (n = 14) compared with that in healthy subjects (n = 14) was significantly decreased by 12% to 21% in all brain regions. Doxapram effectively produced panic attacks in 6 of 7 patients with panic disorder but only 2 of 10 healthy subjects. Doxapram caused no significant change of [(18)F]SPA-RQ binding in either patients or healthy subjects.

365,34144146,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Modulation of Neuroinflammation by Low-Dose Radiation Therapy in an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Recently, several studies have reported that low-dose radiation therapy (RT) suppresses the release of proinflammatory cytokines in inflammatory-degenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). AD is the most common cause of dementia, and neuroinflammation is one of the major contributing factors in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, low-dose RT may be used clinically for treating AD. However, the appropriate doses, effects, and underlying mechanisms of RT in AD have not been determined. In this study, we aimed to determine the appropriate RT dose and schedule for AD treatment and to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of low-dose RT in AD.	We first determined the proper dose and schedule for RT in late-stage AD using 8- to 9-month-old 5x Familial AD (5xFAD) mice, a well-known animal model of AD, by comparing the effects of a low total dose with low dose per fraction (LD-LDRT, 5 × 0.6 Gy) with those of a low moderate total dose with conventional dose per fraction (LMD-CDRT, 5 × 2 Gy).	LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT were found to reduce the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines CD54, IL-3, CXCL9/10, and CCL2/4 in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, increased microgliosis assessed using Iba-1 and CD68 dual immunostaining was significantly reduced by LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. Moreover, LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT decreased the amyloid plaque burden in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice and attenuated their cognitive impairment; these effects persisted for 4 to 5 weeks.	The present study showed that LD-LDRT alleviates cognitive impairments and prevents the accumulation of amyloid plaques by regulating neuroinflammation in the late stage of AD in 5xFAD mice, with an efficacy equivalent to that of LMD-CDRT. Furthermore, the findings suggest that compared with LMD-CDRT, LD-LDRT may facilitate accessible and convenient treatment in clinical trials.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

Eighteen children with severe CH and 21 healthy controls underwent a battery of behavioral measures of hearing, language and communication, along with diffusion MR imaging. Tract-based spatial statistics were performed on standard diffusion parameters of fractional anisotropy and diffusivity metrics. Microscopic diffusion anisotropy mapping based on the Spherical Mean Technique was also used to evaluate biologically specific metrics. Compared with age-matched controls, children with severe CH had poorer hearing and communication skills, albeit generally within normal limits. Children with severe CH had fractional anisotropy that was significantly lower in the cerebellum, bilateral thalami and right temporal lobe, and radial diffusivity that was significantly higher in the cerebellum and bilateral thalami. Microscopic fractional anisotropy and intra-neurite volume fraction were also significantly decreased, and transverse microscopic diffusivity was significantly increased, in the CH group in areas including the cerebellum, thalamus, occipital lobe, and corpus callosum, and in the white matter adjacent to sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the left hemisphere. Significant and widespread correlations were observed between behavioral measures and measures of white matter microstructural integrity in children with CH.

To investigate the effect of manipulating AHNPCs before grafting by predifferentiation, ie, initiating neuronal differentiation before transplantation, and to determine whether this cell priming would affect their ability to migrate in vivo.	AHNPCs were prepared from temporal lobe resections for epilepsy. Seven days after global brain ischemia, predifferentiated AHNPCs (exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor, heparin, and laminin) were transplanted to the left hippocampus. Four and 10 weeks after transplantation, brain sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.	Transplanted primed cells expressed committed neuronal markers at a much earlier stage compared with nonprimed AHNPCs and were found colabeled with human markers within the damaged CA1 region 4 weeks after grafting. Furthermore, predifferentiated AHNPCs migrated preferentially into an ischemic lesion, similar to their undifferentiated counterparts. The chemoattractant effect from the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) in ischemic CA1 on AHNPCs expressing CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) may explain this preference in migration in vivo.	The plasticity of neural progenitors derived from the adult human brain may be greater than previously assumed in that manipulation before grafting may influence the phenotypes seen in vivo.

Diagnosis of GCA was confirmed in 68 patients and excluded in 35 patients, which served as the controls. GCA patients were older (median age 75 vs. 68 years), and presented more often with ischaemic symptoms. The best discrimination between GCA patients and controls was achieved for PET/CT findings within the supra-aortic arteries (sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.91 for a SUV/LE cut-off value of 1.0). Specificity of PET/CT for the aorta and the iliofemoral arteries was lower (<0.34). Visual scoring correlated poorly to SUV measurements (Kendall Tau-b 0.13-0.55) and had a lower diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.75). Prednisone treatment for ≥10 days significantly reduced PET/CT sensitivity (P = 0.009).

The infections included meningitis (31 patients), brain abscesses (four patients), septicaemia (three patients), pleuro-pneumonia (two patients), septic arthritis and soft tissue phlegmona (three patients). No other antibacterial agents were used except in four patients with brain abscesses, in whom ceftriaxone was combined with ornidazole. The overall bacteriological cure rate was 98%, and sterilisation of the cerebrospinal fluid occurred in 27 of 28 patients (96%) with proven bacterial meningitis. Two patients died, three survived with severe neurological sequelae; one neonate required partial gut resection. A complete clinical cure was achieved in the remaining 37 patients. Only one treatment failure was directly related to the drug therapy. The only side effect noted were sterilisation of the gut with overgrowth of Candida albicans in 35% of neonates and infants, an prolonged fever in 13% of all patients. Ceftriaxone given in a 24-hourly regimen is convenient and highly effective in serious bacterial infections in children and is without significant toxicity.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
375,26419846,Molecular brain,Understanding the molecular basis of autism in a dish using hiPSCs-derived neurons from ASD patients.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social cognition, language development, and repetitive/restricted behaviors. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of ASD and lack of a proper human cellular model system, the pathophysiological mechanism of ASD during the developmental process is largely unknown. However, recent progress in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology as well as in vitro neural differentiation techniques have allowed us to functionally characterize neurons and analyze cortical development during neural differentiation. These technical advances will increase our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of heterogeneous ASD and help identify molecular biomarkers for patient stratification as well as personalized medicine. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of iPSC generation, differentiation of specific neuronal subtypes from iPSCs, and phenotypic characterizations of human ASD patient-derived iPSC models. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of iPSC technology and future directions of ASD pathophysiology studies using iPSCs.",Non-systematic-review

The study included 24 boys and 16 girls with ASD, all preschool-aged 4-6 years. All were verbal but with limited production and minimal mean length of utterance. The study followed a randomized control trial design with equally sized experimental and control groups. The experimental group followed a therapeutic program using the AC with a CS protocol, while the control group's AC intervention did not include the CS protocol.	The use of CS significantly improved the children's semantic and morphosyntactic development.	The intervention results illustrate the effectiveness of CS in this study; however, generalizability of effectiveness to other similar CG-speaking children with ASD requires further evidence.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Increased expression of the master regulator of ALP, transcription factor EB (TFEB), is hypothesized to promote the clearance of WT α-synuclein and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we explore the efficacy of targeted TFEB overexpression either in neurons or oligodendrocytes to reduce the pathological burden of α-synuclein in a PD rat model and a MSA mouse model. While TFEB neuronal expression was sufficient to prevent neurodegeneration in the PD model, we show that only TFEB oligodendroglial overexpression leads to neuroprotective effects in the MSA model. These beneficial effects were associated with a decreased accumulation of α-synuclein into oligodendrocytes through recovery of the ALP machinery. Our study demonstrates that the cell type where α-synuclein aggregates dictates the target of TFEB overexpression in order to be protective, paving the way for adapted therapies.",Animal-drug-intervention

The deficits in PCP users occurred despite negative medical-neurological history, and even though the PCP group abused other drugs previously associated with neuropsychological impairment less than the polydrug group. Deficiencies in abstracting and in perceptual-motor integrative abilities were noted. The results suggest the possibility that PCP abuse might be associated with neuropsychological disturbance which persists for considerable time after PCP use ceases.",Remaining

Students worked in interprofessional teams to plan and implement a social skills training program for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The objectives were to provide a hands-on, student-led clinical experience; facilitate interprofessional collaborative learning through leadership partnerships and teach children with ASD to engage in appropriate social skill behaviors. Concurrently, faculty performed qualitative research to explore how the students worked together to provide intervention to the children. Data were collected via interview, direct observation of student planning sessions and student interprofessional interactions, and collection of posts from an online social network site used for session planning. There were six student participants and two faculty participants. Four themes emerged: learning who I am as a professional, learning to appreciate our professional differences, learning to communicate with each other and figuring it out, for the benefit of the kids. This interprofessional clinical learning experience and research helps ensure that students are adequately prepared to represent their profession as part of a diverse interprofessional health care team.",Remaining
381,15292181,The Journal of biological chemistry,Proliferation of neointimal smooth muscle cells after arterial injury. Dependence on interactions between fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor-9.,"The growth factor signaling mechanisms responsible for neointimal smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and accumulation, a characteristic feature of many vascular pathologies that can lead to restenosis after angioplasty, remain to be identified. Here, we examined the contribution of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 2 and 3 as well as novel fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) to such proliferation. Balloon catheter injury to the rat carotid artery stimulated the expression of two distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms, differing only by the presence or absence of the acidic box, and two distinctly spliced FGFR-3 isoforms containing the acidic box and differing only by the presence of either the IIIb or IIIc exon. Post-injury arterial administration of recombinant adenoviruses expressing dominant negative mutant forms of these FGFRs were used to assess the roles of the endogenous FGFR isoforms in neointimal SMC proliferation. Dominant negative FGFR-2 containing the acidic box inhibited such proliferation by 40%, whereas the dominant negative FGFR-3 forms had little effect. Expression of FGF-9, known to be capable of binding to all four neointimal FGFR-2/-3 isoforms, was abundant within the neointima. FGF-9 markedly stimulated both the proliferation of neointimal SMCs and the activation of extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2, effects which were abrogated by the administration of antisense FGF-9 oligonucleotides to injured arteries and the expression of the dominant negative FGFR-2 adenovirus in cultured neointimal SMCs. These studies demonstrate that, although multiple FGFRs are induced in neointimal SMCs following arterial injury, specific interactions between distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms and FGF-9 contribute to the proliferation of these SMCs.",Animal-other

The objective of this study was to evaluate the motor, cognitive and emotional changes associated with dopaminergic and BDNF imbalance after DM exposure in rats. Sixty Wistar rats (9-10 months-old) were used, under Ethics Committee on Animal Research license (ID 19/2017). The animals were randomly divided into four groups: control (CTL, 0.9% saline), DM2 (2 mg DM in 1.6 mL 0.9% saline), DM4 (4 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline), and DM8 (8 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline). DM groups were submitted to 9 or 15 inhalations, one every 48 h. Half of the animals from each group were randomly selected and perfused 24 h after the 9th or 15th inhalation. Throughout the experiment, the animal's behavior were evaluated using catalepsy test, open field, hole-board test, Modified Elevated Plus Maze, and social interaction. At the end of the experiments, the rats were perfused transcardially and their brains were processed for Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) and Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunohistochemistries. The animals submitted to 9 inhalations of DM showed a reduction in immunoreactivity for TH in the Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and dorsal striatum (DS) areas, and an increase in BDNF in the DS and CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal areas. Conversely, the animals submitted to 15 inhalations of DM showed immunoreactivity reduced for TH in the SNpc and VTA, and an increase in BDNF in the hippocampal areas (CA3 and DG). Our results indicate that the DM inhalation at different periods induce motor and cognitive impairments in rats. Such alterations were accompanied by dopaminergic system damage and a possible dysfunction on synaptic plasticity.",Animal-other
383,9520072,European neurology,Cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid beta-peptide in Alzheimer's disease and major depression - inverse correlation with dementia severity.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia that ultimately leads to death. Histopathological hallmarks of AD include brain amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. Major depression is a frequent diagnosis in every gerontopsychiatric clinic that sees patients with both cognitive and affective disorders. Many depressed patients, in fact, are clinically characterized by cognitive impairments. Thus, an assay that excludes - or confirms - probable AD in cognitively impaired patients is desirable. Such assays may use protein markers that are derived from such histopathologically relevant molecules as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its derivatives including the amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta). To evaluate the differential diagnostic properties of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta and secreted soluble ectodomain (APPs), we quantitated CSF levels of these measures in AD patients and compared them to age-matched control patients with major depression. CSF levels of APPs and Abeta were similar in patients with AD or major depression, and the apolipoprotein E genotype had no influence on CSF levels of Abeta in AD patients. Measurement of Abeta peptide using a novel zinc/copper capture ELISA that detects aggregated Abeta peptides as well demonstrated similar levels in AD and major depression. In AD patients, CSF levels of total Abeta (Abeta1-40 plus Abeta1-42) were inversely correlated with a functional measure of dementia severity (NOSGER), suggesting that CSF levels of Abeta decrease with advancing severity of AD. Thus, CSF levels of Abeta are not useful for the differentiation of AD from major depression. However, CSF levels of Abeta reflect the severity of dementia and may be useful as biological markers of the stage of the disease.",Remaining

Individuals with IDD living in supported residential settings in Ohio were offered HBPC. Individuals electing HBPC made up the intervention group. Those who did not opt for HBPC continued to receive traditional primary care services and made up the control group. Hospitalizations were tracked in both groups.	The 757 study participants had IDD diagnoses and received residential support services throughout the study period.	Annualized hospitalization rate was determined in both groups and was compared using generalized estimating equations while controlling for patients' age and hospitalization rate in the year prior to the study.	The results showed that group membership had a significant effect on the hospitalization rate (Wald χ[2] = 20.71, P < .01). Being in the control group was associated with a 2.12-fold increase in annual hospitalization rate for a given patient. The overall population hospitalization rate was 329 hospitalizations per 1000 per year in the HBPC-receiving individuals and 619 hospitalizations per 1000 per year in the control group.	We found that individuals with IDD receiving HBPC were hospitalized at a lower rate than a control group receiving traditional primary care.

Descriptive, case series.	Three community nursing homes.	Seventy-three incontinent residents of three nursing homes participating in a trial of a behavioral intervention for nighttime urinary incontinence.	Data were collected during a baseline and repeat baseline period about 2 months later in nursing homes serving as controls for the intervention homes. Incontinence episodes were identified by incontinence pads, which were wired to detect wetness of 10 mL or more. Sleep was monitored by wireless wrist actigraphs. Noise and light changes were monitored by bedside recording devices.	Recordings covered 403 nights, during which 1715 awakenings from 10 consecutive minutes of sleep were detected as were 1168 incontinent episodes. Only 4% of the awakenings were associated with an incontinence episode, and only 23% of the incontinence episodes occurred during periods of at least 10 consecutive minutes of sleep. Of the latter episodes, only 12% appeared to awaken the resident.	Our data raise questions about the relevance of incontinence episodes to sleep disruption among chronically incontinent nursing home residents. Our findings must be interpreted cautiously because of limitations in the technologies and definitions we used to identify sleep, awakenings, and incontinence episodes. Although logistically and technically difficult to perform, studies using polysomnographic recordings of sleep are needed to examine further these important associations.",Remaining

Since these changes appear to be consistent and unlike those associated with other disorders or the hormonally induced alterations associated with pregnancy, routine serum testing for the Tay-Sachs carrier state may offer a useful approach for the presumptive diagnosis and screening for Gaucher disease.

390,25069902,Disability and rehabilitation. Assistive technology,Evaluation of the performance of paraplegic subjects during walking with a new design of reciprocal gait orthosis.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) influences a person's ability to stand and walk. Various orthoses have been developed to solve these standing and walking problems, however, patients still experience high energy consumption during walking and high forces on the upper limbs. A new reciprocal gait orthosis (RGO) was designed to address these problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the new orthosis design with paraplegic subjects.	Three paraplegic subjects with the lesion at level T12 and three able-bodied subjects were included in this study. Hip and pelvis range of motion and vertical ground reaction force were evaluated using the Qualysis motion analyzer system and a Kistler force plate. Energy consumption was measured with the Polar heart rate monitoring system. The differences between SCI individuals when walking with a Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis (KAFO) and the new RGO, and the differences between able-bodied and paraplegic subjects were evaluated by the use of paired sample and two sample t test, respectively.	The results showed that energy consumption and gait analysis outcomes with new RGO orthosis were better than the KAFO. However, there was a large difference between paraplegic and able-bodied subjects while walking with the new orthosis.	The new RGO design performed better than a KAFO in terms of energy consumption, walking style and vertical ground reaction force. Therefore, it appears that RGO may be a useful orthosis for patients with paraplegia. Implications for Rehabilitation Walking and standing of the subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI) improve their physiological and physiological health. This study introduces a new type of orthosis design in order to improve the abilities of SCI subjects during walking and standing.

391,29883458,PloS one,Sexual behavior and testis morphology in the BACHD rat model.,"Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in brain neurodegeneration and peripheral pathology affecting different organs including testis. Patients with HD suffer from motor and cognitive impairment, and multiple psychiatric symptoms. Among behavioral abnormalities in HD, sexual disturbances have often been reported, but scarcely investigated in animal models. The BACHD rat model of HD carries the human full-length mutated HTT (mHTT) genomic sequence with 97 CAG-CAA repeats and displays HD-like alterations at neuropathological and behavioral level.	This study aims to phenotype the BACHD rats' sexual behavior and performance as well as testis morphology because alterations in these aspects have been associated to HD.	Two rat cohorts at the age of 3 and 7 months were subjected to mating tests to assess different parameters of sexual behavior. Histological analyses for testis morphology were performed in different rat cohorts at 1.5, 7 and 12 months of age whereas immunohistochemical analyses were carried out at 7 and 12 months of age to visualize the presence of mHTT in testicular tissue. Furthermore, western blot analyses were used to assess HTT and mHTT expression levels in striatum and testis at three months of age.	At 3 months, BACHD rats showed a decreased time exploring the female anogenital area (AGA), decreased latency to mount, increased number of intromissions and ejaculations and enhanced hit rate. At 7 months, all sexual parameters were comparable between genotypes with the exception that BACHD rats explored the AGA less than wild type rats. Testis analyses did not reveal any morphological alteration at any of the examined ages, but showed presence of mHTT limited to Sertoli cells in transgenic rats at both 7 and 12 months. BACHD rat HTT and mHTT expression levels in testis were lower than striatum at 3 months of age.	The testis phenotype in the BACHD rat model does not mimic the changes observed in human HD testis. The altered sexual behavior in BACHD rats at three months of age could be to a certain extent representative of and share common underlying pathways with some of the sexual disturbances in HD patients. Further investigating the biological causes of the sexual phenotype in BACHD rats may therefore contribute to clarifying the mechanisms at the base of sexual behavior changes in HD.",Animal-other

Felbamate is an investigational antiepileptic drug with a preclinical profile that suggests it would be effective in patients with multiple types of seizures. In controlled clinical trials, felbamate was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of refractory partial-onset seizures.	We studied the efficacy of felbamate in 73 patients ranging in age from 4 to 36 years who had the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. During a 28-day base-line phase, the patients received their usual antiepileptic therapies. At the end of this phase, felbamate or placebo was administered for 70 days in addition to the current antiepileptic medications. The dosage of felbamate was titrated during the first 14 days of the treatment phase to a maximum of 45 mg per kilogram of body weight per day or 3600 mg per day, whichever was less. The primary efficacy variables were the total number of seizures counted during a four-hour period of video recording, parents' or guardians' global evaluations of the patients' quality of life, and the total number of atonic seizures, as reported by parents or guardians.	The patients treated with felbamate had a 34 percent decrease in the frequency of atonic seizures, as compared with a 9 percent decrease in the patients who received placebo (P = 0.01).

Abundant evidence now discredits this stereotype, but it is unclear if prevailing 'evidence-based' treatments have been evaluated in samples representative of the diversity of individuals affected by EDs. Our goal was to evaluate the reporting, inclusion, and analysis of sociodemographic variables in ED psychotherapeutic treatment randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the US through 2020.	We conducted a systematic review of ED psychotherapeutic treatment RCTs in the US and examined the reporting and inclusion of gender identity, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status (SES) of enrolled participants, as well as recruitment methods, power analyses, and discussion of limitations and generalizability.	Our search yielded 58 studies meeting inclusion criteria dating back to 1985. Reporting was at times incomplete, absent, or centered on the racial/gender majority group. No studies reported gender diverse participants, and men and people of color were underrepresented generally, with differences noted across diagnoses. A minority of papers considered sociodemographic variables in analyses or acknowledged limitations related to sample characteristics. Some progress was made across the decades, with studies increasingly providing full racial and ethnic data, and more men included over time. Although racial and ethnic diversity improved somewhat, progress appeared to stall in the last decade.	We summarize findings, consider context and challenges for RCT researchers, and offer suggestions for researchers, journal editors, and reviewers on improving representation, reporting, and analytic practices.	Randomized controlled trials of eating disorder psychotherapeutic treatment in the US are increasingly reporting full race/ethnicity data, but information on SES is inconsistent and sexual orientation absent. White women still comprise the overwhelming majority of participants, with few men and people of color, and no gender-diverse individuals. Findings underscore the need to improve reporting and increase representation to ensure evidence-based treatments are effective across and within diverse groups.

We performed for the first time a large-scale analysis of sleep duration in children, and how this relates to psychiatric problems including depression, to cognition, and to brain structure. Structural MRI was analyzed in relation to sleep duration, and psychiatric and cognitive measures in 11,067 9-11-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, using a linear mixed model, mediation analysis, and structural equation methods in a longitudinal analysis. Dimensional psychopathology (including depression, anxiety, impulsive behavior) in the children was negatively correlated with sleep duration. Dimensional psychopathology in the parents was also correlated with short sleep duration in their children. The brain areas in which higher volume was correlated with longer sleep duration included the orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal and temporal cortex, precuneus, and supramarginal gyrus. Longitudinal data analysis showed that the psychiatric problems, especially the depressive problems, were significantly associated with short sleep duration 1 year later. Further, mediation analysis showed that depressive problems significantly mediate the effect of these brain regions on sleep. Higher cognitive scores were associated with higher volume of the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Public health implications are that psychopathology in the parents should be considered in relation to sleep problems in children. Moreover, we show that brain structure is associated with sleep problems in children, and that this is related to whether or not the child has depressive problems.",Remaining

397,35446941,Brain : a journal of neurology,Clearance of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prions in vivo by the Hsp70 disaggregase system.,"The metazoan Hsp70 disaggregase protects neurons from proteotoxicity that arises from the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. Hsp70 and its co-chaperones disassemble and extract polypeptides from protein aggregates for refolding or degradation. The effectiveness of the chaperone system decreases with age and leads to accumulation rather than removal of neurotoxic protein aggregates. Therapeutic enhancement of the Hsp70 protein disassembly machinery is proposed to counter late-onset protein misfolding neurodegenerative disease that may arise. In the context of prion disease, it is not known whether stimulation of protein aggregate disassembly paradoxically leads to enhanced formation of seeding competent species of disease-specific proteins and acceleration of neurodegenerative disease. Here we have tested the hypothesis that modulation of Hsp70 disaggregase activity perturbs mammalian prion-induced neurotoxicity and prion seeding activity. To do so we used prion protein (PrP) transgenic Drosophila that authentically replicate mammalian prions. RNASeq identified that Hsp70, DnaJ-1 and Hsp110 gene expression was downregulated in prion-exposed PrP Drosophila. We demonstrated that RNAi knockdown of Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila enhanced neurotoxicity, whereas overexpression mitigated toxicity. Strikingly, prion seeding activity in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila was ablated or reduced by Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 overexpression, respectively. Similar effects were seen in scrapie prion-exposed ovine PrP Drosophila with modified Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression. These unique observations show that the metazoan Hsp70 disaggregase facilitates the clearance of mammalian prions and that its enhanced activity is a potential therapeutic strategy for human prion disease.",Animal-drug-intervention
398,30303262,Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,Clients' experience of change: An exploration of the influence of reformulation tools in cognitive analytic therapy.,"Case formulation is considered important in both the development of the therapeutic relationship and in starting the process of therapeutic change. Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) describes the developmental origins and maintenance of a client's problems in both written (reformulation letter) and diagrammatic form (sequential diagrammatic reformulation). This study aimed to investigate the effects of these reformulation tools on insight and symptom change. A small-N repeated measures design was employed with quantitative and qualitative measures collected from six therapist/client dyads. Participating therapists kept a record of their delivery of CAT reformulation tools. Participating clients completed the insight subscale of the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale every fourth session and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-10 every session. Qualitative data from client change interviews regarding their experiences of CAT and attributions of change was explored using template analysis. Participants demonstrated improvements (symptom reduction and insight increases) over the course of the intervention. Administration of reformulation tools did not consistently result in significant changes on insight and symptom measures. However, the tools were identified by participants as leading to insight and emotional change within the context of a good therapeutic relationship. These findings suggest that a genuine therapeutic relationship is an important change mechanism operating through, and strengthened by, CAT-specific tools.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Data was from the Japanese Schizophrenia Sib-pair Linkage Group (JSSLG), which is a multi-site collaborative study group established to create a national resource for genetic studies of schizophrenia in Japan. All subjects were Japanese, and the probands and their siblings had schizophrenia. Multipoint non-parametric linkage analysis and exclusion mapping were performed with GENEHUNTER software. Simulation studies suggested that in the absence of linkage we could expect one multipoint maximum LOD score (MLS) of 1.9 per genome scan. An MLS of 3.7 would be expected only once in every 20 genome scans and thus corresponds to a genome-wide significance of 0.05. No loci in the initial screen fulfilled the criteria for significant or suggestive evidence for linkage. Ten chromosomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 17, and 20) had at least one region with a nominal P value < 0.05. Susceptibility genes with lambdas of 3 and 2 were excluded from 98 and 70% of the genome, respectively. Our results suggest that common genes that contribute significantly to susceptibility for schizophrenia are unlikely to exist in the Japanese population.",Remaining
400,19469685,Journal of neurotrauma,Axonal outgrowth and Erk1/2 activation by training after spinal cord injury in rats.,"Abstract Physical training in experimental animals can improve locomotor activity via the regulation of spinal neural circuitry or peripheral nerve regeneration. Here we investigated the effects of treadmill training (TMT) on regenerative responses of the corticospinal tract (CST) after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI). One week after injury of the low thoracic spinal cord, rats were given TMT or sedentary treatment for 1-4 weeks. Anterograde tracing of descending CST axons revealed that TMT enhanced collateral arborization of CST axons surrounding the injury cavity and promoted extension into the caudal spinal cord. The number of oligodendrocytes in the vicinity of the injury cavity was significantly increased at 2 or 4 weeks after TMT compared to sedentary controls. The data further showed that TMT increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in the motor cortex as well as the spinal cord injury area, and inhibition of Erk1/2 activity by administration of the MEK1 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 reduced collateral outgrowth of descending CST axons in TMT animals. TMT for 2-4 weeks significantly improved behavioral scores as assessed by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale, as well as on motor function and gridwalk testing. Our data imply that Erk1/2 may be an important mediator for transmitting signals from the injury site to the cell body, and further suggest that activation of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway may be involved in enhanced outgrowth of CST axons after TMT.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

A representative sample of clubhouses more than three years old that were based on the Fountain House model participated in a 1998 mail survey. To verify that ICCD certification is a valid indicator of program quality for use in setting benchmark performance rates, 71 certified and 48 noncertified programs were compared on a variety of organizational variables.	Even though certified and noncertified clubhouses were similar in organizational structure and resources, findings from a logistic regression analysis confirmed that certified clubhouses provided a wider array of rehabilitation services and achieved higher rates of employment.	The findings suggest that ICCD certification is a valid indicator of program quality. The ICCD has therefore proposed that the average performance of certified U.S. clubhouses in specific domains be adopted as benchmarks for organizational performance. When tailored for programs in particular regions and with specific levels of funding, the ICCD benchmarks for clubhouse performance set fair and reasonable expectations for clubhouse programs and for the design of performance contracts between departments of mental health and ICCD clubhouses.",Remaining

Latency to detection and certainty of a drug effect, as well as drug quality (intensity, euphoria, and dysphoria), were studied before and after 10 to 12 days of buprenorphine maintenance. Saline was accurately identified by all 26 patients during the drugfree baseline and by 25 patients during buprenorphine maintenance conditions. All patients accurately identified morphine during the drugfree period before treatment with buprenorphine, but 18 (69%) of 26 patients were unable to detect morphine during buprenorphine maintenance and 2 misidentified morphine as cocaine. Six men (23%) accurately identified morphine and reported that the intensity and quality of morphine's effects were equivalent to drugfree conditions. Cocaine levels in plasma 5 minutes after intravenous cocaine injection were equivalent before and during buprenorphine treatment and averaged 282.8 +/- 43.6 and 295.2 +/- 28.8 ng/ml during 4 and 8 mg/day of buprenorphine maintenance, respectively. All patients accurately identified cocaine before and during buprenorphine maintenance, and there were no significant changes in latency to detection and certainty of a drug effect or reports of cocaine-induced intensity or euphoria during buprenorphine treatment. The concordance between responses to morphine and cocaine during inpatient buprenorphine maintenance and drug use during the first 4 weeks of outpatient buprenorphine treatment was also examined in 16 men. The effects of buprenorphine on individual responses to an acute intravenous dose of morphine or cocaine during the inpatient study did not reliably predict the frequency of heroin or cocaine self-administration during the first 4 weeks of daily outpatient buprenorphine maintenance.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
403,15807099,Acupuncture & electro-therapeutics research,Modulation of the gene expression in the protective effects of electroacupuncture against cerebral ischemia: a cDNA microarray study.,"In the present study, a cDNA microarray technology was used to analyze the gene expression profile in ischemia and in electroacupuncture (EA)-treated ischemia. A focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model on Macaca mulatta was performed with a modified middle cerebral artery occlusion method. Among the nearly 8000 genes, approximately 8% of the total number of genes examined were affected after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Major altered genes were downregulated. In EA-treated monkeys, approximately 10% of the total number of genes examined were affected. Major altered genes were upregulated, including signal transduction-, cell-cycle-, metabolism-, stress response-, DNA repair-related genes. One of the representative upregulated genes encodes insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was confirmed using in situ hybridization. Results showed that after ischemia/reperfusion injury, IGF-1 mRNA expression decreased in ipsilateral striatum, whereas increased in ipsilateral hippocampus. No expression changes were observed in cortex. EA treatment could obviously upregulate the IGF-1 mRNA expression in striatum, and further enhance its expression in hippocampus. Therefore, the data presented suggest a possible mediator underlying the mechanisms of anti-ischemic effect of acupuncture. In conclusion, the protective mechanisms of EA against stroke include several related pathways and gene expressions. Microarray analysis may provide a framework for understanding these complicated mechanisms and yield valuable, clinically relevant insights and potentially therapeutic targets of stroke.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

406,28131932,Addictive behaviors,Common and differential brain abnormalities in gambling disorder subtypes based on risk attitude.,"Studying brain abnormalities in behavioral addiction including GD enables us to exclude possible confounding effects of exposure to neurotoxic substances, which should provide important insight that can lead to a better understanding of addiction per se. There have been a few brain structural magnetic resonance imaging studies for GD, although the results have been inconsistent. On the other hand, GD was suggested to be a heterogeneous disorder in terms of risk attitude. We aimed to examine the heterogeneity of GD by combining a behavioral economics task and voxel-based morphometry. Thirty-six male GD patients and 36 healthy male control subjects underwent a task for estimation of loss aversion, which can assess risk attitude in real-life decision-making. The GD patients were divided into two groups based on their level of loss aversion, low and high. While both groups showed common gray matter volume reduction in the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral posterior cerebellum, high loss-aversion GD showed pronounced reduction in the left posterior cerebellum and additional reduction in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex. Our study suggests that the heterogeneity of GD is underpinned at the brain structural level. This result might be useful for understanding neurobiological mechanisms and for the establishment of precise treatment strategies for GD.",Remaining
407,31330239,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,White Matter Microstructure in Pediatric Bipolar Disorder and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder.,"Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) codifies severe, chronic irritability. Youths with bipolar disorder (BD) also present with irritability, but with an episodic course. To date, it is not clear whether aberrant white matter microstructure-a well-replicated finding in BD-can be observed in DMDD and relates to symptoms of irritability.	We acquired diffusion tensor imaging data from 118 participants (BD = 36, DMDD = 44, healthy volunteers (HV = 38). Images of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were processed with tract-based spatial statistics controlling for age and sex. The data were also used to train Gaussian process classifiers to predict diagnostic group.	In BD vs DMDD, FA in the corticospinal tract was reduced. In DMDD vs HV, reductions in FA and AD were confined to the anterior corpus callosum. In BD vs HV, widespread reductions in FA and increased RD were observed. FA in the anterior corpus callosum and corticospinal tract was negatively associated with irritability. The Gaussian process classifier could not discriminate between BD and DMDD, but achieved 68% accuracy in predicting DMDD vs HV and 75% accuracy in predicting BD vs HV.	Aberrant white matter microstructure was associated with both categorical diagnosis and the dimension of irritability. Alterations in DMDD were regionally discrete and related to reduced AD. In BD, we observed widespread increases in RD, supporting the hypothesis of altered myelination in BD. These findings will contribute to the pathophysiological understanding of DMDD and its differentiation from BD.

A quality improvement project was initiated at a nonpediatric community ED to implement an institution-specific, PECARN-based Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool. Baseline head CT use at the participating ED was determined for children with closed head injury through retrospective chart review from March 2014 through November 2015. Head injury patients were identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes for head injury, unspecified (959.01) and concussion with and without loss of consciousness (850-850.9) until October 2015, after which ICD-9 was no longer used. To identify eligible patients after October 2015, lists of all pediatric patients evaluated at the participating ED were reviewed, and patients were included in the analysis if they had a physician-assigned discharge diagnosis of head injury or concussion. Exclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, penetrating head trauma, history of brain tumor, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, bleeding disorder, or presentation > 24 hours postinjury. Medical history, injury mechanism, symptoms, head CT use, and disposition were recorded. Implementation of the Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool was achieved through provider education sessions beginning in December 2015 and ending in August 2016. Head CT use was monitored for 12 months postimplementation, from September 2016 through August 2017. Patients were classified into low, intermediate, or high risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) by chart review. ED length of stay (LOS), disposition, and ED returns within 72 hours were recorded. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables, using Kruskal-Wallis test.	A total of 252 children with closed head injury were evaluated preimplementation (March 2014 through November 2015), 132 children were evaluated during implementation (December 2015 through August 2016), and 172 children were evaluated postimplementation (September 2016 through August 2017). Overall CT use decreased from 37.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 31.7-43.7) preimplementation to 16.9% (95% CI = 11.3-22.5) postimplementation (p < 0.001). Only 1% (95% CI = 0%-2.9%) of low-risk patients received a head CT postimplementation compared to 22.6% (95% CI = 16.1%-29.1%) preimplementation (p < 0.001). CT use among patients ≥ 24 months decreased from 42.9% (95% CI = 36.5%-49.6%) to 19.6% (95% CI = 13.1%-26.1%; p < 0.001) and remained low and unchanged for patients < 24 months. Transfers to a pediatric trauma center and ED returns within 72 hours were unchanged, while median ED LOS improved from 1.5 to 1.3 hours (p = 0.03). There were no missed ciTBIs after implementation of the guideline.	Implementation of the PECARN-based Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool reduced head CT use in a nonpediatric ED.

The aim of this study was to identify which factors are predictive of buprenorphine injection in patients receiving office-based buprenorphine.	Subazur is a survey consisting of two longitudinal assessments of 111 stabilized patients receiving office-based buprenorphine in southeastern France.	Patients were interviewed by phone at enrolment and 6 months later about social characteristics, addictive behaviors, treatment experiences, overdoses and suicide ideation or attempt. A logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to identify factors associated with buprenorphine injection at any interview.	Among the 111 patients (32% women, mean age 38 years), 36 reported buprenorphine injection after having started treatment initiation in 40 interviews. After adjustment for time since first injection, individuals perceiving their prescribed dosage as inadequate (OR=2.6 95%CI[1.2-5.7]) and those reporting a history of suicide ideation or attempt (OR=2.7 95%CI[1.1-7.0]) had approximately a three-fold higher risk of injecting buprenorphine.	Providing adequate care for both drug dependence and psychiatric comorbidities in primary care is a major issue. Like heroin use during methadone treatment, buprenorphine injection should be regarded more as a response to inadequate care than simply as a 'misuse'.

A total of 1,421 measurements in 15 epileptic patients (age: 28 ± 10) using a radiofrequency generator (50 kHz current injection) were analyzed. Each contact pair was classified as being from healthy (gray matter, n = 696; white matter, n = 530) or pathological (epileptogenic zone, n = 195) tissue using neuroimaging analysis of the local tissue environment and intracerebral EEG recordings. Brain tissue conductivities were obtained using numerical simulations based on conductivity estimates that accounted for the current flow in the local brain volume around the contact pairs (a cube with a side length of 13 mm). Conductivity values were 0.26 S/m for gray matter and 0.17 S/m for white matter. Healthy gray and white matter had statistically different median impedances (P < 0.0001). White matter conductivity was found to be homogeneous as normality tests did not find evidence of multiple subgroups. Gray matter had lower conductivity in healthy tissue than in the epileptogenic zone (0.26 vs. 0.29 S/m; P = 0.012), even when the epileptogenic zone was not visible in the magnetic resonance image (MRI) (P = 0.005). The present in-vivo conductivity values could serve to create more accurate volume conduction models and could help to refine the identification of relevant intracerebral contacts, especially when located within the epileptogenic zone of an MRI-invisible lesion.

Consequently, clinically applicable c-MET inhibitors have been developed. The purpose of this study was to investigate the not-well-known molecular determinants that predict responsiveness to c-MET inhibitors and to explore new strategies for improving inhibitor efficacy in brain tumors.	We investigated the molecular factors and pathway activation signatures that determine sensitivity to c-MET inhibitors in a panel of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells, glioblastoma stem cells, and established cell line-derived xenografts using functional assays, reverse protein microarrays, and in vivo tumor volume measurements, but validation with animal survival analyses remains to be done. We also explored new approaches for improving the efficacy of the inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.	We found that HGF coexpression is a key predictor of response to c-MET inhibition among the examined factors and identified an ERK/JAK/p53 pathway activation signature that differentiates c-MET inhibition in responsive and nonresponsive cells. Surprisingly, we also found that short pretreatment of cells and tumors with exogenous HGF moderately but statistically significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of c-MET inhibition. We observed a similar ligand-induced sensitization effect to an EGF receptor small-molecule kinase inhibitor.	These findings allow the identification of a subset of patients that will be responsive to c-MET inhibition and propose ligand pretreatment as a potential new strategy for improving the anticancer efficacy of RTK inhibitors.",In-vitro-study

In response to injury, the majority of the subependymal cells coexpressed nestin and GFAP, but never nestin and neurofilament. Furthermore, cells coexpressing nestin and GFAP were found progressively further away from the subependyma and closer to the lesion at later time points after the injury, indicating that these cells migrate towards the lesion. Nestin was in addition re-expressed in reactive astrocytes near the lesion and in non-reactive astrocytes very far from the lesion throughout the ipsilateral cortex. In conclusion, our data indicate that the nestin-positive subependymal cells are an in vivo source for the generation of new astrocytes but not neurons after injury, and that nestin re-expression in astrocytes following traumatic stimuli can be used as a sensitive marker for astroglial activation.",Animal-other

However, it remains unclear whether these parameters of use differently impact memory-related hippocampal functioning.	Forty-two cannabis users were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging while they encoded and retrieved face-profession associations. Region of interest analysis was subsequently used to compare (para-)hippocampal functioning in users with (1) a longer and shorter duration of use, (2) a higher and lower frequency of use, and (3) an earlier and later onset. To further separate the effects of these parameters of use on performance and (para-)hippocampal activity, linear regression analysis was applied.	Compared to low-frequency users, high-frequency users displayed stronger blood oxygenation level-dependent response during encoding in the left parahippocampal gyrus. No differences were obvious for the groups separated according to duration of use or an earlier and later onset of use. Linear regression analysis confirmed the association between a higher frequency of use and increased activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus.	Our findings suggest that the frequency of use might have a particular critical impact on intact parahippocampal functioning in cannabis users.

Also, there are controversial data about the comparison between euthymic bipolar patients and different subgroups of schizophrenia in neurocognition, functioning, and QoL level. The present study aimed to compare the neurocognitive performance, functional outcome, and QoL of remitted and non-remitted patients with SC with respect to a group of euthymic patients with BD, and a control group. It included 655 subjects: 98 patients with schizophrenia in remission (SC-R), 184 non-remitted patients with schizophrenia (SC-NR), 117 euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder (BD), and 256 healthy subjects. A comprehensive clinical, neurocognitive (six cognitive domains), functional, and QoL assessment was carried out. Remission criteria of Andreasen were used to classify schizophrenia patients as remitted or non-remitted. Compared with control subjects all groups of patients showed impaired neurocognitive performance, functioning and QoL. SC-R patients had an intermediate functioning between control subjects and SC-NR, all at a neurocognitive, functional, or QoL level. There were no significant differences between SC-R and BD. These results suggest that reaching clinical remission is essential to achieve a better level of psychosocial functioning, and QoL. Likewise, the results of this study suggest that euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and patients with schizophrenia in remission are comparable at the neurocognitive and functional levels, which might have implications in the pathophysiology of both disorders.",Remaining

The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of adjunctive memantine treatment on positive, negative and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia.	This randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in Noor Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, 2013-2014; 32 patients in maintenance treatment were included in each group, using block sampling; inclusion criteria were age 18- 65 years, normal intellectual ability, being diagnosed with schizophrenia for the past two years, being treated with fixed doses of atypical antipsychotic for at least three months before randomization. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, breast feeding, having received electro-convulsive therapy in the past two weeks, drug or substance abuse and dependence, psychiatric/ neurological comorbidities, and sensitivity to memantine. Patients in the intervention group were treated with memantine plus atypical antipsychotic; while in the control group, patients received placebo and atypical antipsychotic. Patients were assessed by Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) initially and every four weeks to the end of the 12th week. Data were analyzed in SPSS 17.0 using t-test, chi square, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).	Positive symptoms (p=0.028), negative symptoms (0.004), general psychopathology (p<0.001), depressive symptoms (p<0.001) and total symptom severity (p<0.001) decreased significantly in patients receiving add-on memantine.

421,35922871,Alzheimer's research & therapy,Inflammatory plasma biomarkers in subjects with preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"This study investigated plasma biomarkers for neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in subjects with preclinical AD compared to healthy elderly. How these biomarkers behave in patients with AD, compared to healthy elderly is well known, but determining these in subjects with preclinical AD is not and will add information related to the onset of AD. When found to be different in preclinical AD, these inflammatory biomarkers may be used to select preclinical AD subjects who are most likely to develop AD, to participate in clinical trials with new disease-modifying drugs.	Healthy elderly (n= 50; age 71.9; MMSE >24) and subjects with preclinical AD (n=50; age 73.4; MMSE >24) defined by CSF Aβ1-42 levels < 1000 pg/mL were included. Four neuroinflammatory biomarkers were determined in plasma, GFAP, YKL-40, MCP-1, and eotaxin-1. Differences in biomarker outcomes were compared using ANCOVA. Subject characteristics age, gender, and APOE ε4 status were reported per group and were covariates in the ANCOVA. Least square means were calculated for all 4 inflammatory biomarkers using both the Aβ+/Aβ- cutoff and Ptau/Aβ1-42 ratio.	The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of the subjects (n=100) was 72.6 (4.6) years old with 62 male and 38 female subjects. Mean (SD) overall MMSE score was 28.7 (0.49) and 32 subjects were APOE ε4 carriers. The number of subjects in the different APOE ε4 status categories differed significantly between the Aβ+ and Aβ- groups. Plasma GFAP concentration was significantly higher in the Aβ+ group compared to the Aβ- group with significant covariates age and sex, variables that also correlated significantly with GFAP.	GFAP was significantly higher in subjects with preclinical AD compared to healthy elderly which agrees with previous studies. When defining preclinical AD based on the Ptau181/Aβ1-42 ratio, YKL-40 was also significantly different between groups. This could indicate that GFAP and YKL-40 are more sensitive markers of the inflammatory process in response to the Aβ misfolding and aggregation that is ongoing as indicated by the lowered Aβ1-42 levels in the CSF. Characterizing subjects with preclinical AD using neuroinflammatory biomarkers is important for subject selection in new disease-modifying clinical trials.

422,27180681,Scientific reports,Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.,"DDX3X is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that has been implicated in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism including translation initiation and the assembly of stress granules (SGs). Recent genomic studies have reported recurrent DDX3X mutations in numerous tumors including medulloblastoma (MB), but the physiological impact of these mutations is poorly understood. Here we show that a consistent feature of MB-associated mutations is SG hyper-assembly and concomitant translation impairment. We used CLIP-seq to obtain a comprehensive assessment of DDX3X binding targets and ribosome profiling for high-resolution assessment of global translation. Surprisingly, mutant DDX3X expression caused broad inhibition of translation that impacted DDX3X targeted and non-targeted mRNAs alike. Assessment of translation efficiency with single-cell resolution revealed that SG hyper-assembly correlated precisely with impaired global translation. SG hyper-assembly and translation impairment driven by mutant DDX3X were rescued by a genetic approach that limited SG assembly and by deletion of the N-terminal low complexity domain within DDX3X. Thus, in addition to a primary defect at the level of translation initiation caused by DDX3X mutation, SG assembly itself contributes to global translation inhibition. This work provides mechanistic insights into the consequences of cancer-related DDX3X mutations, suggesting that globally reduced translation may provide a context-dependent survival advantage that must be considered as a possible contributor to tumorigenesis.",Remaining
423,28735440,Current oncology reports,New Hypofractionation Radiation Strategies for Glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, with a median survival of less than 2 years despite the standard of care treatment of 6 weeks of chemoradiotherapy. We review the data investigating hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM.	Investigators have explored alternative radiotherapy strategies that shorten treatment duration with the goal of similar or improved survival while minimizing toxicity. HFRT over 1-3 weeks is already a standard of care for patients with advanced age or poor performance status. For young patients with good performance status, HFRT holds the promise of radiobiologically escalating the dose and potentially improving local control while maintaining quality of life. Through the use of shorter radiotherapy fractionation regimens coupled with novel systemic agents, improved outcomes for patients with GBM may be achieved.",Non-systematic-review

The number of naloxone-sensitive 3H-DHM binding sites was increased 38-57% in the pyramidal cell layer of ventral hippocampal CA3 and Ca1 of GEPR-3 and GEPR-9 rats compared to non-epileptic controls. No significant differences in 3H-DHM binding were observed in dorsal hippocampal formation, lateral entorhinal cortex, lateral geniculate or cerebellum.

To assess the associations of tramadol, compared with codeine, with mortality and other adverse clinical outcomes as used in outpatient settings.	Retrospective, population-based, propensity score-matched cohort study using a primary care database with routinely collected medical records and pharmacy dispensations covering more than 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain (≈6 million people). Patients 18 years or older with 1 or more year of available data and dispensation of tramadol or codeine (2007-2017) were included and followed up to December 31, 2017.	New prescription dispensation of tramadol or codeine (no dispensation in the previous year).	Outcomes studied were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, constipation, delirium, falls, opioid abuse/dependence, and sleep disorders within 1 year after the first dispensation. Absolute rate differences (ARDs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using cause-specific Cox models.	Of the 1 093 064 patients with a tramadol or codeine dispensation during the study period (326 921 for tramadol, 762 492 for codeine, 3651 for both drugs concomitantly), a total of 368 960 patients (184 480 propensity score-matched pairs) were included after study exclusions and propensity score matching (mean age, 53.1 [SD, 16.1] years; 57.3% women). Compared with codeine, tramadol dispensation was significantly associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (incidence, 13.00 vs 5.61 per 1000 person-years; HR, 2.31 [95% CI, 2.08-2.56]; ARD, 7.37 [95% CI, 6.09-8.78] per 1000 person-years), cardiovascular events (incidence, 10.03 vs 8.67 per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.05-1.27]; ARD, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.45-2.36] per 1000 person-years), and fractures (incidence, 12.26 vs 8.13 per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.37-1.65]; ARD, 4.10 [95% CI, 3.02-5.29] per 1000 person-years). No significant difference was observed for the risk of falls, delirium, constipation, opioid abuse/dependence, or sleep disorders.	In this population-based cohort study, a new prescription dispensation of tramadol, compared with codeine, was significantly associated with a higher risk of subsequent all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and fractures, but there was no significant difference in the risk of constipation, delirium, falls, opioid abuse/dependence, or sleep disorders.

The development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for MS is dependent on a number of components of the immune system including complement and adhesion molecules. Previous studies in our lab have examined the role of C3, the central complement component, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) a key cell adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation including the CNS. In these studies we demonstrated that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE is markedly attenuated in both ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) mice. Given the pivotal role that these proteins play in EAE, we hypothesized that EAE in ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) double mutant mice would likely fail to develop. Unexpectedly, EAE in ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice was only modestly attenuated compared to wild type mice and significantly worse than C3(-/-) mice. Leukocyte infiltration was commensurate with disease severity between the three groups of mice. Spinal cord T cells from ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice produced the highest levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, despite reduced disease severity compared to wild type mice. The mechanisms behind the elevated EAE severity in ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice may relate to altered homing of leukocytes or processing of self-antigens in the double mutant background.",Animal-other

In addition, the role of the visual system in relation to visual hallucinations was examined.	102 consecutive patients diagnosed with strictly defined Parkinson's disease were examined for the presence of hallucinations and delusions and assessed for visual acuity, cognition, depression using the geriatric depression scale, disease severity as measured by the UPDRS, and other clinical variables.	Of 102 consecutive patients, 29.4% (n=30) had hallucinations or delusions, four (3.9%) were determined to be psychotic due solely to delirium and were excluded from further analysis. Of the 98 remaining patients, 26.5% (n=26) had visual hallucinations. Among these, one patient also had delusions, two had auditory hallucinations, and one had gustatory hallucinations. Visual hallucinations were significantly associated with worse visual acuity, lower cognitive score, higher depression score, and worse disease severity. Hallucinations were not associated with history of psychiatric disease, dose or duration of levodopa or other antiparkinsonian medication treatment, or duration of illness.	Visual hallucinations are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease and are most likely of multifactorial origin. Although higher doses of levodopa are known to be related clinically to hallucinations in individual patients, the results suggest that several underlying characteristics of patients with Parkinson's disease (disease severity, dementia, depression, worse visual acuity) may be more important determinants of which patients experience hallucinations. The data also provide preliminary evidence that abnormality of the visual system may be related to visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, as has been found in other disorders with visual hallucinations.",Remaining

This analysis included 165 patients, mean ± SD age of 72.5 ± 6.1 years, with median (IQR) years of education of 13 (12-16), and baseline Modified Mini-Mental Status (3MS) Exam score of 95 (92-98). Prolapse repair type was vaginal for 70% (n=115) and laparoscopic for 30% (n=50) of patients; most under general anesthesia, 151 (92.1%). The incidence of positive delirium screen during the first week after surgery was 12.1% (n=20). Most of these participants screened positive on postoperative day 0, 8.4% (n=14). In univariate analyses, a positive screen was associated with older age and fewer education years, lower 3MS exam score, greater baseline geriatric depression scale score, and greater frailty score. Lower 3MS score was the only variable that remained significant in the final model (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.95).	One in 12 women ≥60 years deemed eligible for discharge on the day of prolapse surgery screens positive for delirium. The 7-day POD incidence is comparable to other elective non-cardiac surgery cohorts.

This study aimed to ascertain if teachers observed less psychological symptoms in Bangladeshi than British children.	Teachers completed a Rutter B2 Scale on samples of 113 'Bangladeshi' and 61 British children aged between 5 and 11 years.	Teachers recognised less symptomatology in the Asian children than their British peers. This trend was significant in children under the age of 8, but there was no significant difference in those aged 8-11 years. Only 13% of Bangladeshi children were fully fluent in English.	Two alternate hypotheses are put forward to explain these findings: (a) because more of the younger children could not speak English and communicate freely with their teachers, their symptoms were not noted by teachers; (b) the symptoms of the older children were a response to the pressures both the children and families faced as new immigrants. This study clearly needs to be replicated with a larger sample and also with interviews with both children and parents in order to validate the Rutter B2 questionnaires as an appropriate measure of disturbance in Bangladeshi children. It should be replicated with validated assessments of the children's fluency in English. It is also important to discuss with Bangladeshi parents what support they would like from both the school and from child psychiatric services, to promote their children's psychological health.",Remaining

Studies support the hypothesis that molecular mimicry between the group A streptococcus and heart or brain are important in directing immune responses in rheumatic fever. Rheumatic carditis, Sydenham chorea and a new group of behavioral disorders called pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections are reviewed with consideration of autoantibody and T cell responses and the role of molecular mimicry between the heart, brain and group A streptococcus as well as how immune responses contribute to pathogenic mechanisms in disease. In rheumatic carditis, studies have investigated human monoclonal autoantibodies and T cell clones for their crossreactivity and their mechanisms leading to valve damage in rheumatic heart disease. Although studies of human and animal sera from group A streptococcal diseases or immunization models have been crucial in providing clues to molecular mimicry and its role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever, study of human monoclonal autoantibodies have provided important insights into how antibodies against the valve may activate the valve endothelium and lead to T cell infiltration. Passive transfer of anti-streptococcal T cell lines in a rat model of rheumatic carditis illustrates effects of CD4+ T cells on the valve. Although Sydenham chorea has been known as the neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever for decades, the combination of autoimmunity and behavior is a relatively new concept linking brain, behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders with streptococcal infections. In Sydenham chorea, human mAbs and their expression in transgenic mice have linked autoimmunity to central dopamine pathways as well as dopamine receptors and dopaminergic neurons in basal ganglia. Taken together, the studies reviewed provide a basis for understanding streptococcal sequelae and how immune responses against group A streptococci influence autoimmunity and inflammatory responses in the heart and brain.",Non-systematic-review

438,32892962,Seminars in pediatric neurology,Treatment of Folate Metabolism Abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that currently has no approved medical therapy to address core symptoms or underling pathophysiological processes. Several compounds are under development that address both underlying pathophysiological abnormalities and core ASD symptoms. This article reviews one of these treatments, d,l-leucovorin calcium (also known as folinic acid) for treatment of folate pathway abnormalities in children with ASD. Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that is essential for normal neurodevelopment and abnormalities in the folate and related pathways have been identified in children with ASD. One of these abnormalities involves a partial blockage in the ability of folate to be transported into the brain utilizing the primary transport mechanism, the folate receptor alpha. Autoantibodies which interfere with the function of the folate receptor alpha called folate receptor alpha autoantibodies have been identified in 58%-76% of children with ASD and independent studies have demonstrated that blood titers of these autoantibodies correlate with folate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Most significantly, case-series, open-label, and single and double-blind placebo-controlled studies suggest that d,l-leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the blockage at the folate receptor alpha by using the reduced folate carrier, an alternate pathway, can substantially improve particular symptoms in children with ASD, especially those positive for folate receptor alpha autoantibodies.

Paper-based measurement tools can be burdensome to the patient and clinician and lack the temporal resolution needed to accurately and objectively track changes in motor symptom severity throughout the day. Wearable sensor-based systems that continuously monitor PD motor disorders may help to solve this problem, although critical shortcomings persist in identifying multiple disorders at high temporal resolution during unconstrained activity. The purpose of this study was to advance the current state of the art by (1) introducing hybrid sensor technology to concurrently acquire surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer data during unconstrained activity and (2) analyzing the data using dynamic neural network algorithms to capture the evolving temporal characteristics of the sensor data and improve motor disorder recognition of tremor and dyskinesia. Algorithms were trained (n=11 patients) and tested (n=8 patients; n=4 controls) to recognize tremor and dyskinesia at 1-second resolution based on sensor data features and expert annotation of video recording during 4-hour monitoring periods of unconstrained daily activity. The algorithms were able to make accurate distinctions between tremor, dyskinesia, and normal movement despite the presence of diverse voluntary activity. Motor disorder severity classifications averaged 94.9% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity based on 1 sensor per symptomatic limb. These initial findings indicate that new sensor technology and software algorithms can be effective in enhancing wearable sensor-based system performance for monitoring PD motor disorders during unconstrained activities.",Remaining

The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used to measure cognition. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MMSE score of less than 24. The crude prevalence of cognitive impairment was 10% in this population of African Americans with CHF. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated an increase in odds of cognitive impairment with increasing age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10 and 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.20; p=0.042]. There was no significant relationship between cognitive impairment and gender, education status, depression and severity of CHF. This study indicates that cognitive impairment is relatively prevalent among African Americans with CHF, but lower than previously reported among Caucasians with CHF.",Remaining
442,35547565,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,Effect of New Nursing on Patients with Acute Cerebral Infarction.,"To explore the effect of the comfortable intervention-based nursing mode under the quality nursing intervention combined with Internet mobile health on the quality of life (QOL) and psychological status of patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI).	90 ACI patients treated in our hospital (June 2019-June 2020) were chosen and equally split into the experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) according to the order of admission. CG received routine nursing, while EG received the comfortable intervention-based nursing mode under the quality nursing intervention combined with Internet mobile health to compare the clinical indexes between the two groups.	Compared with CG, EG after intervention achieved obviously higher SS-QOL, ESCA, and GCQ scores (P < 0.001), and lower MSSNS and NIHSS scores (P < 0.001).	The application of the comfortable intervention-based nursing mode under the quality nursing intervention combined with Internet mobile health effectively improves QOL and alleviates the negative emotions of patients. Compared with routine nursing, this model has higher application value, and further research of the joint intervention will help build better a solution for patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
443,34526055,Molecular neurodegeneration,Adult-onset CNS myelin sulfatide deficiency is sufficient to cause Alzheimer's disease-like neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.,"Human genetic association studies point to immune response and lipid metabolism, in addition to amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau, as major pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by microglia and astrocytes, plays a causative role in neurodegeneration in AD. Our group and others have reported early and dramatic losses of brain sulfatide in AD cases and animal models that are mediated by ApoE in an isoform-dependent manner and accelerated by Aβ accumulation. To date, it remains unclear if changes in specific brain lipids are sufficient to drive AD-related pathology.	To study the consequences of CNS sulfatide deficiency and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we developed a novel mouse model of adult-onset myelin sulfatide deficiency, i.e., tamoxifen-inducible myelinating glia-specific cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) conditional knockout mice (CST[fl/fl]/Plp1-CreERT), took advantage of constitutive CST knockout mice (CST[-/-]), and generated CST/ApoE double knockout mice (CST[-/-]/ApoE[-/-]), and assessed these mice using a broad range of methodologies including lipidomics, RNA profiling, behavioral testing, PLX3397-mediated microglia depletion, mass spectrometry (MS) imaging, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and Western blot.	We found that mild central nervous system (CNS) sulfatide losses within myelinating cells are sufficient to activate disease-associated microglia and astrocytes, and to increase the expression of AD risk genes (e.g., Apoe, Trem2, Cd33, and Mmp12), as well as previously established causal regulators of the immune/microglia network in late-onset AD (e.g., Tyrobp, Dock, and Fcerg1), leading to chronic AD-like neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment. Notably, neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment showed gender differences, being more pronounced in females than males. Subsequent mechanistic studies demonstrated that although CNS sulfatide losses led to ApoE upregulation, genetically-induced myelin sulfatide deficiency led to neuroinflammation independently of ApoE. These results, together with our previous studies (sulfatide deficiency in the context of AD is mediated by ApoE and accelerated by Aβ accumulation) placed both Aβ and ApoE upstream of sulfatide deficiency-induced neuroinflammation, and suggested a positive feedback loop where sulfatide losses may be amplified by increased ApoE expression. We also demonstrated that CNS sulfatide deficiency-induced astrogliosis and ApoE upregulation are not secondary to microgliosis, and that astrogliosis and microgliosis seem to be driven by activation of STAT3 and PU.1/Spi1 transcription factors, respectively.	Our results strongly suggest that sulfatide deficiency is an important contributor and driver of neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment in AD pathology.",Animal-other

A cohort study of 394 male and 360 female surviving infants born at 24 to 33 completed weeks of gestational age. Neurological examination and cognitive assessment of the infants (Bayley Scales of Infant Development) were performed at 2 years corrected age.	Mean gestational age was 30.4 weeks (SD 2.4). Rates of mild and moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impairment were 14.6% (110/754) and 7% (53/754) respectively. In logistic analysis, male sex was associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment (odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.21-2.68) compared with females. The excess risk of neurodevelopmental impairment associated with male sex was higher among preeclamptic than normotensive pregnancies (p for interaction=0.004), among infants who were either small for gestational age or delivered to a mother with preeclampsia (p for interaction=0.001) and in iatrogenic as opposed to spontaneous preterm birth or preterm premature rupture of membranes (p for interaction=0.035).

445,28693402,Clinical child psychology and psychiatry,Fix my child: The importance of including siblings in clinical assessments.,"This study examined concordance in the attachment strategies of school-aged siblings with reference to environmental risk in terms of poverty and maltreatment. It also investigated the effect of child maltreatment and maternal mental illness on children's psychosocial functioning in terms of the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM) including unresolved trauma and the DMM Depressed modifier.	The attachment strategies of 30 sibling pairs, aged 5-14 years, were assessed using the School-age Assessment of Attachment (SAA). Unlike most previous studies, this study included siblings from large families of two to six children.	The main finding was that as environmental risk increases, the diversity of sibling attachment strategies decreases with greater recourse to the DMM Type A3-6 and A/C strategies. Unlike previous studies, the highest level of concordance was found in sibling pairs with the opposite gender. Boys whose mothers had a history of mental illness were significantly more likely than girls to be assessed with the DMM-depression modifier.	As danger increases, children in the same family experience more of the same childhood. Further research should focus on single case, intra-familial studies to build a systemic model of the shared environment. Research should also evaluate the effects of environmental risk compared with size of the sibling group on children's attachment strategies. The clinical implications point to the importance of assessing all children in the family using a model built around functional formulation rather than diagnosing the symptoms of a particular child.",Remaining

Differences in epidemiology of complaints and diagnostic considerations, variance in medical comorbidities, and interference from related medications also contribute to the need for different strategies for treatments of sexual dysfunction according to gender.	Flibanserin and ospemifene are new medication treatment options that may help some women with symptoms of sexual dysfunction.

Recently a tissue-specific and selective upregulation of the multidrug efflux transporter ABCB1 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the spinal cord of both patients and the mutant SOD1-G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that prevalently kills motor neurons has been reported. Here, we extended the analysis of P-gp expression in the SOD1-G93A ALS mouse model and found that P-gp upregulation was restricted to endothelial cells of the capillaries, while P-gp expression was not detected in other cells of the spinal cord parenchyma such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Using both in vitro human and mouse models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we found that mutant SOD1 astrocytes were driving P-gp upregulation in endothelial cells. In addition, a significant increase in reactive oxygen species production, Nrf2 and NFκB activation in endothelial cells exposed to mutant SOD1 astrocytes in both human and murine BBB models were observed. Most interestingly, astrocytes expressing FUS-H517Q, a different familial ALS-linked mutated gene, also drove NFκB-dependent upregulation of P-gp. However, the pathway was not dependent on oxidative stress but rather involved TNF-α release. Overall, these findings indicated that nuclear translocation of NFκB was a converging mechanism used by endothelial cells of the BBB to upregulate P-gp expression in mutant SOD1-linked ALS and possibly other forms of familial ALS.

449,37178103,Annals of emergency medicine,Tenecteplase Versus Alteplase for Acute Stroke: Mortality and Bleeding Complications.,"Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase has been the foundation of initial treatment of acute ischemic stroke for several decades. Tenecteplase is a thrombolytic agent that offers logistical advantages in cost and administration relative to alteplase. There is evidence that tenecteplase has at least similar efficacy and safety outcomes compared with alteplase for stroke. In this study, we compared tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute stroke in a large retrospective US database (TriNetX) regarding the following 3 outcomes: (1) mortality, (2) intracranial hemorrhage, and (3) the need for acute blood transfusions.	In this retrospective study using the US cohort of 54 academic medical centers/health care organizations in the TriNetX database, we identified 3,432 patients treated with tenecteplase and 55,894 patients treated with alteplase for stroke after January 1, 2012. Propensity score matching was performed on basic demographic information and 7 previous clinical diagnostic groups, resulting in a total of 6,864 patients with acute stroke evenly matched between groups. Mortality rates, the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage, and blood transfusions (as a marker of significant blood loss) were recorded for each group over the ensuing 7- and 30-day periods. Secondary subgroup analyses were conducted on a cohort treated from 2021 to 2022 in an attempt to determine whether temporal differences in acute ischemic stroke treatment would alter the results.	Patients treated with tenecteplase had a significantly lower mortality rate (8.2% versus 9.8%; risk ratio [RR], 0.832) and lower risk of major bleeding as measured by the frequency of blood transfusions (0.3% versus 1.4%; RR, 0.207) than alteplase at 30 days after thrombolysis for stroke. In the larger 10-year data set of patients with stroke treated after January 1, 2012, patients receiving tenecteplase were not found to have a statistically different incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (3.5% versus 3.0%; RR, 1.185) at 30 days after the administration of the thrombolytic agents in patients. However, a subgroup analysis of 2,216 evenly matched patients with stroke treated from 2021 to 2022 demonstrated notably better survival and statistically lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage than the alteplase group.	In our large retrospective multicenter study using real-world evidence from large health care organizations, tenecteplase for the treatment of acute stroke demonstrated a lower mortality rate, decreased intracranial hemorrhage, and less significant blood loss. The favorable mortality and safety profiles observed in this large study, taken together with previous randomized controlled trial data and operational advantages in rapid dosing and cost-effectiveness, all support the preferential use of tenecteplase in patients with ischemic stroke.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

The aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes of anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) combined with artificial disc replacement (C-ADR) and ACCF combined with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in patients with consecutive 3-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).	The optimal surgical strategy for multilevel CSM (MCSM) remains undefined. C-ADR maintains motion at the level of the surgical procedure and decreases strain on the adjacent segments. The clinical results of multilevel C-ADR have not yet been elucidated. ACCF combined with 1-level C-ADR for the treatment of consecutive 3-level CSM may be a reasonable alternative to 3-level fusion.	We retrospectively reviewed the histories of patients who underwent surgery for consecutive 3-level CSM between C3-4 and C6-7 from June 2007 to August 2011. A total of 42 patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 19) underwent ACCF combined with 1-level C-ADR; group B (n = 23) underwent ACCF combined with 1-level ACDF. We compared perioperative parameters, clinical parameters, and radiological parameters.	There were no significant differences in the average age, sex ratio, the preoperative heights of the disc space or average blood loss between the 2 groups. Group A had longer operation times than group B (P < 0.05). During the follow-up period, group A showed a better Neck Dysfunction Index recovery (P < 0.05) at 24 months postoperatively, and less visual analogue scale scores at 12 and 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, group A exhibited better C2-C7 range of motion recovery at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.05, respectively).	Group A was superior to Group B in terms of better Neck Dysfunction Index recovery, less intermediate term pain, and better C2-C7 ROM recovery. ACCF hybrid 1-level C-ADR may be a suitable choice for the management of 3-level CSM in appropriate patients.	3.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

The Sydney Myopia Study examined 1765 predominantly 6 year old children from 34 randomly selected Sydney schools during 2003-4. Keratometry, cycloplegic autorefraction, and questionnaire data were collected.	Spherical equivalent (SE) anisometropia (> or =1 dioptre) prevalence was 1.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1% to 2.4%). Aniso-astigmatism (>or =1D) prevalence was 1.0% (CI: 0.6% to 1.6%). Both conditions were significantly more prevalent among moderately hyperopic (SE > or =2.0D) than mildly hyperopic (SE 0.5-1.9D) children. Myopic children (SE < or =-0.5D) had higher anisometropia prevalence. Neither condition varied by age, sex, or ethnicity. In multivariate analyses, anisometropia was significantly associated with amblyopia, odds ratio (OR) 29, (CI: 8.7 to 99), exotropia (OR 7.7, CI: 1.2 to 50), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (OR 3.6, CI: 1.1 to 12.6). Aniso-astigmatism was significantly associated with amblyopia (OR 8.2, CI: 1.4 to 47), maternal age >35 years (OR 4.0, CI: 1.3 to 11.9), and NICU admission (OR 4.6, CI: 1.2 to 17.2). Anisometropia resulted from relatively large interocular differences in axial length (p<0.0001) and anterior chamber depth (p = 0.0009). Aniso-astigmatism resulted from differences in corneal astigmatism (p<0.0001).	In this predominantly 6 year old population, anisometropia and aniso-astigmatism were uncommon, had important birth and biometry associations, and were strongly related to amblyopia and strabismus.",Remaining
452,6135252,Schizophrenia bulletin,Is there a tardive dysmentia?,"A change in the phenomenology of schizophrenia has been observed over the past several decades; affective disturbances and phasic courses have become more evident. Although there is no obvious single explanation for these changes, several ideas have been considered. The advent and use of antipsychotic drugs over the past 30 years stands out as the most significant change. Because it is well known that chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs can induce tardive dyskinesia and has been hypothesized to induce a supersensitivity psychosis, it is reasonable to believe that other behavioral changes may occur over time. We here describe a behavioral disorder that we have termed tardive dysmentia, involving changes in affect, activation level, and interpersonal interaction. A relationship between tardive dysmentia and tardive dyskinesia is suggested. It is our hypothesis that tardive dysmentia contributes to the changing course of schizophrenia and occurs after long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs.",Non-systematic-review

Drugs that inhibit the inactivation of NAAG by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) increase its extracellular concentration and its activation of its receptor, mGluR3. These drugs warrant attention, as they are effective in animal models of several clinical disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia. In inflammatory and neuropathic pain studies, GCPII inhibitors moderated both the primary and secondary pain responses when given systemically, locally or in brain regions associated with the pain perception pathway. The finding that GCPII inhibition also moderated the motor and cognitive effects of ethanol intoxication led to the discovery of their procognitive efficacy in long-term memory tests in control mice and in short-term memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. NAAG and GCPII inhibitors respectively reduce cocaine self-administration and the rewarding effects of a synthetic stimulant. Most recently, GCPII inhibition also has been reported to be efficacious in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. GCPII was first discovered as a protein expressed by and released from metastatic prostate cells where it is known as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). GCPII inhibitors with high affinity for this protein have been developed as prostate imaging and radiochemical therapies for prostate cancer. Taken together, these data militate in favor of the development and application of GCPII inhibitors in more advanced preclinical research as a prelude to clinical trials.",Non-systematic-review

Here we report the analysis of 16 ChG by whole-exome and RNA-sequencing. We found that 15 ChG harbor the same PRKCA [D463H] mutation. PRKCA encodes the Protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme alpha (PKCα) and is mutated in a wide range of human cancers. However the hot spot PRKCA [D463H] mutation was not described in other tumors. PRKCA [D463H] is strongly associated with the activation of protein translation initiation (EIF2) pathway. PKCα[D463H] mRNA levels are more abundant than wild-type PKCα transcripts, while PKCα[D463H] is less stable than the PCKα[WT] protein. Compared to PCKα[WT], the PKCα[D463H] protein is depleted from the cell membrane. The PKCα[D463H] mutant enhances proliferation of astrocytes and tanycytes, the cells of origin of ChG.

In addition, no data exist regarding the benefits of starting statins in patients with AAA not currently taking them.	We performed a registry-based study of all patients undergoing repair of AAAs in the Vascular Quality Initiative between 2003 and 2017 without documented statin intolerance. In our primary analysis, we evaluated the association between preoperative statin therapy and long-term mortality, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital myocardial infarction and stroke. As a secondary analysis, we studied the cohort of patients not taking a statin preoperatively and compared their long-term mortality on the basis of whether they were discharged on a statin. To account for nonrandom assignment to treatment, we constructed propensity scores and applied inverse probability weighting.	We identified 40,452 AAA repairs, of which 37,950 fit our entry criteria (29,257 endovascular and 8693 open). Overall, 25,997 patients (69%) were taking a statin preoperatively, with patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair more frequently taking a statin than those undergoing open repair (69% compared with 66%; P < .001). After propensity weighting, preoperative statin therapy was not associated with 30-day death or in-hospital stroke or myocardial infarction. However, patients taking statins preoperatively experienced higher adjusted 1-year (94% vs 90%) and 5-year (85% vs 81%) survival from the date of surgery compared with those who were not (P < .001 overall), although subgroup analysis showed that this applied only to intact or symptomatic aneurysms. Of the 11,941 patients not taking a statin preoperatively and discharged alive, 2910 (24%) started on a statin before discharge. In our secondary analysis of the subset of patients not taking statins preoperatively, those initiated on a statin before discharge experienced higher survival at 1 year (94% vs 91%) and 5 years (89% vs 81%; P < .001 overall) than those who remained off statin therapy, with the greatest absolute long-term survival difference in patients with rupture (87% vs 62%; P < .001 overall).	Preoperative statin therapy is associated with higher long-term survival but not perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing AAA repair, and initiating statin therapy in previously statin-naive patients is associated with markedly higher survival. All patients with AAAs without contraindications should receive statin therapy. In patients not taking a statin at the time of AAA repair, clinicians should consider initiating one before discharge.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

RSS of the dementia group were significantly lower than those in the intermediate and healthy groups, in order: dementia < intermediate < healthy groups. RSS of the low score intermediate group was significantly lower than that of the high score intermediate group. There was no significant difference between the low score intermediate and dementia groups, or between the high score intermediate and healthy groups. No significant differences of either HSD-R or MMSE were observed between the low score and the high score intermediate groups.

The following imaging parameters associated with syrinx and surgical intervention were identified: midbrain length (P < 0.001; P = 0.032), the obex position (P = 0.002; P < 0.001) and medullary kinking (P = 0.041; P < 0.001). Among the clinical features, the presence of overall pain (P = 0.017; P = 0.042), neck pain (P = 0.005; P = 0.027), and sensory dysfunction (P < 0.001) were found to be strongly associated with syrinx and surgery.	While further investigation is needed, these specific radiological and clinical parameters should be considered when evaluating CM1 patients and may be used to guide further management.",Remaining
464,34500626,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",Apigenin Ameliorates Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction and Neuronal Damage in Mice.,"We investigated the protective effect and mechanisms of apigenin against cognitive impairments in a scopolamine-injected mouse model. Our results showed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of scopolamine leads to learning and memory dysfunction, whereas the administration of apigenin (synthetic compound, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) improved cognitive ability, which was confirmed by behavioral tests such as the T-maze test, novel objective recognition test, and Morris water maze test in mice. In addition, scopolamine-induced lipid peroxidation in the brain was attenuated by administration of apigenin. To further evaluate the protective mechanisms of apigenin on cognitive and memory function, Western blot analysis was carried out. Administration of apigenin decreased the B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio and suppressed caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. Furthermore, apigenin down-regulated the β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme, along with presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 protein levels. Apigenin-administered mice showed lower protein levels of a receptor for advanced glycation end-products, whereas insulin-degrading enzyme, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression were promoted by treatment with apigenin. Therefore, this study demonstrated that apigenin is an active substance that can improve cognitive and memory functions by regulating apoptosis, amyloidogenesis, and BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways.",Animal-drug-intervention

Using a retrospective cohort design, this study analysed data collected from patients with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia in 2003 (index hospitalisation) in order to evaluate prescription patterns of antipsychotic drugs.	Patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia, at least one year prior membership with the insurance fund and a follow-up period of one year were identified. Results were standardised by age and stratified by the severity of their illness, defined by the number of hospital bed days during the three years preceding the index hospitalisation.	A total of 3,121 patients with schizophrenia (male 56.4%, female 43.6%) received 56 692 single prescriptions of antipsychotics. Of these, 35.4% of the prescriptions were for typical and 64.6% for atypical antipsychotics; 55% were for high-potency, 45% for low-potency typical antipsychotics. The most frequently prescribed drugs were olanzapine (26.6%), clozapine (21.3%) and risperidone (19%). There were no relevant gender differences concerning prescription patterns. During a 12-month follow-up period after the first hospitalisation, 1 372 patients (43.9%) were treated exclusively with an atypical antipsychotic, another 499 patients (16%) had a combination of an atypical plus a low-potency typical antipsychotic. Thus, basal therapy with an atypical was observed in 59.9% of our study population. Only 327 patients (10.5%) were treated exclusively with a typical antipsychotic. A total of 645 patients (20.7%) were treated with a combination of atypical plus typical antipsychotic. Changes of medication within one substance group occurred more often with typical antipsychotics (50%) as compared to atypical antipsychotics (25%).	At 60%, the proportion of patients in this study treated with atypical antipsychotics was surprisingly high. Of significant interest is the frequent prescription of clozapine (14%).

468,34549339,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,Resveratrol Improves Synaptic Plasticity in Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury in Neonatal Mice via Alleviating SIRT1/NF-κB Signaling-Mediated Neuroinflammation.,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is an obstinate disease that troubles neonatologists. At present, cognitive impairment after HIE has received increasing attention. Synaptic plasticity determines the development of cognitive function, so it is urgent to develop new drugs that can improve HIE-induced cognitive impairment. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced neuroinflammation affects synaptic plasticity. As a SIRT1 agonist, resveratrol has a powerful anti-inflammatory effect, but whether it has an effect on impaired synaptic plasticity in HIE and the potential mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, resveratrol was used to intervene in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) mice, and the effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and further mechanisms were explored through performing neurobehavioral, morphological observations, Golgi sliver staining, western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments. We first found that resveratrol improves HI-induced long-term cognitive and memory deficits, and then we found that resveratrol reduces hippocampal neuronal damage and increases dendritic spine density and the expression of synaptic proteins. Finally, we found that this effect may be exerted by regulating the neuroinflammatory response mediated by the SIRT1/NF-κB axis. This study provides a new theoretical basis for resveratrol to prevent long-term neurological dysfunction following HIBI.",Animal-drug-intervention

Cycling was performed on a motor-driven isokinetic ergometer that enabled precise determinations of power output. Electrical stimulation was increased to 120-140 mA within the first 5 minutes and remained constant thereafter. Power output increased to 10.7 +/- 3.0 W after 2 minutes, dropped to 5.3 +/- 1.8 W after 6 minutes and subsequently recovered to 8.2 +/- 2.2 and 6.1 +/- 2.3 W after 19.5 and 40 minutes, respectively. Oxygen consumption increased to 0.47 +/- 0.09 l/min after 6 minutes and declined during the second half of the exercise bout. Gross mechanical efficiency after 19.5 minutes was elevated compared with the value after 6 minutes. Heart rate was significantly increased at the end of the trial.

470,11978162,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,Probable metabolic interaction of doxifluridine with phenytoin.,"To report the marked elevation of the serum phenytoin concentration during treatment with antineoplastic agents.	A 51-year-old Japanese woman, who was diagnosed with multiple brain metastatic tumors, was placed on oral phenytoin at a maintenance dose of 200 mg/d (3.8 mg/kg/d) to prevent seizures. The serum concentration of phenytoin was well controlled within the therapeutic range; no seizures occurred. Four months later, combination therapy with doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) 800 mg/d, cyclophosphamide 100 mg/d, and medroxyprogesterone acetate 800 mg/d was initiated because of further metastasis. Approximately 1 month after the start of concurrent treatment with the antineoplastic agents, the serum phenytoin concentration was elevated to fourfold of the original concentration. Staggering was observed at that time, but toxic symptoms gradually subsided with the decline in the serum phenytoin concentration after its withdrawal.	A probable explanation for the marked elevation of serum phenytoin concentration is a reduction of the capacity of CYP2C-dependent phenytoin metabolism, and the antineoplastic agents could be involved in this event. The interaction of fluorouracil and phenytoin is known in clinical practice, and it is reported that the expression of hepatic CYP2C enzymes is depressed by exposure of rats to fluorouracil. 5'-DFUR, a prodrug of fluorouracil, was considered the likeliest candidate responsible for the interaction. This interaction was of clinical significance because of the great extent of changes in the serum phenytoin concentration.	Clinicians should be aware of the elevation of serum phenytoin concentrations when phenytoin is given in combination with fluorouracil derivatives, including 5'-DFUR.",Human-case-report
471,7526192,Mutation research,Post-irradiation DNA synthesis inhibition and G2 phase delay in radiosensitive body cells from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients: an indication of cell cycle defects.,"In the present study, both post-irradiation DNA synthesis and G2 phase accumulation were analyzed in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and fibroblast cell strains derived from (Saudi) patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), ataxia telangiectasia (AT), AT heterozygotes and normal subjects. A comparison of the percent DNA synthesis inhibition (assayed by 3H-thymidine uptake 30 min after irradiation), and a 24 h post-irradiation G2 phase accumulation determined by flow cytometry placed the AT heterozygotes and the NHL patients in an intermediate position between the normal subjects (with maximum DNA synthesis inhibition and minimum G2 phase accumulation) and the AT homozygotes (with minimum DNA synthesis inhibition and maximum G2 accumulation). The similarity between AT heterozygotes and the NHL patients with respect to the two parameters studied after irradiation was statistically significant. The data indicating a moderate abnormality in the control of cell cycle progression after irradiation in the LCLs and fibroblasts from NHL patients may explain the enhanced cellular and chromosomal radiosensitivity in these patients reported by us earlier. In addition to demonstrating a link between cell cycle abnormality and radiosensitivity as a possible basis for cancer susceptibility, particularly in the NHL patients, the present studies emphasized the usefulness of the assay for 24 h post-irradiation G2 phase accumulation developed by Lavin et al. (1992) in characterizing AT heterozygote-like cell cycle anomaly in cancer patients irrespective of whether they carried the AT gene or any other affecting the cell cycle.",In-vitro-study
472,34312771,Molecular neurobiology,Genetic Depletion of Amylin/Calcitonin Receptors Improves Memory and Learning in Transgenic Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Models.,"Based upon its interactions with amyloid β peptide (Aβ), the amylin receptor, a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is a potential modulator of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, past pharmacological approaches have failed to resolve whether activation or blockade of this receptor would have greater therapeutic benefit. To address this issue, we generated compound mice expressing a human amyloid precursor protein gene with familial AD mutations in combination with deficiency of amylin receptors produced by hemizygosity for the critical calcitonin receptor subunit of this heterodimeric GPCR. These compound transgenic AD mice demonstrated attenuated responses to human amylin- and Aβ-induced depression of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in keeping with the genetic depletion of amylin receptors. Both the LTP responses and spatial memory (as measured with Morris water maze) in these mice were improved compared to AD mouse controls and, importantly, a reduction in both the amyloid plaque burden and markers of neuroinflammation was observed. Our data support the notion of further development of antagonists of the amylin receptor as AD-modifying therapies.",Animal-other
473,28428190,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,In Vivo Detection of EGFRvIII in Glioblastoma via Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signature Consistent with Deep Peritumoral Infiltration: The φ-Index.,"Purpose: The epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) mutation has been considered a driver mutation and therapeutic target in glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain cancer. Currently, detecting EGFRvIII requires postoperative tissue analyses, which are ex vivo and unable to capture the tumor's spatial heterogeneity. Considering the increasing evidence of in vivo imaging signatures capturing molecular characteristics of cancer, this study aims to detect EGFRvIII in primary glioblastoma noninvasively, using routine clinically acquired imaging.Experimental Design: We found peritumoral infiltration and vascularization patterns being related to EGFRvIII status. We therefore constructed a quantitative within-patient peritumoral heterogeneity index (PHI/φ-index), by contrasting perfusion patterns of immediate and distant peritumoral edema. Application of φ-index in preoperative perfusion scans of independent discovery (n = 64) and validation (n = 78) cohorts, revealed the generalizability of this EGFRvIII imaging signature.Results: Analysis in both cohorts demonstrated that the obtained signature is highly accurate (89.92%), specific (92.35%), and sensitive (83.77%), with significantly distinctive ability (P = 4.0033 × 10[-10], AUC = 0.8869). Findings indicated a highly infiltrative-migratory phenotype for EGFRvIII[+] tumors, which displayed similar perfusion patterns throughout peritumoral edema. Contrarily, EGFRvIII[-] tumors displayed perfusion dynamics consistent with peritumorally confined vascularization, suggesting potential benefit from extensive peritumoral resection/radiation.Conclusions: This EGFRvIII signature is potentially suitable for clinical translation, since obtained from analysis of clinically acquired images. Use of within-patient heterogeneity measures, rather than population-based associations, renders φ-index potentially resistant to inter-scanner variations. Overall, our findings enable noninvasive evaluation of EGFRvIII for patient selection for targeted therapy, stratification into clinical trials, personalized treatment planning, and potentially treatment-response evaluation.

A retrospective chart review of 107 neonates with NEC (Bell stage > IIa) from Jan 2013- June 2020 was completed. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were compared between infants with or without placental pathologic lesions.	In this cohort, 59/107 (55%) infants had medical NEC, and 48 (45%) had surgical NEC. The infants had a mean gestational age of 28.1±3.7 weeks and a birth weight of 1103±647 g. Maternal vascular malperfusion (82/107, 76.6%) and acute histological chorioamnionitis (42, 39.3%) were the most common pathological placental lesions. Acute histologic chorioamnionitis with fetal inflammatory response was more common in infants with surgical NEC vs. medical NEC (35.4% vs. 15.3%; p = 0.02). The NEC Infants with WMI on brain MRI scans had a significantly higher incidence of acute histological chorioamnionitis (52% vs. 27.8%; P = 0.04). No significant differences in mortality, length of stay and postoperative outcomes in neonates with and without acute histologic chorioamnionitis with fetal inflammatory response were noted.

This study also examined the effects of ADHD on the academic and social lives of college students. The sample consisted of 219 university students. These students were interviewed by a psychiatrist with regard to ADHD symptoms according to the DSM-IV. The Adult ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS), the Teen Interpersonal Influence Scale, and a demographic information form were used as measurement devices. The ADHD and control groups were classified in three different ways: (1) met the ADHD criteria for both Clinical Diagnosis and the ASRS; (2) met only the criteria for Clinical Diagnosis; or (3) met only the criteria of the ASRS. Our research shows that individuals with ADHD experience more problems with money management and are more affected by the media, friends, and brands compared with individuals without ADHD. Smoking and alcohol use disorders, accidents, being held back, and disciplinary actions often accompany ADHD in college students. To the best of our knowledge, the shopping attitudes of young adults with ADHD and the influence of the media, peers, family, and brands have not been studied until now.",Remaining
477,34915734,Crisis,Passive Suicidal Ideation in Childhood.,"Background: A growing body of empirical research shows that suicidal behaviors are prevalent in childhood. Yet, few studies have examined risk factors related to suicidal ideation (SI) among children aged 12 and younger. Aims: The current study addresses this gap. Method: A questionnaire was filled out by 1,350 Flemish primary caregivers (94.7% mothers) of 9-year-old children (50.4% boys, Mage = 9.45). Their responses were analyzed using logistic regression and independent samples t tests. Results: The presence of passive SI was reported in 10.5% of the children. A psychiatric, developmental, or behavioral condition (or multiple conditions), a learning disorder, impulsivity, aggression, and experiencing multiple stressful family life events were discovered as potential risk factors of passive SI in childhood. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of this study meant that causality could not be inferred. In addition, it was based on reports of primary caregivers, rather than on reports from the children themselves. Conclusion: These new empirical findings can be used for the development of prevention programs and be taken into account in risk assessments of SI in clinical practice.

491,29063964,Psychopharmacology,Phytocannabinoids modulate emotional memory processing through interactions with the ventral hippocampus and mesolimbic dopamine system: implications for neuropsychiatric pathology.,"Growing clinical and preclinical evidence suggests a potential role for the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) as a pharmacotherapy for various neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, is associated with acute and neurodevelopmental propsychotic side effects through its interaction with central cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs). CB1R stimulation in the ventral hippocampus (VHipp) potentiates affective memory formation through inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, thereby altering emotional salience attribution. These changes in DA activity and salience attribution, evoked by dysfunctional VHipp regulatory actions and THC exposure, could predispose susceptible individuals to psychotic symptoms. Although THC can accelerate the onset of schizophrenia, CBD displays antipsychotic properties, can prevent the acquisition of emotionally irrelevant memories, and reverses amphetamine-induced neuronal sensitization through selective phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) molecular signaling pathway. This review summarizes clinical and preclinical evidence demonstrating that distinct phytocannabinoids act within the VHipp and associated corticolimbic structures to modulate emotional memory processing through changes in mesolimbic DA activity states, salience attribution, and signal transduction pathways associated with schizophrenia-related pathology.",Non-systematic-review
492,32299778,Clinical colorectal cancer,Efficacy and Safety of Bevacizumab Combined With First-Line Chemotherapy in Elderly (≥75 Years) Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Real-World Study.,"Although elderly patients are the first concerned by colorectal cancer (CRC), they are underrepresented in clinical trials. The real-world CASSIOPEE study was thus conducted in elderly patients treated for metastatic CRC (mCRC).	This French prospective, multicenter, noninterventional study aimed to estimate 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and describe treatments, patient autonomy (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living; Balducci scale), and safety over 24 months, in patients older than 75 with mCRC, starting first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (NCT01555762).	From 2012 to 2014, 402 patients were included (safety population: n = 383, efficacy population: n = 358). Patient characteristics were as follows: mean age, 81 ± 4 years (<80 years, 46%; 80-85 years, 44%; >85 years, 10%); men, 52%; colon primary tumor, 80%; main metastatic site, liver 66%; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 0-1, 81%. Median PFS was 9.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.3-10.2). It was superior for patients ≤85 years (<80 years: 9.3 months; 80-85 years: 9.5 months) compared with patients >85 years (8.3 months). Median OS was 19.0 months (95% CI, 16.5-21.5) and decreased in the 2 oldest groups (20.6, 17.8, and 13.0 months). Autonomy assessments decreased over time leading to nonconclusive results. Twenty-six percent of patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs): 7% bevacizumab-related SAEs, and 6% bevacizumab-targeted SAEs. Two fatal bevacizumab-related adverse events were reported (hemorrhagic stroke and intestinal ischemia).	This large French real-world study showed that medically fit older patients with mCRC could have a benefit/risk balance similar to that of younger patients when treated with first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. Improvements in geriatric assessments are needed to better define this population.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
493,21112701,Drug and alcohol dependence,Psychopathic heroin addicts are not uniformly impaired across neurocognitive domains of impulsivity.,"Impulsivity is a hallmark characteristic of drug addiction and a prominent feature of externalizing disorders such as psychopathy that are commonly comorbid with drug addiction. In a previous study (Vassileva et al., 2007) we have shown that psychopathic heroin addicts evidence more impulsive decision-making on the Iowa Gambling Task relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether the observed impulse-control deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts would generalize to other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity, such as delay discounting and behavioral inhibition among a group of relatively 'pure' heroin addicts in Bulgaria who participated in our previous study.	We tested 92 currently abstinent male heroin addicts, classified as psychopathic or non-psychopathic based on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R). We administered two neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity: (1) Delayed Rewards Discounting Task, a measure of temporal discounting of rewards; and (2) Passive Avoidance Learning Task, a measure of behavioral inhibition.	Psychopathic heroin addicts were not impaired relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts on the Delayed Rewards Discounting Task and the Passive Avoidance Learning Task, on the latter of which they showed better attentional capacity.	These results indicate that psychopathic heroin users are not uniformly impaired across neurocognitive domains of impulsivity. Combined with our previous findings, results suggest that the presence of psychopathy may exacerbate decision-making deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts, but it may not have significant effect on other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity in this population.",Remaining

In order to investigate olfactory perception in different depressive states, we carried out olfactory testing during a depressive episode (n=37) and in a remitted state (n=17). As expected, patients were significantly less depressed (p<0.001) and less anhedonic (p=0.001) in the remitted state. A comparison of olfactory perception between age- and gender-matched patients and healthy volunteers (n=37) controlled for intrinsic olfactory deficits in major depression. In the depressive episode, we applied regression analyses to investigate the relation of olfactory hedonics, severity of depression and anhedonia. The Sniffin' Sticks Test extended by analogue rating scales for intensity and hedonic estimates was employed for olfactory testing. Depression severity was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), anhedonia with the Snaith-Hamilton-Pleasure-Scale (SHAPS). Odour identification ability was significantly reduced during the depressive state. In contrast, no significant differences in hedonic and intensity estimates could be found between the depressive and the remitted state and healthy controls. During the depressive episode, we found a significant relation only between anhedonia and olfactory hedonics. We concluded that anhedonia has potential impact on olfactory hedonics in major depression. Our results indicate the need for (1) confirmatory studies in severe melancholic depression and (2) investigation of the impact of anhedonia on olfactory hedonics in psychiatric diseases other than major depression.",Remaining

A retrospective review was done of charts of 51 patients who had been treated with a 1-week light therapy intervention. Patient self-rated scales applied in a standard manner were used to measure clinical progress. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) with added atypical features was used as the primary outcome variable. Sleep patterns were analyzed and the effect of psychotropic medications on outcome was determined. Seven point scales were used to assess expected response and global response. The importance of having LT set up and available in an office setting was evaluated. Retrospective degree of disability was measured based on the SPAQ degree of problem. The severity of the depressive episode was determined based on BDI score at entry.	Seasonality (how a patient's symptoms vary as a function of the season of the year), degree of disability based on the SPAQ, and severity of depressive episode at entry based on the BDI predicted response to LT. Greater severity at baseline based on BDI score predicted less chance of attaining full remission within 7 days of treatment compared with patients with lower severity scores at entry on the BDI. Sleep patterns relative to a fixed treatment time of 7 AM did not predict LT response. Light therapy was effective on its own, and the results were mixed as to whether adding LT to an existing antidepressant medication produced superior results.	Degree of seasonality can be used as a predictor of response to LT and may be clinically useful when suggesting that patients consider a trial of LT.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Such estimates would enhance the targeting of HIV prevention resources and provide a sensitive outcome measure for prevention program evaluation. The goal of this investigation was to estimate the incidence of HIV infection among persons testing for HIV in New York City.	The study population consisted of persons testing for HIV in public settings in New York City during 2001 (n = 114,703). We applied a less sensitive enzyme immunoassay (LS-EIA) (Vironostika, BioMerieux, Durham, NC) to the diagnostic blood specimen of 1022 persons in whom HIV (non-AIDS) had been diagnosed for the first time in 2001. The distribution of transmission risk among HIV-negative persons--men who have sex with men (MSM), injection drug users (IDUs), heterosexuals-from a large telephone health survey was used to generate denominators for transmission risk groups.	The 1022 persons tested by the LS-EIA represented 27% of all persons in whom HIV (non-AIDS) had been diagnosed in New York City during 2001. The incidence of HIV was estimated to be 0.29% per year (95% CI: 0.20-0.38), and was significantly higher for men than women (rate ratio 3.6, 95% CI: 2.6-5.1), and HIV incidence increased with age. Male IDU and MSM testers had the highest HIV incidence rates: 2.7% per year (95% CI: 2.3-3.1) and 2.5% per year (95% CI: 2.1-2.8), respectively.

500,33351671,Environmental health perspectives,The Association between Residential Green Space in Childhood and Development of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"Access to green space has been hypothesized to have a beneficial impact on children's mental well-being and cognitive development. The underlying mechanisms of the mental health benefits of green space are not fully understood, but different pathways have been suggested, such as the psychologically restoring capacities of green space, the ability to facilitate physical activity and social cohesion, and the mitigation of exposure to air pollution.	In this nationwide cohort study, we investigated associations between residential green space in early childhood and a clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	The cohort included individuals, who were born in Denmark between 1992 and 2007 (n=814,689) and followed for a diagnosis of ADHD from age 5, during the period 1997-2016. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of vegetation greenness surrounding each residential address in a quadratic area of 210m×210m in which the residence was located in the center of the quadrate. Individual exposure to green space was calculated as the average of NDVI surrounding each individual's residential address (or addresses if more than one) between birth and the fifth birthday. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ADHD, according to exposure level and adjusted for calendar time, age, sex, parental socioeconomic status, neighborhood level socioeconomic status, and urbanicity.	Individuals living in areas defined by sparse green vegetation (lowest decile of NDVI) had an increased risk of developing ADHD, compared with individuals living in areas within the highest decile of NDVI (IRR=1.55; 95% CI: 1.46, 1.65). Adjusting for the known confounders attenuated the result, but the association remained (IRR=1.20; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.28).	Our findings suggest that lower levels of green space in residential surroundings, during early childhood, may be associated with a higher risk of developing ADHD. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6729.",Remaining
501,11965850,Medicina,[Cadasil: a case with molecular diagnosis].,"CADASIL disease (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) was described in 1991 by Tourmier-Lasserve. Two years later the same authors described its association with chromosome 19; nonetheless, the mutations in gene Notch3 were not described until 1996. Clinical findings depend on the age at onset. The early form of the illness is found in young patients, generally less than 30 years old, and the main clinical manifestation is a migraine headache with subcortical lesions in the white matter, while in the later form ischemic events and behavioral symptoms are predominant. Anatomo-pathological findings in CADASIL include the presence of osmophilic granular deposits in vessel walls, skin, muscles and cerebral arteries. We present a patient with CADASIL and cavernous angioma. We studied a 40-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a left temporal-parietal cavernous angioma, with aphasia as the only symptom, two years before admission. Her family history showed that her father had suffered from vascular dementia. She was admitted to our hospital with right-side hemiparesis and dysarthria. A CT scan showed the presence of ischemic vascular lesions and former surgery sequelae. The duplex scan of the neck vessels and a transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out an embolic source. Laboratory tests including VDRL, HIV, prothrombotic profile and rheumatologic screening tests were normal. An MRI in T2W and FLAIR showed the presence of multiple subcortical cerebral lesions and hyperintensity in the white matter (leukoencephalopaty). We found a left acute putaminal-capsular infarct in the diffusion-MRI. The MRA was normal. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid was unremarkable. A molecular DNA test was performed, and a nucleotide substitution in position 583 in exon 4 of gene Notch3 was detected. This mutation was found only in CADASIL patients. The association with cavernous angioma has not been previously reported, and we believe that it was unrelated to CADASIL, either clinically or genetically. To our knowledge, this is the first case of CADASIL diagnosed by molecular DNA test in our country.",Human-case-report

We developed a methodology to evaluate the repeated intranasal delivery of neuroactive compounds on the non-human primate (NHP) brain, without the need for sedation. We evaluated the effects of the neuroactive peptide, DNSP-11 following repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation over the course of 10-weeks in Rhesus macaques. This approach allowed us to examine striatal target engagement, safety and tolerability, and brain distribution following a single [125]I-labeled DNSP-11 dose.	Our initial data support that repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation of DNSP-11 resulted in bilateral, striatal target engagement based on neurochemical changes in dopamine (DA) metabolites-without observable, adverse behavioral effects or weight loss in NHPs. Furthermore, a [125]I-labeled DNSP-11 study illustrates diffuse rostral to caudal distribution in the brain including the striatum-our target region of interest.	The results of this study are compared to our experiments in normal and 6-OHDA lesioned rats, where DNSP-11 was repeatedly delivered intranasally using a micropipette with animals under light sedation.	The results from this proof-of-concept study support the utility of our repeated intranasal dosing methodology in awake Rhesus macaques, to evaluate the effects of neuroactive compounds on the NHP brain. Additionally, results indicate that DNSP-11 can be safely and effectively delivered intranasally in MPTP-treated NHPs, while engaging the DA system.",Animal-drug-intervention

Several studies have suggested the presence of disturbed cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways in delirium as well as in Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal concentrations of amino acids and of neurotransmitter metabolites have been found in plasma, platelets and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, and in plasma and CSF of patients with a delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolite levels in plasma of AD patients with a concurrent delirium.	In a case-control study of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) with concurrent delirium, we investigated the contribution of delirium to some biochemical parameters in blood. We compared plasma amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolite levels of 17 delirious AD patients with those of 17 age- and gender-matched non-delirious AD patients and 29 age- and gender-matched controls.	Homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were higher in delirious AD patients than in controls, but only HVA concentrations were higher in delirious AD patients than in non-delirious AD patients.	Our findings suggest that central dopaminergic and serotonergic turnover are increased in AD patients with delirium and that the high dopaminergic turnover might reflect the consequences of delirium.",Remaining

508,25351111,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Prevention of Alzheimer's disease: a global challenge for next generation neuroscientists.,"The incidence of dementia is rapidly increasing in developed countries due to social and demographic changes. This trend is expected to worsen in the coming decades, with the number of cases possibly even tripling in the next 25 years. Therefore Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention is becoming a global health priority. Our knowledge of the pathophysiological process leading to the development of pathological brain lesions that characterize AD has increased exponentially in recent years. However, the phenotypic expression of AD not only depends on the development of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but other factors also play a role. Thus, over the last few decades, epidemiological studies have revealed several risk factors for developing AD, such as vascular or lifestyle related factors. Having the current knowledge on AD, two different strategies have been developed for the prevention of AD: one is based on primary prevention by acting on modifiable risk factors, the other is a pathophysiology-driven approach aimed to identify individuals in a preclinical stage of the disease and treating them with drugs purporting to act on molecular targets of the amyloid cascade. Several promising trials with these approaches are currently ongoing and results are expected in the next few years. The intrinsic limitations in the design of preventive trials should be overcome through a global effort involving healthy population, healthcare professionals, governments, industry, and scientific institutions. This exertion will be more than compensated if we can make AD a preventable disease.",Non-systematic-review

Nevertheless, patients who report that they feel emotionally numb about their illness might encounter difficulties cognitively processing an EOL discussion.	We hypothesized that emotional numbness would modify the effect of EOL discussions on the receipt of less aggressive EOL care.	Data were derived from structured interviews with 290 participants in the federally-funded Coping with Cancer Study, a multisite, prospective cohort study of patients with advanced cancer followed-up till their death. Patients' reports of EOL discussions with their physician and emotional numbness were assessed at a median of 4.6 months before their death. Information about aggressive EOL care (i.e., ventilation, resuscitation in the last week of life, death in the intensive care unit) was obtained from postmortem caregiver interviews and medical charts. Main and interactive effects of EOL discussions and emotional numbness on aggressive EOL care, adjusting for potential confounds, were evaluated using multiple logistic regression.	The likelihood of aggressive EOL care associated with having EOL discussions increased by a factor of nine (adjusted odds ratio=9.02, 95% CI 1.37, 59.6, P=0.022) for every unit increase in a patient's emotional numbness score.	Emotional numbness diminishes a patient's capacity to benefit from EOL discussions. The EOL decision making may be more effective if clinical communications with emotionally numb patients are avoided.",Remaining

Sertindole , first withdrawn from the market for cardiovascular safety concerns, is currently available in many countries. It has high affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and a1-adrenergic receptors, and a low potential for extrapyramidal symptoms.	The pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability, and cost-effectiveness of sertindole are covered in this article, based on a literature review (PubMed) from 1990 to 2014.	The reviewed studies suggest a beneficial effect of sertindole on positive, negative and cognitive symptoms, and on relapse prevention. Although generally well tolerated, sertindole is associated with a dose-related QT-interval prolongation; thus, its administration requires electrocardiogram screening and monitoring. The presence of congenital long QT syndrome, prolongated QTc at baseline, cardiac disease and drug interactions should be carefully considered before prescribing sertindole. Further direct 'head-to-head' comparisons with other second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), trials on special populations and further clarification on cardiac safety are needed to better define the role of sertindole in the treatment of schizophrenia.",Non-systematic-review

It has also been suggested that massage and touch may counteract cognitive decline.	To assess the effects of a range of massage and touch therapies on conditions associated with dementia, such as anxiety, agitated behaviour and depression, identify any adverse effects, and provide recommendations about future trials.	We identified trials from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 12 July 2005 using the terms massage, reflexology, touch and shiatsu. This Register contains records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. In addition, general and specific literature databases were searched and patient and therapist organizations contacted.	Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which a massage or touch intervention was given to persons suffering from dementia of any type, compared with other treatments or no treatment, and in which effect parameters included measures of behavioural problems, caregiver burden, emotional distress or cognitive abilities, were eligible for inclusion. Furthermore, we employed a set of minimal methodological quality criteria as a selection filter.	We identified 34 references in the initial searches. Of these, seven were actual or possible RCTs, but only two were found to meet the requirements of the set of minimal methodological criteria.	The very limited amount of reliable evidence available is in favour of massage and touch interventions for problems associated with dementia. However, this evidence addresses only two specific applications: hand massage for the immediate or short-term reduction of agitated behaviour, and the addition of touch to verbal encouragement to eat for the normalization of nutritional intake. The existing evidence does not support general conclusions about the effect or possible side effects of such interventions. No severe side effects were identified.	Massage and touch may serve as alternatives or complements to other therapies for the management of behavioural, emotional and perhaps other conditions associated with dementia.

In this study, a series of novel isochroman-4-one derivatives from natural (±)-7,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-isochroman-4-one [(±)-XJP] were designed and synthesized, and their anti-AD potential was evaluated. Among them, compound 10a [(Z)-3-acetyl-1-benzyl-4-((6,7-dimethoxy-4-oxoisochroman-3-ylidene)methyl)pyridin-1-ium bromide] possessed potent anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as well as modest antioxidant activity. Further molecular modeling and kinetic investigations revealed that compound 10a was a dual-binding inhibitor that binds to both catalytic anionic site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the enzyme AChE. In addition, compound 10a exhibited low cytotoxicity and moderate anti-Aβ aggregation efficacy. Moreover, the in silico screening suggested that these compounds could pass across the blood-brain barrier with high penetration. These findings show that compound 10a was a promising lead from a natural product with potent AChE inhibitory activity and deserves to be further developed for the prevention and treatment of AD.",In-vitro-study

515,27781424,Clinical neuropathology,Update on the integrated histopathological and genetic classification of medulloblastoma - a practical diagnostic guideline.,"The revised WHO classification of tumors of the CNS 2016 has introduced the concept of the integrated diagnosis. The definition of medulloblastoma entities now requires a combination of the traditional histological information with additional molecular/genetic features. For definition of the histopathological component of the medulloblastoma diagnosis, the tumors should be assigned to one of the four entities classic, desmoplastic/nodular (DNMB), extensive nodular (MBEN), or large cell/anaplastic (LC/A) medulloblastoma. The genetically defined component comprises the four entities WNT-activated, SHH-activated and TP53 wildtype, SHH-activated and TP53 mutant, or non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastoma. Robust and validated methods are available to allow a precise diagnosis of these medulloblastoma entities according to the updated WHO classification, and for differential diagnostic purposes. A combination of immunohistochemical markers including β-catenin, Yap1, p75-NGFR, Otx2, and p53, in combination with targeted sequencing and copy number assessment such as FISH analysis for MYC genes allows a precise assignment of patients for risk-adapted stratification. It also allows comparison to results of study cohorts in the past and provides a robust basis for further treatment refinement. .",Non-systematic-review
516,1649899,The Journal of general virology,High resolution in situ hybridization to determine the cellular distribution of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus RNA in the tissues of persistently infected mice: relevance to arenavirus disease and mechanisms of viral persistence.,"By the application of in situ hybridization to thin sections of paraffin-embedded tissues we have been able to determine with high resolution the cell types containing lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleic acid in the tissues of persistently infected mice. We confirm and extend previous observations of virus persistence in the brain, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, thyroid and reticuloendothelial system. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time persistence of viral nucleic acid in specific cell types in the thymus, lymph nodes, testes and bladder, and the adrenal, parathyroid and salivary glands; the cell types infected were observed in several animals. In lymphoid tissue, viral nucleic acid was predominantly located in the T cell-dependent areas of the spleen and lymph nodes; it was also present in cells of the thymic medulla. This has important implications for the deficiency in T cell function observed in persistently infected mice. In the testes, viral nucleic acid was detected in spermatogonia but not differentiating spermatocytes and therefore, in this tissue at least, persistence is related to the state of differentiation of the cell. Endocrine and exocrine dysfunctions have been described in persistently infected mice and we report that the highest levels of viral nucleic acid were found in the adrenal gland. The infection of endocrine and exocrine tissue was not pantropic, specific cell types expressed viral nucleic acid in each tissue. In the adrenal cortex, cells of the zona reticularis and zona fasciculata but not the zona glomerulosa were positive, whereas in the adrenal medulla viral nucleic acid was predominantly localized to adrenalin-secreting cells. Infection of the renal tubules, transitional epithelium of the bladder and the ducts of the salivary gland indicates the likely sites of virus production for the dissemination of arenavirus infections.",Animal-other
517,18579121,Brain research,Mobility decline of unknown origin in mild cognitive impairment: an MRI-based clinical study of the pathogenesis.,"Mobility dysfunction of unknown origin predicts dementia in the elderly and is associated with periventricular leukoaraiosis (LA), another predictor of dementia of still controversial pathogenesis, in the elderly with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Thus, this study examined which gait and balance parameters best correlate with periventricular LA to better understand the pathogenesis of mobility decline in MCI. High resolution MRI and detailed mobility assessment were performed in 61 subjects (72 years+/-5) with MCI. Cognitive assessment included Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and the Trail Making test part B (TMB). Mobility assessment included reports of falls in the previous 6-month period, the walking while talking test, the timed 'up and go test' (TUG), measurement of fast gait speed, the standing test and the one-leg standing test. There was an association between marked periventricular LA and slow postural changes, slow gait (TUG and gait speed), altered balance (standing test and one-leg standing test), altered walking while talking test. But after adjusting for age and ventriculomegaly on a logistic multiple regression model, performance on the TUG test was the only clinical predictor of periventricular LA (>10 s, P=0.002). Poorer TUG performances were more frequent with vascular than Alzheimer's disease-like profiles on the FCSRT and TMB tests (P=0.01). In conclusion, the clinical profile of patients demonstrating a main MR brain correlate of mobility dysfunction supports a main pathomechanism of subtle vascular extrapyramidal dysfunction in MCI.",Remaining

Internet-based depression prevention approaches are found to be effective but they were mostly evaluated in a Western context. Grasping the Opportunity is a Chinese Internet intervention, which was translated and modified from CATCH-IT developed in the West. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Grasp the Opportunity in reducing depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents.	In this randomized controlled trial, Chinese adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms were recruited from three secondary schools in Hong Kong. The participants (n = 257) were randomly assigned to receive either intervention or attention control. The primary outcome was the improvement in depressive symptoms according to the revised Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-R) at the 12-month follow-up. Analyses were performed using intention to treat (ITT).	The participants were randomly assigned to receive the intervention (n = 130) or attention control (n = 127). Follow-up data were obtained from 250 (97%) participants. Only 26 (10%) participants completed the intervention. Compared to the attention control, Grasp the Opportunity led to reductions in depressive symptoms at the 12-month follow-up with a medium effect size using ITT analysis (mean difference 2.6, 95% CI 0.59-5.55, effect size d = 0.36).	Grasp the Opportunity is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents over a long follow-up period.

While disease-modifying treatment, such as hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), may decrease this risk, it has not been systematically investigated in children with SCD. We screened neurocognitive functioning in 103 adolescents with SCD (16-17 years, 50% female) and compared outcomes between patients with a history of exposure to hydroxycarbamide (n = 12 HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia; n = 52 HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia) and those never treated with hydroxycarbamide (n = 31 HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia; n = 8 HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia). Demographic distributions were similar between the groups. After adjusting for socioeconomic status, the hydroxycarbamide group had significantly higher scores on nonverbal IQ (HbSC/HbSβ thalassaemia: P = 0·036, effect size [d] = 0·65), reaction speed (HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia: P = 0·002, d = 1·70), sustained attention (HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia: P = 0·014, d = 1·30), working memory (HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia: P = 0·034, d = 0·71) and verbal memory (HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia: P = 0·038, d = 0·84) when compared to those who did not receive hydroxycarbamide. In patients with HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia, longer treatment duration with hydroxycarbamide was associated with better verbal memory (P = 0·009) and reading (P = 0·002). Markers of hydroxycarbamide effect, including higher fetal haemoglobin (HbF), higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and lower white blood cell count (WBC), were associated with better verbal fluency (HbF: P = 0·014, MCV: P = 0·006, WBC: P = 0·047) and reading (MCV: P = 0·021, WBC: P = 0·037).

Firstly, results revealed superior disembedding for children with ASD, irrespective of the type of target or embedding context, although the ASD group took more time in both the M-EFT and D-EFT. Secondly, the number of target lines continuing into the context proved more of a hindrance for the controls. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence to support the notion of superior disembedding in ASD.",Remaining

In recent years, many studies have focused on the mechanism(s) of PQ neurotoxicity. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of manganese (III) meso-tetrakis (N,N'-diethylimidazolium) porphyrin (MnTDM), a superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic, on PQ-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in 1RB3AN27 (N27) cells, a dopaminergic neuronal cell line. The results indicated that MnTDM significantly attenuated PQ-induced loss of cell viability, glutathione depletion, and reactive oxygen species production. MnTDM also ameliorated PQ-induced morphological nuclear changes of apoptosis and increased rates of apoptosis. In addition, our data provide direct evidence that MnTDM suppressed PQ-induced caspase-3 cleavage, possibly a key event of PQ neurotoxicity. These observations suggested that oxidative stress and apoptosis are implicated in PQ-induced neurotoxicity and this toxicity could be prevented by MnTDM. These findings also proposed a novel therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease and other disorders associated with oxidative stress.",In-vitro-study

The pathological changes of brain were observed under light microscope and the brain edema was detected by wet weight/dry weight rations.	The I-V, III-V of BAEP wave inter peak latency (IPL) in MTBI group increased immediately in 15 minutes after injury. The III, V wave peak latency (PL) and I-V, III-V wave IPL became longer than the pre-trauma level in 6, 12 h post-injury (P<0.05). The III, V wave PL and I - III, I - V, III - V wave IPL became longer than the pre-trauma level in 1, 2 d after injury (P < 0.001), the BAEP retuned to normal level in 14 d after brain injury. At 15 minutes after injury, the water content in brain increased and met its peak in 1 d, decreased gradually in 4 d, then decreased slowly and returned to normal level in 10 d after injury.

We screened clinical records of individuals living in the London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth who were referred to the early intervention services before (from 1/3/2019 to 28/2/2020) and during (from 1/3/2020 to 28/2/2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the Office for National Statistics to determine the population at risk. We computed crude and sex-age standardised FEP incidence per 100,000 person-years. We used Poisson regression to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) across the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 321 incident cases of FEP were identified during the COVID-19 pandemic, accounting for a crude rate of 69.8 (95% CI 62.1-77.4) per 100,000 person-years. The crude rate for the year before was 47.5 (95% CI 41.2-53.8). The incidence variation between the two years accounted for an adjusted IRR of 1.45 (95% CI 1.22-1.72).

524,21294942,The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,"Stability of prepulse inhibition and habituation of the startle reflex in schizophrenia: a 6-year follow-up study of initially antipsychotic-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients.","Deficits in information processing appear to be core features in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) and habituation of the startle reflex are operational measures of early information processing. Impaired PPI in schizophrenia has been replicated in many studies and is regarded as an endophenotype for schizophrenia. However, reports on the stability of PPI over a longer period of time are lacking, both for patients with schizophrenia and for healthy subjects. The current study examined 25 initially drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients and 23 healthy matched controls. Three PPI measures [stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) 30, 60, 120 ms] and habituation were assessed at baseline, and again after 6 yr. Sixteen patients and 17 healthy controls completed the study, and 13 patients and 17 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. The schizophrenia patients had PPI deficits compared to controls at baseline. After 6 yr, no significant group differences were found. PPI had increased significantly in the patients and had decreased significantly in controls. In addition, patients showed significantly less habituation than controls while habituation did not change in patients or controls. The present results show that PPI in drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients can improve significantly over time. As PPI increased in patients over the same period that it decreased in controls, it is likely that the increase was caused by disease-related factors such as disease process, clinical state, or medication.",Remaining

Parents of children with both seizure disorder and intellectual disability stated the highest constraints in daily life, regarding friends, hobbies, emotional pressure, occupation, partnership, habitation, and financial burden. Due to diagnosis of seizure or developmental disorder, 155/307 (51%) parents reduced their working hours/stopped working, 62/307 (20%) changed their habitation, and 46/307 (15%) broke up. As judged by parents, 148/317 (47%) children are being discriminated against, even own family/friends and educators are held responsible.	Parents perceive changes in their daily life and discrimination of their children due to their children's seizure and developmental disorders. An intellectual disability combined with seizure disorder caused the highest constraint. What is Known: • Seizure and/or developmental disorders of children may adversely influence quality of life for affected parents. • Caring for a child with special health care needs can take complete attention and own parental needs may therefore be difficult to meet. What is New: • Two out of three parents stated changes of their daily life such as quitting work, change of habitation, or breakup of partnership due to their child's diagnosis. • As judged by the parents, one in two children with developmental disorder of any kind is being discriminated against, even teachers and own family are held responsible.",Remaining

While amyloid deposition has been noted within atrial appendages, the incidence and significance remains incompletely understood. More accurate amyloid typing methodologies and targeted pharmacotherapeutics have recently been developed, prompting pathologists to provide more detailed information about the type of amyloid identified in such samples. This study sought to fully characterize the morphologic characteristics of atrial amyloid as well as its incidence and clinical significance. Tissue archives were queried for atrial appendages removed during the cardiac surgeries (2010-2014). Patient demographics, imaging features, and salient clinical findings were recorded. Pattern and extent of amyloid deposition were recorded. Typing of the amyloid protein, when present, was performed on a subset of cases by laser capture microdissection with mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. A total of 383 atrial appendages from 345 consecutive patients were included in the study (mean age, 69 years; range, 26-92 years). Amyloid was present in 46% of patients. A linear relationship was observed between age and presence of atrial amyloidosis. Women were more likely to have atrial amyloidosis. Two distinct morphologies of amyloid were observed: filamentous and nonfilamentous, and correlated perfectly with amyloid type (filamentous = AANF-type amyloid; nonfilamentous = ATTR-type amyloid). Filamentous deposits were observed in 91% of those with amyloid. Amyloid was more likely to be found in the left atrial appendage than the right. Patients with atrial amyloid, irrespective of type, were more likely to have experienced stroke or TIA and more likely to have atrial arrhythmia preoperatively. Postoperatively, those with atrial amyloid are more likely to experience recurrence of arrhythmia than those who did not have atrial amyloid. Understanding the morphologic characteristics of AANF-type amyloid will allow for identification by the light microscopy and obviates the need for expensive ancillary typing techniques. The finding of nonfilamentous amyloid, should still prompt confirmation of amyloid type so that targeted therapy may be employed.",Remaining

535,28566233,Molecular genetics and metabolism,Expanding the genetic cause of multiple sulfatase deficiency: A novel SUMF1 variant in a patient displaying a severe late infantile form of the disease.,"Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by defective cellular sulfatases. Activity of sulfatases depends on post-translational modification catalyzed by formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), encoded by the SUMF1 gene. SUMF1 pathologic variants cause MSD, a syndrome presenting with a complex phenotype. We describe the first Polish patient with MSD caused by a yet undescribed pathologic variant c.337G>A [p.Glu113Lys] (i.e. p.E113K) in heterozygous combination with the known deletion allele c.519+5_519+8del [p.Ala149_Ala173del]. The clinical picture of the patient initially suggested late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy, with developmental delay followed by regression of visual, hearing and motor abilities as the most apparent clinical symptoms. Transient signs of ichthyosis and minor dysmorphic features guided the laboratory workup towards MSD. Since MSD is a rare disease and there is a variable clinical spectrum, we thoroughly describe the clinical outcome of our patient. The FGE-E113K variant, expressed in cell culture, correctly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum but was retained intracellularly in contrast to the wild type FGE. Analysis of FGE-mediated activation of steroid sulfatase in immortalized MSD cells revealed that FGE-E113K exhibited only approx. 15% of the activity of wild type FGE. Based on the crystal structure we predict that the exchange of glutamate-113 against lysine should induce a strong destabilization of the secondary structure, possibly affecting the folding for correct disulfide bridging between C235-C346 as well as distortion of the active site groove that could affect both the intracellular stability as well as the activity of FGE.

For future clinical trials quantitative data on disease progression rates are essential. Moreover, diagnosis can be challenging in ALD women, as the most important diagnostic biomarker is normal in 15-20%. Better biomarkers are needed. The purpose of this single centre cross-sectional follow-up study in women with ALD was to assess whether Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), AMC Linear Disability Scale (ALDS) and Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) can detect disease progression and to model the effect of age and duration of symptoms on the rate of progression. Moreover, we performed a pilot study to assess if a semi-targeted lipidomics approach can identify possible new diagnostic biomarkers.	In this study 46 women (baseline clinical data published by our group previously) were invited for a follow-up visit. Newly identified women at our center were also recruited. We analysed 65 baseline and 34 follow-up assessments. Median time between baseline and follow-up was 7.8 years (range 6.4-8.7). Mean age at baseline was 49.2 ± 14.2 years, at follow-up 55.4 ± 10.1. EDSS increased significantly (+ 0.08 points/year), but the other outcome measures did not. Increasing age and duration of symptoms were associated with more disability. For the pilot study we analysed plasma of 20 ALD women and 10 controls with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, which identified 100 potential biomarker ratios with strong differentiating properties and non-overlapping data distributions between ALD women and controls.	Progression of spinal cord disease can be detected with EDSS, but not with ALDS or SF-36 after a follow-up period of almost 8 years. Moreover, age and the duration of symptoms seem positively associated with the rate of progression. Although a significant progression was measurable, it was below the rate generally conceived as clinically relevant. Therefore, EDSS, ALDS and SF-36 are not suitable as primary outcome measures in clinical trials for spinal cord disease in ALD women. In addition, a semi-targeted lipidomics approach can identify possible new diagnostic biomarkers for women with ALD.",Remaining

Participants were 6 nurses and 7 nursing technicians working in emergency and hospitalization. Data collection was performed using semi-structured interviews and organized into thematic categories. Participants considered psychiatric emergencies as situations that may threat their own lives or that of others. The emergency characteristics they mentioned were: aggressive and agitated behavior, suicide attempt and substance abuse. The first impression of the patient's behavior and an attempt to have conversation determine the conducts adopted by the professionals. They recognize their difficulty and lack of preparation to approach the patient.

Regardless of rat sex, with the disease development xanthine oxidase (XO) activity and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression increased in spinal cord, whereas glutathione levels decreased. This was accompanied by the rise in spinal cord malondialdehyde level. On the other hand, with EAE development superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased, while O2[-] concentration increased only in spinal cord of male rats. Consequently, SOD activity was lower, whereas O2[-] concentration was higher in spinal cord of male rats with clinically manifested EAE. XO activity and iNOS mRNA expression were also elevated in their spinal cord. Consistently, in the effector phase of EAE the concentration of advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) was higher in spinal cord of male rats, which exhibit more severe neurological deficit than their female counterparts. In as much as data obtained in the experimental models could be translated to humans, the findings may be relevant for designing sex-specific antioxidant therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the study indicated that the increased pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance in plasma may be an early indicator of EAE development. Moreover, it showed that plasma AOPP level may indicate not only actual activity of the disease, but also serve to predict severity of its course.",Animal-other

The level of lipoperoxide (LPO) in the erythrocytes of SHRSP loaded with salt for 22 days was significantly higher than that of the controls. Idebenone treatment (30 mg/kg per day, p.o.) markedly decreased the LPO to the level of the controls. Hemolysis in SHRSP was accelerated by the salt-loading. Idebenone significantly inhibited the hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner.

In contrast to migraine headache, there has been limited focus on tension-type headache. Most patients with the chronic form of tension-type headache, which affects 3% of the population, are left virtually without any specific treatment. Chronic tension-type headache differs from the episodic form in frequency, lack of effect to most treatment strategies, more medication overuse, and more loss of quality of life. Daily or near daily headaches also constitute a major diagnostic and therapeutic problem and distinguishing chronic tension-type headache from migraine headache and from medication-induced headache is a substantial diagnostic challenge because management strategies are completely different. Considerable benefits for the society can be gained by specific strategies leading to reductions in the amount of sickness absence and impaired working abilities. The burden on the affected patients' and their families' quality of life also may be improved by a general acceptance of the disorder and by the development of a specific treatment strategy.",Non-systematic-review

Several proteases released by invading tumor cells seem to participate in the focal degradation of extracellular matrix proteins. Using enzymatic assays, Western blotting, and Northern blotting techniques, we investigated whether cathepsin B level was associated with malignant grade in seven human glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B activity and protein content levels were higher in glioblastoma cell lines than in anaplastic astrocytoma or low-grade glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B transcripts were overexpressed in glioblastoma cell lines relative to their expression in anaplastic astrocytoma and low-grade glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B promoter activity and amount of SP-1 complexes were much higher in glioblastoma cell lines than in anaplastic astrocytoma or low-grade glioma cell lines. Finally, E-64, an inhibitor of cathepsin B, inhibited both cathepsin B enzymatic activity and the invasiveness of glioblastoma cell lines. These results strongly support a role for cathepsin B in glioblastoma cell lines and suggest that inhibition of cathepsin B activity may be proven useful in cancer therapy.",In-vitro-study

A retrospective cohort study using a Medicaid claims database was conducted. Patients hospitalized for an AMI and subsequently filling a prescription for an ACE inhibitor were followed longitudinally for the occurrence of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality. A subanalysis was also conducted to account for switching/discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy. Stepwise (forward conditional) Cox-proportional hazards models were used to analyze the effect of tissue selectivity on study outcomes.	The final study sample consisted of 689 AMI and the results indicated that tissue-selective ACE inhibitors had a protective effect against hospitalization due to stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.265; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.101-0.698). A similar lower rate in hospitalizations due to heart failure was observed in the group using tissue-selective ACE inhibitors; however, the results were not statistically significant (HR = 0.681; 95% CI = 0.436-1.063). A protective effect was also observed on the combined outcome of hospitalization due to any cardiovascular condition (HR = 0.712; 95% CI = 0.536-0.945). Hospitalizations due to recurrent AMI, need for coronary revascularization procedures, and mortality were not significantly different between patients using tissue-selective and non-tissue-selective ACE inhibitors. The completer subanalysis provided similar findings regarding the impact of tissue selectivity on study outcomes.	Tissue-selective ACE inhibitors may have a protective effect against hospitalization due to stroke/TIA or heart failure when compared to non-tissue-selective ACE inhibitors for patients following AMI.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

This study investigated whether autonomic hypoarousal and hyporesponsivity, which have been observed in antisocial individuals of all ages, are passed from fathers to male offspring.	The study included 44 boys with early-onset conduct disorder and 36 healthy controls (8 to 13 years old) together with their biological fathers. Resting heart rate and nonspecific skin conductance fluctuations were assessed as arousal measurements, with electrodermal responses and heart rate changes to pictorial stimuli serving as response measurements. In addition, boys and fathers were subjected to psychometric measurements of antisocial behavior.	The fathers of boys with CD showed significantly lower electrodermal responses to pictures of either emotional quality than the fathers of controls (p between.015 and < .001), and they revealed fewer nonspecific skin conductance fluctuations (p = .001). In addition, they reported a more aggressive, hostile, and impulsive behavioral style. Psychophysiological measurements were highly correlated between fathers and sons (p between .007 and < .001), and fathers' autonomic responses accounted for group differences in electrodermal responses between boys (p < .001).	The fathers of boys with conduct disorder exhibited an abnormal psychophysiological response pattern similar to that of their sons. High father-son correlations in psychophysiological measures raise the question of whether autonomic abnormalities may constitute a biological mediator through which the disposition for antisocial behavior is transmitted within families.",Remaining

545,29759891,Sleep medicine reviews,"The putative role of oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathophysiology of sleep dysfunction across neuropsychiatric disorders: Focus on chronic fatigue syndrome, bipolar disorder and multiple sclerosis.","Sleep and circadian abnormalities are prevalent and burdensome manifestations of diverse neuro-immune diseases, and may aggravate the course of several neuropsychiatric disorders. The underlying pathophysiology of sleep abnormalities across neuropsychiatric disorders remains unclear, and may involve the inter-play of several clinical variables and mechanistic pathways. In this review, we propose a heuristic framework in which reciprocal interactions of immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and mitochondrial pathways may drive sleep abnormalities across potentially neuroprogressive disorders. Specifically, it is proposed that systemic inflammation may activate microglial cells and astrocytes in brain regions involved in sleep and circadian regulation. Activated glial cells may secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (for example, interleukin-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha), nitric oxide and gliotransmitters, which may influence the expression of key circadian regulators (e.g., the Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) gene). Furthermore, sleep disruption may further aggravate oxidative and nitrosative, peripheral immune activation, and (neuro) inflammation across these disorders in a vicious pathophysiological loop. This review will focus on chronic fatigue syndrome, bipolar disorder, and multiple sclerosis as exemplars of neuro-immune disorders. We conclude that novel therapeutic targets exploring immune and oxidative & nitrosative pathways (p.e. melatonin and molecular hydrogen) hold promise in alleviating sleep and circadian dysfunction in these disorders.",Non-systematic-review
546,21714358,Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences,The efficacy of psychotherapy in reducing post-psychotic trauma.,"There is now growing evidence to suggest that the experience of psychosis may be so traumatic for some that it can lead to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)-type symptoms or post-psychotic trauma symptoms (PPTS). There is, however, less knowledge about what psychological interventions may be helpful in reducing these symptoms. Evidence from the literature, to date, suggests that of the seven studies that have addressed this issue only four were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, all these studies included less than 100 patients with the vast majority reporting positive results. Overall, it seems that although cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT)-based psychological interventions appear to be efficacious in the treatment of PPTS, the studies are too small to draw any firm conclusions and should be subjected to larger good-quality RCTs. Further research will also need to establish the role of mediating variables such as shame and depression in the treatment of PPTS.",Non-systematic-review

In this study, the lack of toxicity to normal brain when single source allogeneic CTLs were intracranially administered multiple times is documented. Additionally, the efficacy and lack of toxicity of allogeneic CTLs from multiple sources, each given once is documented. CTLs sensitized to Fischer antigen were prepared from major histocompatibility complex incompatible DA, PVG, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Furth rat lymphocytes. CTLs from multiple donors were administered one time each to Fischer rats bearing established 9L tumor at staggered intervals over a two week period and survival was monitored in relation to a sham treated group. Additional groups of nontumor-bearing rats received either multiple source allogeneic CTLs or single source DA anti Fischer CTLs in the same treatment regimen. Histological evaluation of the nontumor-bearing brains receiving either single or multiple source allogeneic CTL infusions showed minimal localized brain damage confined to the cannulation tract. No neuronal loss or inflammatory reaction was seen either adjacent to or remote from the administration site. Brains from the long-term survivors of the tumor-bearing animals showed no residual neoplasm; the instillation site had focal sterile abscesses; gliosis and neuronal loss did not extend into adjacent brain. The safety and potential of chronic, local allogeneic CTL administration, derived from multiple donors, as adjuvant local therapy for brain tumors was demonstrated.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

Older adults were recruited from the waiting rooms of 2 geriatrics outpatient clinics for face-to-face interviews regarding their interest in being screened for MCI. A short description of MCI adapted from The Alzheimer's Association's 'Fact Sheet' was presented before asking about MCI testing. Multivariable ordinal regression was used to account for heavily skewed outcome data showing very high levels of interest in screening for MCI. The strongest, most consistent correlate across all of the intention measures was the desire to know as early as possible if one has Alzheimer disease. Another robust correlate was having had normal memory testing in the past. Older adults appear to have psychologically connected MCI to Alzheimer disease, but how well they understand this connection is not known and requires further study.",Remaining

550,15956992,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Constitutively active micro opioid receptors mediate the enhanced conditioned aversive effect of naloxone in morphine-dependent mice.,"Naloxone administration produces a robust conditioned place aversion (CPA) in opiate-naive rodents by blocking the action of enkephalins at mu opioid receptors. This aversive response is potentiated by prior exposure to morphine. In vitro studies indicate that morphine treatment may promote constitutive activity of mu opioid receptors. We hypothesized that such enhanced constitutive activity in vivo may underlie the increased aversive property of naloxone by uncovering the inverse agonist property of this drug. The CPA produced by naloxone was compared with that produced by the neutral antagonists 6-alpha- and 6-beta-naloxol in mice with and without prior morphine exposure. While all three drugs produced CPA, only naloxone CPA was enhanced by morphine given 20 h prior to each naloxone injection. Furthermore, only naloxone produced withdrawal jumping when given 20 h after morphine, even though 6-alpha-naloxol was able to produce jumping when given 4 h after morphine. These data suggest that morphine may enhance naloxone CPA by increasing levels of constitutively active mu receptors and further support the role of such constitutive activity in mediating naloxone-precipitated physical withdrawal. Such long-term changes in constitutive activity of the mu receptor induced by exogenous opiate exposure may thus be an important factor in hedonic homeostatic dysregulation proposed to underlie the addictive process.",Animal-drug-intervention

This study examines this relationship by applying network analysis to a large sample collected at 18-months follow-up in a longitudinal dataset.	One thousand four hundred and eighty-six college students were recruited and completed a set of self-reported questionnaires on empathy, schizotypy, depression, anxiety and stress. Networks were constructed by taking the subscale scores of these measures as nodes and partial correlations between each pair of nodes as edges. Network Comparison Tests were performed to investigate the differences between individuals with high and low schizotypy.	Cognitive and affective empathy were strongly connected with negative schizotypy in the network. Physical and social anhedonia showed high centrality measured by strength, closeness and betweenness while anxiety and stress showed high expected influence. Predictability ranged from 22.4% (personal distress) to 79.9% (anxiety) with an average of 54.4%. Compared with the low schizotypy group, the high schizotypy group showed higher global strength (S = 0.813, p < 0.05) and significant differences in network structure (M = 0.531, p < 0.001) and strength of edges connecting empathy with schizotypy (adjusted ps < 0.05).	Only self-rating scales were used, and disorganized schizotypy was not included.	Our findings suggest that the cognitive and affective components of empathy and dimensions of schizotypy are closely related in the general population and their network interactions may play an important role in individuals with high schizotypy.",Remaining

However, considerably less attention is devoted to the impact of exercise on health outcomes for people experiencing a mental illness. In response to the recognized paucity, a structured exercise program was developed and implemented for residents of a Community Care Unit in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Six residents participated in the program over a period of three months. This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study. A focus group interview was conducted with the resident participants (n=6), the exercise physiologists who developed and implemented the program (n=2), and nursing staff involved in implementing and supporting the program (n=4). Analysis of the data collected revealed that four main themes had emerged: the individual nature of the program, physical improvement, group dynamics, and future plans. The findings of this study suggest that involvement in the program produced very positive outcomes, most notably in the physical fitness of residents. The individual nature of the program which enabled gradual participation, and the cohesive approach of the group as a whole were considered very important factors contributing to the overall success. Furthermore, the participants planned to continue with some form of physical activity in the future.

The EncephalApp Stroop test is validated for its screening. The aim of the study was to define Tunisian norms for the test based on healthy controls norms and to estimate the prevalence of CHE in cirrhotic Tunisian patients. Methods: A prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted. Ambulatory or hospitalized cirrhotic patients aged 40 years and over were recruited at 11 centers. Healthy subjects aged 40 years and over were recruited at 8 centers. We used a translated Arabic version of the streamlined EncephalApp Stroop test. The task has two components: 'Off' and 'On' state depending on the discordance or concordance of the stimuli. Results: 142 patients were included. The mean age was 57.26 years [40-86]. 40 (28.17%) of cirrhotic patients who were included were diagnosed as having a minimal hepatic encephalopathy or CHE. Among the ineligible patients, 22 had overt hepatic encephalopathy. If we consider these patients, the overall prevalence rate of CHE was around 24.39% in cirrhotic patients. It was more frequent in women (34.21% vs 25.96%), and in patients whose level of school education is between 6 and 13 years. Its prevalence does not appear to be affected by gender, MELD score, etiology of cirrhosis and age group of patients, as these variables were independent with respective p according to the chi-square test 0.413; 0.736; 0.663 and 0.1. The stroop times (On / Off and On + Off) correlated significantly with each other, are associated significantly and positively with age (respective Pearson coefficients: 0.578; 0.567 and 0.6). The more the age increases, the more the stroop response times increases (p > 10 [-3]).

Furthermore to study the consequences of pain and to identify pain-exacerbating and pain-relieving factors.	In a national survey, fifty-five adolescents with spinal muscular atrophy and dystrophinopathy completed a questionnaire assessing pain frequency, duration, location using a body map, intensity and discomfort using visual analogue scales, pain interference using a modified version of Brief Pain Inventory and factors exacerbating and relieving pain.	Sixty-nine per cent of the adolescents reported pain during the past three months and 50% reported chronic pain. The pain prevalence did not differ significantly between diagnostic groups or between ambulators and non-ambulators. The average pain intensity was graded as mild and the worst pain as moderate. The pain typically occurred weekly, most frequently in the neck/back or legs. General activity and mood were the areas that were most affected by pain. Common pain-exacerbating factors were sitting, too much movement/activity and being lifted or transferred.	Pain is a frequent problem in adolescents with spinal muscular atrophy and dystrophinopathy.

We furthermore tested univariate and multivariate associations between brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and mental health. Our results showed a significant multivariate relationship between IDPs and mental health, which was replicable. Conversely, effect sizes for individual IDPs were small. Test-retest reliability of IDPs was stronger for measures of brain structure than for measures of brain function.

This study assessed which factors contribute to pediatric QoL 6 and 18 months post-recruitment in 159 participants (mTBI = 52; orthopedic injury [OI] = 43; typically developing controls [TDC] = 64) aged 18 to 60 months at the time of injury (M = 37.50, SD = 11.69). Family environment, injury characteristics, and child cognitive-behavioral functioning were assessed at 6 months via parent questionnaires and socio-cognitive assessment. QoL was determined using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory at both time points. Genetic information (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] genotype) was collected using saliva samples. Hierarchical regression analyses testing biological, family-environmental, injury and cognitive-behavioral factors revealed that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was a significant independent predictor of better QoL 6 months post-injury in the mTBI group. Lower parental distress significantly and independently predicted higher QoL 18 months after mTBI, and 6 months post-recruitment in the TDC group. At 18 months, models were non-significant for both control groups. Genetic factors involved in neuroplasticity may play an important role in recovery 6 months after mTBI and contribute to outcome via their interplay with environmental factors. Over time, family factors appear to become the primary determinants of post-mTBI outcome.",Remaining
562,34389509,Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry,Remote Collaborative Care With Off-Site Behavioral Health Care Managers: A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials.,"In the United States, most patients who require behavioral health care do not receive it owing to an overall shortage of behavioral health specialists. The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is a team-based, highly-coordinated approach to treating common mental health conditions in primary care that has a robust evidence base. Several recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams. As telehealth technology advances and uptake expands, understanding the evidence for remote CoCM becomes increasingly crucial to inform CoCM practice and implementation.	The objective of this study was to systematically review randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams in treating common psychiatric conditions in primary care and medical settings.	Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to structure our review. Our search strategy and development of search terms was informed by knowledge and review of the CoCM literature. Articles were reviewed by 3 authors, and once selected, they were sent to 2 authors for further data extraction to describe various study characteristics and process measures relating to remote CoCM.	The literature search identified 13,211 articles, 9 of which met inclusion criteria. The 9 studies collectively demonstrate effectiveness of remote CoCM in treating a range of behavioral health conditions (depression [n = 7], anxiety [n = 2], and PTSD [n = 1]), across various populations and settings. Sample sizes ranged from 191 patients to 704 patients, publication dates from 2004 to 2018, and studies were conducted from 2000 to 2014. Various process measures were also reported.	As the 9 studies included in our systematic review demonstrate, remote CoCM can be effective in treating a range of behavioral health conditions in various primary care and specialty medical settings. These findings suggest organizations may have more flexibility in building their CoCM team and drawing upon wider workforces than previously recognized. As recent shifts in telehealth policy and practice continue to motivate telehealth approaches, further research that can inform best practices for remote CoCM will be useful and valuable to those making organizational decisions when implementing integrated care models.",Human-systematic-review

Little is known about how obesity in children with ASD is being addressed in primary care. This article reports findings from a survey completed by 327 general pediatricians, which included a fictional clinical vignette and Likert-scales assessing attitudes, practices, self-efficacy, and barriers to obesity management. Although the majority of respondents agreed pediatricians should be the main providers to manage obesity in children with ASD, few reported receiving adequate training to do so. Pediatricians were more likely to refer to developmental-behavioral pediatricians and dietitians for a child with ASD compared to a child without ASD. Higher self-efficacy was associated with increased weight-related counseling frequency by pediatricians.",Remaining
564,33937974,Journal of clinical psychology,Incorporating narrative repair in the treatment of avoidant personality disorders: A case in point.,"Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) is characterized by multiple struggles, including shyness, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to interpersonal judgments. Research indicates that people with AvPD also show disturbances in narrative identity, which is an internal and evolving story created about the personal past, present, and presumed future. Here, the novel Guide for Narrative Repair (GNaR) recently developed by (Thomsen et al., 2020) is introduced as a potentially useful tool to help people with AvPD in crafting more adaptive narrative identities. The guide is brought to life via a case study analysis of Adam, a male outpatient suffering from AvPD. Consistent with the GNaR, disturbances in Adam's storied self are brought to light and ways to facilitate his narrative repair are proposed. We conclude with implications related to the case as well as the potential narrative turn in AvPD treatment.",Human-case-report

The diverse molecular heterogeneity in these rare tumors and inadequate tumor models have limited the development of effective therapies. In this issue of the JCI, Haase et al. produced a genetically engineered mouse model of H3.3-G34R-mutant pHGG to help identify vulnerabilities in DNA repair pathways. The authors designed a therapy that combined radiation with DNA damage response inhibitors to induce an adaptive immune response and extend survival. These findings suggest that combinations of small-molecule therapies with immunotherapies could drive a more durable response and improve mortality for patients with pHGG.",Animal-non-drug-intervention
566,28728096,European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,Early life stress explains reduced positive memory biases in remitted depression.,"There is contradictory evidence regarding negative memory biases in major depressive disorder (MDD) and whether these persist into remission, which would suggest their role as vulnerability traits rather than correlates of mood state. Early life stress (ELS), common in patients with psychiatric disorders, has independently been associated with memory biases, and confounds MDD versus control group comparisons. Furthermore, in most studies negative biases could have resulted from executive impairments rather than memory difficulties per se.	To investigate whether memory biases are relevant to MDD vulnerability and how they are influenced by ELS, we developed an associative recognition memory task for temporo-spatial contexts of social actions with low executive demands, which were matched across conditions (self-blame, other-blame, self-praise, other-praise). We included fifty-three medication-free remitted MDD (25 with ELS, 28 without) and 24 healthy control (HC) participants without ELS.	Only MDD patients with ELS showed a reduced bias (accuracy/speed ratio) towards memory for positive vs. negative materials when compared with MDD without ELS and with HC participants; attenuated positive biases correlated with number of past major depressive episodes, but not current symptoms. There were no biases towards self-blaming or self-praising memories.	This demonstrates that reduced positive biases in associative memory were specific to MDD patients with ELS rather than a general feature of MDD, and were associated with lifetime recurrence risk which may reflect a scarring effect. If replicated, our results would call for stratifying MDD patients by history of ELS when assessing and treating emotional memories.",Remaining
567,30550449,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,Technique of Fractionated Transcatheter Arterial Embolization for Treating Large Arteriovenous Malformation in Brain Functional Area.,"At present, large cranial function area arteriovenous malformation (fAVM) is mainly treated by craniotomy with a high risk of operation and high disability. In recent years, with the continuous improvement of the neural intervention technology, fractionated transcatheter arterial embolization (fTAE) may be used to treat the fAVM instead of surgical treatment. However, its effectiveness for treating fAVM has never been explored. The authors hypothesized that fTAE can be effective in the treatment of fTAE.	A retrospective study was conducted in 229 cases of large fAVM in multicenter hospitals. Among them, 103 cases were performed fTAE and the other 126 cases were carried on minimally invasive craniotomy (MIC). Clinically relevant symptomatic improvement and complications were compared between 2 groups.	Complete resection rate of arteriovenous malformation in MIC group (100%) was significantly higher than that of complete embolization rate in fTAE group (77.7%) (P = 0.000). However, the incidence of postoperative complications includes decreased limb muscle strength (P = 0.001), sensory loss of extremities (P = 0.003), visual field defect (P = 0.025) that were lower in fTAE group and remission rate of headache (P = 0.012) but not epilepsy (P = 0.952) was higher in fTAE group compared with that in MIC group. After 1 year follow-up, the rebleeding rate in the fTAE treatment group was 4.85%, higher than that in MIC group (0%) (P = 0.000).	Fractionated transcatheter arterial embolization therapy is beneficial for reducing the postoperative complications and preoperative symptoms of fAVM, but not for recurrence rate.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
568,27465265,Diabetes care,Pioglitazone Prevents Diabetes in Patients With Insulin Resistance and Cerebrovascular Disease.,"The Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke (IRIS) trial recently found that pioglitazone reduced risk for stroke and myocardial infarction in patients with insulin resistance but without diabetes who had had a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). This report provides detailed results on the metabolic effects of pioglitazone and the trial's prespecified secondary aim of diabetes prevention.	A total of 3,876 patients with recent ischemic stroke or TIA, no history of diabetes, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <126 mg/dL, and insulin resistance by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score >3.0 were randomly assigned to pioglitazone or placebo. Surveillance for diabetes onset during the trial was accomplished by periodic interviews and annual FPG testing.	At baseline, the mean FPG, HbA1c, insulin, and HOMA-IR were 98.2 mg/dL (5.46 mmol/L), 5.8% (40 mmol/mol), 22.4 μIU/mL, and 5.4, respectively. After 1 year, mean HOMA-IR and FPG decreased to 4.1 and 95.1 mg/dL (5.28 mmol/L) in the pioglitazone group and rose to 5.7 and 99.7 mg/dL (5.54 mmol/L), in the placebo group (all P < 0.0001). Over a median follow-up of 4.8 years, diabetes developed in 73 (3.8%) participants assigned to pioglitazone compared with 149 (7.7%) assigned to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48 [95% CI 0.33-0.69]; P < 0.0001). This effect was predominately driven by those with initial impaired fasting glucose (FPG >100 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L]; HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.30-0.57]) or elevated HbA1c (>5.7% [39 mmol/mol]; HR 0.46 [0.34-0.62]).	Among patients with insulin resistance but without diabetes who had had a recent ischemic stroke or TIA, pioglitazone decreased the risk of diabetes while also reducing the risk of subsequent ischemic events. Pioglitazone is the first medication shown to prevent both progression to diabetes and major cardiovascular events as prespecified outcomes in a single trial.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention

This population-based study was based on an analysis of data collected by the Neonatal Research Network of Japan from 2003 to 2015 of neonates weighing 1,500 g or less at birth, from gestational ages of 24 0/7 to 31 6/7 weeks of gestation. After propensity score matching, univariate logistic and interaction analyses were performed to compare short-term (neonatal period) and medium-term (3 years of age) outcomes of the children of mothers who received antenatal corticosteroids with those of children of mothers who did not receive antenatal corticosteroids. We focused on differences between singletons and twins, between monochorionic and dichorionic twins and between the first and second twin.	The study comprised 23,502 singletons and 6,546 twins. Antenatal corticosteroid treatment was associated with significant decreased short-term neurologic outcomes in both singletons and twins. However, antenatal corticosteroid treatment was associated with significantly decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.53-0.70), respiratory distress syndrome (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67-0.76), and cerebral palsy (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) in singletons but not in twins (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68-1.17; OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87-1.12; and OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61-1.11, respectively). No association was found between chorionicity and the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on outcomes. Further, no association was found between birth order and the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on outcomes, except for periventricular leukomalacia and necrotizing enterocolitis (interaction: P=.02 and P=.04, respectively).	Antenatal corticosteroid treatment in twins was associated with a beneficial effect on short-term neurologic outcomes only, without improvement in other short-term and medium-term outcomes. There was no difference related to chorionicity.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Wistar rats were subjected to BCCAo procedure under anaesthesia to induce VaD. The rats were subjected to Morris water maze (MWM) test (6th day onwards post-surgery). MWM test was employed to assess learning and memory of the animals whereby escape latency time, time spent in target quadrant and Path length (distance travelled) taken as important parameters. Serum nitrite level; Brain thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels; Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; brain Myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and neutrophil count were estimated as per standard procedures. BCCAo in rats produced a significant vascular endothelial dysfunction, as reflected by decrease in serum nitrite levels. Further, these animals showed poor performance on MWM, depicting impairment of learning and memory. There was a significant rise in brain oxidative stress level as indicated by increase in TBARS and decrease in GSH levels. An increase in brain AChE activity was also observed. Moreover, these rats also exhibited an increase in MPO activity and neutrophil infiltration in brain (as marker of inflammation). Treatment of Carnosine (200 and 400 mg/kg, i.p.)/Donepezil (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) ameliorated BCCAo-induced memory deficits; endothelial dysfunction; biochemical and histopathological changes. It is concluded that Carnosine has shown efficacy in rat model of BCCAo-induced VaD and can be considered as an important therapeutic agent for the treatment of VaD.",Animal-drug-intervention
571,12472824,Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,Women's experiences of hospital admission.,The primary aim of this study was to examine women's experiences of inpatient psychiatric services. A secondary aim was to use the emerging themes in service planning and to develop an evaluation tool. Focus groups and individual interviews with women in receipt of psychiatric services in Croydon were used. The findings suggest continuity with both negative and positive aspects of institutional care described before the policy of community care was introduced. The attempts to 'normalize' institutional care by desegregating wards appear rather to have compounded problems faced by women. Women were clear about what they felt they wanted and needed. Women are dissatisfied about many aspects of care aside from the problems associated specifically with mixed sex wards. This suggests that sexual segregation of wards alone is a necessary but an insufficient measure to improve inpatient care. The findings can inform development of a women-only service in Croydon and of a tool to evaluate it.,Remaining

573,28867587,Neuroscience letters,Cerebellar pathology in childhood-onset vs. adult-onset essential tremor.,"Although the incidence of ET increases with advancing age, the disease may begin at any age, including childhood. The question arises as to whether childhood-onset ET cases manifest the same sets of pathological changes in the cerebellum as those whose onset is during adult life. We quantified a broad range of postmortem features (Purkinje cell [PC] counts, PC axonal torpedoes, a host of associated axonal changes [PC axonal recurrent collateral count, PC thickened axonal profile count, PC axonal branching count], heterotopic PCs, and basket cell rating) in 60 ET cases (11 childhood-onset and 49 adult-onset) and 30 controls. Compared to controls, childhood-onset ET cases had lower PC counts, higher torpedo counts, higher heterotopic PC counts, higher basket cell plexus rating, and marginally higher PC axonal recurrent collateral counts. The median PC thickened axonal profile count and median PC axonal branching count were two to five times higher in childhood-onset ET than controls, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Childhood-onset and adult-onset ET had similar PC counts, torpedo counts, heterotopic PC counts, basket cell plexus rating, PC axonal recurrent collateral counts, PC thickened axonal profile count and PC axonal branching count. In conclusion, we found that childhood-onset and adult-onset ET shared similar pathological changes in the cerebellum. The data suggest that pathological changes we have observed in the cerebellum in ET are a part of the pathophysiological cascade of events in both forms of the disease and that both groups seem to reach the same pathological endpoints at a similar age of death.",Remaining
574,27981399,AIDS and behavior,The Usefulness of the CRAFFT in Screening for Problematic Drug and Alcohol Use Among Youth Living with HIV.,"Substance use is highly prevalent among youth living with HIV (YLWH) and negatively impacts HIV care. This study sought to determine whether the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, and Trouble), designed to screen for problematic substance use, is reliably associated with substance use behaviors among YLWH. A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth (ages 12-26) were recruited through the adolescent medicine trials network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. Participants completed a self-administered survey. Over half screened positive on the CRAFFT (i.e., ≥2). Among frequent substance users, those older in age, behaviorally infected, with history of incarceration or unstably housed were more likely to screen positive on the CRAFFT. Study findings suggest that the CRAFFT reliably identifies youth who use substances. Thus, screening measures such as the CRAFFT should be utilized routinely in HIV clinical settings for youth.	El uso de sustancias entre jóvenes que viven con el VIH es muy prevalente y afecta negativamente el cuidado del VIH.

Una muestra transversal de 2216 jóvenes (edades 12-26) fueron reclutados a través del Adolescent Medicine Trials Network para Intervenciones contra el VIH/SIDA. Los participantes completaron una encuesta autoadministrada. Más de la mitad fueron seleccionados como positivos por el CRAFFT (es decir, ≥ 2). Entre los usuarios frecuentes de sustancias, los mayores de edad, los infectados por conducta en comparación con aquellos infectados perinatalmente, y aquellos con antecedentes de encarcelamiento y viviendas inestables fueron más propensos a resultados positivos en el CRAFFT. Los hallazgos del estudio sugieren que el CRAFFT identifica de manera fiable a los jóvenes que usan sustancias.

578,12759259,The American journal of pathology,Induction of pathogenic sets of genes in macrophages and neurons in NeuroAIDS.,"The etiology of the central nervous system (CNS) alterations after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, such as dementia and encephalitis, remains unknown. We have used microarray analysis in a monkey model of neuroAIDS to identify 98 genes, many previously unrecognized in lentiviral CNS pathogenesis, whose expression is significantly up-regulated in the frontal lobe of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected brains. Further, through immunohistochemical illumination, distinct classes of genes were found whose protein products localized to infiltrating macrophages, endothelial cells and resident glia, such as CD163, Glut5, and ISG15. In addition we found proteins induced in cortical neurons (ie, cyclin D3, tissue transglutaminase, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and STAT1), which have not previously been described as participating in simian immunodeficiency virus or HIV-related CNS pathology. This molecular phenotyping in the infected brains revealed pathways promoting entry of macrophages into the brain and their subsequent detrimental effects on neurons. These data support the hypothesis that in HIV-induced CNS disease products of activated macrophages and astrocytes lead to CNS dysfunction by directly damaging neurons, as well as by induction of altered gene and protein expression profiles in neurons themselves which are deleterious to their function.",Animal-other

Long-term alcohol use leads to an altered perioperative hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and immunity.	The aim of this study was to evaluate HPA intervention with low-dose ethanol, morphine, or ketoconazole on the neuroendocrine-immune axis and development of postoperative pneumonia in long-term alcoholic patients.	In this randomized, double-blind controlled study, 122 consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery for aerodigestive tract cancer were included. Long-term alcohol use was defined as consuming at least 60 g of ethanol daily and fulfilling the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence. Nonalcoholic patients were included but only as a descriptive control. Perioperative intervention with low-dose ethanol (0.5 g/kg body weight per day), morphine (15 mug/kg body weight per hour), ketoconazole (200 mg four times daily), and placebo was started on the morning before surgery and continued for 3 d after surgery. Blood samples to analyze the neuroendocrine-immune axis were obtained on the morning before intervention and on Days 1, 3, and 7 after surgery.	In long-term alcoholic patients, all interventions decreased postoperative hypercortisolism and prevented impairment of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte type 1:type 2 ratio. All interventions decreased the pneumonia rate from 39% to a median of 5.7% and shortened intensive care unit stay by 9 d (median) compared with the placebo-treated long-term alcoholic patients.	Intervention at the level of the HPA axis altered the immune response to surgical stress. This resulted in decreased postoperative pneumonia rates and shortened intensive care unit stay in long-term alcoholic patients.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention

Three clinical forms of Gaucher disease have been described: type 1 as non-neuronopathic, type 2 as acute neuronopathic, and type 3 as subacute neuronopathic. We recently identified a rare mutation (G-->A at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1604) [Choy et al., 1994a, Am J Med Genet 51:156-160] and a novel mutation (T-->G at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1366) in two type 1 Gaucher patients by sequence analysis of the entire glucocerebrosidase coding region [Choy et al., 1994a, 1994b, Hum Mol Genet 3:821-823]. To demonstrate that these are deleterious and not neutral mutations, we cloned the full-length glucocerebrosidase cDNA of patients and of a normal control in the plasmid vector pAcUW1, recombined the human gene into the Baculovirus genome downstream of its polyhedron p10 promoter, and expressed the inserted gene in cultured cells of Spodoptera frugiperda transfected by recombinant Baculovirus. The levels of residual glucocerebrosidase activity determined in transfected cells with the Gaucher G1604A and T1366G alleles are 6.9% and 2.9% of that expressed by the normal allele (normal = 352.0 nmol/hr/mg protein or 100%). By comparison, the enzyme-specific activity expressed in transfected cells by 2 known Gaucher alleles, A1226G and T1448C, that are prevalent in type 1 and type 2 Gaucher disease are 23.4% and 3.3% of normal. No endogeneous glucocerebrosidase activity was detected in cultured cells transfected by either the wild-type Baculovirus or Baculovirus with the pAcUW1 plasmid vector without the glucocerebrosidase cDNA insert. These findings show that the Baculovirus expression system in cultured Spodoptera frugiperda cells is a suitable system for the functional expression and characterization of the normal and mutant glucocerebrosidase alleles. Moreover, the use of this expression system demonstrates that the G1604A and T1366G mutations are both deleterious mutations resulting in profoundly deficient glucocerebrosidase activity and subsequent Gaucher disease.",In-vitro-study

One hundred-thirty-nine women were assessed during their third trimester of pregnancy and followed for 2, 4, 6, and 8 months postpartum for abuse status and depression symptoms. Predictors of postpartum depression were also assessed. Few women reported current abuse experiences, although 37% reported having lifetime physical or sexual abuse or both. Women with a lifetime history of abuse were 3.6-8.4 times more likely to experience postpartum depression than their nonabused peers at each measurement time. This effect steadily increases during the first 6 months after birth and decreases at the 8th month. These findings extend recent reports of the chronicity of abuse and have implications for care providers. The standard of care for abuse assessments may need to be expanded to include consideration of lifetime physical and sexual abuse experiences of pregnant and postpartum women.",Remaining

The Social Inclusion Questionnaire User Experience (SInQUE) is a new measure of social inclusion for mental health service users which assesses five domains (consumption, production, access to services, social integration and civil engagement). It has good psychometric properties and is acceptable to service users and mental health professionals. It is not clear whether individuals with different diagnostic conditions experience a similar reduction in social inclusion.	(1) Investigate whether current social inclusion differs between diagnostic groups (people with schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders, common mental disorder or personality disorder); (2) Identify factors associated with lower social inclusion; (3) Examine associations between social inclusion and stigma, quality of life and loneliness.	Mental health service users with psychotic disorder, personality disorder or common mental disorder, living in the community, completed the SInQUE, alongside other validated outcome measures. Multiple regression investigated associations.	About 192 service users (55% with psychotic disorder; 26% with common mental disorder; 19% with personality disorder). Current social inclusion did not vary according to diagnosis, except for the sub-domain of productivity, where individuals with personality disorder were more socially included than the other two groups. Lower social inclusion was associated with older age (p = .008), lack of higher education (p < .001), more previous admissions (p = .005), severity of current symptoms and greater experienced stigma (p = .006) and anticipated stigma (p = .035). Greater social inclusion was associated with better quality of life (p < .001) and less loneliness (p < .001).	Barriers to social inclusion in individuals with severe mental health problems include factors related to the illness, such as symptom severity and external factors, such as stigma and discrimination. Social inclusion is a recovery goal and should be routinely assessed. Increasing people's social inclusion benefits service users in terms of improved mental health, better quality of life and reduced loneliness.",Remaining

Here, we report an extremely rare cause of foot drop in a child, which if not recognized early, could lead to multiple complications.	A 6-year-old girl presented with difficulty in walking and left sided foot droop for1-month duration. On examination she had reduced muscle power in dorsiflexors and plantar flexors and diminished knee and absent ankle jerk in the left side. Sensory loss was noted in L4 and L5 dermatomes on the left side. Superficial abdominal reflex was absent on the left side while preserved in the right. Nerve conduction and electromyography revealed nerve root or spinal cord cause for the foot drop. These results prompted ordering MRI spine and brain which revealed Chiari malformation type-1 with holocord syrinx extending from the cervicomedullary junction to conus medullaris.	This case highlights the importance of considering broad differential diagnosis for foot drop and value of the complete neurological examination including superficial reflexes in arriving at a diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis helped to early neurosurgical referral and intervention which is an important prognostic factor.",Non-systematic-review

We hypothesized that the parenchymal abnormality on CTASI in faster scanners would overestimate ischemic core.	This prospective study assessed the correlation of Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on NCCT, CTASI, and computed tomography perfusion (CTP) with final infarct size in patients within 8 hours of AIS. Follow-up with NCCT or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 24 hours. Correlations of NCCT and CTASI with final infarct size and with CTP parameters were assessed. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients who underwent intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Inter-rater reliability was tested using Spearman's rank correlation. A P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.	A total of 105 patients were included in the final analysis. NCCT had a stronger correlation with the final infarct size than did CTASI (Spearman's ρ = .85 versus .78, P = .13). We found an overestimation of the final infarct size by CTASI in 47.6% of the cases, whereas NCCT underestimated infarct size in 60% of the patients. NCCT correlated most strongly with CBV (ρ = .93), whereas CTASI correlated most strongly with CBF (ρ = .87). Subgroup analysis showed less correlation of CTASI with final infarct size in the group that received thrombolysis versus the group that did not (ρ = .70 versus .88, P = .01).	In a 256-slice scanner, the CTASI parenchymal abnormality includes ischemic penumbra and thus overestimates final infarct size-this could result in inappropriate exclusion of patients from thrombolysis or thrombectomy.",Remaining

S8 and Prx2) genes by characterizing the expression of the human orthologs and their potential for causing specific human malformations. The expression pattern of PRRX2 and its close relative, PRRX1, were analyzed in human tissue by RT-PCR. Although the expression of these human genes is similar to their mouse orthologs, there are notable differences in expression. PRRX2 was detected in the human kidney and lung, whereas in mice and chickens neither of these tissues has been reported to express Prrx2. For PRRX1 the expression pattern was quite similar to other vertebrates, but the ratio of the two isoforms was reversed. To begin the search for the gene-disease connection, both genes were mapped to human chromosomes by FISH. The PRRX1 locus maps to 1q23, whereas the PRRX2 locus maps to 9q34.1. This localization, along with the recently described phenotypes of the gene-targeted Prrx1, Prrx2 and double mutant mice, enabled us to search the human disease databases for similar malformations. This examination suggested that mutations at the PRRX1 and/or PRRX2 loci could result in Nager Acrofacial Dysostosis (NAFD) syndrome. We obtained DNA samples from eight patients with NAFD, as well as two patients with Miller syndrome, and analyzed them for mutations in the PRRX1 and PRRX2 genes. The data excludes mutations in the presumed coding sequences of these genes from causing NAFD.",Remaining

American journal of neuroradiology,Mitochondrial disorders: analysis of their clinical and imaging characteristics.,"Investigation of the clinical, imaging, and in vivo MR spectroscopy (MRS) characteristics of disorders of mitochondrial function.	Clinical, imaging (five CT and 20 MR examinations), and MRS (six studies in five patients) findings in 19 patients with mitochondrial disorders were retrospectively reviewed. Results were critically analyzed and, when applicable, compared with results in the literature.	Patients included four with mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), two with myoclonus, epilepsy, and ragged red fibers (MERRF), two with Kearns-Sayre syndrome, seven with Leigh syndrome, one with progressive cerebral poliodystrophy (Alpers syndrome), and three with trichopoliodystrophy (Menkes disease). MELAS, MERRF, and Kearns-Sayre tended to occur in older children and adults, whereas Leigh syndrome, Alpers syndrome, and Menkes disease occurred in infants and young children. All diseases involved gray matter early in their course, manifest primarily as T2 prolongation, with the deep cerebral nuclei being involved more often than the cerebral cortex. When T2 prolongation was seen in the white matter (MELAS, MERRF, Kearns-Sayre, Leigh), the peripheral and retrotrigonal white matter showed early involvement. Patients with Menkes disease showed rapidly progressive atrophy accompanied by large subdural hematomas. Proton MRS showed an elevated lactate level in involved regions of the brain; the lactate peak disappeared in old areas of T2 prolongation.	Mitochondrial disorders have a wide range of both clinical and imaging findings. Although no one set of findings is diagnostic of these disorders, the combination of deep gray matter involvement and peripheral white matter involvement in young adults or children should suggest the diagnosis, especially when associated with an elevated lactate level on proton MRS.",Remaining

TGX-221 is a selective PI3K-β inhibitor with a good separation of anti-thrombotic efficacy and bleeding (therapeutic index) in rats. Our goal was to further evaluate potential of a PI3K-β inhibitor as an anti-thrombotic agent by determining the therapeutic index in another species and efficacy model. Reported effects of TGX-221 in rats were also confirmed.	TGX-221 (0.3 + 0.3, 1 + 1, 3 + 3 mg/kg + mg/kg/hr, i.v.) or vehicle was given to mice starting 15 min prior to FeCl(3) arterial thrombosis (AT), tail or kidney bleeding time (BT) procedures.	Integrated blood flow over 30 min (%baseline mean ± SEM) improved (p < 0.05) with TGX-221 doses 1 + 1 (49 ± 13.9%) and 3+3 (88 ± 10.6%) versus 0.3 + 0.3 (10 ± 0.8%) and vehicle (10 ± 0.6%). Vascular patency (non-occluded/total arteries) improved (p < 0.01) with TGX-221 doses of 3 + 3 (7/8), but not 0.3 + 0.3 (0/8) or 1 + 1 (4/8) versus vehicle (0/8). Tail BT (sec) increased (p < 0.05) with TGX-221 doses of 3 + 3 (median 1560) and 1 + 1 (1305) versus vehicle (225). Mean renal BT (sec) increased (p < 0.05) in all TGX-221 groups (3 + 3: 510 + 26; 1 + 1: 478 + 41; 0.3 + 0.3: 246 + 37) versus vehicle (123 + 9). For comparison, a reference agent, aspirin (30 mpk, i.p.) increased tail BT 1.9X and renal BT 2.6X.	The novel finding of a clear impact on hemostasis by TGX-221 was demonstrated by increased bleeding in two models in mice at anti-thrombotic doses.

The children were interviewed individually. They thought-listed their latest worry episodes, rated the uncontrollability of the episodes, and reported on the strategies they used to terminate worry. Content analyses showed that children's worry episodes contained predominantly thoughts reflecting negative outcome anticipation, but other types of thought content also were present. These included problem-solving, ruminating, and self-blaming thoughts. Compared to clinic-referred children, nonreferred children reported more problem solving and less ruminating. In the nonreferred group, increasing age was associated with more problem solving and less ruminating. No such age-related associations were found in the clinic-referred group. The 2 groups did not differ in the types of worry-termination strategies they reported, but clinic-referred children were more likely to keep worrying until the perceived threat was removed. The results suggest that the problem-solving function of worry is still emerging during late childhood and that developmental delays in problem solving may be associated with excessive and uncontrollable worrying.",Remaining
592,29039020,Molecular neurobiology,Systemic Inflammation and Multimodal Biomarkers in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"There is increasing evidence suggesting that one of the most relevant pathophysiological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuroinflammation, which plays an important role in the production and regulation of AD-related proteins (amyloid beta (Aβ) and Tau) and exacerbates AD pathology. Neuroinflammation can also be induced by systemic influences (factors from outside the central nervous system). However, the role of systemic inflammation in AD pathophysiology is much less understood. Thus, our main objective in this study was to verify whether the presence of serum cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α) affects different AD biomarkers: Aβ1-42 and Tau protein levels, hippocampal volumes (HV), and default mode network functional connectivity (DMN FC) in healthy elderly controls, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients due to AD, and mild AD patients. To accomplish this, we acquired 3-T MRI, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 42 healthy controls, 55 aMCI patients due to AD, and 33 mild AD patients. Comparing the groups, we found that the mild AD patients presented smaller HV, disrupted DMN FC, and proportionally less IL-1β than the controls. The aMCI patients only differed from the controls in DMN FC. In intra-group comparison, aMCI and mild AD with detectable levels of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-12) had decreased DMN FC. On the other hand, patients with detectable levels of IL-10 and IL-12 presented a more favorable AD biomarkers profile (larger HV, more CSF Aβ1-42, and less p-Tau), indicating a possible protective role of these ILs. Our findings indicate a possible relationship between systemic inflammation with DMN FC disruption, hippocampal atrophy, and CSF protein levels in the subjects with mild AD and aMCI.",Remaining

In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant elevated risks were associated with A allele carriers in Europeans (OR=1.27 and 95%CI=1.01-1.59 for AA+AG vs. GG), but not in Asians (OR=1.37 and 95%CI=0.32-5.88 for AA+AG vs. GG).	This meta-analysis suggested that the -1082G/A polymorphism of IL-10 gene would be a risk factor for AD.

594,18501411,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",Neuropeptide Y in the central nucleus of the amygdala suppresses dependence-induced increases in alcohol drinking.,"The anxiolytic effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) are mediated in part by the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a brain region involved in the regulation of alcohol-drinking behaviors. Centrally administered NPY suppresses alcohol drinking in subpopulations of rats vulnerable to the development of high alcohol-drinking behavior. The purpose of the current study was to determine the role of NPY in the CeA on elevated alcohol drinking produced by alcohol dependence. Adult male Wistar rats were trained to respond for 10% w/v alcohol in an operant situation with the use of a supersaccharin fading procedure. Following stabilization of responding, rats were divided into two groups matched for intake and given daily access to either alcohol-containing (9.2% v/v) liquid diet or an isocaloric control diet. Following extended access to the diet and reliable separation of operant responding between dependent and non-dependent rats during 6-h withdrawal tests, all rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae aimed at the CeA. Rats were then infused with 4 NPY doses (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 microg/0.5 microl aCSF) in a within-subjects Latin-square design during acute withdrawal and tested for operant alcohol responding 30 min later. Alcohol-dependent rats exhibited higher operant alcohol responding than non-dependent rats when infused with vehicle, but responding was similar in the two groups following infusion of all doses of NPY. These results indicate that NPY abolishes dependence-induced elevations in alcohol drinking and implicate the recruitment of limbic NPY systems in the motivational drive to consume alcohol following the transition to dependence.",Animal-drug-intervention

Relatively little research has been done on the extent to which these interventions were implemented in the daily care. The aim of this study was to obtain insight into strategies for successful implementation of psychosocial interventions in the daily residential dementia care. Using a modified RE-AIM framework, the indicators that are considered important for effective and sustainable implementation were defined.	A systematic literature search was undertaken in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cinahl, followed by a hand search for key papers. The included publications were mapped based on the dimensions of the RE-AIM framework: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.	Fifty-four papers met the inclusion criteria and described various psychosocial interventions. A distinction was made between studies that used one and studies that used multiple implementation strategies. This review shows that to improve their knowledge, caregivers needed at least multiple implementation strategies, only education is not enough. For increasing a more person-centered attitude, different types of knowledge transfer can be effective. Little consideration is given to the adoption of the method by caregivers and to the long-term sustainability (maintenance).	This review shows that in order to successfully implement a psychosocial method the use of multiple implementation strategies is recommended. To ensure sustainability of a psychosocial care method in daily nursing home care, innovators as well as researchers should specifically pay attention to the dimensions Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of the RE-AIM implementation framework.",Human-systematic-review

It is possible that ignorance and stigma prevent such persons from seeking appropriate help, and that community attitudes and beliefs play a role in determining the help-seeking behaviour and successful treatment of the mentally ill. Nevertheless, there is little research on the attitudes of lay persons toward mental illness within the South African community.	The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of the general South African public toward mental illness, specifically regarding the causes of illness and treatment options.	The study design employed a questionnaire survey. Structured interviews (n = 667) were conducted with members of the general public. One of eight vignettes, portraying depression, schizophrenia, panic disorder or substance abuse, with subtle or obvious symptoms, was presented to each respondent.	The main findings were that cases were most often conceptualised as stress-related or due to a lack of willpower rather than as medical disorders. Treatment advocated was more often to talk the problem over than to consult professional medical help. Psychotherapy was the preferred treatment option, particularly in vignettes where symptom presentation was subtle, and in cases of substance abuse.	These data suggest that stigma and misinformation regarding mental illness exist, influencing preferred treatment modality and help-seeking behaviour. More work needs to be done to educate the public about the psychobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and about the value of effective treatments. A better understanding of these disorders amongst the public would presumably lessen stigmatisation and encourage the use of currently available and effective interventions.",Remaining

PRSS8 upregulation inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, xenograft experiments showed that PRSS8 overexpression suppressed glioma cell growth in vivo. We also found that upregulated PRSS8 reduced the protein expression levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR in glioma cells. Taken together, our study demonstrated that overexpression of PRSS8 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, PRSS8 may act as a novel therapeutic target for glioma.",In-vitro-study

Access to preventive health care services, including genital human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations, may mitigate the impact of ACEs on adverse health outcomes. Our objective was to assess associations between ACEs and HPV vaccination coverage among young adults.	We included 3415 respondents aged 18 to 29 years to the 2019-2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ACE and HPV vaccination modules. Adverse childhood experiences included emotional, physical, and sexual abuse; household intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and mental illness; and parental separation/divorce and incarcerated household member. We used log-binomial regression models to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between ACEs and self-reported HPV vaccination and completion. Secondary outcomes included influenza vaccination uptake, time since routine checkup, HIV testing history, and HIV-related risk behavior.	Several ACEs were positively associated with HPV vaccination initiation, including emotional abuse (PR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.43), intimate partner violence (PR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30), substance abuse (PR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.33), and mental illness (PR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.22-1.50).

Adverse childhood experiences were positively associated with having had an HIV test (PRs from 1.19 to 1.56) and HIV-related risk behavior (PRs from 1.19 to 2.07).	The unexpected positive associations between ACEs and HPV vaccination coverage could be due to opportunities to receive HPV vaccination in late adolescence or early adulthood while accessing STI/HIV prevention or treatment services. Future studies should evaluate associations between ACEs and timely HPV vaccination in early adolescence.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Humanized VEEV-binding Fabs were evaluated for virus-neutralizing capacity, then selected Fabs were converted to whole immunoglobulin (Ig) G1, and stable cell lines were generated. The humanized mAb Hy4-26C, designated Hy4 IgG, had virus-neutralizing capacity similar to that of 3B4C-4. Passive antibody protection studies with purified Hy4 IgG were performed in adult Swiss Webster mice. As little as 100 ng Hy4 IgG protected 90 % of mice challenged with 100 intraperitoneal (i.p.) mean morbidity (MD(50)) doses of virulent VEEV (Trinidad donkey) 24 h after antibody transfer; also, 500 mug Hy4 IgG protected 80 % of mice inoculated with 100 intranasal MD(50) doses of VEEV.

606,27138817,Psychiatry research,Psychopathological factors associated with problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use in a sample of adolescents in Germany.,"In Germany, high prevalence rates for problematic alcohol use and problematic Internet use in adolescents were reported. The objective of the present study was to identify psychopathological factors associated with these two behavior patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation assessing psychopathological factors for both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use in the same sample of adolescents. We surveyed a sample of 1444 adolescents in Germany regarding problematic alcohol use, problematic Internet use, psychopathology and psychological well-being. We conducted binary logistic regression analyses. 5.6% of the sample showed problematic alcohol use, 4.8% problematic Internet use, and 0.8% both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Problematic alcohol use was higher in adolescents with problematic Internet use compared to those without problematic Internet use. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms were statistically significant associated with both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Prosocial behavior was related to problematic Internet use. Male gender and less peer problems were associated with problematic alcohol use. For the first time associations between adolescent problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use due to common psychopathological factors were identified. However, in addition to shared factors, we found also specific psychopathological correlates associated with these two behavior patterns.",Remaining

All patients and comparison participants (n = 9) completed baseline 31P-MRSI scans, and 9 patients completed posttherapy scans. The percentage changes for MADRS scores (Week 2, -23.8; Week 3, -34.9; Week 4, -42.5) and the time effects of TAU on MADRS scores (Week 2, z = -2.07, p = .039; Week 3, z = -4.28, p < .001; Week 4, z = -4.54, p < .001) may reflect TAU effects on early symptom improvement. TAU responders (patients who had a 50% or greater reduction in MADRS scores from baseline at any time) demonstrated a significant difference from nonresponders in pH changes from baseline (effect size = 150). These results suggest that TAU treatment may decrease symptoms of depression and improve mitochondrial functioning.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Weight control thus seems to be important after stroke, and methods for monitoring nutritional status need to be simple and non-invasive. Here we aimed to assess if the nutritional intervention altered body composition in men and women in this study cohort, and also to examine the correlation between the methods for assessing body-, fat- and fat-free mass.	Acute stroke patients > 65 years at nutritional risk were randomized to either individualized, nutritional treatment with energy- and protein rich supplementation (intervention, n = 58) or routine, nutritional care (control, n = 66) while in hospital. Body composition was assessed with anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance. The follow-up period was three months.	During the first week while in hospital, weight loss was smaller in the intervention group compared with the controls (P = 0.013). After three months weight- and fat loss were significant in both men and women. Whereas no significant differences were found in changes in body composition between the male study groups, in the women both weight loss (P = 0.022) and fat loss (P = 0.005) was smaller in the intervention group compared with the controls. A high correlation (r = 0.87) between mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) and body mass index (BMI) was found.	Individualized nutritional support to older stroke patients in hospital was beneficial for maintaining an adequate body mass and body composition the first week and seemed to have a preventive effect on fat loss among women, but not among men after three months. Measurement of MUAC may be used in the assessment of nutritional status when BMI cannot be obtained.

Participants were 448 patients referred to a private practice in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada for psychological or neuropsychological assessment, related to evaluation of impairment and disability resulting from a work-related or non-work related accident. All patients were involved in some form of compensation claim at the time of their evaluation. All patients completed two tests designed to detect exaggerated cognitive deficits, the Computerized Assessment of Response Bias (CARB) and the Word Memory Test (WMT) as part of their evaluation. The diagnostic groups included 322 head injury cases, varying from very minor to very severe. Normative data for the smell test were derived from 126 patients with orthopedic injuries who passed both the CARB and the WMT. Patients with more severe traumatic brain injuries were 10-12 times more likely to have olfactory deficits than persons with trivial to mild head injuries. In a subgroup of patients who failed either the CARB or the WMT, there was no relationship between injury severity and total scores on the smell test. Therefore, the dose-response relationship between brain injury severity and olfactory deficits is severely attenuated when patients who are probably exaggerating their cognitive deficits are included in the analyses. Those patients with trivial to mild head injuries who demonstrated adequate effort on both the CARB and the WMT were no more likely to show olfactory deficits than the non-head-injured orthopedic control subjects. Therefore, anosmia following mild traumatic brain injury should not be concluded from self-reports or from tests of smell unless tests of effort have been passed. Effort should also be controlled in group studies of olfaction.",Remaining

Avoidance, or amelioration, of this secondary injury depends on early diagnosis and intervention before permanent injury occurs. However, tools to monitor brain oxygenation continuously in the neuro-intensive care unit have been lacking.	In recent times, methods of monitoring aspects of brain oxygenation continuously by the bedside have been evaluated in several experimental and clinical series and are potentially changing the way we manage head-injured patients. These monitors have the potential to alert the clinician to possible secondary injury and enable intervention, help interpret pathophysiological changes (e.g., hyperemia causing raised intracranial pressure), monitor interventions (e.g., hyperventilation for increased intracranial pressure), and prognosticate. This review focuses on jugular venous saturation, brain tissue oxygen tension, and near-infrared spectroscopy as practical methods that may have an important role in managing patients with brain injury, with a particular focus on the available evidence in children. However, to use these monitors effectively and to understand the studies in which these monitors are employed, it is important for the clinician to appreciate the technical characteristics of each monitor, as well as respective strengths and limitations of each. It is equally important that the clinician understands relevant aspects of brain oxygen physiology and head trauma pathophysiology to enable correct interpretation of the monitored data and therefore to direct an appropriate therapeutic response that is likely to benefit, not harm, the patient.",Non-systematic-review

Three cases were selected from each country. The 15 resulting cases were presented to the Scientific Committee in Madrid, Spain in November 2009 and awards were given to the top 5 presentations. This article presents details of these cases, including the award winning entries. They have been categorized into four main groups: (a) headaches in rare syndromes; (b) secondary headaches to infectious/autoimmune causes or post-trauma/mass occupation; (c) headache in unresolved cases; and (d) other relevant cases. First prize was awarded to a case involving a 55-year-old male with familial thrombocytopenia and a unilateral neuralgiform headache secondary to trigeminal vascular contact, and which was successfully treated with carbamazepine. Conclusions from the meeting include: rare syndromes do occur and require appropriate treatment to improve outcomes; concomitant diseases may impair adequate diagnosis and should be investigated; physicians should be cautious and treat possible serious underlying disease, whilst accurately clarifying the correct diagnosis; neurological examination and complementary tests may be required; consideration should be given to possible rare medication events; and some cases may remain without a clear cause or diagnosis and symptoms should be treated whilst investigations continue.",Remaining

A factor analysis was performed, based on the polychoric correlations matrix, between ZSDS items using promax oblique rotation in 1049 PC patients with a diagnosis of MDD (DSM-IV).	A clinical interpretable four-factor solution consisting of a core depressive factor (I); a cognitive factor (II); an anxiety factor (III) and a somatic factor (IV) was extracted. These factors accounted for 36.9% of the variance on the ZSDS. The 4-factor structure was validated and high coefficients of congruence were obtained (0.98, 0.95, 0.92 and 0.87 for factors I, II, III and IV, respectively). The model seemed to fit the data well with fit indexes within recommended ranges (GFI = 0.9330, AGFI = 0.9112 and RMR = 0.0843).	Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms in patients with MDD in the PC setting cluster into four dimensions: core depressive, cognitive, anxiety and somatic, by means of a factor analysis of the ZSDS.

Patients with schizophrenia have an increased cardiac mortality rate, but the reasons for this remain unclear. In addition to other factors, the role of impaired autonomic regulation during acute psychosis has become more evident in different studies applying heart rate (HR) variability analyses. But, until now, respiration and cardiorespiratory regulation, which are important for homeostatic control, have not been considered. In this study, short-term cardiorespiratory couplings (CRCs) of 23 unmedicated patients with paranoid schizophrenia (SZO), 20 of their healthy first-degree relatives (REL) and 20 healthy subjects (CON) matched according to age and sex of SZO and REL were investigated by applying high-resolution joint symbolic dynamics (HRJSD) analysis. We found a significantly (p<0.0061) altered HR pattern, respiratory pattern and CRCs in SZO and only marginal alterations for the REL group in comparison with the CON group when we applied HRJSD. These results might be an indication of decreased vagal activity within the brainstem, an altered or suppressed interaction of the brainstem and higher regulatory centres, or panic- and anxiety-related changes in the brainstem associated with the acute psychosis of these patients.",Remaining

This paper reviews the neurobiology and pharmacotherapy of RLS, with a critical analysis of the heterogeneity and methodological limitations of the existing scientific literature.	Although several neurotransmitter systems dysfunction and neuroanatomical abnormalities have been implicated in RLS pathogenesis, dopamine dysfunction within basal ganglia pathways, iron deficiency and opioid system abnormalities have consistently been found to be involved. Their involvement is further strengthened by the therapeutic effectiveness of dopaminergic agents, iron supplementation and opioid medications.	Converging evidence from neuroimaging, autoptic and animal studies points towards dopamine dysregulation and iron metabolism alterations as the main contributors to RLS pathophysiology. The possible interactions between different neurotransmitter systems should guide further neuropharmacological research in order to improve therapeutic efficacy for this disabling condition.",Non-systematic-review
618,33479201,Translational psychiatry,"Brain dynamics: the temporal variability of connectivity, and differences in schizophrenia and ADHD.","We describe advances in the understanding of brain dynamics that are important for understanding the operation of the cerebral cortex in health and disease. In data from 1017 participants from the Human Connectome Project, we show that early visual and connected areas have low temporal variability of their functional connectivity. We show that a low temporal variability of the connectivity of cortical areas is related to high mean functional connectivity between those areas, and provide an account of how these dynamics arise. We then investigate how these concepts help to understand brain dynamics in mental disorders. We find that in both first episode and long-term schizophrenia, reduced functional connectivity of early visual and related temporal cortex areas is associated with increased temporal variability of the functional connectivity, consistent with decreased stability of attractor networks related to sensory processing. In ADHD, we find these functional connectivities are increased and their temporal variability is decreased, and relate this to increased engagement with visual sensory input as manifest in high screen time usage in ADHD. We further show that these differences in the dynamics of the cortex in schizophrenia, and ADHD can be related to differences in the functional connectivity of the specific sensory vs. association thalamic nuclei. These discoveries help to advance our understanding of cortical operation in health, and in some mental disorders.",Remaining

The damage to neurons and glial cells in the brain or spinal cord is present in neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal cord injury, lysosomal storage disorder, epilepsy, and glioblastoma. Therefore, stem cell transplantation can be used as a novel therapeutic approach in cases of brain and spinal cord damage. Recently, researchers have generated neuron-like cells and glial-like cells from embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and neural stem cells. In addition, several experimental studies have been performed for developing stem cell transplantation in brain tissue.

The cAMP analogs were delivered via osmotic minipumps at 1-250 mM through an indwelling cortical cannula or by intrathecal infusion for up to 4 weeks after either a T8 unilateral over-hemisection or a C2-3 dorsolateral quadrant lesion, respectively. In both SCI models, continuous db-cAMP delivery was associated with histopathological changes that included sporadic micro-hemorrhage formation and cavitation, enhanced macrophage infiltration and tissue damage at regions beyond the immediate application site; no deleterious or beneficial effect of agent delivery was observed at the spinal injury site. Furthermore, these changes were accompanied by pronounced behavioral deficits that included an absence of progressive locomotor recovery, increased extensor tone, paralysis, and sensory abnormalities. These deleterious effects were not observed in saline-treated animals, in animals in which the db-cAMP dose did not exceed 1 mM, or in those animals that received a high dose (250 mM) of the alternative cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP. These results demonstrate that, for continuous intraparenchymal or intrathecal administration of cAMP analogs for the study of biological or therapeutic effects within the central nervous system (CNS), consideration of the effective concentration applied as well as the potential toxicity of chemical moieties on the parent molecule and/or their activity needs to be taken into account.",Animal-drug-intervention

Various classifications exist. Its epidemiology remains unclear, because most of the data have been extrapolated from case reports.	In this paper, we describe and comment two cases of shared paranoid disorder: in the first case report, a husband shares the paranoiac delusion of his wife; the second case report describes a shared paranoid disorder between a schizophrenic daughter and her mother.	A review of the existing literature is also presented. Some clinical characteristics arise, such as frequent mother-daughter associations and diagnosis of schizophrenia in inducing subject. Particular social and psychopathological conditions for the occurrence of a shared delusional disorder are described, such as personality traits and genetic influences. This article also reviews some forensic issues, which may be of importance, since this disorder is underdiagnosed. Data concerning the principles of its treatment are sparse, but most authors consider that the separation of the two subjects has to be the basis of any intervention. The inducing subject has to be treated with specific medical interventions, including the prescription of antipsychotics. Sometimes, the separation is enough to eliminate the delusional ideas from the induced subject, who, according to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, is the only one to meet the criteria for shared delusional disorder. The case reports are discussed in light of the review, and some propositions for their treatment are made.

The objective of our study was to assess the role of interleukin-15 as a marker of increased proinflammatory activity in patients with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. We measured cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-15 levels in 17 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 7 patients with frontotemporal dementia in comparison with 17 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 15 patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia had significantly higher cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-15 levels compared with patients with noninflammatory neurological diseases (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). In Alzheimer's disease, a significant positive correlation was noted between interleukin-15 levels and age of onset (R = .48, P = .05). Our findings suggest that interleukin-15 may be implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.",Remaining

Our goal is to investigate two treatment-seeking samples of adults collected in Brazil and the United States, countries with different socio-cultural backgrounds. This comparison may lead to a better understanding of cultural influences on GD.	The total studied sample involved 733 treatment-seeking subjects: 353 men and 380 women (average age=45.80, standard deviation ±10.9). The Brazilian sample had 517 individuals and the American sample 216. Subjects were recruited by analogous strategies.	We found that the Brazilian sample was younger, predominantly male, less likely to be Caucasian, more likely to be partnered, tended to have a faster progression from recreational gambling to GD, and were more likely to endorse chasing losses.	This study demonstrated that there are significant differences between treatment-seeking samples of adults presenting GD due to EGM in Brazil and in the United States. These findings suggest that cultural aspects may have a relevant role in GD due to EGM.",Remaining

Histological examination of the tumor removed at the second transsphenoidal operation found atypical epithelial and sarcomatous components. Administration of bromocriptine, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were initiated. Emergent craniotomy was required for rapid regrowth of the tumor. Histological examination found predominant sarcomatous components. Tumor growth was difficult to control. The patient died of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a pseudoaneurysm involving the C1 portion of the right internal carotid artery. Pituitary adenoma rarely shows malignant transformation. In this case, prolactinoma underwent malignant change to sarcoma. Development of the pseudoaneurysm may have resulted from surgical manipulation, radiotherapy, or tumor invasion.",Human-case-report

As the zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly utilized as a powerful model organism in biomedical research, mounting evidence suggests these fish as a useful tool to study neural and immune mechanisms and their interplay. Here, we discuss zebrafish neuro-immune mechanisms and their pharmacological and genetic modulation, the effect of stress on cytokines, as well as relevant models of microbiota-brain interplay. As many human brain diseases are based on complex interplay between the neural and the immune system, here we discuss zebrafish models, as well as recent successes and challenges, in this rapidly expanding field. We particularly emphasize the growing utility of zebrafish models in translational immunopsychiatry research, as they improve our understanding of pathogenetic neuro-immune interactions, thereby fostering future discovery of potential therapeutic agents.",Animal-other
635,29725038,Scientific reports,(Poly)phenol-digested metabolites modulate alpha-synuclein toxicity by regulating proteostasis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease associated with the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn). The molecular underpinnings of PD are still obscure, but nutrition may play an important role in the prevention, onset, and disease progression. Dietary (poly)phenols revert and prevent age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in model systems. However, only limited attempts were made to evaluate the impact of digestion on the bioactivities of (poly)phenols and determine their mechanisms of action. This constitutes a challenge for the development of (poly)phenol-based nutritional therapies. Here, we subjected (poly)phenols from Arbutus unedo to in vitro digestion and tested the products in cell models of PD based on the cytotoxicity of aSyn. The (poly)phenol-digested metabolites from A. unedo leaves (LPDMs) effectively counteracted aSyn and H2O2 toxicity in yeast and human cells, improving viability by reducing aSyn aggregation and inducing its clearance. In addition, LPDMs modulated pathways associated with aSyn toxicity, such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial impairment, and SIR2 expression. Overall, LPDMs reduced aSyn toxicity, enhanced the efficiency of ER-associated protein degradation by the proteasome and autophagy, and reduced oxidative stress. In total, our study opens novel avenues for the exploitation of (poly)phenols in nutrition and health.",In-vitro-study

This is a retrospective, interventional case report of four patients seen in the clinic over a 1-year period. All patients had analysis of the Norrie gene by direct sequencing.	All patients presented with a similar retinal appearance of dense stalk tissue, globular dystrophic retina, and peripheral avascular retina with pigmentary changes. Each patient was found to have a mutation in the Norrie gene affecting a cystine residue in the cystine knot domain. The mutations are predicted to disrupt the structure of the protein product, norrin, which is required for activation of the Wnt receptor:beta-catenin pathway.	No other vitreoretinopathy that the authors have seen demonstrates this characteristic retinal presentation of severe retinal dysplasia. All four patients were found to have mutations in the Norrie gene which alter the cystine knot motif. Mutations affecting this domain appear to have devastating effects on retinal development and indicate phenotype correlates with mutations affecting the cystine knot domain.",Remaining

At least four of them appear to have an underlying similarity. Each appears to reflect a tendency for respondents to infer a general lack of self-worth (or a continued likelihood of bad events) on the basis of a single discrete failure. The present research was a comparative test of one of these scales against the other three in terms of associations with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores.

638,18760507,Neurobiology of aging,Early diagnostic accuracy and pathophysiologic relevance of an autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease peripheral biomarker.,"Treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the discovery of promising drug candidates depend on early diagnosis. Few currently available diagnostic tests have significantly improved this early uncertainty, while the 'gold standard' diagnosis continues to require clinical dementia in life and the presence of pathologic brain lesions of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain at autopsy. Here, the inflammatory agonist bradykinin, a small nano-peptide, that induces PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 in fibroblasts, was applied to punch-biopsy-obtained human skin fibroblasts. Quantitative imaging of the phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 bands was then used in a ratio that is mathematically configured into an AD-Biomarker Index (AD-Index). In the population described here (N=264), there were 64 autopsy examinations. Demented individuals were clinically diagnosed as AD with an overall accuracy of 78%. Among the 42 autopsy-confirmed cases for which there were also AD-Biomarker measurements, the overall accuracy of the AD-Biomarker was 98%. Among both the autopsy-confirmed and the clinically diagnosed patients, the AD-Index values were inversely correlated with the duration of disease, i.e., the time from the onset of dementia symptoms. Among the autopsy-confirmed cases, the AD-Biomarker diagnosis showed remarkably high sensitivity (97%) and specificity (100%) compared to clinical diagnosis (sensitivity: 78% and specificity: 20%). Using autopsy validation, the clinical diagnosis was only accurate at 52% level vs. the AD-Biomarker accuracy of 100% for cases with dementia not larger than 4 years of duration. Finally, application of soluble Abeta(1-42) to the fibroblasts of normal controls induced the abnormal AD-Biomarker phenotype, suggesting the pathophysiologic relevance of this AD-Biomarker measurement. In summary, the AD-Biomarker, as confirmed by autopsy validation, showed significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than did clinical diagnosis, particularly at early stages of disease, and pathophysiological relevance was demonstrated for the mechanistic basis of the AD-Biomarker measurements.",Remaining
639,18952610,The Journal of biological chemistry,A Drosophila protein family implicated in pheromone perception is related to Tay-Sachs GM2-activator protein.,"Low volatility, lipid-like cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones produced by Drosophila melanogaster females play an essential role in triggering and modulating mating behavior, but the chemosensory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Recently, we showed that the CheB42a protein, which is expressed in only 10 pheromone-sensing taste hairs on the front legs of males, modulates progression to late stages of male courtship behavior in response to female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons. Here we report that expression of all 12 genes in the CheB gene family is predominantly or exclusively gustatory-specific, and occurs in many different, often non-overlapping patterns. Only the Gr family of gustatory receptor genes displays a comparable variety of gustatory-specific expression patterns. Unlike Grs, however, expression of all but one CheB gene is sexually dimorphic. Like CheB42a, other CheBs may therefore function specifically in gustatory perception of pheromones. We also show that CheBs belong to the ML superfamily of lipid-binding proteins, and are most similar to human GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP). In particular, GM2-AP residues involved in ligand binding are conserved in CheBs but not in other ML proteins. Finally, CheB42a is specifically secreted into the inner lumen of pheromone-sensing taste hairs, where pheromones interact with membrane-bound receptors. We propose that CheB proteins interact directly with lipid-like Drosophila pheromones and modulate their detection by the gustatory signal transduction machinery. Furthermore, as loss of GM2-AP in Tay-Sachs disease prevents degradation of GM2 gangliosides and results in neurodegeneration, the function of CheBs in pheromone response may involve biochemical mechanisms critical for lipid metabolism in human neurons.",Remaining
640,7694167,Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,Alzheimer's lesions labelled by anti-ubiquitin antibodies: comparison with other staining techniques. A study of 15 cases with graded intellectual status in ageing and Alzheimer's disease.,"We compared the densities of lesions immunolabeled with ubiquitin, tau and beta A4 antibodies and stained by various silver impregnations, with the intellectual status. The densities of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles labelled by anti-ubiquitin antibody were correlated with the Blessed test score. Ubiquitin-positive neurofibrillary tangles were less numerous than those labelled by Gallyas, anti-tau, Bodian's and Bielschowsky's methods. There were five times more beta A4 deposits than ubiquitin positive plaques. beta A4 deposits could be numerous in cases in which ubiquitin immunolabelling was entirely negative. Bielschowsky's method, silver methenamine and thioflavin S revealed more senile plaques than anti-ubiquitin, whereas anti-tau, Gallyas', Bodian's and Cross' techniques revealed similar numbers. Anti-ubiquitin positive lesions were correlated with the severity of dementia. Compared with other staining methods, sensitivity of anti-ubiquitin was weaker for neurofibrillary tangles than for senile plaques. These findings suggest that ubiquitin epitopes are linked to the neurofibrillary changes (in the perikaryon or within the senile plaques), and are absent from beta A4 deposits, either diffuse or compact.",Remaining

642,28690033,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",Schisantherin A attenuates ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal injury in rats via regulation of TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways.,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and C5aR1 (CD88) have been recognized as potential therapeutic targets for the reduction of inflammation and secondary damage and improvement of outcome after ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). The inflammatory responses which induce cell apoptosis and necrosis after I/R brain injury lead to a limited process of neural repair. To further comprehend how these targets function in I/R state, we investigated the pathological changes and TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo models of I/R brain injury in this study. Meanwhile, we explored the roles of schisantherin A on I/R brain injury, and whether it exerted neuroprotective effects by regulating the TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways or not. The results showed that schisantherin A significantly reduced the neuronal apoptosis induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) injury in primary culture of rat cortical neurons. Also, schisantherin A alleviated neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume, attenuated oxidation stress, inflammation and apoptosis in ischemic parietal cortex of rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury. Moreover, the activated TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways were inhibited by schisantherin A treatment. In conclusion, TLR4 and C5aR1 played a vital role during I/R brain injury in rats, and schisantherin A exhibited neuroprotective effects by TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways. These findings also provided new insights that would aid in elucidating the effect of schisantherin A against cerebral I/R and support the development of schisantherin A as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke.",Animal-other

644,10490713,American journal of medical genetics,Evaluation of a screening questionnaire for genetic studies of Parkinson's disease.,"A screening questionnaire with high sensitivity for detection of Parkinson's disease would make it easier to identify undiagnosed, yet affected, family members for genetic research. We assessed the validity of a screening questionnaire developed by Duarte et al. [1995: Mov Disord 10:643-649] with reported high specificity and sensitivity for Parkinson's disease (PD). We applied the questionnaire to 78 asymptomatic members of families that had at least two people diagnosed with PD. These families were participating in a linkage study of Parkinson's disease. Examination of these 78 revealed that 53 were normal (normal controls) and 25 were classified ('undiagnosed' PD defined) as possible, probable, or clinically definite PD based on standardized criteria. We compared these results with 123 patients with clinically definite PD ('diagnosed' PD). There were significant differences among the mean scores on the questionnaire for normal controls (4.4), subjects with undiagnosed PD (9.8), and patients with diagnosed PD (42.1; p<0.000001) and a significant difference between undiagnosed PD and normals (p<0.01). The questionnaire had only 4% sensitivity for detection of parkinsonism in undiagnosed PD using the original criteria [Duarte et al., 1995]. Revising the criteria increased the sensitivity from 4 to 48% in the undiagnosed group. The positive predictive value was 39% and the negative predictive value was 72%. Prospective application of these revised criteria is necessary to confirm the improved sensitivity. However, we conclude that this screening questionnaire has inadequate sensitivity for detection of mild parkinsonism and direct examination is still critical for accurate classification for genetic studies.",Remaining
645,32198120,Brain research,Apathy in frontotemporal dementia is related to medial prefrontal atrophy and is independent of executive dysfunction.,"Apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric syndrome in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and encompasses cognitive, behavioral and affective symptoms. The neural basis of apathy in bvFTD is not completely understood. Previous neuroimaging studies have poorly considered executive impairment and dementia severity as possible confounding factors. Herein we investigated the neural basis of apathy in bvFTD through structural neuroimaging taking into account these factors.	We included patients with probable bvFTD (n = 21) and cognitively healthy controls (HC, n = 22). Participants were matched for age, sex and schooling. All subjects underwent a thorough neuropsychological examination, including tests for executive functions and social cognition. Apathy was assessed with the Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS). All subjects underwent 3T brain MRI. We investigated correlations between SAS scores and gray matter atrophy within the bvFTD group. Executive function (Frontal Assessment Battery) and disease severity were considered as covariates in neuroimaging analyses.	Compared to HC, bvFTD patients had lower scores on global cognitive efficiency, executive functions and social cognition. All bvFTD had clinically relevant apathy (scores greater than 14 in the SAS). Performance in executive function tests did not correlate with apathy scores. The severity of apathy was negatively correlated with gray matter volumes in midline prefrontal regions, namely orbitofrontal cortex and both anterior and dorsal regions of cingulate cortex.	Apathy in bvFTD is related to a specific network of prefrontal cortical areas critically involved in effort-based behavior for rewards and appears to be independent of executive dysfunction.",Remaining
646,29076783,Journal of neurosurgery,Systematic histopathological analysis of different 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence levels in newly diagnosed glioblastomas.,"OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by distinct intratumoral histopathological heterogeneity with regard to variable tumor morphology, cell proliferation, and microvascularity. Maximum resection of a GBM results in an improved prognosis and thus represents the aim of surgery in the majority of cases. Fluorescence-guided surgery using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is currently widely applied for improved intraoperative tumor visualization in patients with a GBM. Three intratumoral fluorescence levels (i.e., strong, vague, or no fluorescence) can usually be distinguished during surgery. So far, however, their exact histopathological correlates and their surgical relevance have not been clarified sufficiently. Thus, the aim of this study was to systematically analyze tissue samples from newly diagnosed GBMs with different fluorescence levels according to relevant histopathological parameters. METHODS This prospective study recruited patients who underwent 5-ALA fluorescence-guided resection of a newly diagnosed radiologically suspected GBM. Each patient received 5-ALA approximately 3 hours before surgery, and a modified neurosurgical microscope was applied for intraoperative visualization of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. During surgery, tissue samples with strong, vague, or no fluorescence were collected. For each sample, the presence of tumor tissue, quality of tissue (compact, infiltrative, or no tumor), histopathological criteria of malignancy (cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and presence of microvascular proliferation/necrosis), proliferation rate (MIB-1 labeling index [LI]), and microvessel density (using CD34 staining) were investigated. RESULTS Altogether, 77 patients with a newly diagnosed, histopathologically confirmed GBM were included, and 131 samples with strong fluorescence, 69 samples with vague fluorescence, and 67 samples with no fluorescence were collected. Tumor tissue was detected in all 131 (100%) of the samples with strong fluorescence and in 65 (94%) of the 69 samples with vague fluorescence. However, mostly infiltrative tumor tissue was still found in 33 (49%) of 67 samples despite their lack of fluorescence. Strong fluorescence corresponded to compact tumors in 109 (83%) of 131 samples, whereas vague fluorescence was consistent with infiltrative tumors in 44 (64%) of 69 samples. In terms of the histopathological criteria of malignancy, a significant positive correlation of all analyzed parameters comprising cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis with the 3 fluorescence levels was observed (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the proliferation rate significantly and positively correlated with strong (MIB-1 LI 28.3%), vague (MIB-1 LI 16.7%), and no (MIB-1 LI 8.8%) fluorescence (p < 0.001). Last, a significantly higher microvessel density was detected in samples with strong fluorescence (CD34 125.5 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) than in those with vague (CD34 82.8 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) or no (CD34 68.6 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) fluorescence (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Strong and vague 5-ALA-induced fluorescence enables visualization of intratumoral areas with specific histopathological features and thus supports neurosurgeons in improving the extent of resection in patients with a newly diagnosed GBM. Despite the lack of fluorescence, tumor tissue was still observed in approximately half of the cases. To overcome this current limitation, the promising approach of complementary spectroscopic measurement of fluorescence should be investigated further.",Remaining
647,30658131,Brain research bulletin,Cerebral malaria.,"Malaria remains of significant public health concern under the tropics, causing millions of deaths annually. The disease is caused by protozoans of the Plasmodium genus, of which harbors several distinct species. Human infection occurs during the blood meal of an infected female mosquito belonging to the Anopheles genus. It is estimated that around 1% of children infected with Plasmodium falciparum develops a more severe form of malaria, which may eventually lead to cerebral complications including cerebral malaria (CM). CM can be positively diagnosed in patients unable to localize a painful stimulus, with peripheral asexual P. falciparum parasitemia and no other identifiable causes of an encephalopathy. Unarousable comas along with the presence of asexual forms of the parasite on a peripheral blood smear are hallmarks of the disease. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CM have yet be fully elucidated, the pathology in itself indicates a clear disease of the vascular endothelium. It is characterized by parasite sequestration, inflammatory cytokine production and vascular leakage, eventually resulting in brain hypoxia. The condition requires systemic health management consisting of focused nursing practices, supportive care, and anti-malarial drugs. The continued understanding of pathogenic mechanisms leading to the onset of CM is fundamental and key for the expansion and development of appropriate neuroprotective interventions. Future research perspectives may also include the development of field-based and rapid diagnostic tests for CM, understanding of host-pathogen interactions to advance development of prevention tools and therapies, and antimalarial drug trials.",Non-systematic-review

Aggregation-prone truncated species of αSyn caused by aberrant cleavage of this fibrillogenic protein are hypothesized to participate in its sequestration into inclusions subsequently leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Here, we investigated the role of calpain cleavage of αSyn in vivo by generating two opposing mouse models. We crossed into human [A30P]αSyn transgenic (i) mice deficient for calpastatin, a calpain-specific inhibitor, thus enhancing calpain activity (SynCAST(-)) and (ii) mice overexpressing human calpastatin leading to reduced calpain activity (SynCAST(+)). As anticipated, a reduced calpain activity led to a decreased number of αSyn-positive aggregates, whereas loss of calpastatin led to increased truncation of αSyn in SynCAST(-). Furthermore, overexpression of calpastatin decreased astrogliosis and the calpain-dependent degradation of synaptic proteins, potentially ameliorating the observed neuropathology in [A30P]αSyn and SynCAST(+) mice. Overall, our data further support a crucial role of calpains, particularly of calpain 1, in the pathogenesis of PD and in disease-associated aggregation of αSyn, indicating a therapeutic potential of calpain inhibition in PD.",Animal-drug-intervention

656,15538265,The Journal of urology,The role of sildenafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients with pelvic fracture urethral disruption.,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common sequel of pelvic fracture urethral disruption (PFUD). After repair of the urethral injury ED may be the most devastating long-term effect for the patient. Some patients with ED may regain normal erectile function. We prospectively studied the response to sildenafil and the erectile function of patients with ED due to PFUD.	The erectile function of patients referred to us with PFUD for urethroplasty were prospectively evaluated before surgery. Patients underwent nocturnal penile tumescence testing and, if results were abnormal, penile duplex ultrasonography with intracavernous injection and arteriography were performed to diagnose the etiology of ED. Patients were questioned about erectile function every 3 months after surgery and if they complained of ED they were offered 100 mg sildenafil. Patients were followed for at least 18 months after surgery.	A total of 29 consecutive patients were evaluated and 22 (76%) of them had ED before surgery. Sufficient followup was available for 15 of the patients. Overall 47% of these patients responded favorably to sildenafil. Of the patients 60% with neurogenic ED and 20% of those with arterial ED responded to this treatment. In 33% of the patients ED resolved within the followup period. All patients with spontaneous resolution of ED previously responded to sildenafil (71% of sildenafil responders).	In patients with ED due to PFUD, those with neurogenic ED are more likely to respond to sildenafil than those with arterial damage. Favorable response to sildenafil may predict spontaneous resumption of normal erectile function over time.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
657,8933611,The Psychiatric clinics of North America,Working with difficult-to-treat eating disorders using an integration of twelve-step and traditional psychotherapies.,"In summary, we have a multidimensional treatment program that attempts to integrate psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, systemic, psychopharmacologic, and 12-step interventions. For patients who have not had previous treatments or patients who are young adolescents, we do not emphasize the 12-step approach. For our difficult-to-treat patients, our current overall impression is that the benefits of adding the 12-step component have outweighed the costs. We began the program with an expressed intent of experimenting with the integration. Staff were subsequently recruited who were open to the experiment and the success of the integration has been a function of the flexibility within the staff. Our hunch is that this integration would not work as well with an existing staff who harbored prejudice toward either position. Actually, we have found working on the integration quite invigorating. Our recovering counselors have raised issues that we have not heard raised in the more traditional settings we have been associated with. Likewise, we have seen our counselors grow professionally from hearing alternative views of why individuals struggle and how they get better. The exchange has been synergistic rather than divisive. Although we are encouraged by our early experience, it is the long-term outcome that will clarify the relative usefulness of this treatment strategy. We are confident that as we live with the integration longer, more of the advantages and disadvantages will become apparent and perhaps we can refine our understanding of which subgroup of patients makes most use of this type of integrated approach.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
658,25579380,Molecular neurobiology,Bee Venom Acupuncture Alleviates Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis by Upregulating Regulatory T Cells and Suppressing Th1 and Th17 Responses.,"The protective and therapeutic mechanism of bee venom acupuncture (BVA) in neurodegenerative disorders is not clear. We investigated whether treatment with BVA (0.25 and 0.8 mg/kg) at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoints, located lateral from the anterior border of the tibia, has a beneficial effect in a myelin basic protein (MBP)(68-82)-induced acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model. Pretreatment (every 3 days from 1 h before immunization) with BVA was more effective than posttreatment (daily after immunization) with BVA with respect to clinical signs (neurological impairment and loss of body weight) of acute EAE rats. Treatment with BVA at the ST36 acupoint in normal rats did not induce the clinical signs. Pretreatment with BVA suppressed demyelination, glial activation, expression of cytokines [interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-17, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-1β], chemokines [RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α], and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB (p65 and phospho-IκBα) signaling pathways in the spinal cord of acute EAE rats. Pretreatment with BVA decreased the number of CD4(+), CD4(+)/IFN-γ(+), and CD4(+)/IL-17(+) T cells, but increased the number of CD4(+)/Foxp3(+) T cells in the spinal cord and lymph nodes of acute EAE rats. Treatment with BVA at six placebo acupoints (SP9, GB39, and four non-acupoints) did not have a positive effect in acute EAE rats. Interestingly, onset and posttreatment with BVA at the ST36 acupoint markedly attenuated neurological impairment in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(35-55)-induced chronic EAE mice compared to treatment with BVA at six placebo acupoints. Our findings strongly suggest that treatment with BVA with ST36 acupoint could delay or attenuate the development and progression of EAE by upregulating regulatory T cells and suppressing T-helper (Th) 17 and Th1 responses. These results warrant further investigation of BVA as a treatment for autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system.",Animal-non-drug-intervention
659,35411967,Annals of neurology,Heterozygous PNPT1 Variants Cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 25.,"Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are characterized by genetic heterogeneity. Some mapped and named loci remain without a causal gene identified. Here we applied next generation sequencing (NGS) to uncover the genetic etiology of the SCA25 locus.	Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing were performed in families linked to SCA25, including the French family in which the SCA25 locus was originally mapped. Whole exome sequence data were interrogated in a cohort of 796 ataxia patients of unknown etiology.	The SCA25 phenotype spans a slowly evolving sensory and cerebellar ataxia, in most cases attributed to ganglionopathy. A pathogenic variant causing exon skipping was identified in the gene encoding Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase PNPase 1 (PNPT1) located in the SCA25 linkage interval. A second splice variant in PNPT1 was detected in a large Australian family with a dominant ataxia also mapping to SCA25. An additional nonsense variant was detected in an unrelated individual with ataxia. Both nonsense and splice heterozygous variants result in premature stop codons, all located in the S1-domain of PNPase. In addition, an elevated type I interferon response was observed in blood from all affected heterozygous carriers tested. PNPase notably prevents the abnormal accumulation of double-stranded mtRNAs in the mitochondria and leakage into the cytoplasm, associated with triggering a type I interferon response.	This study identifies PNPT1 as a new SCA gene, responsible for SCA25, and highlights biological links between alterations of mtRNA trafficking, interferonopathies and ataxia.

The objective of the current report is to determine if the latent class structure of ADHD subtypes can be replicated in a culturally distinct sample of female and male Australian twins.	LCA was applied to parent-report DSM-IV ADHD symptom profiles of N=2,848 child and adolescent Australian twins and compared to North American findings. Separate models were fitted for females (N= 1,432) and males (N= 1,416).	The most congruent latent ADHD classes across samples included a non-symptomatic class, three mild-moderate and two severe classes. Also present within samples was a rare hyperactive-impulsive class and a unique class, the structure of which was idiosyncratic across samples. Mean symptom endorsement and individual symptom endorsement probabilities for each of the stable classes were similar across samples. Consistent with previous findings, there was substantial overlap between the DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes with the severe inattentive and severe combined latent classes. However, DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes were distributed over several latent classes in each sample, and a substantial proportion of individuals with no DSM-IV diagnosis were also assigned to these severe classes.	Results from LCA using an Australian twin sample replicate six of the eight latent class subtypes previously reported using Missouri female twins and extend the findings to male twins. LCA and DSM-IV systems of ADHD classification identify different phenotypic groups, and the basis of this disparity merits further investigation.",Remaining

In this context, the role of personality traits and attitudes of staff members in decision-making around coercion is increasingly being assessed. This study aimed to examine the role of staff attitudes towards coercion and staff members' personality traits in decision-making around coercion in an experimental setting.	We assessed the attitudes towards coercion and (general) personality traits of mental health professionals in psychiatric hospitals with a quantitative survey. Furthermore, we developed case vignettes representing cases in a 'grey zone' and included them in the survey to assess staff members' decisions about coercion in specific situations.	A general approving attitude towards coercion significantly influenced decisions around coercion in individual cases-resulting in a more likely approval of applying coercion in the cases described in the vignettes. Personality traits did not seem to be relevant in this regard.	Strategies to reduce coercion in mental healthcare institutions should focus more on the role of staff attitudes and encourage staff members to reflect on them critically.",Remaining
662,19404652,Acta neuropathologica,Pathology and new players in the pathogenesis of brain edema.,"Brain edema continues to be a major cause of mortality after diverse types of brain pathologies such as major cerebral infarcts, hemorrhages, trauma, infections and tumors. The classification of edema into vasogenic, cytotoxic, hydrocephalic and osmotic has stood the test of time although it is recognized that in most clinical situations there is a combination of different types of edema during the course of the disease. Basic information about the types of edema is provided for better understanding of the expression pattern of some of the newer molecules implicated in the pathogenesis of brain edema. These molecules include the aquaporins, matrix metalloproteinases and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors A and B and the angiopoietins. The potential of these agents in the treatment of edema is discussed. Since many molecules are involved in the pathogenesis of brain edema, effective treatment cannot be achieved by a single agent but will require the administration of a 'magic bullet' containing a variety of agents released at different times during the course of edema in order to be successful.",Non-systematic-review

Literature suggests that after a hysterectomy, women experience complications during the postoperative recovery period that may vary with the type of surgical procedure. During this period, the quantity and quality of sleep as well as other symptoms (pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression) are influenced by various physiologic, psychologic, and social factors. Despite limited evidence that sleep problems may occur frequently during the recovery period, only a few researchers have systematically examined sleep patterns in women after hysterectomy.

664,8988463,Journal of neural transmission. Supplementum,Deprenyl in the treatment of Parkinson's disease: clinical effects and speculations on mechanism of action.,"Selegiline is a relatively selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B that has been used in Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa and as putative neuroprotective therapy. Clinical trials demonstrate that selegiline slows the rate of disease progression and delays the appearance of disability necessitating levodopa. However, confounding symptomatic effects have made it difficult to ascertain the presence of any direct neuroprotective effect. Laboratory studies demonstrate that selegiline protects dopaminergic neurons through a mechanism that does not involve MAO-B inhibition. Recent studies suggest that neuroprotection in laboratory models may be related to the capacity of selegiline to up-regulate a series of anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic molecules which promote cell survival. Further delineation of the precise mechanism whereby selegiline induces this effect may permit for the development of enhanced neuroprotective benefits in PD patients.",Non-systematic-review

To examine whether memory-related EEG parameters may predict cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we assessed P200 and N200 latencies as well as beta event-related synchronization (ERS) in 16 elderly controls (EC), 29 MCI cases and 10 patients with AD during the successful performance of a pure attentional detection task as compared with a highly working memory demanding two-back task. At 1 year follow-up, 16 MCI patients showed progressive cognitive decline (PMCI) and 13 remained stable (SMCI). Both P200 and N200 latencies in the two-back task were longer in PMCI and AD cases compared with EC and SMCI cases. During the interval 1000 ms to 1700 ms after stimulus, beta ERS at parietal electrodes was of lower amplitude in PMCI and AD compared with EC and SMCI cases. Univariate models showed that P200, N200 and log% beta values were significantly related to the SMCI/PMCI distinction with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, 0.78 and 0.72, respectively. The combination of all three EEG hallmarks was the stronger predictor of MCI deterioration with 90% of correctly classified MCI cases. Our data reveal that PMCI and clinically overt AD share the same pattern of working memory-related EEG activation characterized by increased P200-N200 latencies and decreased beta ERS. They also show that P200 latency during the two-back task may be a simple and promising EEG marker of rapid cognitive decline in MCI.",Remaining

668,31230602,Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy,Patterns and temporal precedence of symptom change during cognitive processing therapy for military sexual trauma-related posttraumatic stress disorder.,"Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including for veterans with military sexual trauma (MST)-related PTSD. Most CPT research to date has focused on pre- to post-treatment change in total PTSD symptoms; however, PTSD symptom criteria may not change equivalently over the course of treatment. For example, changes in re-experiencing symptoms have been shown to precede changes in other PTSD criteria during other PTSD treatments (i.e. virtual reality exposure therapy, venlafaxine ER). An improved understanding of the mechanism of change in PTSD symptoms during CPT may assist in optimizing treatment.	The purpose of this study was to identify the pattern and temporal precedence of change in PTSD symptom criteria during and after CPT using cross-lagged panel analyses.	Data from veterans (n = 32) enrolled in a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of CPT for MST-related PTSD were utilized for this secondary analysis. Using hierarchical linear modelling, each symptom criterion was entered as a predictor of subsequent change in the other PTSD symptom criteria.	All symptom criteria followed a logarithmic pattern of change. Hyperarousal symptoms were found to both predict and temporally precede change in avoidance symptoms, but not re-experiencing symptoms. Re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms did not predict change in other PTSD symptom criteria.	These findings provide initial support that targeting and reducing hyperarousal symptoms may be a key component of PTSD intervention with CPT. Additional research is needed to identify factors that predict change in PTSD-related re-experiencing symptoms.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

The WPV1 isolate from this resident was genetically most closely related to WPV1 isolated in Angola in 2010. Subsequent investigation, including active case finding, revealed increased acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) hospital admissions beginning in September. Weekly admissions rose from approximately 10 AFP patients in early October to approximately 80 by the end of October and November.

The history of 'harm reduction' in New York City is characterized within changing historical periods and in relation to the actions of stakeholders. The expansion is traced over four periods: (i) 1984-1989: emergence, activism, and science; (ii) 1990-1994 reckoning: syringe exchange legislation and consolidation; (iii) 1995-1999: bureaucratization, opposition, and challenges to institutional control; and (iv) 2000-2010 revitalization: expansion of syringe access and harm reduction. It is clear from this review that the leadership of activism and the work of advocates catalyzed syringe access policy and practice. Without this 'push,' it is unlikely that New York City would have experienced the dramatic decline in HIV infection among drug injectors in the 1990s. Second, successful arguments for expanding syringe access in New York City were based on the high HIV/AIDS infection rates. Thus, program developments were advocated as HIV prevention interventions, rather than as expanded services for addressing broader health and social issues of injecting drug use.",Non-systematic-review

676,20451518,Experimental neurology,Analysis of combinatorial variability reveals selective accumulation of the fibronectin type III domains B and D of tenascin-C in injured brain.,"Tenascin-C (Tnc) is a multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is markedly upregulated in CNS injuries where it is primarily secreted by reactive astrocytes. Different Tnc isoforms can be generated by the insertion of variable combinations of one to seven (in rats) alternatively spliced distinct fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains to the smallest variant. Each spliced FnIII repeat mediates specific actions on neurite outgrowth, neuron migration or adhesion. Hence, different Tnc isoforms might differentially influence CNS repair. We explored the expression pattern of Tnc variants after cortical lesions and after treatment of astrocytes with various cytokines. Using RT-PCR, we observed a strong upregulation of Tnc transcripts containing the spliced FnIII domains B or D in injured tissue at 2-4 days post-lesion (dpl). Looking at specific combinations, we showed a dramatic increase of Tnc isoforms harboring the neurite outgrowth-promoting BD repeat with both the B and D domains being adjacent to each other. Isoforms containing only the axon growth-stimulating spliced domain D were also dramatically enhanced after injury. Injury-induced increase of Tnc proteins comprising the domain D was confirmed by Western Blotting and immunostaining of cortical lesions. In contrast, the FnIII modules C and AD1 were weakly modulated after injury. The growth cone repulsive A1A2A4 domains were poorly expressed in normal and injured tissue but the smallest isoform, which is also repellant, was highly expressed after injury. Expression of the shortest Tnc isoform and of variants containing B, D or BD, was strongly upregulated in cultured astrocytes after TGFbeta1 treatment, suggesting that TGFbeta1 could mediate, at least in part, the injury-induced upregulation of these isoforms. We identified complex injury-induced differential regulations of Tnc isoforms that may well influence axonal regeneration and repair processes in the damaged CNS.",Animal-other
677,35955753,International journal of molecular sciences,Synthetic Peucedanocoumarin IV Prevents α-Synuclein Neurotoxicity in an Animal Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Pathological protein inclusion formation and propagation are the main causes of neuronal dysfunction in diverse neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, current disease-modifying therapeutic strategies have targeted this disease protein aggregation process. Recently, we reported that peucedanocoumarin III (PCiii) is a promising therapeutic compound with the ability to disaggregate α-synuclein inclusion and protect dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we found that trans-4'-acetyl-3'-tigloylkhellactone (racemic peucedanocoumarin IV [PCiv]), a structural isomer of PCiii with a higher synthetic yield presented a strong anti-aggregate activity to a degree comparable to that of PCiii. PCiv retained effective inhibitory function against β-sheet aggregate-mimic β23 cytotoxicities and potently prevented α-synucleinopathy in α-synuclein preformed fibril (PFF)-treated mice cortical neurons. In detailed pharmacokinetic profiling of PCiv, oral administration of PCiv in rats exhibited an approximately 97-min half-life and 10% bioavailability. Moreover, tissue distribution analysis revealed favorable profiles of brain penetration with a 6.4 brain-to-plasma concentration ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of PCiv was further evaluated in a sporadic PD mouse model with a combinatorial co-injection of α-synuclein preformed fibril and recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing α-synuclein. Motor dysfunctions induced in this combinatorial α-synucleinopathy PD mouse model was almost completely rescued by PCiv diet administration, and this therapeutic effect is consistent with the marked prevention of dopaminergic neuron loss and suppression of α-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our translational study suggests that PCiv is advantageous as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, especially with its good synthetic yield, high brain distribution, and anti-aggregate activity. PCiv may be useful in the management of α-synuclein inclusion formation and propagation at different stages of PD.",Animal-drug-intervention
678,31408379,Traffic injury prevention,Driving/riding after alcohol and marijuana use among young adults: Is residing with family protective?,"Objective: Driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs increases the risk of motor vehicle fatalities, the leading cause of death among young adults. The current study documented the prevalence of driving after alcohol and marijuana use in the past 2 weeks as well as the prevalence of riding with a driver who had used each substance during that time frame. We tested whether young adults who lived with family members (i.e., their parents or their children) were less likely to engage in these behaviors. Methods: Participants aged 18-25 who resided in nonmetropolitan areas in the United States (N = 1,131; 55% female, Mage = 22.6) completed an online survey. Multivariate logistic regressions examined alcohol- and marijuana-related driving and riding behaviors adjusting for demographic factors. Interactions tested whether associations varied by gender. Results: In the 2 weeks prior to the survey, 17% of participants drove after drinking alcohol and 21% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking. The prevalence of driving after marijuana use was 11%, and 16% of the sample had ridden with a driver who had been using marijuana. Participants who lived with their parents were less likely to ride with a driver who had been using alcohol or marijuana (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 0.71 and 0.55, respectively). Living with parents was also associated negatively with driving after both substances, but these associations were no longer significant when controlling for substance use frequency and driving frequency. Surprisingly, the odds of driving after marijuana use were over 2 times larger for young adults who lived with their children. For women, but not men, residing with children decreased the odds of driving and riding after alcohol use. Conclusions: Living with parents protects against riding after substance use among young adults. Prevention programs should target young adults who live independently or those transitioning away from the parental home. Furthermore, given the higher rates of driving after marijuana use among young adult parents, this group should be educated about the risks associated with this behavior.",Remaining

The method is based on an 'induced' bioelectrical phenomenon that develops in the circulating blood after the vessel in question is placed in a constant magnetic field, the field lines of which are perpendicular to the blood flow direction. Animal and in vitro experiments with induced thrombosis of 100 experimental aneurysms are described. For extrapolating the experiments into clinical conditions a special magnetic device was created that is provided with appliances for external stereotaxis and angiographic control. Nine clinical observations with induced thrombosis of aneurysms were conducted, the follow-up reaching 2 years.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
681,36085340,Pituitary,Historical and future trends in emergency pituitary referrals: a machine learning analysis.,"Acute pituitary referrals to neurosurgical services frequently necessitate emergency care. Yet, a detailed characterisation of pituitary emergency referral patterns, including how they may change prospectively is lacking. This study aims to evaluate historical and current pituitary referral patterns and utilise state-of-the-art machine learning tools to predict future service use.	A data-driven analysis was performed using all available electronic neurosurgical referrals (2014-2021) to the busiest U.K. pituitary centre. Pituitary referrals were characterised and volumes were predicted using an auto-regressive moving average model with a preceding seasonal and trend decomposition using Loess step (STL-ARIMA), compared against a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm, Prophet and two standard baseline forecasting models. Median absolute, and median percentage error scoring metrics with cross-validation were employed to evaluate algorithm performance.	462 of 36,224 emergency referrals were included (referring centres = 48; mean patient age = 56.7 years, female:male = 0.49:0.51). Emergency medicine and endocrinology accounted for the majority of referrals (67%). The most common presentations were headache (47%) and visual field deficits (32%). Lesions mainly comprised tumours or haemorrhage (85%) and involved the pituitary gland or fossa (70%). The STL-ARIMA pipeline outperformed CNN-LSTM, Prophet and baseline algorithms across scoring metrics, with standard accuracy being achieved for yearly predictions. Referral volumes significantly increased from the start of data collection with future projected increases (p < 0.001) and did not significantly reduce during the COVID-19 pandemic.	This work is the first to employ large-scale data and machine learning to describe and predict acute pituitary referral volumes, estimate future service demands, explore the impact of system stressors (e.g. COVID pandemic), and highlight areas for service improvement.",Remaining
682,35337924,Journal of affective disorders,Symptomatic plaque enhancement is associated with early-onset post-stroke depression.,"The association between imaging features closely associated with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic plaques and early-onset post-stroke depression (PSD) is currently unclear.	76 ischemic stroke patients who underwent high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (HR-VWI) were divided into PSD and non-PSD groups according to their DSM-V diagnoses and HAMD-17 scores at 14 days after onset. Clinical data and the imaging features associated with symptomatic plaques (including the enhancement index (EI), remodeling index, and plaque surface irregularity) were compared between groups. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis was used to find independent predictors of early-onset PSD. Spearman rank correlation analysis explores the association between clinical data, symptomatic plaque imaging features, and HAMD-17 in patients.	The sample comprised 36 patients with early-onset PSD. The symptomatic plaque EI and infarct volume were significantly higher in depressed patients than in patients without depression (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that symptomatic plaque EI could be used as an independent predictor of early-onset PSD after correcting for the confounding factor of infarct volume (OR = 1.034, 95% CI:1.014-1.055, P = 0.001). In the total sample, symptomatic plaque EI, infarct volume, and HAMD-17 had a significant positive correlation with each other (P < 0.05).	This study focused only on the patients' symptomatic plaques and did not monitor patients' systemic inflammation levels at the time of HR-VWI.	The degree of symptomatic plaque enhancement is an independent predictive imaging marker of early-onset PSD and can be used the early diagnosis of early-onset PSD.",Remaining

There are many factors, including social and cultural, that promote longer DUP. To date, there have been no studies to evaluate religion's effect on DUP. In this study, we evaluated the effect of certain religious affiliations and degree of religious practice on the DUP.	A total of 195 patients were recruited aged 18 to 45 years with the presence of at least 1 psychotic symptom (delusions, hallucinations, or prominent thought disorder). Patients were evaluated on their religious practice prior to the index episode using a Likert-style scale. Using a similar scale, patients were asked about their religious affiliation categorized as Catholic, Protestant, or neither.	Correlational analysis revealed that the time to first treatment and time to first hospitalization were both was negatively related to degree of religious practice (r = -0.15, N = 161, p < 0.05 and r = -0.18, N = 161, p < 0.05, respectively). Between-group comparisons revealed longer DUP in the Protestant group compared to the no affiliation and Catholic groups (p = 0.05).	From our results, it appears that the degree of religious practice does not affect length of time to treatment in psychotic patients. However, having a Protestant religious affiliation is strongly associated with having a greater delay in treatment seeking for psychosis. Factors contributing to a longer DUP in this group warrant further study.",Remaining

This study attempted to screen mutations and to investigate the mutation distribution and related phenotypes including epilepsy of Chinese TSC patients.	We performed the genotypic analysis of TSC1 and TSC2 genes in 77 unrelated Chinese TSC patients using direct Sanger sequencing and Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).	Mutations were identified in a total of 63 (81.8%) cases, including 18 TSC1 mutations (8 nonsense mutations, 6 frameshift, 1 in-frame shift, 1 missense and 2 splice-site) and 45 TSC2 mutations (13 missense, 3 nonsense, 6 splicing, 6 in-frame shift,12 frameshift mutations and 5 large deletions). Large deletions were presented exclusively in TSC2 gene, accounting for 7.9% of all mutations in this study. Fourteen novel mutations were identified in this study.	Epilepsy occurs in approximately 75.3% (58/77) of patients. Hypomelanotic macules occurred significantly more often in patients with TSC2 mutations and cases with TSC1/TSC2 mutations had a significantly higher frequency of cortical nodule than patients with no mutations identified. Overall, our data expands the spectrum of mutations associated with the TSC loci and will be of value to the genetic counseling in patients with the disease.",Remaining

Sodium alginate, a natural polysaccharide, was used as matrix-forming agent in the optimization of transdermal films. Propylene glycol and dl-limonene was added into films as a plasticizer and permeation enhancer, respectively. As well as mechanical strength and bioadhesiveness of optimized transdermal films of DNP, the impact of dl-limonene concentration in films on DNP in vitro permeation across pig skin was assessed. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) measurements were carried out to examine the effects of enhancer on in vitro conformational order of the stratum corneum intercellular lipids following permeation study. Results showed that transdermal formulations of DNP were suitable due to both mechanical and bioadhesive features of the films. In vitro skin permeation study indicated that dl-limonene at a concentration of 3% was optimum with high drug flux. ATR-FTIR results confirmed a more fluidized stratum corneum lipid state in the presence of dl-limonene, indicating its permeation enhancement effect. Regarding to achieve therapeutic levels of DNP, it seems to be feasible deliver DNP with transdermal films for the management of Alzheimer disease.",In-vitro-study

The aims were to assess presence of PD-MCI in untreated, drug-naive PD patients, and to follow-up the sample over 4 years to ascertain evolution of neurocognitive profile.	Seventy-six patients underwent neuropsychological testing at baseline (T0), and after 2 (T1:n = 62) and 4 years (T2:n = 55). Diagnosis of PD-MCI and PD-associated dementia (PDD) was made according to current consensus criteria.	PD-MCI occurred in 25/76 patients (32.9%) at baseline, and 4 of them reverted from PD-MCI to Normal Cognition (Reverters), 7 remained stable (Non-Reverters) and 2 developed PDD at T2; 12 patients were lost to the follow-up. Among the 51 patients with normal cognition (PD-CN) at T0, 27 had normal cognition at T2 (5 of them were Reverters with respect to diagnosis at T1), 5 had MCI at T1 and T2 (Non-Reverters), 9 had MCI at T2 only, whereas 1 developed PDD; 9 patients were lost to the follow-up. At baseline, Reverters (n = 9) had younger age at onset and better performance on constructional visuospatial task than Non-Reverters (n = 12). Compared to patients without PD-MCI at all evaluations (n = 19), Reverters had poorer performance on verbal immediate recall and attention tasks and higher level of apathy at T0. Reduced performance on the Stroop Test at baseline predicted PD-MCI at T2.	Executive dysfunctions predicted development of PD-MCI after few years from onset. Reversal from PD-MCI to PD-CN was related to young age at onset and high level of apathy at baseline evaluation.",Remaining

A variety of frame-based, frameless, and robotic stereotactic systems have been designed for the accurate placement of depth electrodes.	Using the FHC microTargeting platform as a model, we introduce a fully customized design that has all the constructive elements positioned by a computer algorithm, according to the planned trajectories, anchoring points, and anatomic constraints. All the constructive elements form a single-body fixture, which allows for the efficient implantation of multiple depth electrodes following trajectories having a wide range of orientations. We aim at evaluating the safety and accuracy of this stereotactic system in a clinical setting.	A total of 173 depth electrodes were implanted in 21 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Matlab and DEETO software packages were used to postoperatively evaluate the targeting accuracy. Automatic detection of electrode locations eliminated any subjectivity in calculating the targeting errors.	As a result of using custom geometry of the stereotactic platform, the new design is optimized for each patient and streamlines the surgical procedures. The most important results characterizing the platform's accuracy are the values of 1.22 mm for the median lateral target point localization error and 1.17 mm for the median lateral entry point localization error.	The patient-customized platforms are comparable in terms of safety, accuracy, and simplicity of use to the existing robotic devices for implantation of depth electrodes in patients undergoing SEEG investigations.",Remaining

We evaluated the impact of supportive housing on SUD-related ED visits and hospitalizations among active substance users experiencing chronic homelessness.	We matched 1558 homeless adults eligible for a New York City supportive housing program who had a SUD (2007-2012) to Medicaid claims data. We examined SUD-related hospitalizations and ED visits 2 years posteligibility. We calculated stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights using baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and used doubly robust estimators to compare rates between persons placed into supportive housing and those eligible but not placed. We also examined outpatient SUD treatment.	Placed persons were hospitalized and visited EDs for substance use at significantly lower rates than persons not placed into housing (adjusted rate ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.88 and adjusted rate ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.68, respectively) 2 years posteligibility. Placed persons had increased odds of a new episode of SUD treatment and initiating treatment.

Method Data were collected by self-report from 1098 adolescents (mean age 13.6 years; 60.9% boys) at five separate time points, equally separated by 6 months, across a 24-month period. General growth mixture modelling identified three distinct trajectories of adolescents reporting psychotic experiences: elevated, increasing and low.	Controlling for cannabis use, bullying by peers significantly predicted change in psychotic experiences between Time 2 and Time 5 in adolescents belonging to the increasing group. No effect was found for the elevated or low groups. Controlling for bullying, an earlier age of cannabis use and cannabis use more than twice significantly predicted change in psychotic experiences in adolescents belonging to the increasing group. Cannabis use at any age was significantly associated with subsequent change in psychotic experiences in the low group. Reverse causal associations were examined and there was no evidence for psychotic experiences at Time 1 predicting a subsequent change in cannabis use between Times 2 and 5 in any trajectory group.	Bullying by peers and cannabis use are associated with adolescents' reports of increasing psychotic experiences over time. Further research into the longitudinal development of psychosis in adolescence and the associated risk factors would allow for early intervention programmes to be targeted more precisely.",Remaining

We studied patients with Af, retrospectively, as to the factors related to cerebral embolism. We examined 82 cases with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) as well as ambulatory (Holter) ECG and 12 leads ECG. Thirty-three patients had cerebral ischemic attack (CIA), including 14 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) and 19 patients with other heart disease or lone Af (NonMS). The CIA group of NonMS were older than other groups. Both the CIA and NonCIA groups had the same frequency of paroxysmal and chronic Af. In the CIA group, there was a tendency of small amplitude of f wave and longer RR interval than the NonCIA group with ambulatory ECG. The CIA group also had larger left atrial cavity size and aortic diameter with TTE. TEE revealed thrombus formation in 29 cases, and the CIA group had a higher occurrence rate of thrombus than NonCIA group. TEE also detected a fuzzy echo in the left atrium in 88% of the CIA group and 42% of the NonCIA group. The risk factors of cerebral embolism could not be made clear in this study, but a fuzzy echo and thrombus in the left atrium with TEE are specific findings of cerebral embolism. Therefore, older patients with paroxysmal Af, large LAD, AOD, small f wave or long RR interval need to be examined by TEE to detect LA thrombus or a fuzzy echo, which are probably major risk factors of cerebral embolism.",Remaining

The four boys presented in our study, between 10 and 17 years of age, with classical Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, who all had a duplicated proteolipid protein gene, invariably manifested type I despite their various clinical severities. Follow-up MRI after an interval of 5 years and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in three of the patients. The white matter on the last MRI was unchanged in volume and the distribution of high-intense areas. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed no abnormal peaks. These results were consistent with the lack of definite neurologic regression in the last 5 years and with the pathologic characteristics of well-preserved axons and the absence of sclerosis. Further study is required to precisely determine whether the patterns of MRI findings can be divided into subtypes corresponding to those of proteolipid protein gene abnormalities.",Remaining

693,15199474,Seminars in vascular medicine,"P2Y12, a new platelet ADP receptor, target of clopidogrel.","Clopidogrel is a potent antithrombotic drug that inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. The antiaggregating effect of clopidogrel is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of ADP binding to a purinergic receptor present at the platelet surface. Clopidogrel is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. The chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. Several purinergic receptors have been described on platelets; P2X (1), a calcium channel, and P2Y1 a Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor, have been found not to be antagonized by clopidogrel. Another Gi (2)-coupled receptor (named P2Y12) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells. These cells displayed a strong affinity for (33)P-2MeS-ADP, a stable analogue of ADP, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. The binding of (33)P-2MeS-ADP to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets. In these transfected CHO cells, as in platelets, ADP and 2MeS-ADP induced adenylyl cyclase downregulation, an effect that was inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel. These results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called 'P2t' platelet receptor and show that the active metabolite of clopidogrel binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of ADP on platelets.",Non-systematic-review

None of the usually reported direct or indirect signs of aqueductal obstruction were seen in 7 patients in whom the clinical suggestion of AS was confirmed by PC-MR imaging results. Seven patients in this population had a third ventriculostomy, and 5 of them were among those in whom conventional MR imaging failed to reveal signs of aqueductal obstruction. All of these 7 patients had a positive postsurgical outcomes. The analysis of CSF and vascular dynamic data in this population was compared with an aged-matched population, and these data were found similar except for the fourth ventricular CSF flush flow latency.	PC-MR imaging supports the diagnosis of CSF flow blockage at the aqueductal level in a reliable, reproducible, and rapid way, which aids in the diagnosis of AS in patients with clinical and/or radiologic suggestion of obstructive hydrocephalus. We, therefore, suggest using this technique in the current evaluation of hydrocephalus.",Remaining

Participants with CKD stages 3-5 had the highest prevalence of calcification and the highest frequency of calcium scores > 400 in all arterial sites. Calcification in at least one arterial site was present in > 90% of patients with CKD stage 3. In all five CKD stages prevalence of calcification was greatest in both the thoracic and abdominal aorta, and in the iliac arteries. These arterial sites also showed the highest calcium scores. High calcium scores (> 400) in all five arterial regions were independently associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease. In multivariable analyses, after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, declining creatinine clearance was associated with increasing calcification of the coronary arteries (p = 0.012) and the thoracic aorta (p = 0.037) only.	Arterial calcification is highly prevalent throughout all five CKD stages and is most prominent in both the thoracic and abdominal aorta, and in the iliac arteries. Follow-up studies are needed to explore the potential of extracardiac calcification sites in prediction of cardiovascular events in the CKD population.",Remaining

Nine hundred and thirty-nine T2DM patients were recruited from a grade 3 Class A hospital in Harbin, China, and asked to complete a demographic questionnaire as well as the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R), and Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire (MCMQ). Hierarchical linear regression analysis and the bootstrap method were preformed to examine if coping style influenced the relationship between illness perception and depression.	The majority of patients (73.59%) exhibited depressive symptoms, including 37.27% with moderate and 6.71% with severe depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were more frequent in patients with complications (P < 0.05). A resignation coping style partially mediated the influence of illness perception on depressive symptoms.	Interventions to improve coping style may reduce the prevalence or severity of depressive symptoms among T2DM patients, potentially enhancing treatment adherence and clinical outcome.",Remaining

705,25637797,Neuroscience,Enhanced angiogenesis promoted by human umbilical mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in stroked mouse is Notch1 signaling associated.,"Cellular therapy has provided hope for restoring neurological function post stroke through promoting endogenous neurogenesis, angiogenesis and synaptogenesis. The current study was based on the observation that transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) promoted the neurological function improvement in stroked mice and meanwhile enhanced angiogenesis in the stroked hemisphere. Grafted hUCMSCs secreted human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Notch1 signaling was activated after stroke and also in the grafted hUCMSCs. To address the potential mechanism that might mediate such pro-angiogenic effect, we established a hUCMSC-neuron co-culture system. Neurons were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) injury before co-culturing to mimic the in vivo cell transplantation. Consistent with the in vivo data, co-culture medium claimed from hUCMSC-OGD neuron co-culture system significantly promoted the capillary-like tube formation of brain-derived endothelial cells. Moreover, coincident with our in vivo data, Notch 1 signaling activation was detected in hUCMSCs after co-cultured with OGD neurons as demonstrated by the up-regulation of key Notch1 signaling components Notch1 and Notch1 intercellular domain (NICD). In addition, OGD-neuron co-culture also increased the VEGF-A production by hUCMSCs. To verify whether Notch1 activation was involved in the pro-angiogenic effect, γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) was added into the co-culture medium before co-culture. It turned out that DAPT significantly prevented the Notch1 activation in hUCMSCs after co-culture with OGD neurons. More importantly, the pro-angiogenic effect of hUCMSCs was remarkably abolished by DAPT addition as demonstrated by inhibited capillary-like tube formation and less VEGF-A production. Regarding how Notch1 signaling was linked with VEGF-A secretion, we provided some clue that Notch1 effector Hes1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated by OGD-neuron co-culturing and down-regulated after additional treatment of DAPT. In summary, our data provided evidence that the VEGF-A secretion from hUCMSCs after being triggered by OGD neurons is Notch1 signaling associated. This might be a possible mechanism that contributes to the angiogenic effect of hUCMSC transplantation in stroked brain.",In-vitro-study

We aimed to explore service users' and carers' accounts of recent episodes of severe mental illness and of the care received in a multi-cultural inner city. We sought to examine factors impacting on these experiences, including whether and how users and carers felt that their experiences were mediated by ethnicity.	Forty service users and thirteen carers were recruited following an acute psychotic episode using typical case sampling. In-depth interviews explored illness and treatment experiences. Ethnicity was allowed to emerge in participants' narratives and was prompted if necessary.	Ethnicity was not perceived to impact significantly on therapeutic relationships, and nor were there ethnic differences in care pathways, or in the roles of families and friends. Ethnic diversity was commonplace among both service users and mental health professionals. This was tolerated in community settings if efforts were made to ensure high-quality care. Home Treatment was rated highly, irrespective of service users' ethnicity. In-patient care was equally unpopular and was the one setting where ethnicity appeared to mediate unsatisfactory care experiences. These findings highlight the risks of generalising from reports of (dis)satisfaction with care based predominantly on in-patient experiences.	Home treatment was popular but hard to deliver in deprived surroundings and placed a strain on carers. Interventions to enhance community treatments in deprived areas are needed, along with remedial interventions to improve therapeutic relationships in hospital settings.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
708,31758600,Journal of neuroscience research,Parenchymal pericytes are not the major contributor of extracellular matrix in the fibrotic scar after stroke in male mice.,"Scar formation after injury of the brain or spinal cord is a common event. While glial scar formation by astrocytes has been extensively studied, much less is known about the fibrotic scar, in particular after stroke. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor ß-expressing (PDGFRß[+]) pericytes have been suggested as a source of the fibrotic scar depositing fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins after detaching from the vessel wall. However, to what extent these parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells contribute to the fibrotic scar and whether targeting these cells affects fibrotic scar formation in stroke is still unclear. Here, we utilize male transgenic mice that after a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model have a shift from a parenchymal to a perivascular location of PDGFRß[+] cells due to the loss of regulator of G-protein signaling 5 in pericytes. We find that only a small fraction of parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells co-label with type I collagen and fibronectin. Consequently, a reduction in parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells by ca. 50% did not affect the overall type I collagen or fibronectin deposition after stroke. The redistribution of PDGFRß[+] cells to a perivascular location, however, resulted in a reduced thickening of the vascular basement membrane and changed the temporal dynamics of glial scar maturation after stroke. We demonstrate that parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells are not the main contributor to the fibrotic ECM, and therefore targeting these cells might not impact on fibrotic scar formation after stroke.",Animal-other

Stress factors play an important role in the etiopathology of both diseases, since increased corticosteroid levels caused by chronic stress indirectly induce neuronal damage. The aim of our experiments was to evaluate the changes induced by stress in the transcription of amyloid precursor protein (APP), mitogen activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1) and beta-actin, of which the latest plays a leading role in synaptic plasticity. Additionally we intended to examine how duloxetine - a serotonin-norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor type antidepressant - would modify the stress-induced changes. Wistar rats were exposed to immobilization stress for five hours daily through 21 days, while part of the animals received 45 mg/bwkg of duloxetine. At the end of the third week total RNA was purified from the cortex and hippocampus. The amount of beta-actin, APP and MAPK-1 mRNA was determined by real time PCR method. On protein level, semiquantitative measurement was performed by Western blot. The expression of beta-actin mRNA in the animals exposed to stress was four times as intense as in the control group. The increase in the beta-actin mRNA levels was repressed by the duloxetine treatment. In the case of APP and MAPK-1 no changes were detected. According to the Western blot results, the antidepressant treatment slightly, the drug along with the stress treatment strongly decreased the amount of the beta-actin protein. Our findings indicate that antidepressant treatment with duloxetine could play a protective role against the chronic stress-induced changes in the nervous system, such as disorders of synaptic plasticity, and the consequent cognitive dysfunctions in case of both affective disorders and AD.",Animal-drug-intervention

SULEHS is an ultra-rare disorder associated with biallelic loss-of-function variants of the TASP1 gene, and up-to-date, seven patients from five families have been reported in the literature. Loss of TASP1 function has been reported to alter H3K4 histone modifications and expression of TFIIA and HOX transcription factors in the SULEHS phenotype. In this report, a new patient molecularly diagnosed with SULEHS by a novel homozygous c.404-2A > G variant in the TASP1 gene is presented with the long-term follow-up. Although the majority of the patient's clinical characteristics were similar to those of previously reported SULEHS patients, this study was the first to describe some additional anomalies, such as cystic hygroma, increased nuchal thickness, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary sequestration anomaly, chronic constipation, encephalomalacia, and aggressive behavior. Because of the remarkable similarities between the clinical features of Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BRWS) and the patient, BRWS was considered the most likely diagnosis before the molecular diagnosis. Network analysis also supported that the interaction of the SULEHS-associated TASP1 gene with the BRWS-associated ACTB and ACTG1 genes through common intermediate molecules. Overall, despite the existence of differences in clinical features, inheritance patterns, and underlying pathophysiology between BRWS and SULEHS, both diseases could be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the high clinical similarities, including the dysmorphic features, growth parameters, neurodevelopmental phenotype, neurological problems, and multisystem involvement. Additionally, this report could contribute to a better understanding of the genotypic and clinical features of SULEHS by describing a novel pathogenic variant and new clinical features, such as prenatal manifestations.",Remaining

The pretreatment molar ratio of amino acids was less in patients than in controls (p less than 0.001) and was lower in those with cirrhosis (p less than 0.02). Branched-chain amino acid levels were elevated in patients without cirrhosis (p less than 0.02) but not in those with cirrhosis; aromatic amino acid concentrations were increased in all (p less than 0.01). The ratio improved with remission and predicted behavior after discontinuation of treatment. Patients who deteriorated failed to improve the ratio and those whose ratio improved incompletely relapsed. The ratio correlated with histologic severity and serum concentrations of albumin, bilirubin, and gamma-globulin and not with clinical manifestations of encephalopathy. We conclude that amino acid abnormalities reflect liver dysfunction and that normalization of the molar ratio may have therapeutic and prognostic significance.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Commonly referred to as a rare cause of adrenal failure is X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a demyelinating peroxisomal disorder affecting 1: 20,000 Caucasian males. Albeit primary adrenal insufficiency is a rare entity per se, we decided to study patients with idiopathic Addison disease and establish the frequency of ALD as a cause of adrenal insufficiency. The biochemical defect of ALD was found in 5 out of 24 patients. The small number of cases in our series led us to include in our analysis the published results of two other groups of investigators. This analysis indicates that the proportion of cases in which Addison disease is attributable to ALD is age dependent. It is highest when the adrenal insufficiency manifests before 15 years. This study clearly demonstrates that the proportion of ALD in patients presenting primary adrenal insufficiency has been under-estimated.	Addison disease manifesting during the first decade of life has a high likelihood of being the first sign of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.",Remaining

This article focuses on 8 cases in which treatment with candesartan was successful in reducing both the incidence and severity of headache in hypertensive patients with migraine. The cases reported in this article showed a mean improvement in Migraine Disability Assessment score from 29.4 to 9 points and in blood pressure from 154.9/90.4 to 129.5/81.9mmHg, suggesting that candesartan is an extremely attractive option for the treatment of migraine. Although recent studies have reported the efficacy of candesartan for treating migraine, there has been no description of its potential advantages over other prophylactic drugs. The present study included patients who could not tolerate triptans for whom triptans were contraindicated, several patients for whom other migraine prophylactic drugs showed little or no effect, and one patient for whom candesartan was prescribed initially for hypertension, but was also found to be therapeutic for migraines. Thus candesartan is considered to be a unique, attractive choice of prophylactic agent for migraine complicated by hypertension.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

The lowest median adherence was observed with surgical management (14%), whereas the highest was observed with oxygenation (100%), steroid (97.8%), and blood pressure recommendation (92.3%). Variability was primarily explained by the variation in the strength of evidence of each recommendation. Treating patients with higher severity of injury as well as treatment in a Level I trauma center positively influenced adherence. Overall, adherence to BTF guidelines varies.

The relationships between the initial changes of myocardial workload, hemodynamic deterioration, and myocardial histological changes caused by acute induction of brain death are unclear. Cats (n = 15) were submitted to brain death by rapid inflation of an intracranial balloon. A further 12 cats served as a sham-operated control group. The changes in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, LV dP/dtmax, rate-pressure product (RPP), and circulating noradrenaline and adrenaline were studied during 240 min after the induction of brain death. Central venous pressure was kept constant. The hearts were histologically examined afterward. Electrocerebral activity disappeared within 30 sec after balloon inflation. At 3 min, noradrenaline and adrenaline levels had increased 75- and 40-fold, respectively, compared to pre-induction levels. The hemodynamic response was characterized by an early and rapid increase of hemodynamic variables at 2.9 +/- 0.2 min. This was followed by a second phase of normalization or deterioration. Two distinct subgroups (n = 9) became hemodynamically unstable (HDU), characterized by a systolic arterial blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, at 108 +/- 29 min, and progressively deteriorated to 67 +/- 8 mm Hg at 240 min after inflation of the balloon. The hemodynamic variables of the other, hemodynamically stable (HDS), subgroup (n = 6) normalized at 60 min after inflation. Hemodynamic deterioration of the HDU subgroup compared to the HDS subgroup was significant at 10 min after induction of brain death. The maximum values of RPP were similar in the two subgroups. Respiratory and metabolic variables at the end of the experiment were not different in both subgroups. Histological evidence of myocardial damage was present in 73% (11/15) of the brain dead cats and absent in the control group. The histological changes were identified both in hearts of HDU (6/9) and HDS (5/6) cats. In the cat, no relationships were demonstrated between the acute increase of myocardial workload, the occurrence of hemodynamic deterioration, and myocardial histological changes after rapid induction of brain death. These results may contribute to the discussion whether hemodynamic instability of the donor is an appropriate exclusion criterion for heart transplantation.",Animal-other

The questionnaire contained a scale focusing on fulfillment of adolescent needs, the Children's Depression Inventory, and items on current substance use. The results of t-tests indicated that the higher the adolescent is on the Need scale, the greater the likelihood of engaging in substance use (p < .05). Further, results indicated that cigarette smoking, drinking alcohol, and smoking marijuana are associated with significantly higher scores on the Need scale for both males and females. Although the Need scale was significantly positively correlated with the Children's Depression Inventory (r = .45, p = .0001), the two feeling states were not collinear. However, the Need scale was not significantly correlated with age, indicating that the need state is not simply a developmental process (r = .04, p = .11). The results suggest that a feeling state of unfulfilled needs may propel adolescents into the destructive behavior of substance use. A state of high wants and needs that cannot be gratified simply in a complex society may be a precursor of substance use.",Remaining

In the present study, the delivery efficiency of cationic bovine serum albumin-conjugated tanshinone IIA PEGylated nanoparticles (CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs) in rat brain was investigated. We further explored whether the protective mechanism of CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs in cerebral ischemia was associated with modulating neuronal signaling pathways. The experimental cerebral ischemia model was established to evaluate the treatment efficacy of CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs. The pharmacokinetics demonstrated that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs could obviously prolong circulation time and increase plasma concentration compared with intravenously administrated TIIA solution. The biodistribution and brain uptake study confirmed that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs possessed better brain delivery efficacy with a high drug accumulation and fluorescence quantitative level in brain. CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs effectively reduced infarction volume, neurological dysfunctions, neutrophils infiltration and neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-8; upregulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and increase TGF-β1 level in the ischemic brain. In addition, treatment with CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs markedly inhibited the mRNA expressions of GFAP, MMP-9, COX-2, p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK, downregulated the protein levels of GFAP, MMP-9 and COX-2, as well as decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK and JNK.

Conditioning of inflammatory cells reflects, at least in part, soluble mediators (such as transforming growth factor β and IL-4) that are released by cancer cells and alter the phenotype of cells of the innate immune system. Signaling pathways in cancer cells that potentiate this activity are incompletely understood. The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is a cell-signaling receptor known to promote cancer cell survival, proliferation, metastasis, and cancer stem cell-like properties. The present findings show that uPAR expression in diverse cancer cells, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma cells, promotes the ability of these cells to condition co-cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages so that the macrophages express significantly increased levels of arginase 1, a biomarker of the alternatively activated M2 macrophage phenotype. Expression of transforming growth factor β was substantially increased in uPAR-expressing cancer cells via a mechanism that requires uPA-initiated cell signaling. uPAR also controlled expression of IL-4 in cancer cells via a mechanism that involves activation of ERK1/2. The ability of uPAR to induce expression of factors that condition macrophages in the tumor microenvironment may constitute an important mechanism by which uPAR promotes cancer progression.",In-vitro-study

Here, we present results from a longitudinal analysis of annual counts of six bird species, using North American Breeding Bird Survey data from ten states (1994 to 2010). We fit overdispersed Poisson models to annual counts. Counts from successive years were linked by an autoregressive process that depended on WNV transmission intensity (annual West Nile neuroinvasive disease reports) and was adjusted by El Niño Southern Oscillation events. These models were fit using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.	Model fit was mostly excellent, especially for American Crows, for which our models explained between 26% and 81% of the observed variance. The impact of WNV on bird populations was quantitatively evaluated by contrasting hypothetical count trajectories (omission of WNV) with observed counts. Populations of American crows were most consistently affected with a substantial cumulative impact in six of ten states. The largest negative impact, almost 60%, was found in Illinois. A regionally substantial decline was also seen for American Robins and House Sparrows, while the other species appeared unaffected.	Our results confirm findings from previous studies that single out American Crows as the species most vulnerable to WNV infection. We discuss strengths and limitations of this and other methods for quantifying the impact of WNV on bird populations.",Animal-other

Although recent animal studies have tried to clarify the neural substrates of the MMN, the nature of schizophrenia-related deficits is unknown. In this study, we applied a novel paradigm developed from translational animal model studies to carefully deconstruct the constituent neurophysiological processes underlying MMN generation. Patients with schizophrenia (N = 25) and healthy comparison subjects (HCS; N = 27) underwent MMN testing using both a conventional auditory oddball paradigm and a 'many-standards paradigm' that was specifically developed to deconstruct the subcomponent adaptation and deviance detection processes that are presumed to underlie the MMN. Using a conventional oddball paradigm, patients with schizophrenia exhibited large effect size deficits of both duration and frequency MMN, consistent with many previous studies. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia showed selective impairments in deviance detection but no impairment in adaptation to repeated tones. These findings support the use of the many-standards paradigm for deconstructing the constituent processes underlying the MMN, with implications for the use of these translational measures to accelerate the development of new treatments that target perceptual and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia and related disorders.",Remaining

The problem is that an advance directive only works to hasten death when there is a life-threatening illness for which one can refuse treatment; more often than not, Alzheimer's kills the self long before it kills the body.",Non-systematic-review
727,27469020,International journal of methods in psychiatric research,Pathways from maternal depression to young adult offspring depression: an exploratory longitudinal mediation analysis.,"Maternal depression in the peri-natal period is associated with increased risk for young adult depression in offspring. This study explored mediation of these links via trajectories of child conduct and emotional problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) from ages 4-16 years old in data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort (n = 13373). Through gender-specific structural equation models, a composite measure of exposure to early maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), predicted young adult depression at age 18 (Revised Clinical Interview Schedule - distal outcome). Mediational effects were then estimated by testing which parts of joint piecewise latent trajectory models for child/adolescent conduct and emotional problems were associated with both exposure and distal outcome. For girls, only conduct problems in early childhood were consistently indicated to mediate effects of early maternal depression on risk of young adulthood depression. Some evidence for a pathway via changing levels of childhood and adolescent emotional difficulties was also suggested. For boys, by contrast, the differing models gave less consistent findings providing some evidence for a small time-specific indirect effect via early childhood conduct problems. In addition to its practice implications the current methodological application offers considerable potential in exploratory longitudinal developmental mediation studies. © 2016 The Authors International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Remaining
728,33951249,Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,Hyperactive behaviour in Angelman syndrome: the association with sleep problems and age of epilepsy onset.,"Sleep problems are common in many neurodevelopmental disorders, but little is known about how sleep is related to behavioural symptoms in Angelman syndrome (AS) or other genetic disorders. Hyperactive behaviour, sleep problems and epilepsy seem to be more common in AS than in other genetic conditions associated with severe intellectual disability. We hypothesised that both more sleep problems and earlier onset of epileptic seizures would predict more symptoms of hyperactivity. Hence, the aim of the project was to explore the association between hyperactive behaviour, sleep problems and age of epilepsy onset in individuals with AS.	All known parents/guardians (n = 115) of individuals with AS in Norway were invited to participate in this descriptive correlational study. Fifty-six individuals (49%) responded, and 42 people (25 male and 17 female; mean age 18.5 years, range 2-57 years) with genetically verified AS were included. Scores for 'hyperactivity' and 'sleep problems' were derived from questionnaire data. Information on epilepsy was obtained from medical records.	'Hyperactivity' was positively correlated with 'total sleep problems' (r = 0.46, P = 0.002) and negatively correlated with 'age of epilepsy onset' (r = -0.47, P = 0.01). 'Age of epilepsy onset' was not correlated with 'total sleep problems'. An overall multiple regression model with 'hyperactivity' as the dependent variable and 'age of epilepsy onset' and 'total sleep problems' as covariates was significant (R[2]  = 0.39, F = 8.16, P = 0.002). Hence, hyperactivity in AS could be predicted from both age of epilepsy onset and current sleep problems.	Sleep problems may increase hyperactivity symptoms in individuals with AS. The association between hyperactivity and sleep problems in AS indicates that both should be investigated together as part of routine clinical assessment and intervention for either area of difficulty. Younger age of epilepsy onset was associated with more hyperactivity in AS, which may be related to encephalopathic effects of seizures and epilepsy.",Remaining

In contrast, we used a population-based design to study such problems in teenagers who have a parent with cancer (cases) compared with matched teenagers with cancer-free parents (controls). We hypothesized that higher prevalence of psychosocial problems would be observed in cases compared with controls and that sex differences would be observed between cases and controls.	We used data from a cross-sectional population-based survey of teenagers (Young-HUNT study). Among 8,986 teenage participants, 120 of their parents had invasive cancer before the Young-HUNT study according to the Norwegian Cancer Registry. These parents had 143 teenagers (cases) participating in the Young-HUNT study. Matched on sex, age, and municipality, 429 control teenagers with cancer-free parents were drawn from the Young-HUNT study. Six psychosocial problems were studied.	No significant differences in psychosocial problems were observed between cases and controls in the total sample. Fewer case daughters reported eating problems compared with control daughters, and more case sons reported eating problems compared with control sons. More case daughters than case sons reported somatic stress symptoms and low self-esteem and displayed more caseness of anxiety/depression. These three sex differences were also observed among controls, indicating that they were general sex differences.	In this population-based study, teenagers who had a parent with cancer did not have higher prevalence of psychosocial problems than controls. Sex differences observed in previous clinically based studies were confirmed but may simply reflect sex differences observed among teenagers in general.",Remaining
730,11122949,Current psychiatry reports,The genetics of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically complex disorder. Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 (PS1) genes are fully penetrant and cause early-onset AD. Mutations in presenilin 2, a PS1 homologue, cause partially penetrant autosomal dominant AD with onset age beginning at 40 years and extending past 75 years. A fourth gene, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a risk-factor for late-onset AD. Over 40 genes have been tested as AD candidate genes, yet none has been clearly established as an AD risk factor. Linkage studies have implicated a number of chromosome regions as possible sites for late-onset AD loci with the strongest evidence being for chromosome 12. Candidate genes in this region include alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related gene (LRP), although neither has been clearly established as an AD gene. Identification of additional late-onset genes will require larger samples, more sophisticated analysis methods, and large-scale positional cloning efforts.",Non-systematic-review

[et al],Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.,"To evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) on target volume delineation for radiation treatment planning.	The data of the literature concerning the use of PET in target volume delineation are summarized. The following points are discussed for each tumor entity: biological background for the PET investigation, sensitivity and specificity of PET (with different tracers) in comparison to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and impact of PET on target volume definition. New PET tracers, which could visualize biological pathways, such as hypoxia, proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression patterns, will also be discussed.	The results of clinical studies on the integration of PET in target volume definition for lung, head-and-neck, genitourinary and brain tumors were analyzed. Fluorodeoxyglucose-(FDG-)PET has a significant impact on GTV (gross tumor volume) and PTV (planning target volume) delineation in lung cancer and can detect lymph node involvement and differentiate malignant tissue from atelectasis. In head-and-neck cancer, the value of FDG-PET for radiation treatment planning is still under investigation. For example, FDG-PET could be superior to CT and MRI in the detection of lymph node metastases and unknown primary cancer and in the differentiation of viable tumor tissue after treatment. Therefore, it might play an important role in GTV definition and sparing of normal tissue. Choline PET and acetate PET are promising tracers in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but their validity in local tumor demarcation, lymph node diagnosis and detection of recurrence has to be defined in future clinical trials. FDG-PET seems to be particularly valuable in lymph node status definition in cervical cancer. In high-grade gliomas and meningiomas, methionine PET helps to define the GTV and differentiate tumor from normal tissue. For other entities like gastrointestinal cancer, lymphomas, sarcomas, etc., the data of the literature are yet insufficient. The imaging of hypoxia, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression leads to the identification of different areas of a biologically heterogeneous tumor mass that can individually be targeted using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In addition, a biological dose distribution can be generated, the socalled dose painting. However, systematic experimental and clinical trials are necessary to validate this hypothesis.	Regarding treatment planning in radiotherapy, PET offers advantages in terms of tumor delineation and the description of biological processes. To define the real impact of this investigation in radiation treatment planning, subsequent experimental, clinical and cost-benefit analyses are required.",Non-systematic-review
732,30468246,Headache,Clinical Features Contributing to Cortical Thickness Changes in Chronic Migraine - A Pilot Study.,"The objectives of this cross-sectional pilot study were threefold: to identify regions of cortical thickness that differentiate chronic migraine (CM) from controls, to assess group differences in interregional cortical thickness covariance, and to determine group differences in associations between clinical variables and cortical thickness.	Cortical thickness alterations in relation to clinical features have not been adequately explored in CM. Assessment of this relationship can be useful to describe cortical substrates for disease progression in migraine and to identify clinical variables that warrant management emphasis.	Thirty CM cases (mean age 40 years; male-to-female 1:4) and 30 sex-matched healthy controls (mean age 40 years) were enrolled. Participants completed self-administered and standardized questionnaires assessing headache-related clinical features and common psychological comorbidities. T1-weighted brain images were acquired on a 3T MRI. A whole-brain cortical thickness analysis was performed. Additionally, correlations between all brain regions were assessed to examine interregional cortical thickness covariance. Interactions were analyzed to identify clinical variables that were significantly associated with cortical thickness.	The whole brain cortical thickness analysis revealed no significant differences between CM patients and controls. However, significant associations between clinical features and cortical thickness were observed for the patients only. These associations included the right superior temporal sulcus (R[2]  = 0.72, P = .001) and the right insula (R[2]  = 0.71, P = .002) with distinct clinical variables ie, longer history of CM, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep quality, pain self-efficacy, and somatic symptoms. Higher interregional cortical covariance was found in CM compared to controls (OR = 3.1, CI 2.10-4.56, P < .0001), such that cortical thickness between regions tended to be more correlated in patients, particularly in the temporal and frontal lobes.	CM patients have significantly greater cortical covariance compared to controls. Cortical thickness in CM patients was predominantly accounted for by CM duration, PTSD, and poor sleep quality, while improved pain self-efficacy buffered cortical thickness. While it is important to address all CM features and comorbidities, it may be useful to emphasize optimizing the management of certain clinical features that contribute to cortical abnormalities including managing PTSD, early management to shorten duration of CM, and improving pain self-efficacy and sleep quality.",Remaining
733,8102036,The American journal of physiology,Autonomic control of pancreatic polypeptide and glucagon secretion during neuroglucopenia and hypoglycemia in mice.,"Neural control of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release has not been previously investigated in the mouse. In addition, it is not known to what extent increased glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia in mice is neurally mediated vs. an effect of hypoglycemia to directly stimulate glucagon secretion at the level of the islet. Feeding or the cholinergic agonist carbachol increased plasma PP levels in conscious mice (+74 +/- 18 pg/ml vs. fasted mice and +141 +/- 17 pg/ml vs. control, respectively). Neuroglucopenia induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose or insulin-induced hypoglycemia also increased plasma PP (+79 +/- 18 and +89 +/- 11 pg/ml vs. control, respectively). These increases were abolished by hexamethonium and reduced by atropine methylnitrate (atropine). Hypoglycemia-induced hyperglucagonemia (+1,243 +/- 275 pg/ml) was reduced to 31 +/- 7% of control by atropine (+382 +/- 85 pg/ml), to 48 +/- 9% of control by combined adrenergic blockade (+601 +/- 112 pg/ml), and nearly abolished by atropine plus combined blockade (+143 +/- 41 pg/ml; 11 +/- 3% of control) or hexamethonium (+151 +/- 38 pg/ml; 12 +/- 3% of control). We conclude the following in the mouse. 1) Feeding or cholinergic agonists increase plasma PP. 2) During neuroglucopenia or hypoglycemia, plasma PP is increased via nicotinic and muscarinic mechanisms. 3) The glucagon response to hypoglycemia is predominantly the result of autonomic activation and is mediated by both muscarinic and adrenergic mechanisms.",Animal-other
734,26513639,Forensic science international,Methadone related deaths compared to all prescription related deaths.,"Methadone is increasingly implicated in unintentional overdose deaths. Despite major interventions, rates continue to remain high. One primary intervention, Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) are limited in their ability to impact this epidemic due to federal law restricting Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) from sharing data to PDMPs, despite being a major source of Methadone dispensing.	This retrospective, observational study analyzed all prescription-related deaths occurring in San Diego County during the year 2013 with a specific focus on methadone-related deaths. All patients designated by medical examiner to have died by unintentional prescription were then referenced in the California PDMP, the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES).	As a whole, patients who died had a high number of average prescriptions, 21, and averaged 4.5 different providers, and three different pharmacies. Methadone-related deaths (MRD) accounted for 46 out of the 254 total patient deaths (18.1%). Methadone prescriptions were found in 14 patients with PDMP reports, 10 of who had methadone on toxicology report. Notably, 100% of methadone prescribed by primary care specialists. MRD patients were less likely to have toxicology reports matching PDMP data compared to other related drug deaths (20.6 vs. 61.2%, p<0.0001). Of the 46 methadone deaths, only 10 (29.4%) had prescriptions for methadone recorded in the database. Out of the 51 patients with only one drug recorded at death, methadone was most common (n=12; 23.5%). While all deaths had a notably high rate of chronic prescriptions at death (68.8% compared to 2% for all patients in CURES), there was no significant difference between MRD and other drug-related deaths (73.5 vs. 67.8%, p=0.68, respectively). MRD patients were less likely than other drug patients to have matching PDMP data without any illicit substance or alcohol (14.7 vs. 41.4%, p=0.003, respectively).	Methadone is a long-acting opioid that carries a higher risk profile than other opioids. In San Diego, the great majority of MRD had no data on methadone in the statewide PDMP database, bringing to question the restriction of OTP clinics from uploading information into the database. A risk-benefit analysis should be made to consider changing laws that would allow for OTP to input data into PDMP. OTP should make it standard of care to check PDMP data on their patients. Methadone prescribed for pain management should be limited to the most compliant patients.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

The signs of involvement of the medulla, of the cauda equina, and those which complicate the basilar impressions usually develop in a progressive and not very spectacular fashion. Nevertheless, they should be recognized as soon as possible so that therapeutic measures may be taken.

Depression and recent use of health services were assessed in 542 patients aged 60 or over who were consecutively admitted to university medical services. Depression was measured by using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the depressive disorders section of the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule, which was administered by a psychiatrist.	After age, sex, race, education, and severity of medical illness were controlled for, Hamilton depression score significantly predicted hospital days in the past year, hospital days and total inpatient days (hospital plus nursing home) in the past 3 months, and number of outpatient medical visits in the past 3 months. Depressed patients had more hospital days in the past year and had more hospital days, total inpatient days, and outpatient medical visits in the past 3 months than did nondepressed patients. Associations between depression and length of index hospital stay, home health visits, nursing home days, and number of prescription medications disappeared when severity of medical illness was controlled. Mental health visits were no more common among depressed than nondepressed patients.	Depressed elderly medical inpatients used more hospital and outpatient medical services than nondepressed patients, but they did not receive more mental health services. Efforts by primary care physicians and third-party payers to identify and treat depression in this population are needed.",Remaining

741,29067401,Journal of vision,Motion-generated optical information allows event perception despite blurry vision in AMD and amblyopic patients.,"Events consist of objects in motion. When objects move, their opaque surfaces reflect light and produce both static image structure and dynamic optic flow. The static and dynamic optical information co-specify events. Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and amblyopia cannot identify static objects because of weakened image structure. However, optic flow is detectable despite blurry vision because visual motion measurement uses low spatial frequencies. When motion ceases, image structure persists and might preserve properties specified by optic flow. We tested whether optic flow and image structure interact to allow event perception with poor static vision. AMD (Experiment 1), amblyopic (Experiments 2 and 3), and normally sighted observers identified common events from either blurry (Experiments 1 and 2) or clear images (Experiment 3), when either single image frames were presented, a sequence of frames was presented with motion masks, or a sequence of frames was presented with detectable motion. Results showed that with static images, but no motion, events were not perceived well by participants other than controls in Experiment 3. However, with detectable motion, events were perceived. Immediately following this and again after five days, participants were able to identify events from the original static images. So, when image structure information is weak, optic flow compensates for it and enables event perception. Furthermore, weakened static image structure information nevertheless preserves information that was once available in optic flow. The combination is powerful and allows events to be perceived accurately and stably despite blurry vision.",Remaining

A sound diagnostic assessment is indispendable for this task. In a second step the level of severity needs to be gauged in order to clarify whether the requirement of the entry criteria of §§ 20, 21 of the German penal code are fulfilled. In a third step, significant impairments of self-control mechanisms need to be elucidated. The present article reviews indicators of such impairments regarding pedophilia.

Recent studies revealed that the ferroptosis pathway is involved in the death process of dopaminergic neurons in PD. The aberrant endosomal sorting pathway, which results in aberrant iron level in eukaryotic cells, may serve a role in the ferroptosis pathway in PD condition. However, its specific molecular mechanisms remained unclear. In the present study, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, the rank ordering of super-enhancers (ROSE) algorithm, and RNA interference (RNAi) to explore the regulatory mechanism of PD-specific super-enhancer (SE) in the endosomal sorting pathway and ferroptosis pathway of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats and cells. The ChIP assay and ROSE algorithm results showed that there are specific SEs expression in 6-OHDA-lesioned SNc of PD rats, and the most significant expression gene is Sorting Nexin 5 (SNX5). SNX5 silencing by RNAi experiments significantly decreased the level of ferroptosis in 6-OHDA-lesioned PC12 cells, suggesting the correlation between the SNX5, ferroptosis, and PD. In conclusion, this study investigated the mechanism by which PD-specific SE driven SNX5 promoted the ferroptosis level in PD models. This study further improved the understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis during PD injury and provided potential therapeutic targets and clinical diagnostic markers in PD condition.",Animal-other

Pica was also generated by forced running in a motorized wheel for 60 min as a positive function of the speed of wheel rotations at 98, 185, or 365 m/h, independent of the order of execution (Experiment 2). Voluntary running generated more pica than did forced running at 80 m/h, although the distance travelled in the former condition was 27% lesser than that in the latter condition (Experiment 3).

The aim is to investigate how fathers' alcohol use is related to the risk for substance-related disorders in offspring.	A prospective cohort study of 64 710 Swedish citizens whose fathers were conscripted for compulsory military training at ages 18-20 in 1969/70. Information on fathers' alcohol consumption, frequency of intoxication and apprehended for drunkenness, was collected during conscription. Offspring was followed for substance-related disorders from age 12 to end of follow up in 2009.	All measures of fathers' alcohol use were significantly and positively associated with risk for substance-related disorders in offspring. The associations were to a large extent explained by other risk factors in childhood. In the fully adjusted model, those with fathers in the highest alcohol consumption quintile still had a 63% higher risk (HR=1.63 CI 1.26-2.12) of substance-related disorders compared to those whose fathers' reported abstinence. The highest risk was found among offspring to fathers with alcohol-related disorders or that had been apprehended for drunkenness, with a more than two-fold increased risk for substance-related disorders.	Despite the lower risk found among offspring to fathers with sub-clinical drinking when compared to those with alcohol-related disorders, the former group accounts for a much larger proportion of all cases of substance-related disorders in the population, prompting universal prevention efforts targeting the level of total alcohol consumption in society.",Remaining

Prefrontal volume was significantly smaller in group 3 than in the other two groups, and PFC volume was significantly better than MTL volume in distinguishing between groups 2 and 3. These findings suggest that PFC atrophy is highly associated with dementia and can be considered an important predictor of the disease. It may even be a better predictor than the MTL atrophy that has been found in earlier studies.",Remaining
751,28097788,Pediatric blood & cancer,Outcome of patients with intracranial relapse enrolled on national Wilms Tumor Study Group clinical trials.,"The occurrence of brain metastases (at diagnosis or at relapse) in patients with Wilms tumor is very rare.	We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics of patients with Wilms tumor and relapse to the brain enrolled on the National Wilms Tumor Studies (NWTSs) 1-5.	Intracranial relapse was documented in 47 patients (0.5%). Of the 45 patients with adequate data, 26 (58%) patients were male. Thirty-eight (84%) patients had favorable histology Wilms tumor. In 30 patients (67%), the appearance of intracranial disease was preceded by relapse at another site. Ten patients did not have any disease-directed therapy. Surgical resection was attempted in 15 patients; gross total resection was achieved in 11 patients. Twenty-nine patients received brain irradiation; the median dose was 3,000 cGy (range 1,080-4,000 cGy). Twenty-seven patients received chemotherapy. The 5-year overall survival from the time of intracranial relapse was 28.7% (95% confidence interval: 14.4-43.1%). Nine patients (all favorable histology Wilms tumor) were alive with a median follow-up from brain relapse of 140 months (range 35-381 months). All nine survivors received radiation therapy, eight received chemotherapy, and four underwent surgery (two gross total resection, two partial resection). The overall survival after brain metastases of the NWTS-5 patients was significantly higher than the overall survival of the NWTS 1-4 patients (P value = 0.029, log-rank test).	Patients with Wilms tumor recurrence involving the brain may have durable survival, particularly those treated in recent years. Multimodality therapy including radiation and chemotherapy should be considered for these patients.",Remaining
752,16096861,Annals of vascular surgery,Management of brachial artery pseudoaneurysms secondary to drug abuse.,"Arterial pseudoaneurysm secondary to parenteral drug abuse poses a difficult problem to vascular surgeons. This study prospectively evaluates the outcome of surgical treatment for brachial artery pseudoaneurysms secondary to drug abuse. From February 1996 to July 2003, all brachial artery pseudoaneurysms secondary to drug abuse as diagnosed by duplex imaging were recruited for the study. Aneurysm excision, ligation, and radical debridement along with revascularization by axial reanastomosis were performed for all patients except one with chronic degenerative fusiform aneurysm, who received aneurysm resection and interposition reverse saphenous vein graft. Upper limb arterial flow was evaluated clinically and with hand-held Doppler in the perioperative period and during subsequent follow-up. During the study period, nine consecutive patients presented with cubital fossa swelling following deliberate drug arterial injections. Two of them suffered from thromboembolic complications and were managed conservatively by heparinization. Seven patients (six male, one female), aged 32-53, were confirmed to have brachial artery pseudoaneurysms by duplex scan and recruited for data analysis. Pseudoaneurysms ranged 10-40 mm in size. One ex-heroin abuser, who presented with median nerve palsy, underwent aneurysm resection and reversed saphenous vein interposition. The other six patients presented with painful pulsatile cubital fossa swellings. They underwent aneurysm resection, extensive debridement, and primary axial reanastomosis. There were no perioperative procedure-related complications. With an average follow-up of 38.7 months, no recurrences or neurovascular complications were detected. Routine revascularization by aneurysm resection and axial anastomosis for brachial artery pseudoaneurysm secondary to drug abuse is a safe, effective approach with low associated morbidity.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
753,33779331,Human & experimental toxicology,Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes reduce apoptosis and inflammatory response during spinal cord injury by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most common destructive injuries, which may lead to permanent neurological dysfunction. Currently, transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in experimental models of SCI shows promise as effective therapies. BMSCs secrete various factors that can regulate the microenvironment, which is called paracrine effect. Among these paracrine substances, exosomes are considered to be the most valuable therapeutic factors. Our study found that BMSCs-derived exosomes therapy attenuated cell apoptosis and inflammation response in the injured spinal cord tissues. In in vitro studies, BMSCs-derived exosomes significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PC12 cell apoptosis, reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL (interleukin)-1β and promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors including IL-10 and IL-4. Moreover, we found that LPS-induced protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) was significantly downregulated after treatment with BMSCs-derived exosomes. In in vivo studies, we found that hindlimb motor function was significantly improved in SCI rats with systemic administration of BMSCs-derived exosomes. We also observed that the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and pro-inflammatory factors was significantly decreased, while the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and anti-inflammatory factors were upregulated in SCI rats after exosome treatment. In conclusion, BMSCs-derived exosomes can inhibit apoptosis and inflammation response induced by injury and promote motor function recovery by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, which suggests that BMSCs-derived exosomes are expected to become a new therapeutic strategy for SCI.",Animal-drug-intervention
754,32721633,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Histopathological grading affects survival in patients with IDH-mutant grade II and grade III diffuse gliomas.,"Diffuse grade II and grade III gliomas are actually classified in accordance with the presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation (IDH-mut) and the deletion of both 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codel). The role of tumour grading as independent prognostic factor in these group of tumours remains matter of debate. The aim of this study was to determine if grade is an independent prognostic factor and not somehow associated to IDH mutation and 1p/19q status of the tumour.	We analysed 399 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, histologically proven World Health Organisation (WHO) 2016 grade II or grade III IDH-mut gliomas, assessed by polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry or next-generation sequencing (NGS).	The analysis included 399 patients with grade II (n = 250, 62.7%) or grade III (n = 149, 37.3%) diffuse gliomas. Median follow-up time was 105.3 months. Median survival was 148.1 months. In multivariate analysis, grade II (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.342, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.221-0.531; P < 0.001) and 1p/19q codeletion (HR = 0.440, 95% CI: 0.290-0.668; P < 0.001) were independently associated with a lower risk for death. The difference in survival remained significant (p = 0.006 in astrocytomas, p = 0.014 in oligodendrogliomas) when adjusted for histological subtype. Residual disease after surgery (or biopsy) negatively affected survival (HR: 2.151, 95% CI: 1.375-3.367, P = 0.001). Post-surgical treatment with radiotherapy + adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival compared with follow-up and other treatments (HR: 0.316, 95% CI: 0.156-0.641, P = 0.001).	In our study, histopathological grade still affects survival in IDH-mutant WHO grade II and III diffuse gliomas. This effect appears to be independent from molecular features, extension of surgical resection and post-surgical treatments. Therefore, physicians should continue to take into account tumour grade, along their molecular characteristics, for a better clinical and therapeutic management of the patients.",Remaining

After clinical evaluation, 84 drug-free patients with primary RLS (53 women; mean age 55.1 ± 12.3 years) and 76 controls (47 women; mean age 52.2 ± 15.3 years) underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and polysomnographic monitoring, and peripheral arterial tonometry to assess endothelial function for 61 patients and 69 controls. Hypertension was diagnosed in 11.9% of patients with RLS based on office measurement, and in 46.4% on the 24 h recording, with nighttime hypertension, two times more frequent than daytime hypertension. Periodic limb movement during sleep (PLMS), markers of sleep fragmentation, and systolic and mean BP non-dipping profile were more frequent among patients. BP non-dipping status was associated with older age, later RLS onset and diagnosis, RLS severity and higher sleep fragmentation. The mean 24-hour, daytime and nighttime BP values, the frequency of hypertension and the endothelial function were comparable between groups. However, both systolic and diastolic BP trajectories over a 24-hour period differed between groups. In conclusion, patients with RLS exhibit a 24-hour BP deregulation with increased frequency of systolic non-dipping profiles that could worsen the risk for CVD morbidity and mortality.",Remaining

Cases were classified as alcoholics or narcotics abusers according to the following criteria: any case record report of drinking problems or narcotics abuse, alcoholism or narcotics abuse indicated in the manner or cause of death or autopsy findings of liver change or pancreatitis due to alcoholism, or toxicology findings of narcotics (unless medically prescribed). The age-eligible cases decreased from 710 in year 1 to 691 in year 2 and 643 in year 3. Decedents classified as alcoholics rose from 18% in year 1 to 25% in years 2 and 3. The proportions classified as narcotic abusers and those with both conditions were relatively constant, averaging 7 and 5%, respectively, over the 3 years. Substance abuse itself was the manner of death for alcoholics and most of those with both conditions; 38% of the narcotics abusers were homicide victims. There were no appreciable demographic changes among substance abusers during this period.",Remaining

DNA methylation may be a possible mechanism for persistence of such memory. Here we injected the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza) into hippocampus CA1 area and prelimbic cortex during the stages of acquisition and expression of cocaine-induced place preference in C57BL/6 mice. Results showed that in CA1 DNA methylation inhibitors could restrain acquisition but had no impact on expression of the cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). On the contrary, in prelimbic cortex, 5-aza had no effect on acquisition but blocked expression. Our results indicated that DNA methylation in hippocampus is required for learning; while DNA methylation in prelimbic cortex is necessary for memory retrieval. The present finding is consistent with the role of the hippocampus as a structure contributing to cocaine-induced memory acquisition, and prelimbic cortex, a part of prefrontal cortex as an area responsible for cocaine-induced memory retrieval. In conclusion, DNA methylation does play an important role in drug-induced learning and memory although the detailed effect still calls for further research.",Animal-drug-intervention

We reviewed the English-language literature.	Depression occurs significantly more often in patients with AD than in the general elderly population. While development of depression in response to the disability and emotional stress of AD may be a contributory factor in some patients, several studies showed that depression was not, or was only seldom, related to self-awareness of AD and these studies could not explain the high prevalence figures. To overcome the overlapping phenomenology of the two diseases, specific diagnostic criteria have been developed for depression in this context. Mixed findings have come from neuropathological and neuroimaging studies, with some evidence linking the underlying neural substrate of AD and depression, suggesting an overlapping cause of primary depression and depression comorbid with AD. Few randomized controlled trials for depression associated with AD have been conducted, with rather poor results for the use of antidepressants.	Currently, depression associated with AD is not considered a separate disorder by regulatory authorities and is unlikely to be considered as such in the near future. Several obstacles remain to support such a specific position, including the heterogenous nature of depression in general and within AD itself, the lack of a distinct set of symptoms, and limited treatment.",Non-systematic-review

The study comprised 10 patients with primary enuresis and 10 normal comparable controls (age range 6-14 years). Nitrite was assayed in 'spot' morning urine samples in both the enuretics and normal controls. Enuretics were then given 50 mg indomethacin suppositories each night; urine volume, urinary osmolality and electrolytes, serum osmolality and electrolytes and urinary nitrite were assayed before indomethacin treatment and after 15 days of treatment.	The mean (sd) urinary nitrite excretion was 24.4 (19.6) micromol/L in normal children and 275.9 (111.2) micromol/L in enuretics (P<0.05). With indomethacin, the urinary nitrite concentration was significantly decreased to 141 (45.1) micromol/L (P<0.05) and associated with a significant reduction in bed-wetting episodes and voiding frequency. The functional bladder capacity was <70% of the predicted value for age in six of the patients; they had significant improvements on indomethacin, to values similar to those in patients with a nearly normal functional bladder capacity. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary volume by 41%, the night volume by 40%, clearance of free water by 46% and increased the day : night urinary volume ratio by 55%. The absolute amounts of urinary calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, urea, creatinine, and glucose were lower on indomethacin, although not statistically significantly so. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary and 'spot' morning osmolality and osmotic clearance. There were no significant changes in serum osmolality and electrolyte concentrations. Indomethacin also decreased the absolute amount of urinary sodium, chloride and potassium, fractional sodium and potassium excretion, and filtered sodium. Creatinine clearance was decreased by 20% (P>0.05) and normal 24-h urinary protein was significantly lower, by 47%, after indomethacin treatment (P<0.05).	Urinary nitrite excretion increased significantly in patients with primary nocturnal enuresis; indomethacin markedly reduced bed-wetting episodes and decreased the frequency of voiding in enuretics with small or normal functional bladder capacity, which was associated with a significant decrease in urinary nitrite excretion. Indomethacin reduced bed-wetting by decreasing the urine volume, clearance of free water and urinary electrolytes, and through possible effects on bladder and urethral contraction, by inhibiting NO and prostaglandin synthesis. NO and prostaglandins might be important in the pathogenesis of primary enuresis.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
761,20513660,Brain : a journal of neurology,Bone morphogenetic protein-7 release from endogenous neural precursor cells suppresses the tumourigenicity of stem-like glioblastoma cells.,"Glioblastoma cells with stem-like properties control brain tumour growth and recurrence. Here, we show that endogenous neural precursor cells perform an anti-tumour response by specifically targeting stem-like brain tumour cells. In vitro, neural precursor cells predominantly express bone morphogenetic protein-7; bone morphogenetic protein-7 is constitutively released from neurospheres and induces canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells. Exposure of human and murine stem-like brain tumour cells to neurosphere-derived bone morphogenetic protein-7 induces tumour stem cell differentiation, attenuates stem-like marker expression and reduces self-renewal and the ability for tumour initiation. Neurosphere-derived or recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-7 reduces glioblastoma expansion from stem-like cells by down-regulating the transcription factor Olig2. In vivo, large numbers of bone morphogenetic protein-7-expressing neural precursors encircle brain tumours in young mice, induce canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells and can thereby attenuate tumour formation. This anti-tumour response is strongly reduced in older mice. Our results indicate that endogenous neural precursor cells protect the young brain from glioblastoma by releasing bone morphogenetic protein-7, which acts as a paracrine tumour suppressor that represses proliferation, self-renewal and tumour-initiation of stem-like glioblastoma cells.",Animal-other

However, data on functional outcome according to stroke territory in patients with acute stroke treatment are conflicting and information on outcome predictors is scarce. In this retrospective study, we analysed functional outcome in 517 patients with stroke and thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy treated at the University Hospital Zurich. We compared clinical factors and performed multivariate logistic regression analyses investigating the effect of outcome predictors according to stroke territory. Of the 517 patients included, 80 (15.5%) suffered a posterior circulation stroke (PCS). PCS patients were less often female (32.5% vs. 45.5%, p = 0.031), received thrombectomy less often (28.7% vs. 48.3%, p = 0.001), and had lower median admission NIHSS scores (5 vs. 10, p < 0.001) as well as a better median three months functional outcome (mRS 1 vs. 2, p = 0.010).

Burdenko,[Evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in acromegaly using different remission criteria].,"For a long time, surgical removal of somatotropinoma using the transsphenoidal approach has been the first stage of treatment in most acromegaly patients. For the past decades, the efficacy criteria for surgical treatment of acromegaly have significantly changed, which requires appropriate correction.	We aimed to evaluate the results of transsphenoidal adenomectomy in acromegaly patients using various criteria for disease remission.	The study included patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly who underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic adenomectomy performed by a single neurosurgeon. The surgical treatment outcomes were evaluated 6 months after operative intervention based on levels of IGF-1, OGTT, and GH. The obtained data were analyzed using different threshold values for the level of GH nadir during OGTT: criteria A <2.0 ng/ml, criteria B <1.0 ng/ml, and criteria C <0.4 ng/ml to assess acromegaly remission, along with matching of the IGF-1 level to the reference range for a given gender and age.	The study included 70 patients (52 females and 18 males) with a mean age of 52.2±11.5 years (29 to 73 years). The baseline IGF-1 level exceeded the upper limit of the reference range 3.3±1.4 (1.1-7.3)-fold, on average. The baseline mean basal GH level was 34.2±41.7 (1.2-192.0) ng/ml. The mean pituitary adenoma size was 16.7±8.6 (4.3-46.0) mm; 18 (26%) out of 70 patients had pituitary microadenoma, and 52 (74%) patients had macroadenoma. Six months after surgery, acromegaly remission met criteria A in 47 (67%) patients, criteria B in 28 (40%) patients, and criteria C in 18 (26%) patients.	Our findings demonstrate that evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in treatment of acromegaly patients depends on the criteria chosen for assessing remission. This feature should be considered when comparing outcomes of surgical treatment for acromegaly in different years. Probably, introduction of the 2010 criteria should be accompanied by revision of the previous remission indicators.

Цель исследования - оценить результаты транссфеноидальной аденомэктомии у пациентов с акромегалией с использованием различных критериев ремиссии заболевания. Материал и методы. В исследование включили пациентов с впервые выявленной акромегалией, которым была выполнена трансназальная транссфеноидальная эндоскопическая аденомэктомия одним нейрохирургом. Результаты хирургического лечения оценили через 6 мес после оперативного вмешательства путем определения уровня ИФР-1 и ОГТТ с определением ГР. Полученные данные проанализировали, используя различные пороговые значения уровня ГР в ОГТТ: критерии А <2,0 нг/мл, критерии В <1,0 нг/мл, критерии С <0,4 нг/мл для оценки ремиссии акромегалии наряду с соответствием уровня ИФР-1 референсному диапазону для данного пола и возраста. Результаты. В исследование включены 70 пациентов (52 женщины и 18 мужчин), средний возраст которых составил 52,2±11,5 года (от 29 до 73 лет). Исходный уровень ИФР-1 превышал верхнюю границу референсного диапазона в среднем в 3,3±1,4 (1,1-7,3) раза. Исходно средний базальный уровень ГР составил 34,2±41,7 (1,2-192,0) нг/мл. Размер аденомы гипофиза - 16,7±8,6 (4,3-46,0) мм; 18 (26%) из 70 пациентов имели микроаденому гипофиза, 52 (74%) пациента - макроаденому. Через 6 мес после хирургического лечения критериям А ремиссии акромегалии соответствовали 47 (67%) пациентов, критериям В - 28 (40%) пациентов, критериям С - 18 (26%) пациентов. Выводы. Согласно данным нашего исследования, оценка результатов транссфеноидальной аденомэктомии при лечении больных акромегалией зависит от выбранных критериев оценки ремиссии.

Because cellular injury mechanisms and therapeutic approaches may depend on the severity of the initial insult, it is important to utilize a model in which outcomes are sensitive to injury severity. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized and subjected to sham injury (n = 23) or CCI injury at either 0.5 mm (n = 22) or 1.0 mm (n = 22) depth of impact at a velocity of 5 m/sec. At 2 days, brain-injured mice exhibited significant memory (p < 0.05) and motor function (p < 0.001) deficits compared to sham-injured mice; furthermore, mice subjected to an impact of 1.0 mm were significantly more impaired in both outcome measures than those injured at 0.5 mm (p < 0.05). The cortical lesion increased in size between 24 h and 7 days in both injury groups, but was significantly larger in the 1.0 mm group. Hippocampal cell loss was observed in the hilar and CA3 regions in both groups, and in the CA1 and dentate granule cell layers in the 1.0 mm group. Regional patterns of IgG extravasation and reactive astrocytosis were similar in the two injured groups, but changes were more persistent in the 1.0 mm group. Both levels of injury resulted in acute loss of neuronal MAP-2 immunoreactivity in the cortex and sub-region specific changes in the hippocampus. Thus, increasing the depth of impact led to similar structural alterations in neurons, astrocytes and the vasculature, but resulted in greater behavioral deficits and cortical and hippocampal cell death.",Animal-other

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of magnolol on the proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and neointima formation in vivo, as well as the related cell signaling mechanisms.	Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induced proliferation ofVSMCs was assessed using colorimetric assay. Cell cycle progression and mRNA expression of cell cycle associated molecules were determined by flow cytometry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respectively. The signaling molecules such as ERK1/2,JNK, P38 and NF-kappaB were determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, rat carotid artery balloon injury model was performed to assess the effect of magnolol on neointima formation in vivo.	Oral administration of magnolol significantly inhibited intimal area and intimal/medial ratio (I/M). Our in vitro assays revealed magnolol dose dependently induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. Also, magnolol inhibited mRNA and protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK2 in vitro and in vivo. The cell cycle arrest was associated with inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB translocation.	Magnolol suppressed proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and attenuated neointima formation in vivo by inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 through modulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK2 expression.	Thus, the results suggest that magnolol could be a potential therapeutic candidate for the prevention of restenosis and atherosclerosis.",Animal-drug-intervention

High levels of ED related symptoms were associated with 'concretised' understanding of own emotions (i.e. a greater number of food related responses), but sophisticated understanding of same sex acquaintance's emotions. They were associated with fewer positive thoughts for self, fewer negative emotions about their own behaviour, and more food responses for same sex acquaintance's behaviour. Similarities and differences were observed in the different perspectives. Limitations are discussed. Implications for further research related to this topic and relevant to EDs are briefly summarised.",Remaining

Logistic regressions indicated that daily cigarette smoking, weekly alcohol consumption, and any illicit substance use in the past year were each independently associated with an elevated likelihood of diagnosis with SUD and other psychiatric disorders (anxiety, mood, or disruptive behavior disorders), controlling for sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, family income). The associations between the use of specific substances and specific psychiatric disorders varied as a function of gender.",Human-RCT-non-intervention
771,29802210,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",Neuroprotection via AT2 receptor agonists in ischemic stroke.,"Stroke is a devastating disease that afflicts millions of people each year worldwide. Ischemic stroke, which accounts for ~88% of cases, occurs when blood supply to the brain is decreased, often because of thromboembolism or atherosclerotic occlusion. This deprives the brain of oxygen and nutrients, causing immediate, irreversible necrosis within the core of the ischemic area, but more delayed and potentially reversible neuronal damage in the surrounding brain tissue, the penumbra. The only currently approved therapies for ischemic stroke, the thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and the endovascular clot retrieval/destruction processes, are aimed at restoring blood flow to the infarcted area, but are only available for a minority of patients and are not able in most cases to completely restore neurological deficits. Consequently, there remains a need for agents that will protect neurones against death following ischemic stroke. Here, we evaluate angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 (AT2) receptor agonists as a possible therapeutic target for this disease. We first provide an overview of stroke epidemiology, pathophysiology, and currently approved therapies. We next review the large amount of preclinical evidence, accumulated over the past decade and a half, which indicates that AT2 receptor agonists exert significant neuroprotective effects in various animal models, and discuss the potential mechanisms involved. Finally, after discussing the challenges of delivering blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeable AT2 receptor agonists to the infarcted areas of the brain, we summarize the evidence for and against the development of these agents as a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.",Non-systematic-review
772,9268809,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,The Post-Stroke Depression Rating Scale: a test specifically devised to investigate affective disorders of stroke patients.,"Owing to the lack of instruments specifically constructed to study emotional and affective disorders of stroke patients, the nature of post-stroke depression (PSD) remains controversial. With this in mind, the authors constructed a new scale, the Post-Stroke Depression Scale (PSDS) which takes into account a series of symptoms and problems commonly observed in depressed stroke patients. The PSDS and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDS) were administered to a group of 124 patients, who had been classified, on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria, in the following categories: No depression (n = 32); Minor PSD (n = 47); Major PSD (n = 45). Scores obtained by these stroke patients on the PSDS and on the HDS were compared to those obtained on the same scales by 17 psychiatric patients also classified as major depression on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria. An analysis of the symptomatological profiles clearly showed that: (1) a continuum exists between the so-called 'major' and 'minor' forms of PSD; (2) in both groups of depressed stroke patients the depressive symptomatology seems due to the psychological reaction to the devastating consequences of stroke, since the motivated aspects of depression prevailed in depressed stroke patients, whereas the (biologically determined) unmotivated aspects prevailed in patients with a functional form of major depression; and (3) in stroke patients a DSM III-based diagnosis of major PSD could be in part inflated by symptoms (such as apathy and vegetative disorders) that are typical of major depression in a patient free from brain damage, but that could be due to the brain lesion per se in a stroke patient.",Remaining

Confidence and volume based domain adaptation (CAVEAT) method of co-training the three datasets on a 3D nonlocal convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was implemented to detect BM.	The performance was evaluated using sensitivity and false positive rates per patient (FP/patient) and free receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis at seven predefined (1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, and 8) FPs per scan.

774,31023125,Scandinavian journal of urology,The rate of deterioration of erectile function increases with age: results from a longitudinal population based survey.,"Background: Increasing age as a risk factor for erectile dysfunction (ED) is in most studies assumed to be a linear function. If this is not the case the assumption could lead to bias, e.g. when men of different ages are compared in interventional studies on ED. Objective: To explore the risk of developing ED over time for men from different age groups. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was sent to a number of male residents in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1992 (n = 10,458). Men were randomly selected according to year of birth to obtain several cohorts at 5-year intervals of ages 45, 50, 55 years, etc., up to the age of 85 or older. In 2003 an analogous, slightly expanded, questionnaire was sent to a random sample of men from the age cohorts 46, 51 years, etc. (n = 10,845). A total of 4072 men received both surveys, thereby constituting a group of men followed longitudinally for 11 years. The future risk of developing ED in the different age cohorts, adjusted for a number of ED risk factors, was then assessed. Results: A total of 3257 men responded to both questionnaires (response rate = 80%, age range = 56-103 years). The risk of having ED increased substantially with increasing age, both within each survey and longitudinally between the surveys. The adjusted risk of developing ED within the next 11 years increased with a factor of 10, from 1.8% at the age of 45 years at baseline to as much as 11.4% at the age of 65 years. Conclusion: Age as a risk-factor for ED is a non-linear function and should be adjusted as such to avoid bias when including men of different ages in interventional studies on ED.",Human-RCT-non-intervention

Twenty-seven patients affected by CM and 30 with MOH were enrolled. Control CSF specimens were obtained from 20 age-matched subjects who underwent lumbar puncture for diagnostic purposes, and in all of them CSF and blood tests excluded central nervous system or systemic diseases. Orexin-A and CRF were determined by radioimmunoassay methods. Significantly higher levels of orexin-A and CRF were found in the CSF of MOH and to a lesser extent in patients with CM compared with control subjects (orexin-A: P < 0.001 and P < 0.02; CRF: P < 0.002 and P < 0.0003). A significant positive correlation was also found between CSF orexin-A values and those of CRF (R = 0.71; P < 0.0008), monthly drug intake group (R = 0.39; P < 0.03) and scores of a self-completion 10-item instrument to measure dependence upon a variety of substances, the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ) in the MOH group (R = 0.68; P < 0.0003). The significantly higher orexin-A levels found in CM and MOH can be interpreted as a compensatory response to chronic head pain or, alternatively, as an expression of hypothalamic response to stress due to chronic pain. A potential role for orexin-A in driving drug seeking in MOH patients through activation of stress pathways in the brain can also be hypothesized.",Remaining

The current study examines individual data from a case-control study of stroke (n = 3489) conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. The study sought to identify whether individual socio-economic status (as measured by income from lifetime occupation) and community socio-economic status (measured in a number of ways) predicts the onset of stroke both independently and after controlling for individual risk factors (e.g., smoking, obesity and hypertension). Logistic regression results show that individual socio-economic status and all of the community socio-economic status measures predict the onset of stroke before controlling for individual risk factors. However, there is a high correlation between the various measures of community socio-economic status. Stepwise regression results suggest that average household income is the measure of community-level socio-economic status with the greatest predictive power. The results suggest that individual income and average household income are significant predictors of onset of stroke both independently and after controlling for behavioural and medical risk factors. Logistic regression analysis of the pathway suggests that individual income is a significant predictor of smoking and obesity, and that community socio-economic status is a significant predictor of heart disease, heavy drinking, diabetes, smoking and obesity.",Remaining

A study in opioid-dependent patients.,"A history of sexual violence has been related to more complex treatment needs in patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Most of the existing studies, however, included patients with various types of SUD, did not examine gender differences and focused on a small range of clinical domains. Our sample consisted of opioid-dependent outpatients treated during a three-year period in a German metropolitan region. The analysis was based on a local case register and included all patients for whom information on lifetime sexual violence was available (N=3531; 68.3% males). In a case-control design, patients with a history of sexual violence were compared to patients without these experiences regarding a wide range of clinical and social factors indicative of potential needs. Almost two thirds (65.6%) of the female patients and 10.9% of the males reported experiences of sexual violence. Victims differed from non-victims across a variety of domains, including more psychiatric symptoms and suicide attempts, more legal problems, financial and family problems, as well as a higher use of services. In contrast to a previous study among alcohol-dependent patients, no gender differences became apparent. Our findings suggest that experiences of sexual violence are an indicator for more complex needs in opioid-dependent patients of both genders. In addition to integrated trauma-informed approaches, an effort needs to be made to link addiction facilities to further institutions to meet these complex needs.",Remaining

We sought to implement this into clinical practice.	Paediatric ED triage staff underwent competency-based assessments for HIDAT with all head injury presentations 1 May to 31 October 2020 included in analysis. We determined which patients were discharged using the tool, which underwent CT of the brain and whether there was a clinically important traumatic brain injury or representation to the ED.	Of the 1429 patients screened; 610 (43%) screened negative with 250 (18%) discharged by nursing staff. Of the entire cohort, 32 CTs were performed for head injury concerns (6 abnormal) with 1 CT performed in the HIDAT negative group (normal). Of those discharged using HIDAT, four reattended, two with vomiting (no imaging or admission) and two with minor scalp wound infections. Two patients who screened negative declined discharge under the policy with later medical discharge (no imaging or admission). Paediatric ED attendances were 29% lower than in 2018.	We have successfully implemented HIDAT into local clinical practice. The number discharged (18%) is lower than originally described; this is likely multifactorial. The relationship between COVID-19 and paediatric ED attendances is unclear but decreased attendances suggest those for whom the tool was originally designed are not attending ED and may be accessing other medical/non-medical resources.",Remaining
780,24032437,Epilepsia,Cognitive behavior therapy for depression in people with epilepsy: a systematic review.,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a recommended treatment for depression in people with epilepsy (PWE); however, a recent Cochrane review found that there was insufficient evidence that any psychological therapy is effective. This conclusion provides little help to clinicians who provide interventions for depressed PWE. The aim of this review was to systematically and qualitatively review the literature on the efficacy of CBT for depression in PWE based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case series. We aim to determine patterns in the literature to inform the type of CBT, if any, that should be offered to PWE who are depressed. Databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane EBM Reviews were searched via OVID. Selection criteria included the following: (1) participants with epilepsy; (2) use of CBT; (3) valid depression outcome measure; and (4) published in peer-reviewed journal in English. Inclusions of studies were assessed by two independent researchers. We identified 14 outcome papers for 13 CBT trials including 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 case series. Positive effects of CBT on depression were reported in three of six RCTs. A review of their content revealed that all effective RCTs specifically tailored CBT to improve depression. Conversely, two of three RCTs that failed to find depression-related effects focused on improving seizure-control. This pattern was also observed in the case series. Although limited in number and having methodologic limitations, the treatment studies included in our review suggest that interventions tailored toward improving depression are possibly efficacious, whereas those that focus on improving seizure control do not appear to be. However, this review highlights that there is need for further RCTs in this area in order to confirm the possible efficacy of CBT for depression in PWE.",Human-systematic-review

Previous studies indicate that several components of emotional processing are intact in schizophrenia when subjects are instructed to attend to emotionally-evocative stimuli. However, few studies have examined whether emotional stimuli capture attention to a normal degree in people with schizophrenia when attention is directed elsewhere. The current event-related potential study examined motivated attention to task-irrelevant emotional stimuli in 35 stabilized outpatients and 26 healthy controls with a modified visual P300 oddball detection task. Participants viewed images of rare target and commonly occurring standard letter stimuli, as well as intermixed emotional (unpleasant, pleasant, neutral) pictures. Subjects were instructed to count the number of rare targets; the emotional valence of the picture stimuli was, therefore, task-irrelevant. We separately evaluated the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) and Late Positive Potential (LPP) to emotional pictures and the P300 to target stimuli. Patients and controls showed similar patterns of EPN and LPP amplitude to the emotional stimuli, such that the EPN and LPP were larger for both pleasant and unpleasant versus neutral pictures. Although patients performed worse than controls on the target counting task, both groups showed comparable P300 differentiation between target versus non-target stimuli. Emotional stimuli captured attentional resources in people with schizophrenia even when the emotional stimuli were task-irrelevant, suggesting intact motivated attention at the level of early electrophysiological responding.",Remaining

They also play vital roles in the central nervous system as significant cofactors for several enzymes, including the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and other enzymes that take part in the creation and breakdown of neurotransmitters in the brain. An imbalance in the levels of these metals weakens the structural, regulatory, and catalytic roles of different enzymes, proteins, receptors, and transporters and is known to provoke the development of various neurological conditions through different mechanisms, such as via induction of oxidative stress, increased α-synuclein aggregation and fibril formation, and stimulation of microglial cells, thus resulting in inflammation and reduced production of metalloproteins.

However, postoperative progressive spinal deformity complicates outcome in a subset of patients after surgery. We set out to determine whether the use of laminoplasty (LP) vs laminectomy (LM) has reduced the incidence of subsequent spinal deformity following intradural tumor resection at our institution.	We retrospectively reviewed the records of 238 consecutive patients undergoing resection of intradural tumor at a single institution. The incidence of subsequent progressive kyphosis or scoliosis, perioperative morbidity, and neurological outcome were compared between the LP and LM cohorts.	One hundred eighty patients underwent LM and 58 underwent LP. Patients were 46 +/- 19 years old with median modified McCormick score of 2. Tumors were intramedullary in 102 (43%) and extramedullary in 102 (43%). All baseline clinical, radiographic, and operative variables were similar between the LP and LM cohorts. LP was associated with a decreased mean length of hospitalization (5 vs 7 days; P = .002) and trend of decreased incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak (3% vs 9%; P = .14). Following LP vs LM, 5 (9%) vs 21 (12%) patients developed progressive deformity (P = .728) a mean of 14 months after surgery. The incidence of progressive deformity was also similar between LP vs LM in pediatric patients < 18 years of age (43% vs 36%), with preoperative scoliosis or loss of cervical/lumbar lordosis (28% vs 22%), or with intramedullary tumors (11% vs 11%).	LP for the resection of intradural spinal tumors was not associated with a decreased incidence of short-term progressive spinal deformity or improved neurological function. However, LP may be associated with a reduction in incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak. Longer-term follow-up is warranted to definitively assess the long-term effect of LP and the risk of deformity over time.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

795,23568168,Der Nervenarzt,[Pathophysiology of antibody-associated diseases of the central nervous system].,"Antibodies against intracellular antigens have been known since the 1980s and 1990s but in recent years antibodies against surface antigens have also been discovered. These are 'more interesting' than those to intracellular targets in two respects: they result in a better response to immunotherapy and are probably directly pathogenic, which helps to understand the disease mechanisms. There are the destructive and irreversible effects of the antibodies to antigens that are complexed with voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC complex antibodies), especially antibodies to leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) on the one hand. On the other hand, antibodies may have reversible functional effects, such as antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, which cause an internalization of these receptors but do not lead to cell destruction: LGI1 antibodies also seem to have functional, in this case epileptogenic effects. These emerging findings make plausible why antibody-reducing therapies provide opportunities for the restoration of health in affected patients.",Remaining

The first control group was younger while the second was at the same age as patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The patients were diagnosed according to DSM IIIR criteria. Information was obtained on birth and childhood, medical and surgical history, exposure to various social, psychological and biological factors as well as a family history of dementia. A structured questionnaire based on the AMDP--system was completed. Some of the variables studied reached statistical significance. First of all the sum of unfavourable environmental factors taking place during the person's childhood and elderly was predictive. Also head trauma was more frequent in patients with dementia. The findings suggest a possible etiologic role for some environmental factors in dementia of the Alzheimer's type.",Remaining

A systematic search of databases PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO through April 2011 was performed.	Two independent raters identified and examined studies that reported laboratory- or field-based measures of maximal aerobic or anaerobic capacity in children with CP aged 5 to 14 years.	The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was used by 2 independent raters to evaluate the methodologic quality of the included clinimetric studies and to identify measures used in these studies.	Twenty-four studies that used a maximal aerobic or anaerobic capacity measure were identified. Five studies reported clinimetric properties for 5 measures (2 aerobic and 3 anaerobic measures). Methodologic quality was excellent in 3 studies, showing good validity and reliability of field-based aerobic (Shuttle Run Test) and anaerobic (Muscle Power Sprint Test) measures. The studies on laboratory-based measures were rated fair, mainly because of inadequate statistics. The level of evidence was strong for good validity and reliability of the field-based tests. The level of evidence was unknown for validity and low to moderate for good reliability of laboratory-based tests.	There is a paucity of research on the clinimetric properties of measurement instruments to assess aerobic and anaerobic capacity for children with CP. Further clinimetric studies of laboratory-based measures in children with CP at all Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels, and clinimetric studies of field-based measures in children who are classified as GMFCS levels III to V are required.",Human-systematic-review
798,4053968,Drug and alcohol dependence,The psychological benefits of moderate alcohol consumption: a review of the literature.,"A review of the literature on the positive psychological benefits of light and moderate alcohol consumption suggests the following: (1) Alcohol in moderate amounts is effective in reducing stress. This has been found in both physiologic and self-report measures. (2) Low and moderate doses of alcohol have been reported to increase overall affective expression, happiness, euphoria, conviviality and pleasant and carefree feelings. Tension, depression and self-consciousness have been reported to decrease with equal doses. (3) Low alcohol doses have been found to improve certain types of cognitive performance. Included here are problem-solving and short-term memory. (4) Heavy drinkers and abstainers have higher rates of clinical depression than do regular moderate drinkers. (5) Alcohol in low and moderate doses has been effective in the treatment of geropsychiatric problems. As indicated in the text, results from many of the studies reviewed suggest that light or moderate drinking may be beneficial to psychological well-being. Liber (N. Engl. J. Med., 310(13) (1984) 846) has commented that the subject of control of alcohol intake evokes strong emotional responses, which can overshadow a logical assessment of whether or not to include 'healthy' drinking in a dietary plan.

Treatment in supine position including field verification as a prerequisite for anesthesia without intubation.,"For craniospinal axis irradiation in young children sometimes anesthesia is required. In order to minimize risks from the anesthesist's point of view supine position would be preferable to standard prone position. In case of irradiation in supine position verification of the 3-field junction in the cervical region causes problems, because there is no direct visual control. For such situations the clinical application of a new technique is presented.	For treatment planning a modern 3D planning system was necessary. Patient's positioning was done by using a vacuum-form body immobilizer and an integrated head mask. Radiation fields were placed only by table movements being calculated by the planning system in relation to a reference point at the patient's surface. In addition to common verification films specially prepared small films were used for the 3-field junction in the cervical region. These films were placed close to the patient for the whole time of each radiation session being exposed by every radiation field.	Two children (age 3 and 5 years, respectively) were irradiated as described. Twenty-eight of those specially prepared films were exposed. Two films (7%) had to be excluded because of inadequate exposure. An overlap of radiation fields was seen on 1 of the 26 remaining films (4%), whereas an unacceptable gap was not found. Acute skin reactions were comparable to those observed in patients being irradiated in standard prone position.	The presented technique for craniospinal axis irradiation in supine position including field verification was not only precise and reproducable, but also comfortable and safe for the patient. We suggest it as a new option for craniospinal axis irradiation in children.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

In the RECOS group, participants were directed towards one of five training modules (verbal memory, visuo-spatial memory and attention, working memory, selective attention or reasoning) corresponding to their key cognitive concern whereas the CRT group received a standard program. The main outcome was the total score on BADS (Behavioural Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome) and the secondary outcomes were: cognition (executive functions; selective attention; visuospatial memory and attention; verbal memory; working memory) and clinical measures (symptoms; insight; neurocognitive complaints; self-esteem). All outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), week 12 (posttherapy, T2), and follow-up (week 36, i.e., 6months posttherapy, T3).	No difference was shown for the main outcome. A significant improvement was found for BADS' profile score for RECOS at T2 and T3, and for CRT at T3. Change in BADS in the RECOS and CRT arms were not significantly different between T1 and T2 (+0.86, p=0.108), or between T1 and T3 (+0.36, p=0.540). Significant improvements were found in several secondary outcomes including cognition (executive functions, selective attention, verbal memory, and visuospatial abilities) and clinician measures (symptoms and awareness to be hampered by cognitive deficits in everyday) in both treatment arms following treatment.

To determine which ADHD symptoms and subtypes have the strongest association, we used type and frequency of symptoms on the 2014 National Survey of the Diagnosis and Treatment of ADHD and Tourette Syndrome (NS-DATA) to create symptom scores for inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity and define subtypes (ADHD-Inattentive [ADHD-I], ADHD-Hyperactive-Impulsive, ADHD-Combined [ADHD-C]). Regression methods were used to examine associations between symptoms and subtype and a composite measure of school performance. Children with ADHD-C and ADHD-I had higher adjusted odds of having reduced overall school performance (ADHD-C = 5.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.1-10.9; ADHD-I = 5.5, 95% CI = 3.1-10.1) compared with children without ADHD. All inattentive symptoms were significantly related to reduced school performance in reading, writing, and handwriting, while 6 of 9 symptoms were significantly associated in mathematics. Children with ADHD-I were significantly more likely than children with other ADHD subtypes to receive a school-based Individualized Education Program or 504 Plan. ADHD-I symptoms may be broadly linked to reduced school performance.",Remaining

All patients received a 1.5 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Sensitivity, specificity and the corrected predictive values of DST nonsuppression (50 or more ng/ml at 0800 hr, 1600 hr, or 2300 hr), adjusted to a 50% prevalence of endogenous and nonendogenous depression, varied considerably depending on the diagnostic definition used. The highest predictive value (89.9%) was found with the Taylor-Abrams criteria (sensitivity = 43.9%, specificity = 95.0%), and the lowest predictive value (53.3%) with DSM-III (sensitivity = 37.7%, specificity = 68.1%). Eliminating the patients with dexamethasone levels of less than 2000 pg/ml improved the diagnostic specificity of the DST for most of the eight definitions of endogenous depression. This further indicates that plasma dexamethasone levels should be analyzed in studies designed to explore the diagnostic utility of the DST. A significant, chance-corrected association between DST nonsuppression and the diagnosis of endogenous depression was found with clinical diagnosis (according to the International Classification of Diseases), and for four out of eight operational diagnoses (Newcastle Scale I, Newcastle Scale II, Taylor-Abrams Criteria, and Vienna Research Criteria). For the other diagnoses (Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, Michigan Discriminant Index, and Hamilton Endogenomorphy Index), no significant association was found. The RDC criterion 'early or intermittent awakening' was the only one out of 28 diagnostic criteria tested which was significantly associated with DST nonsuppression.",Remaining

The Life Outcomes of Personality Replication Project.,"The Big Five personality traits have been linked to dozens of life outcomes. However, metascientific research has raised questions about the replicability of behavioral science. The Life Outcomes of Personality Replication (LOOPR) Project was therefore conducted to estimate the replicability of the personality-outcome literature. Specifically, I conducted preregistered, high-powered (median N = 1,504) replications of 78 previously published trait-outcome associations. Overall, 87% of the replication attempts were statistically significant in the expected direction. The replication effects were typically 77% as strong as the corresponding original effects, which represents a significant decline in effect size. The replicability of individual effects was predicted by the effect size and design of the original study, as well as the sample size and statistical power of the replication. These results indicate that the personality-outcome literature provides a reasonably accurate map of trait-outcome associations but also that it stands to benefit from efforts to improve replicability.",Remaining
807,24831083,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,Graph theory findings in the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilepsy.,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of adult epilepsy. Accumulating evidence has shown that TLE is a disorder of abnormal epileptogenic networks, rather than focal sources. Graph theory allows for a network-based representation of TLE brain networks, and has potential to illuminate characteristics of brain topology conducive to TLE pathophysiology, including seizure initiation and spread. We review basic concepts which we believe will prove helpful in interpreting results rapidly emerging from graph theory research in TLE. In addition, we summarize the current state of graph theory findings in TLE as they pertain its pathophysiology. Several common findings have emerged from the many modalities which have been used to study TLE using graph theory, including structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, surface EEG, intracranial EEG, magnetoencephalography, functional MRI, cell cultures, simulated models, and mouse models, involving increased regularity of the interictal network configuration, altered local segregation and global integration of the TLE network, and network reorganization of temporal lobe and limbic structures. As different modalities provide different views of the same phenomenon, future studies integrating data from multiple modalities are needed to clarify findings and contribute to the formation of a coherent theory on the pathophysiology of TLE.",Non-systematic-review

AWD 140-190 was active at nontoxic doses after oral and intraperitoneal administration in rats and mice in a range of anticonvulsant tests. The compound was active against electrically-induced seizures (MES, ED50 rat p.o. = 2.47 mg/kg), in a genetic animal model the DBA/2 mouse, and in corneally kindled rats. It was not active against seizures induced chemically by pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline and strychnine. Effective doses in mice following both oral and intraperitoneal administration are similar indicating good oral absorption. During 14 days chronic oral treatment of mice with 10 mg/kg, no development of tolerance was observed. The protective indices (TD50/MES ED50) in rats and mice following oral administration are favorable when compared to phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. No motor impairment, evaluated with the rotarod test and by observation in the open field test, was observable following oral administration of doses up to 500 mg/kg. There was no influence on spontaneous motility and learning performance in rats and no interaction with ethanol in mice after administration of doses which are above anticonvulsant effective doses indicating the absence of central side effects. AWD 140-190 thus presents an orally active and safe anticonvulsant agent, which is structurally unrelated to anticonvulsants currently used.",Animal-drug-intervention

Alcoholic men (n = 43) and women (n = 21) who responded to notices about a research study were screened, clinically assessed and administered Wechsler Memory and Intelligence tests after 3 months of sobriety, on average. Cognitive performance was compared with that of an age-matched sample of healthy controls (n = 51).	As a group, the alcoholics achieved significantly lower scores than controls on summary indices of the Wechsler Memory and Adult Intelligence Scales and showed greater decline from estimated premorbid intelligence levels than controls. Almost 60% of the alcoholics had at least one additional psychiatric (mood or anxiety) or past substance-dependence comorbidity. There were no marked sex differences in patterns of comorbidity. Comorbid alcoholics were younger, had consumed less alcohol over their lifetime and performed between noncomorbid alcoholics and controls on all tests.	Mood and anxiety comorbidity did not necessarily compound poor cognitive test performance associated with chronic alcohol misuse. While unexpected, this finding suggests that, in this sample, poorer cognitive performance was more a function of alcoholism per se than nonalcoholic comorbidity.",Remaining

814,28707407,Psychology and psychotherapy,"Symptom fluctuations, self-esteem, and cohesion during group cognitive behaviour therapy for early psychosis.","Group cohesion has been linked to positive changes in self-esteem and in symptoms during group psychotherapy in people with psychosis. These changes may be linked to changes in symptoms as fluctuations in self-esteem have been linked to symptom fluctuations.	We aimed to determine the relationship between these three factors - group cohesion, self-esteem, and symptoms - during group cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (GCBTp). We hypothesized that group cohesion would precede changes in symptoms and self-esteem and that improvements in self-esteem would precede improvements in symptoms.	This is an uncontrolled longitudinal study recruiting from a convenience sample within two early psychosis clinics.	Sixty-six individuals from first episode of psychosis treatment programmes participated in this study and received 24 sessions of a validated GCBTp protocol. Participants answered a brief questionnaire at the end of each session, measuring their group cohesion, self-esteem, and perception of their symptoms as worse, same, or better than usual.	Orthogonal polynomial contrasts for time effects were estimated with a mixed model for repeated measures with a random cluster effect and revealed a quartic trend regarding changes in symptoms over the 24 sessions. Self-esteem, symptoms, and group cohesion were strongly linked during a given session. Also, self-esteem changes predicted changes in symptoms up to two sessions later, and symptoms changes predicted self-esteem changes at the next session. Group cohesion preceded improvements in both self-esteem and symptoms; self-esteem also predicted improvements in group cohesion.	These results suggest that self-esteem and symptoms influence each other during therapy, with improvements in one leading to improvements in the other. Group cohesion also appears to be an essential prerequisite to positive changes in self-esteem and symptoms during GCBTp.	This study emphasizes the interrelation between self-esteem improvements and symptom improvements, with improvements in one leading to improvements in the other, during group CBT for psychosis. Group cohesion, in this study, is a predictor of self-esteem and symptom improvements, suggesting that a special attention should be given to developing a strong alliance and group cohesion early on during CBT for psychosis.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG repeat in the first exon of the SCA7 gene.	Clinical and related examinations were performed in all affected or at-risk individuals from 4 Chinese families presenting with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and decreased visual acuity. The size of the (CAG)(n) array of the SCA7 gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and related techniques in the 4 families and 67 healthy controls. The relationship between expanded repeat number and age of onset was statistically analyzed.	The SCA7 mutation was identified in 2 families. Clinical study revealed that great variation occurred in the age of onset, initial symptoms, and associated signs. Meanwhile, the analysis of 11 parent-child couples demonstrated the existence of marked anticipation. Some distinct retinal changes were noted in 2 affected patients. All SCA7 patients in our series exhibited expanded CAG repeats, ranging from 44 to 85 repeats, with a strong negative correlation between repeat size and age of onset. Repeat lengths of expanded alleles showed somatic mosaicism in leukocyte DNA. There were some subtle clinical differences between the SCA7-positive and -negative cases.	Clinical variation occurred not only among the SCA7 families but also within the same kindred. Meiotic and mitotic instability of the CAG repeat in the SCA7 gene were demonstrated, and intergenerational instability of the array was associated with the clinical phenomenon of anticipation.

Forty percent to 60% of patients with OCD fail to respond to available treatments. Neuroimaging studies have highlighted an association between the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms and an increased activity of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in patients with OCD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a powerful and easy-to-use tool to modulate brain activity. Cathodal tDCS (c-tDCS) is assumed to decrease cortical excitability in the targeted brain region. We hypothesized that c-tDCS applied over the left OFC alleviates symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. We report here the case of a patient who received 10 sessions (2 mA, 20 minutes) of c-tDCS. The tDCS sessions were delivered twice a day with a 2-hour interval, with the cathode (35 cm[2]) placed over the left OFC and the anode (100 cm[2]) placed over the contralateral occipital region. No adverse event was reported. One month after the completion of the tDCS sessions, we observed a 26% reduction in severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores. These findings are consistent with a previous study reporting a similar reduction in obsessive and compulsive symptoms after a low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was given to the left OFC. Our results indicate that c-tDCS applied over the left OFC may be a suitable and safe treatment in patients with treatment-resistant OCD.",Human-case-report

Delay discounting is significantly associated with smoking initiation and success in quitting. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the relationship between delay discounting and intention to quit smoking. In 2 separate observational, cross-sectional studies, the current investigation examines the relationship between delay discounting and intention to quit smoking within groups of smokers. Experiment 1 used data collected online and an adjusting-delay discounting task; Experiment 2 used data collected in the laboratory and an adjusting-amount discounting task. A total of 242 participants and 142 participants completed the online and on laboratory experiments, respectively. In both studies, participants with higher intention to quit smoking had significantly lower rates of discounting. These associations between intention to quit smoking and rates of delay discounting further support recent characterizations of delay discounting as a candidate behavioral marker of addiction.

To address this challenge, recommendations include integrating tobacco-free policies and tobacco dependency treatment into the behavioral health care delivery system. Currently, little is known regarding levels of such integration. A 65-item Internet survey measuring integration assessed three areas: a) policies addressing the use of tobacco products; b) provision of evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment; and, c) capacity to help employees/volunteers quit tobacco use. The survey was distributed to representatives of all behavioral health programs in Wisconsin. The survey response rate was 27.1%. Programs, on average, were 40% integrated. A significant proportion of programs (20%) were less than 20% integrated. A few programs (4.3%) exceeded 80% integration. Integration of tobacco policies and treatment into the behavioral health care delivery system remains limited and there is a need for technical assistance and training.",Remaining

Although effective under optimal conditions, several drawbacks are imminent to the long-term application of these drugs due to their narrow therapeutic window, interactions with other drugs as well as the need for regular monitoring and the risk of a recurrent event versus the risk of bleeding. To overcome these downsides, novel anticoagulants are being developed; in contrast to vitamin K antagonists, these novel agents specifically and selectively block central elements of the coagulation cascade. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of selective FXa inhibitors (such as fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (such as lepirudin, bivalirudin, dabigatran etexilate) in the treatment of typical indications for conventional vitamin K antagonists, in particular, the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism.

826,26940435,Scientific reports,"Intratumoral heterogeneity identified at the epigenetic, genetic and transcriptional level in glioblastoma.","Heterogeneity is a hallmark of glioblastoma with intratumoral heterogeneity contributing to variability in responses and resistance to standard treatments. Promoter methylation status of the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is the most important clinical biomarker in glioblastoma, predicting for therapeutic response. However, it does not always correlate with response. This may be due to intratumoral heterogeneity, with a single biopsy unlikely to represent the entire lesion. Aberrations in other DNA repair mechanisms may also contribute. This study investigated intratumoral heterogeneity in multiple glioblastoma tumors with a particular focus on the DNA repair pathways. Transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity was identified in 40% of cases with variability in MGMT methylation status found in 14% of cases. As well as identifying intratumoral heterogeneity at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, targeted next generation sequencing identified between 1 and 37 unique sequence variants per specimen. In-silico tools were then able to identify deleterious variants in both the base excision repair and the mismatch repair pathways that may contribute to therapeutic response. As these pathways have roles in temozolomide response, these findings may confound patient management and highlight the importance of assessing multiple tumor biopsies.",Remaining

Within a paradigm that aimed for conceptual and methodological clarity, we presented 40 high and 38 low hypnotizable individuals with a word list either before or during hypnosis, gave them a PHA suggestion for the word list, and tested them on explicit and implicit memory tasks. In the absence of conscious recollection, highs showed equivalent levels of priming (perceptual and semantic) to lows. However, when analysis focused only on those highs who remained amnesic after the implicit memory tasks, we confirmed perceptual, but not semantic, priming.

This risk seems to be related to the COX-2 inhibitory potency and has been found with most NSAIDs except naproxen. Two main hypotheses have been advanced: an imbalance between COX-1-dependent platelet production of thromboxane and partly COX-2-dependent endothelial production of prostacyclin, and a COX-2-dependent increase in blood pressure.	Clinical trials and observational studies providing information about cardiovascular risk associated with long-term use of NSAIDs were retrieved; 14 clinical trials and 16 observational studies mentioned a follow-up of at least 6 months.	Results are ambiguous: long-term exposure seemed associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke with high-dose rofecoxib, and perhaps diclofenac, but less with other NSAIDs. In other studies, little or no increase in risk was associated with exposures shorter than 30 days. Since most NSAIDs are rarely used long term, there is little information on risks associated with long-term use. The relative risks or odds ratios associated with most drugs are mostly well below 2.",Non-systematic-review

Ethanol vapor inhalation offers an advantage over liquid diet consumption in that the onset of withdrawal can be temporally controlled more precisely, allowing studies of the development of withdrawal symptoms.	The purpose of the current study was to induce ethanol dependence in mice using an inhalation procedure and to assess withdrawal anxiety symptoms behaviorally in the elevated zero maze and in the light/dark box. Male and female mice were exposed to 3 days of ethanol vapors. Anxiety-like behavior was measured on the elevated zero maze and light/dark box at multiple time points during withdrawal.	Mice experiencing ethanol withdrawal demonstrated increased anxiety-like behaviors relative to control animals in both apparatuses.

Age- and gender-standardized weight increased after 6 months of treatment (gross: mean=5.6 kg [SD=3.9]; standardized: mean=0.6 z [SD=0.5]) and was positively correlated with weight gained after 1 month. Change in leptin levels after 2 months of treatment (mean=-0.3 ng/ml, SD=6.2) (N=48) did not predict final weight gain.	Chronic risperidone exposure in children with autism causes weight gain in excess of developmentally expected norms that follows a curvilinear trajectory and decelerates over time.

All selected studies were assessed for risk of bias. Owing to the heterogeneity of studies in terms of study design and analysis and the use of overlapping datasets across studies, studies were analysed thematically per outcome, and the evidence was synthesised on different health outcomes without formal meta-analysis.	 41 studies met the inclusion criteria, and focused on suicide, mental health, self rated health, mortality, and other health outcomes. Of those studies, 30 (73%) were deemed to be at high risk of bias, nine (22%) at moderate risk of bias, and only two (5%) at low risk of bias, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Although there were differences across countries and groups, there was some indication that suicides increased and mental health deteriorated during the crisis. The crisis did not seem to reverse the trend of decreasing overall mortality. Evidence on self rated health and other indicators was mixed.	 Most published studies on the impact of financial crisis on health in Europe had a substantial risk of bias; therefore, results need to be cautiously interpreted.

Interestingly, some lymphoma cells form characteristic spindle shapes; these cells are found in some variants of malignant lymphoma, such as primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma, but they have not been reported in PCNSL or LC. Here, we provide an autopsy case report of LC in a 69-year-old immunocompetent man who developed rapidly progressive cognitive decline and died on day 68 after the episode despite treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone administration. MRI revealed high signal intensities on T2-weighted images of the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord without gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted images. On autopsy, diffuse infiltrative atypical cells were seen; these cells were positive for CD20 and CD79a and negative for GFAP, CD3, and CD5 on immunohistochemistry, resulting in a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, specifically LC. We found characteristic spindle-shaped cells, especially in the cerebral cortex. This is the first report showing that lymphoma cells in PCNSL can take on a spindle-shaped form. It is difficult to recognize these spindle-shaped cells as lymphoma cells on hematoxylin and eosin staining and diagnose them correctly with small biopsy specimens without immunohistochemistry.

To comprehensively disentangle potentially causal aspects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) to inspire new drug targeting and improved prevention.	This genetic association study was conducted using 2-sample univariable and multivariable mendelian randomization. Independent genetic variants associated with modifiable risk factors were selected as instrumental variables from genomic consortia. Outcome data for AD were obtained from the European Alzheimer & Dementia Biobank (EADB), generated on August 31, 2021. Main analyses were conducted using the EADB clinically diagnosed end point data. All analyses were performed between April 12 and October 27, 2022.	Genetically determined modifiable risk factors.	Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for AD were calculated per 1-unit change of genetically determined risk factors.	The EADB-diagnosed cohort included 39 106 participants with clinically diagnosed AD and 401 577 control participants without AD. The mean age ranged from 72 to 83 years for participants with AD and 51 to 80 years for control participants.

848,8558175,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,Transfection of an invasive human astrocytoma cell line with a TIMP-1 cDNA: modulation of astrocytoma invasive potential.,"Malignant astrocytomas are highly invasive tumors which infiltrate diffusely into regions of normal brain. The degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases is thought to be one of the most important steps in the process of tumor invasion. However, the activity of most matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can be modulated by simultaneously secreted inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs). We have previously shown that an imbalance between the levels of MMPs and TIMPs may be essential in the determination of the invasiveness of certain human malignant astrocytoma cell lines. To determine if the up-regulation of TIMP genes and gene products could modulate the invasiveness of human malignant astrocytoma cells, in the present study we have transfected a highly invasive astrocytoma cell line, SF-188, with an expression vector carrying a full-length TIMP-1 cDNA. The parental SF-188 astrocytoma cell line overexpresses the 72-kDa and 92-kDa type IV collagenases with little expression of TIMPs-1 and -2. Following transfection with TIMP-1, SF-188 astrocytoma clones expressed the 0.9 kb TIMP-1 message by northern analysis, and produced a 21 kDa metalloproteinase inhibitor by reverse zymography. The stable TIMP-1 SF-188 transformants demonstrated morphological changes and diminished growth rates in soft agar when compared to controls. The invasion of successfully TIMP-1 transfected astrocytoma cells across matrigel-coated filters was significantly decreased over controls. These results suggest that upregulation of TIMP-1 expression in SF-188 astrocytoma cells has decreased their in vitro invasive potential.",In-vitro-study

Circadian disruption has been implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis in experimental studies. We prospectively examined the association between sleep duration and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).	In the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, 75 828 postmenopausal women reported habitual sleep duration at baseline 1993-1998. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of CRC and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI).	We ascertained 851 incident cases of CRC through 2010, with an average 11.3 years of follow-up. Compared with 7 h of sleep, the HRs were 1.36 (95% CI 1.06-1.74) and 1.47 (95% CI 1.10-1.96) for short (≤5 h) and long (≥9 h) sleep duration, respectively, after adjusting for age, ethnicity, fatigue, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), physical activity, and waist to hip ratio. The association was modified by the use of HRT (P-interaction=0.03).	Both extreme short and long sleep durations were associated with a moderate increase in the risk of CRC in postmenopausal women.

D11S931 has been shown to lie close to a translocation breakpoint associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders in a large Scottish family. Because glutamate receptor genes are excellent candidates for psychiatric disorders, we have investigated the physical distance of this gene from the translocation breakpoint on chromosome 11. We have shown that the mGluR5a gene lies at least 850 kb from the breakpoint and, hence, cannot be directly disrupted in translocation carriers. However, a long range position effect of the translocation on this gene, or co-segregation of the translocation with a mutant allele of mGluR5a cannot be ruled out.",Remaining

Participants in the Women's Health Initiative who had Type 2 diabetes and data on depressive symptoms (N=8895) were included in the analyses. In multivariable linear regression models controlling for sociodemographic, medical and psychosocial covariates, we examined the main effect of depressive symptoms, as well as the interactions between depressive symptoms and antidepressant use, and between depressive symptoms and optimism, on sleep disturbance, physical activity, physical health-related quality of life; and global quality of life.	In all, 16% of women with Type 2 diabetes reported elevated depressive symptoms. In multivariable analyses, women with depressive symptoms had greater sleep disturbance (P<0.0001) and lower global quality of life (P<.0001). We found evidence of significant statistical interaction in the models for quality-of-life outcomes: the increased risk of poor physical health-related quality of life associated with antidepressant use was stronger in women without vs with depressive symptoms, and the association between greater optimism and higher global quality of life was stronger in women with vs without depressive symptoms.	To improve health behaviours and quality of life in women with Type 2 diabetes, sociodemographic and medical characteristics may identify at-risk populations, while psychosocial factors including depression and optimism may be important targets for non-pharmacological intervention.",Remaining

A search was undertaken for the diagnosis of paracetamol overdoses in the diagnoses registry of the National University Hospital of Iceland from 2004 to 2009 serving a population of 219,249 inhabitants. Relevant information was collected from medical records.	A total of 1913 drug-related poisoning episodes were identified and reviewed, 352 (18%) involved paracetamol overdoses. The annual incidence of paracetamol overdoses declined from 30.0 (2004) to 16.0/100,000 per year (2009) (p < 0.05). The female/male ratio was 3.0 and the largest age group was 16-25 years. After the initial examination, 26% were discharged home. Hospitalized index visits were 182 with accidental overdoses constituting 16 (9%) with no gender difference. Compared with intentional overdose the accidental group had higher aminotransferases (p < 0.005). ALF occurred in 3.8% (7/182) of the index visits and the incidence was 0.7/100,000 per year. In the intentional group, 1.2% (2/163) developed ALF versus 25% (4/16) of the accidental group (p = 0.001). Only one patient died from ALF and none underwent liver transplantation.	The annual incidence of paracetamol overdoses was high in this population-based study but declined.

Yet there is an under-representation of the older population in the BP literature. We present extensive interview data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, dealing with a population-based sample of Danish twins aged 70-102, and describing the 1-month prevalence of BP and the development of BP over time. The associations between BP and education, self-rated health, other health problems, lifestyle factors, and physical and mental function were also investigated. Data were analysed in a cross-sectional analysis for all answers given at entry into the study and in a longitudinal analysis for participants in all four surveys. Associated factors were analysed for the cross-sectional sample using univariate and multivariate analysis accounting for the non-independence of twins in complete pairs. The overall 1-month prevalence of BP was 25% and differed significantly between men and women. The variations in prevalence between the age groups and over time were negligible. The majority of participants in all four surveys had either not experienced BP during the previous month or had done so on one occasion only. Education was not associated with BP. Self-rated health was associated with BP in a significant 'dose-response' like pattern. BP was associated with bone and joint disorders, migraine headaches, lung disease, cardiovascular disorders and gastric ulcer, but not neurologic or endocrinologic diseases. BP sufferers had significantly lower scores on physical but not on mental functioning. We conclude that BP is a common symptom in old age; however, the prevalence does not change with increasing age.

Previously, the decreased C4b-binding protein (C4BP), a potent circulating soluble inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathways of complement, was reported to be associated with risk of schizophrenia. Here, we analyzed 4 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of C4BPB and 5 SNPs of C4BPA in a group of 556 schizophrenia patients and a matched group of 610 healthy controls to see if the genes C4BPB and C4BPA, which encode C4BP, may confer a susceptibility to schizophrenia. Comparing the genotype and allele frequencies of those SNPs between cases and controls, we found no association between the C4BPB/C4BPA variants and schizophrenia. Our results provided preliminary evidence that C4BPB/C4BPA may not confer susceptibility to schizophrenia among Han Chinese.

We hypothesized that depressive symptoms are also linked to low levels of secondary control (i.e., influencing the psychological impact of objective conditions by adjusting oneself to fit them). To test the hypothesis, we developed the Secondary Control Scale for Children (SCSC), examined its psychometrics, and used it to assess the secondary control-depression symptomatology association. In a large adolescent sample, the SCSC showed factorial integrity, internal consistency, test-retest stability, convergent and discriminant validity, and accounted for more than 40% of the variance in depression symptoms. Consistent with evidence on risk and gender, depression symptoms were more strongly associated with secondary control in girls and primary control in boys.

Most of these tumors are mitotically low in activity in accord with their benign clinical course. However, increased mitotic activity has been noted in several cases, one of which had an ultimately fatal outcome. Here, the authors present a tumor showing angiocentric glioma and glioblastoma-like features, with recurrence of the lower-grade component after radiotherapy. A 15-year-old boy presented with a 3-month history of progressive left-sided weakness and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large heterogeneous mass in the right frontal lobe, with mild post-Gd enhancement. A gross-total resection was obtained. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue revealed a tumor with 2 distinct appearances: 1) a mildly to moderately cellular infiltrating tumor with angiocentric glioma characteristics, and 2) a markedly cellular glioblastoma-like tissue with necrosis and microvascular proliferation. The patient received a course of postoperative radiotherapy to 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions administered over the course of 6.5 weeks, but his tumor recurred 4 months after resection. A second resection was then performed. The recurrent tumor exhibited radiation-induced changes and persistent characteristics of angiocentric glioma, but it had fewer malignant features; the mitotic activity was lower, and there was no necrosis or microvascular proliferation. The findings in this case, along with those in several previously reported cases, suggest that angiocentric gliomas may have a malignant variant or malignant transformation. Angiocentric gliomas with malignant features tend to recur, for which surgical intervention followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be offered as a therapeutic option.",Human-case-report

This systematic review and meta-analysis of three scientific databases examined the prevalence of the use of intoxicating substances, those tending to excite or stupefy the user on a psychoactive level, before or during sex, among young adults (18-29 years old). A total of 55 unique empirical studies met the inclusion criteria (48,145 individuals; 39% males), were assessed for risk of bias using the tools of Hoy et al.

Nonetheless, significant differences were identified between different intoxicating substances, with the use of alcohol (35.10%; 95% CI: 27.68%, 43.31%), marijuana (27.80%; 95% CI: 18.24%, 39.92%), and ecstasy (20.90%; 95% CI: 14.34%, 29.45%) significantly more prevalent than that of cocaine (4.32%; 95% CI: 3.64%, 5.11%), heroin (.67%; 95% CI: .09%, 4.65%), methamphetamine (7.10%; 95% CI: 4.57%, 10.88%), and GHB (6.55%; 95% CI: 4.21%, 10.05%).

866,12511771,Stroke,Differential regulation of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.,"Angiogenesis occurs after cerebral ischemia, and the extent of angiogenesis has been correlated with survival in stroke patients. However, postischemic angiogenesis is short-lived and may be completely terminated within a few weeks after ischemic insult. The molecular mechanism underlying the dissolution of postischemic angiogenic processes is poorly understood. Although the expression of angiogenic genes has been studied in ischemic stroke models, the activation of angiostatic genes after cerebral ischemia has not been investigated. Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and TSP-2 are naturally occurring angiostatic factors, which inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. The aim of the present study was to explore the expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2 in relation to the evolution of angiogenic process in a focal ischemia model in rats.	Rats underwent cortical ischemia in the middle cerebral artery territory for 60 minutes and reperfusion for up to 2 weeks. Northern and Western blot analysis were used to study the temporal profile of TSP-1 and TSP-2 expression at the mRNA and protein level, respectively. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies were used to examine the spatial expression patterns. Double immunostaining was applied to define the cellular origins of TSP-1 and TSP-2.	A biphasic expression of TSP-1 was noted after ischemia, peaking at 1 and 72 hours. Endothelial cells in the leptomeninges were the only source of the first TSP-1 peak, whereas endothelial, glial, neuronal, and macrophage cells contributed to the second peak of TSP-1 expression. TSP-2 expression occurred much later and in a monophasic manner, peaking 2 weeks after ischemia. TSP-2 immunoreactivity was observed in endothelial, neuronal, and macrophage, but not glial, cells. TSP-1 was expressed before the peak of angiogenesis, whereas robust TSP-2 expression occurred at the peak of angiogenesis and continued into the period when angiogenesis had completely resolved.	Robust expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2, 2 major angiostatic factors, was noted in the ischemic brain with different temporal expression profiles from different cellular origins. The expression of these angiostatic factors, especially TSP-2, likely contributes to the spontaneous resolution of postischemic angiogenesis. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance of angiogenic and angiostatic factors in the ischemic brain.",Animal-other

We report here a simple and rapid strategy to detect the precise number of the CAGs. After the DNA fragment containing the CAG repeats is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, a primer extension is carried out; the extension of the end-labelled reverse primer adjacent to 3' end of CAG repeats stops at the first T after CAG repeats with the incorporation of dideoxy ATP in the reaction mixture. The resultant primer products are analysed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. This method could be quite useful to detect not only CAG repeats in SBMA but also other polymorphic dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats.",Remaining
870,18346734,Experimental neurology,AAV2-mediated gene transfer of GDNF to the striatum of MPTP monkeys enhances the survival and outgrowth of co-implanted fetal dopamine neurons.,"Neural transplantation offers the potential of treating Parkinson's disease by grafting fetal dopamine neurons to depleted regions of the brain. However, clinical studies of neural grafting in Parkinson's disease have produced only modest improvements. One of the main reasons for this is the low survival rate of transplanted neurons. The inadequate supply of critical neurotrophic factors in the adult brain is likely to be a major cause of early cell death and restricted outgrowth of fetal grafts placed into the mature striatum. Glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor that is crucial to the survival, outgrowth and maintenance of dopamine neurons, and so is a candidate for protecting grafted fetal dopamine neurons in the adult brain. We found that implantation of adeno-associated virus type 2 encoding GDNF (AAV2-GDNF) in the normal monkey caudate nucleus induced overexpression of GDNF that persisted for at least 6 months after injection. In a 6-month within-animal controlled study, AAV2-GDNF enhanced the survival of fetal dopamine neurons by 4-fold, and increased the outgrowth of grafted fetal dopamine neurons by almost 3-fold in the caudate nucleus of MPTP-treated monkeys, compared with control grafts in the other caudate nucleus. Thus, the addition of GDNF gene therapy to neural transplantation may be a useful strategy to improve treatment for Parkinson's disease.",Animal-drug-intervention

Premenopausal women often had a low apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), but there was a discrepancy between the low AHI and the amount of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) needed to control the SDB, and there was a need for higher pressures in overweight premenopausal SDB women (mean 9.1 +/- 1.9 and 10.1 +/- 2.6 cmH(2)O).	Normal-weight premenopausal SDB women often present with atypical sleep complaints of chronic insomnia and parasomnias. Clinical attention paid to craniofacial features and use of specific scales such as Mallampati help with the suspicion of the presence of SDB, and a low AHI is unrelated to the positive clinical impact of nasal CPAP treatment.",Remaining

Two-hundred-thirty-four patients, who verbally self-reported they were preoperatively fully potent and strongly motivated to maintain postoperative EF, underwent a BNSRRP. A comprehensive medical and sexual history was obtained on hospital admission the day prior to surgery. Subjectively reported potency rate was compared with the scores of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF).	The EF domain of the IIEF showed a baseline normal EF in only 43% of the subjects. In contrast, 13% had a mild erectile dysfunction (ED), 8% had a mild to moderate ED, 8% complained of a moderate ED, and as many as 28% reported severe EF impairment. Interestingly, 38% of the patients with severe ED did not attempt any intercourse during the last 4 weeks prior to surgery.	A significant proportion of patients with clinically localized pCa and self-reported total potency already had suffered from ED preoperatively. Incorrect timing of questionnaires administration, the potential influence of preoperative patient's psychological distress, and the implication of the patient's partner's psychological and sexual health may be contributing factors to the contradictory finding. The preoperative use of validated questionnaire may help to identify patients who can actually expect to regain potency following a BNSRRP.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
873,15673232,Adolescence,Eating attitudes and their psychological correlates among Turkish adolescents.,"This study examined the eating attitudes and psychological characteristics of Turkish late adolescents. Seven hundred eighty-three university students were administered the Eating Attitudes Test, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Social Physique Anxiety Scale. More than one in ten (9.2% of the males and 13.1% of the females) had abnormal eating attitude scores. Chi-square analysis revealed that there were no significant differences in the prevalance of abnormal eating behaviors based on gender. Analysis of covariance indicated that participants who had disturbed eating attitudes had lower self-esteem, higher social physique anxiety, and higher trait anxiety than those who had normal eating attitudes. It was concluded that the prevalence of disturbed eating attitudes was high among these Turkish late adolescents, and that disturbed eating attitudes were related to several psychological characteristics.",Remaining

A 53-year-old female had developed slowly progressive dementia and atactic gait since the age of 45. No myoclonic jerks and periodic synchronous discharges were observed throughout the illness. The neuropathological study revealed that many amyloid plaques and widespread Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) appeared in the cerebral cortex. Characteristically, the plaques reacted with anti-prion protein and none of them reacted with anti-beta protein, and they were made of many components, including amyloid cores, macrophages laden with lipid granules and/or degenerated neurites. Neuropil threads were seen mainly in amyloid plaques. Moreover, plaques appeared which were confluent and laminar in arrangement in the fifth and sixth cortical layers and had a close relationship to the neuronal loss. There was no spongiform change in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. The cerebellum was almost intact except for a few amyloid plaques. Ultrastructurally, some of the plaques simulated kuru plaques and others had many degenerated neurites possessing paired helical filaments and other accumulated organelles. GSS has been proposed to include cases with progressive ataxia, dementia and massive multifocal plaques in the brain with or without cerebral spongiform changes. The case presented here is a very peculiar case of GSS. Recently, similar cases have been reported in some large families, diagnosed as familial Alzheimer's disease. These cases may be a telencephalic form with numerous NFTs of GSS.",Human-case-report

The association of epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia has been rarely reported in the literature, and several loci have been identified. Absence epilepsy and exercise-induced paroxysmal dystonia appear to be very uncommon, although some reports mentioned the association in sporadic and familial cases.

Although current guidelines do not recommend routine blood culture in uncomplicated cellulitis, their implementation in clinical practice remains challenging. We therefore aimed to assess the frequency, determinants and microbiology of bacteremia in hospitalized patients with uncomplicated cellulitis.	We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all adult patients admitted at a primary-care hospital with a diagnosis of community-acquired uncomplicated cellulitis during a 4-year period. We looked at the factors associated with blood cultures sampling and at the incidence, determinants and microbiology of bacteremia in this population.	Among the 476 patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of cellulitis, 250 (52.5%) had blood cultures. Fever, high C-reactive protein and lymphatic insufficiency were significantly associated with the sampling of blood cultures. Twelve (4.8%) patients had bacteremia. Alcoholism and duration of hospitalization were associated with bacteremia in multivariate analysis. Among the 12 patients with bacteremia, 9 had Streptococcus sp. and 3 had Staphylococcus aureus infection.	In our study population with uncomplicated cellulitis, representative of unselected population admitted at primary-care hospitals, bacteremia was uncommon and not associated with discriminant patient characteristics, except for alcohol abuse. Episodes of bacteremia were exclusively due to gram-positive cocci susceptible to co-amoxicilin, a common first-line empirical therapy. In accordance with existing guidelines, we do not recommend to collect blood for cultures in uncomplicated cellulitis. Clinicians' awareness of guidelines and of the poor yield of blood cultures could reduce useless investigation.",Remaining
878,17917563,International clinical psychopharmacology,High-quality remission: potential benefits of the melatonergic approach for patients with major depressive disorder.,"Full remission of symptoms is the goal for the acute treatment of depression, because incomplete remission is associated with poor outcomes including higher risk of relapse and chronicity. The current definitions for remission (e.g. a score of </=7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), however, allow for the presence of residual symptoms of depression even if remission is attained. The focus now is on the quality of remission, that is, ensuring a minimum of such residual symptoms, because the consequences of low-quality remission also include impairment in psychosocial functioning. The most common residual symptoms are sleep disturbances, fatigue, and disinterest. Sleep-associated residual symptoms are particularly common, and are a major concern because most current treatments fail to adequately address sleep disturbances and may even aggravate them. Other side effects of current treatments, such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction, may also reduce the quality of remission. A novel approach to the treatment of depression with agomelatine, a melatonergic MT1 and MT2 receptor agonist and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, may be an effective treatment that improves the quality of remission, as it combines good efficacy with positive effects on sleep, neutral effects on sexual function, and a favorable side effect profile.",Non-systematic-review

Policy makers and service providers aiming to reduce children's disruptive behavior problems must often choose between importing an intervention developed abroad or instead developing or using a 'homegrown' (i.e., local) intervention. No comprehensive comparison of these interventions exists.	We performed a multilevel meta-regression of 129 randomized trials (374 effect sizes) of transported and homegrown parenting interventions. We identified trials by searching the included trials lists of systematic reviews, found through searches in 6 databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE). Trials that had not yet been reviewed were found by searching the same databases. Primary outcome was the mean difference in effectiveness between transported and homegrown interventions to reduce disruptive child behavior. We also compared this differential effectiveness for various intervention 'brands' (e.g., Incredible Years and Triple P Positive Parenting Program) and geographical regions (e.g., North America and Europe).	Transported and homegrown interventions did not differ in their effectiveness to reduce disruptive child behavior (d = 0.10, not significant). Results were robust across intervention brands and geographical regions. Six trials on transported interventions in Hong Kong, Iran, and Panama suggest promising results for transporting interventions to 'nonwestern' countries, whereas one trial in Indonesia does not.	Parenting interventions based on the same principles led to similar outcomes, whether transported or homegrown.

To study interobserver variability in scoring for objective SCORAD criteria and to optimize the scoring guidelines.	Three scoring sessions were organized in 1993-1994 in Hamburg, Bordeaux and Rotterdam totalizing 19 patients (14 children and 5 adults) and 23 physicians, among whom 12 participated in at least 2 scoring sessions; 169 evaluation sheets have been processed using the SCORAD File Marker Pro software. At each session, total body photographs and close-up views were taken of each patient, and this material was reviewed at the final evaluation.	The extent of lesions according to the rule of nines showed interobserver variability mostly for patients with lesions of moderate intensity involving 20-60% of body surface. Intensity items were scored with more consistency overall, but variations subsided especially for oozing/crusts and lichenifications. Low and high scorer profiles and the benefit of training were noted.	This study has allowed to optimize clinical scoring using the SCORAD system.

The study proceeded in the form of a statistical analysis of assessments made on 46 patients according to RLS85 and GCS (i.e., when comparison was with GCS) and on 28 patients according to RLS85 and E2CS(M). In all 74 cases two physicians participating as 'observers' carried out the assessments. They were both contacting the patient--not together but--successively within a time interval of less than 20'. Hence the data appeared as 'pairwise' observations for any of the three scales above. The results of the analysis, arising from a rather strict statistical reasoning, can be summarized as follows: (1) The rank correlation coefficient r(s) between: (i) RLS85 and GCS sum score, (ii) RLS85 and E2CS(M), was found to be at a satisfactory level meaning that all three scales indicate almost the same 'ranking order of severity'. (2) Reliability was compared by taking into account as to what extent the two observers agreed on RLS85 and--simultaneously--disagreed on the other scale. The 'sign' test was applied and as a result RLS85 proved to be more reliable than; (i) GCS (EMY profile), (ii) GCS sum score, and (iii) E2CS(M), in all the above mentioned at a high level of significance. (3) Apart from the test above, some values of the index kappa (kappa) of interobserver agreement were calculated. Those corresponding to RLS85 are considerably higher. In particular the overall value based on 74 pairwise assessments amounted to kappa = 0.733 associated with a standard error sigma(kappa) = 0.061. This was a satisfactory result regarding the features of RLS85.

Though barriers to implementing systematic screening for alcohol and drug use have been examined in urban settings, less is known about screening in rural primary care.	To identify current screening practices, barriers, facilitators, and recommendations for the implementation of substance use screening in rural federally qualified health centers (FQHCs).	As part of a multi-phase study implementing electronic health record-integrated screening, focus groups (n = 60: all stakeholder groups) and individual interviews (n = 10 primary care providers (PCPs)) were conducted.	Three stakeholder groups (PCPs, medical assistants (MAs), and patients) at three rural FQHCs in Maine.	Focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed. Themes surrounding current substance use screening practices, barriers to screening, and recommendations for implementation were identified and organized by the Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework.	Identifying the problem: Stakeholders unanimously agreed that screening is important, and that universal screening is preferred to targeted approaches. Adapting to the local context: PCPs and MAs agreed that screening should be done annually. Views were mixed regarding the delivery of screening; patients preferred self-administered, tablet-based screening, while MAs and PCPs were divided between self-administered and face-to-face approaches. Assessing barriers: For patients, barriers to screening centered around a perceived lack of rapport with providers, which contributed to concerns about trust, judgment, and privacy. For PCPs and MAs, barriers included lack of comfort, training, and preparedness to address screening results and offer treatment.	Though stakeholders agree on the importance of implementing universal screening, concerns about the patient-provider relationship, the consequences of disclosure, and privacy appear heightened by the rural context. Findings highlight that strong relationships with providers are critical for patients, while in-clinic resources and training are needed to increase provider comfort and preparedness to address substance use.",Remaining

This case-control study performed in a US clinical sample of heavy drinkers, replicates the previously reported association between ALD and rs738409 polymorphism in the PNPLA3 gene in heavy drinkers. This association persisted after accounting for the subject's diabetes status.	Patients of European ancestry with a history of ALD were identified (n = 169). Controls consisted of patients without ALD who were from the same cohorts and were ≥ 30 years of age, had lifetime total years drinking ≥20 and lifetime maximum drinks per day ≥12 (n = 259). Patients were genotyped for 40 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected for the purpose of testing their association with ALD. The association of each SNP with ALD was tested using a logistic regression model, assuming log-additive allele effects. Bonferroni correction was applied and multivariable logistic regression models were used to account for relevant covariates.	Age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) distributions were similar between cases and controls. Diabetes was more prevalent in the ALD cases. Three SNPs were associated with ALD at the nominal significance level (rs738409 in PNPLA3, P = 0.00029; rs3741559 in AQP2, P = 0.0185; rs4290029 in NVL, P = 0.0192); only PNPLA3 rs738409 SNP was significant at the Bonferroni-corrected P-value threshold of 0.00125. Association results remained significant after adjustment for diabetes status.	Our case-control study confirmed that PNPLA3 rs738409 SNP is associated with ALD.

Cerebral small artery disease has been considered as one of the main causes of LA. However, since the term 'venous collagenosis' (VC) was proposed in an atrophy research in 1995, there have been pathological and neuroimaging studies proving the association between the venous system and LA in aging, Alz-heimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease.	Autopsy studies confirmed that thickening of the lumen wall in venules, which results from the deposition of collagen I and III, leading to vessel stenosis or occlusion, is closely associated with LA. Susceptibility-weighted imaging research revealed a controversial association of deep medullary veins and LA in vivo, regarding which there are no standard criteria currently. Nevertheless, retinal venous changes had been reported to increase the risk of LA development, providing a novel way for in vivo evaluation. As for the internal jugular vein, jugular venous reflux could double the LA score in aging and modulate circulation of cerebral spinal fluids. Key Messages: Disruption of the venous system was notably associated with LA in aging, AD, and Parkinson's disease post-mortem and in in vivo models. The venous pathological changes may induce cerebral hypoperfusion, drainage system disruption, and vasogenic oedema in the veins around the periventricular white matter. The clarification of VC in LA may provide an early prevention and early treatment strategy for LA patients.",Non-systematic-review

Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinoma (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one). Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS.

However, specific understanding of the roles played, especially the mechanistic and functional roles, by long ncRNAs in AD is still elusive. Using mouse tissue qPCR assays we observe changes in the expression levels of 41 lncRNAs in AD mice of which only 7 genes happen to have both human orthologs and AD associations. Post validation of these 7 human lncRNA genes, MEG3 and MALAT1 shows consistent and significant decrease in AD cell, animal models and human AD brain tissues, but MALAT1 showed a more pronounced decrease. Using bioinformatics, qRT-PCR, RNA FISH and RIP techniques, we could establish MALAT1 as an interactor and regulator of miRs-200a, -26a and -26b, all of which are naturally elevated in AD. We could further show that these miRNAs target the RTK EPHA2 and several of its downstream effectors. Expectedly EPHA2 over expression protects against Aβ1-42 induced cytotoxicity. Transiently knocking down MALAT1 validates these unique regulatory facets of AD at the miRNA and protein levels. Although the idea of sponging of miRNAs by lncRNAs in other pathologies is gradually gaining credibility, this novel MALAT1- miR-200a/26a/26b - EPHA2 regulation mechanism in the context of AD pathophysiology promises to become a significant strategy in controlling the disease.",Animal-other

Human corpus cavernosum (HCC) tissue was cut into strips of approximately 2 cm and suspended in a cascade bioassay. The strips were then superfused with oxygenated and warmed Krebs solution and precontracted with noradrenaline (3 microM). Glyceryl trinitrate, acetylcholine and histamine were injected as a single bolus in the absence or in the presence of mepyramine and cimetidine. For the in vivo studies, histamine (30-60 micrograms) was injected intracavernously as a single bolus into the right corpus cavernosum 1 cm from the balamo-preputial sulcus. Similar protocols were carried out for papaverine (50 mg). The erectile response was divided into four grades: no response, tumescence, partial and full erection.	In vitro studies demonstrated that histamine (3-100 micrograms) caused dose-dependent relaxation of the HCC strips which was significantly inhibited by cimetidine (5-10 microM). The histamine H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine (1 microM) potentiated histamine-induced relaxation. The co-infusion of both mepyramine and cimetidine did not abolish histamine-induced relaxation. When injected intracavernously in humans, histamine (30 micrograms) caused full erection in 13% of the patients, whereas 87% had partial erection or tumescence. A higher dose of histamine (60 micrograms) caused full erection in 26% of the patients and 74% had partial erection or tumescence. Papaverine induced full erection in the majority of patients (66%). In contrast to papaverine, the duration of erection induced by histamine was markedly shorter (mean 200 and 6.5 min, respectively). The penile erections induced by papaverine were associated with complications such as pain, haematoma and priapism. Histamine did not induce any complications. Treatment of eight male patients with psychogenic impotence with the histamine H1 receptor antagonist astemizol (10 mg orally once daily for 1 week) did not affect histamine-induced erectile responses.	These results indicate that histamine may play a role in human penile erection. The erection-promoting action of histamine is probably due to H2 receptor activation, although another histamine receptor, possibly H3, also seems to be involved. This study suggests that histamine could be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
896,16195185,Brain injury,Consensus guidelines on screening for hypopituitarism following traumatic brain injury.,"The goal of this consensus statement is to increase awareness among endocrinologists and physicians treating patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) of the incidence and risks of hypopituitarism among patients with TBI.	TBI poses significant risk to the pituitary gland, leading to elevated risks of diabetes, hypopituitarism and other endocrinopathies. Signs and symptoms associated with hypopituitarism often mimic the sequellae of TBI, although the severity of symptoms is not necessarily related to the severity of the injury. Patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may benefit both physically and psychologically from appropriate hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Participants at this unique consensus meeting attempted to define and spearhead an approach to increase awareness of the risks of TBI-induced endocrinopathies, in particular growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and to outline necessary and practical objectives for managing this condition.	Systematic screening of pituitary function is recommended for all patients with moderate-to-severe TBI at risk of developing pituitary deficits. Patients with hypopituitarism benefit from appropriate hormonal replacement and prospects for rehabilitation of patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may be enhanced by appropriate HRT. Further exploration of this possibility requires: (1) active collaboration between divisions of endocrinology and rehabilitation at the local level to perform a screening of pituitary function in patients after TBI, (2) creation of a consultancy service by endocrine societies for use by rehabilitation centres, (3) development of continuing medical education (CME) programmes that can be offered as crossover training to the physicians who manage the care of patients with TBIs, (4) targeting of patient organizations with educational information for dissemination to patients and their families, (5) continued efforts to more clearly define the population at greatest risk of TBI-induced hypopituitarism and (6) monitor results of efficacy studies as they become available to evaluate whether and how much replacement therapy can improve the symptoms of individuals with TBI-induced hypopituitarism.",Non-systematic-review

The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway is a major innate immune pathway activated acutely and chronically after stroke. Hence, understanding the intricacies of the temporal profile, specific control points, and cellular specificity of TLR4 activation is crucial for the development of any novel therapeutics targeting the endogenous innate immune response after focal cerebral ischemia. The goal of this review is to summarize the current findings related to TLR4 signaling after stroke with a specific focus on the components of the neurovascular unit such as astrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, and pericytes. In addition, this review will examine the effects of focal cerebral ischemia on interaction of these neurovascular unit components.",Non-systematic-review

This review updates a previously published review summarising evidence on the impact of health checks on the health and well-being of people with intellectual disabilities. Electronic literature searches and email contacts were used to identify literature relevant to the impact of health checks for people with intellectual disabilities published from 1989 to 2013. Forty-eight publications were identified, of which eight articles and two reports were newly identified and not included in the previous review. These involved checking the health of people with intellectual disabilities from a range of countries including a full range of people with intellectual disabilities. Health checks consistently led to detection of unmet health needs and targeted actions to address health needs. Health checks also had the potential to increase knowledge of the health needs of people with intellectual disabilities amongst health professionals and support staff, and to identify gaps in health services. Health checks are effective in identifying previously unrecognised health needs, including life threatening conditions. Future research should consider strategies for optimising the cost effectiveness or efficiency of health checks.",Human-systematic-review

Possible role for ACE in SCZ was also suggested by ACE activity interaction with dopaminergic mechanisms to modulate abnormalities of sensorimotor gating. In addition, we have demonstrated higher ACE activity in blood of SCZ subjects, its implication in cognitive performance in SCZ and its power as a predictor for SCZ diagnosis.Methods: ACE activity was determined in the serum and in selected brain regions of an animal model presenting SCZ-like behaviour, before and after the treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotics, and also in the serum of animals receiving the psychostimulants amphetamine/lisdexamphetamine.Results: Dopaminergic manipulations with antipsychotics and psychostimulants influenced the ACE activity, but with no correlation with the animal blood pressure.Conclusions: The validity of measuring ACE activity in animal blood to predict activity in the CNS, as well as the lack of correlation between the activity and blood pressure, before and after the treatment with antipsychotics, were confirmed here. Correlations of the present findings with data from clinical studies also strengthen the value of this animal model for studying several aspects of SCZ.",Animal-drug-intervention

We investigated the association between hyperfibrinogenemia upon hospital admission and the short-term prognosis of AIS patients.	A total of 3,212 AIS patients enrolled from December 2013 to May 2014 across 22 hospitals in Suzhou city were included in the present study. Hyperfibrinogenemia was defined as having a serum fibrinogen＞4.0g/L. Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of hyperfibrinogenemia on all-cause in-hospital mortality and poor discharge outcome (modified Rankin Scale score≥3) in AIS patients.	During hospitalization, 106 patients (3.3%) died from all-cause and 1226 (38.2%) patients experienced poor functional outcome at discharge. Multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, white blood cell count and other covariates, showed that hyperfibrinogenemia was associated with a 1.76-fold increase in the risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.81; P-value=0.019). However, there was no significant association between hyperfibrinogenemia and poor outcome at discharge (adjusted odds ratios[OR]1.15; 95% CI 0.86-1.53; P-value=0.338). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses also confirmed a significant association between hyperfibrinogenemia and in-hospital mortality.	In patients with AIS, hyperfibrinogenemia at the time of admission was independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality.",Remaining

The study was undertaken with 93 children aged from 2 to 8 years to examine whether the items of the PAGS construct a unidimensional scale that can be used to measure children's play ability. The internal scale validity and the person response validity of the PAGS were investigated by examining the goodness-of-fit of the play items and children's play performance to the many-faceted Rasch model for the PAGS. In total, 46 of the 51 play items demonstrated acceptable goodness-of-fit. Of the 93 children, 90.3% demonstrated acceptable goodness-of-fit on the scale of play items. Overall, the results support both the scale and person response validity for the PAGS, as well as providing preliminary evidence that the PAGS can be used for a more detailed evaluation of children's abilities in play performance within natural day-care contexts. Further research is needed to examine other aspects of the validity and reliability of the PAGS measures.",Remaining

Cerebral ischemia was induced in swiss albino mice by performing BCCAO surgery. Morris water-maze test was utilized to assess the learning ability and memory of the animals. The whole brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, TBARS, GSH levels and MPO activity were evaluated as the biochemical parameters. For histopathological evaluation of the cerebral infarct size, TTC staining was employed.	Administration of L-carnosine (500   mg/kg, i.p.) successfully attenuated the manifestations of cerebral ischemia. Higher levels of AChE, TBARS, and MPO were observed in BCCAO treated animals, which were successfully attenuated by treatment with L-carnosine and ischemic postconditioning. Whereas administration of L-carnosine and ischemic postconditioning significantly increased the level of GSH in BCCAO treated animals. Moreover, treatment with ranitidine, an H2 blocker (30 NMol, i.c.v) antagonized the neuroprotective actions of L-carnosine evidenced by decrease in MWM performance, increase in the level of AChE and oxidative stress, while decrease in GSH level in brain. The cerebral infarct size was found to be more in BCCAO inflicted animals, which was improved by the administration of L-carnosine, while the cerebral infarct size worsened by treatment with ranitidine (3   nmol, i.c.v.).	It is concluded that L-carnosine exerts neuroprotective effect via involvement of histidine-histamine pathway since the beneficial effects of L-carnosine were abolished by the H2-blocker.",Animal-drug-intervention

The biological significance of FGL2 expression was assessed using the The Cancer Genome Atlast (TCGA) glioma database and tumor lysates analysis. The therapeutic effects of an anti-Fgl2 antibody and the role of immune suppression regulation by Fgl2 were determined in immune-competent, NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG), and FcɣRIIB-/- mice (n = 3-18 per group). Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance, log-rank survival analysis, and Pearson correlation. All statistical tests were two-sided.	In low-grade gliomas, 72.5% of patients maintained two copies of the FGL2 gene, whereas 83.8% of GBM patients had gene amplification or copy gain. Patients with high levels of FGL2 mRNA in glioma tissues had a lower overall survival (P = .009). Protein levels of FGL2 in GBM lysates were higher relative to low-grade glioma lysates (11.48±5.75ng/mg vs 3.96±1.01ng/mg, P = .003). In GL261 mice treated with an anti-FGL2 antibody, median survival was 27 days compared with only 17 days for mice treated with an isotype control antibody (P = .01). The anti-FGL2 antibody treatment reduced CD39(+) Tregs, M2 macrophages, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). FGL2-induced increases in M2, CD39, and PD-1 were ablated in FcɣRIIB-/- mice.	FGL2 augments glioma immunosuppression by increasing the expression levels of PD-1 and CD39, expanding the frequency of tumor-supportive M2 macrophages via the FcγRIIB pathway, and enhancing the number of MDSCs and CD39(+) regulatory T cells. Collectively, these results show that FGL2 functions as a key immune-suppressive modulator and has potential as an immunotherapeutic target for treating GBM.",Animal-drug-intervention

In the present study, we investigated the expression of the messenger ribonucleic acid PDGF A and B chains and the PDGF alpha and beta receptors in 17 cases of oligodendrogliomas.	Measurements of messenger ribonucleic acid levels were obtained using radioactive complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probes. Protein expression was analyzed with specific antibodies.	Sixteen of 17 tumors expressed the PDGF A subunit and all the PDGF alpha receptors. Furthermore, all the tumors expressed PDGF B and PDGF beta receptor subunits.	The results of this study suggest that oligodendrogliomas may have an autocrine loop stimulated by the interaction of PDGF and its receptor simultaneously produced by these tumors.",Remaining

Pre-post nonrandomized controlled trial.	Rehabilitation center and gait laboratory of a university hospital.	Community-dwelling ambulatory volunteers (N=22) with chronic hemiparesis caused by a unilateral stroke.	Study subjects participated in a gait training program using either a below-knee prosthesis or a treadmill.

The ground reaction forces, stance time, step length and cadence during walking at a comfortable speed, and maximum gait speed, as well as the Berg Balance Score, were estimated before and after each training program.	In comparison with changes after the treadmill gait training, analyses of covariance demonstrated a significant increase of the fore-aft ground reaction forces during the paretic propulsion phase and a significant increase in the relative durations of the paretic and nonparetic single stance involved in a gait cycle after the prosthetic gait training (P<.05).	Prosthetic gait training would have different effects on a hemiparetic gait than treadmill gait training.

Analyses were completed in 2 stages. First, 3 types of variables (screening variables, alcohol-related cognitions, mandated student profile) were examined in a logistic regression model as putative predictors of lower risk drinking (defined as 3 or fewer heavy episodic drinking [HED] episodes and/or 4 or fewer alcohol-related consequences in the past month) 6 weeks following the BA session. Second, we used generalized estimating equations to examine putative moderators of BMI effects on HED and peak blood alcohol content compared with assessment only (AO) control over the 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups.	Participants reporting lower scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, more benefits to changing alcohol use, and those who fit the 'Bad Incident' profile at baseline were more likely to report lower risk drinking 6 weeks after the BA session. Moderation analyses revealed that Bad Incident students who received the BMI reported more HED at 9-month follow-up than those who received AO.

Treatment with stents may be an effective method to treat VADA involving the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and dissection of the dominant vertebral artery (VA). In this article, our personal experience of the treatment of VADAs by using stents and coils is reported.	Since 1998, 26 cases of VADA have been treated by endovascular surgery by the first author. Of these cases, 6 cases were treated using stents, 3 of which were treated using stent and coils, 2 patients were treated using double overlapping stents, and the remaining one patient was treated using a single stent.	In all patients, dissection aneurysms were successfully covered by stents. There was one complication: an intraprocedural rupture during additional coil insertion without neurological deterioration. Follow-up angiography was performed in all 5 surviving patients except for one patient who died due to the severity of his original subarachnoid hemorrhage (mean duration of follow-up angiography 22.8 months, range 15-57 months). Total or subtotal disappearance of the VADA was achieved in all 5 cases. At one year after the treatment, all 5 surviving patients remained clinically stable without any neurological deficit.	Treatment using stents is an effective alternative for the treatment of VA dissecting aneurysms, especially for lesions of the dominant VA or involving the PICA. However, additional coil insertion should be performed very carefully and may be avoided if stagnation of contrast material is achieved after overlapping stenting.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

A data-base of parent report of sleep problems of children with autism (N=55), ranging from 5 to 12 years of age (M=8.2 years) was evaluated. Results suggested that fewer hours of sleep per night predicted overall autism scores and social skills deficits. Similarly, stereotypic behavior was predicted by fewer hours of sleep per night and screaming during the night. Increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli in the bedroom and screaming at night predicted communication problems. Finally, sensitivity to environmental stimuli in the bedroom also predicted fewer developmental sequence disturbances.

Evaluation of olfactory and gustatory functions was performed on patients through the 'Sniffin' Sticks' method in order to assess the olfactory threshold, the capacity for discriminating and identifying olfactory stimuli, and the overall olfactory function, and through the 'taste strip' kit method in order to assess the gustatory function. The results were processed statistically to assess differences between patients with anorexia nervosa, patients with bulimia nervosa and healthy controls.	The two groups of patients with bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa showed a poorer olfactory and gustatory function compared with the healthy controls; discrimination of olfactory stimuli and overall olfactory function were reduced in both samples, as well as the overall gustatory function and the perception of bitter stimuli, whereas olfactory threshold was altered only in patients with bulimia nervosa. In both samples, scores for olfactory function fell within the range of hyposmia.	Our data suggest that patients with eating disorders have an altered perception of olfactory and gustatory stimuli.

920,17244569,The International journal of psycho-analysis,"Thinking with, and about, patients too scared to think: can non-interpretive maneuvers stimulate reflective thought?","Patients incapable of higher-order (symbolic) thinking can often not tolerate evidence of the analyst's separate existence, particularly when that 'otherness' becomes evident in the process of the analyst's reflecting upon and interpreting how the patient experiences or represents the analyst. The patient's intolerance of the analyst's efforts to think (reflect upon and interpret) renders the usual psychoanalytic maneuvers employed to stimulate reflective thought ineffective with such patients. Such patients have to learn to tolerate multiple perspectives before they can allow the analyst, or themselves, to think in the other's presence. The author presents two clinical vignettes that illustrate how the analyst's efforts to think about the patient were experienced by the patient as both intolerably distancing and as rejecting of an aspect of the patient's subjective reality. Working psychoanalytically with such patients requires the analyst to forego the use of narrow interpretations that elucidate unconscious meanings and motives in favor of alternate technical maneuvers capable of facilitating the development of symbolic thinking and reflective thought (insightfulness). These maneuvers include a demonstration of the analyst's willingness and ability to withstand (rather than 'interpret away') how he is being psychically represented by the patient, without becoming destroyed by, or lost within, the patient's characterization of him. Beside modeling a tolerance of alternate perspectives of one's self, other non-interpretive maneuvers that help facilitate the development of self-reflective thought include: stimulating the patient's curiosity about the workings of his own mind by identifying incompletely understood behaviors or reactions worthy of greater psychological understanding, and insinuating doubt about the adequacy of the patient's explanations of such phenomena.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
921,29777529,Clinical pharmacokinetics,Pharmacokinetics of ADS-5102 (Amantadine) Extended Release Capsules Administered Once Daily at Bedtime for the Treatment of Dyskinesia.,"Preclinical and clinical studies suggest amantadine immediate-release (IR) may reduce dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD), although higher doses are associated with increased CNS adverse events (AEs). ADS-5102 is an extended release amantadine capsule formulation, designed for once-daily dosing at bedtime (qhs) to provide high concentrations upon waking and throughout the day, with lower concentrations in the evening. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADS-5102 were assessed in two phase I studies in healthy subjects, and a blinded, randomized phase II/III dose-finding study in PD patients.	The first phase I study assessed single ADS-5102 doses (68.5, 137, and 274 mg) in a crossover design, whereas the second phase I study evaluated ADS-5102 137 mg for 7 days followed by amantadine IR 81 mg twice daily (or reverse order). In the phase II/III double-blind study, PD patients with dyskinesia were randomized to ADS-5102 (210, 274, or 338 mg) or placebo for 8 weeks.	Single ADS-5102 doses resulted in a slow initial rise in amantadine plasma concentration, with delayed time to maximum concentration (12-16 h). Amantadine plasma concentrations were higher in PD patients versus healthy volunteers. The steady-state profile of once-daily ADS-5102 was significantly different from that of twice-daily amantadine IR, such that the two formulations are not bioequivalent. PK modeling suggested the recommended daily ADS-5102 dosage (274 mg qhs) resulted in 1.4- to 2.0-fold higher amantadine plasma concentrations during the day versus amantadine IR.	ADS-5102 can be administered once-daily qhs to achieve high amantadine plasma concentrations in the morning and throughout the day, when symptoms of dyskinesia occur.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention

Routine laboratory tests are insufficient to evaluate platelet activity.	To profile the spectrum of platelet inhibition, as measured by aspirin and P2Y12 response unit assays, in a TBI population on antiplatelet therapy.	This single-center, prospective cohort study included patients presenting to our institution between November 2010 and January 2015 with a clinical history of TBI. Serum platelet reactivity levels were determined immediately on admission and analyzed using the aspirin and P2Y12 response unit assays; test results were reported as aspirin response units and P2Y12 response units. We report congruence between assay results and clinical history as well as differences in assay results between types of antiplatelet therapy.	A sample of 317 patients was available for analysis, of which 87% had experienced mild TBI, 7% moderate, and 6% severe; the mean age was 71.5 years. The mean aspirin response units in patients with a history of any aspirin use was 456 ± 67 (range, 350-659), with 88% demonstrating therapeutic platelet inhibition. For clopidogrel, the mean P2Y12 response unit was 191 ± 70 (range, 51-351); 77% showed therapeutic response.	Rapid measurement of antiplatelet function using the aspirin and P2Y12 response assays indicated as many as one fourth of patients on antiplatelet therapy do not have platelet dysfunction.

The grade of brachycephaly was determined on skull models based on CT datasets. Cranial measurements were examined with regard to a possible correlation with relative ventricular volume, and cranial capacity. Persians with high (peke-face Persians) and lower grades of brachycephaly (doll-face Persians) were investigated for the presence of skull dysmorphologies.	The mean cranial index of the peke-face Persians (0.97 ± 0.14) was significantly higher than the mean cranial index of doll-face Persians (0.66 ± 0.04; P < 0.001). Peke-face Persians had a lower relative nasal bone length (0.15 ± 0.04) compared to doll-face (0.29 ± 0.08; P < 0.001). The endocranial volume was significantly lower in doll-face than peke-face Persians (89.6 ± 1.27% versus 91.76 ± 2.07%; P < 0.001).

Random-effect model was used to estimate the summary relative risks.	The overall risk of stroke in SLT users was found to be significantly higher (1.17, 95% CI 1.04–1.30) compared to non-users, especially for users in Southeast Asian region. The results remained unchanged even after strict adjustment for smoking (1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.32). SLT users had 1.34 times or 13.4% higher risk of fatal stroke, though risk of nonfatal stroke was not enhanced. Significantly higher risk of stroke was seen in users of chewing tobacco (1.35, 95% CI 1.20–1.50) in comparison to non-chewers. Gender-based analysis showed enhanced risk of fatal stroke in both male and female users. SLT-attributable fraction of fatal stroke was highest for India at 14.8%.

The present work studied the temporal variation of three key antioxidant enzymes in cortex and hippocampus during the development of behavioral and cognitive symptoms in 3xTg-AD mice, and as compared to age-matched controls. At 2 months of age, when no intraneuronal Aβ immunoreactivity has been reported, increased neophobia shown as a delayed and reduced rearing, evidenced the onset of BPSD-like symptoms at premorbid stages of disease. In these animals, NQO1 was found increased in both the hippocampus (800%) and cortex (400%) and progressively diminished at older ages. SOD1 was increased in the hippocampus at 4 months of age, when neuronal Aβ accumulation has been established. These hippocampal increases of antioxidants before the prodromal emergence of cognitive symptoms support their role as defense mechanisms. SIRT1 levels showed opposite age-dependent changes in cortex (increase) and hippocampus (decrease) relative to controls. Prodromal cognitive deficits emerged at 6 months of age, concomitantly to cortical overexpression of SIRT1 but down-regulation of NQO1 and SIRT1 in the hippocampus, suggesting inadequate antioxidative protection to prevent or delay the subjacent neuronal damage. The present data further support the link between oxidative status and the anxious profile. Their crosstalk may underline AD-pathological mechanisms that may lead to deranged physiology and selective neuronal degeneration. It also points out increased neophobia and high expression of NQO1 among the first indicators of disease in the 3xTg-AD mice.",Animal-other

We review limitations of available research, and discuss novel approaches to overcome previous methodological barriers.	Mechanistic studies suggest a possible association between excess lead, manganese, cadmium, arsenic, or copper, and zinc deficiency, and several biochemical disturbances related to psychosis, such as altered neurotransmitters levels, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Furthermore, studies suggest that some metals (lead, manganese, cadmium excess, and zinc deficiency) are associated with schizophrenia or psychosis-related phenotype. However, previous studies had multiple methodological limitations. Importantly, metal exposure was often measured after disease development and seldom determined during critical developmental periods. Most studies fell short of depicting the exact timing of exposure and the change in exposure over time. Here, we propose several methods to overcome these methodological limitations.	There is a plausible role of early life exposure to metals in the cause of psychosis. Owing to methodological limitations in exposure measurement, this has not been well characterized. Considering the wide exposure to metals and the high cost of psychosis to society, this hypothesis should be rigorously examined.",Non-systematic-review

While two of these dots always moved randomly, the two others could fulfill the role of being either the chasing (wolf) or chased (sheep) dot. In the chase-present (but not the chase-absent) trials the wolf displayed chasing behavior defined by the degree to which the dot reliably moved towards the sheep (chasing subtlety). Previous research indicated that chasing subtlety strongly influenced chase detection in typically developing (TD) adults. We intended to replicate and extend this finding to adolescents with and without ASD, while also adding either a social or a non-social cue to the displays. Our results confirmed the importance of chasing subtlety and indicated that adding social, but not non-social, information further improved chase detection performance. Interestingly, the performance of adolescents with ASD was less dependent on chasing subtlety than that of their TD counterparts. Nonetheless, adolescents with and without ASD did not differ in their use of the added social (or non-social) cue.",Remaining

Repeated OMT misuse was reported by 20% (i.e., 71% of misusers) of patients and was associated with positive OMT misuse experience and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. Admission to the ER because of misuse complications was reported by 34% of patients, this outcome being associated with gender, employment, type of previous opioid abuse and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. OMT dosage was lower than the recommended maintenance dosage.	We offered new information on factors associated with intravenous OMT misuse, repeated misuse and ER admission in Italian patients under OMT. Our data indicate that BUP-NLX misuse is not different from that of BUP or MET. Choosing the more expensive BUP-NLX over MET will likely not lead to the expected reduction of the risk of injection misuse of the OMT. Instead of prescribing new and expensive OMT formulations, addiction unit physicians and medical personnel should better focus on patient's features that are associated with a higher likelihood of misuse. Care should be paid to concurrent benzodiazepine and OMT misuse.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Recommendations and guidelines for phenylketonuria should deal with the following subjects: 1. What is the target age to start dietary phenylalanine restriction under newborn-screening conditions? 2. At which plasma phenylalanine concentration should phenylalanine restriction be initiated? 3. Which are the recommended plasma phenylalanine concentrations at different ages? 4. What is the recommended frequency of monitoring phenylalanine in plasma? Statements from the following countries are presented: Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Slovakia and the United States.	Due to the lack of internationally accepted guidelines, management of phenylketonuria still varies between different countries. Our efforts should focus on the formulation of internationally acceptable and accepted recommendations for the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria at different ages.",Non-systematic-review

Thirty-nine journal articles met the inclusion criteria. Six types of interventions were identified that addressed depression, anxiety, or mental health-related quality of life: exercise or movement based, behavioral therapy and stroke education, behavioral therapy only, stroke education only, care support and coordination, and community-based interventions that included occupational therapy. Evidence from well-conducted research supports using problem-solving or motivational interviewing behavioral techniques to address depression. The evidence is inconclusive for using multicomponent exercise programs to combat depression after stroke and for the use of stroke education and care support and coordination interventions to address poststroke anxiety. One study provided support for an intensive multidisciplinary home program in improving depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life.

946,8969775,Stroke,Ultrasound densitometric analysis of carotid plaque composition. Pathoanatomic correlation.,"The components of a carotid artery plaque might affect the risk of ipsilateral stroke. The accuracy of carotid duplex scan in assessing stroke risk reflects the experience of the scan reader. Thus, methods that can enhance ultrasonic evaluation of plaque morphology might allow a more objective means of determining carotid-mediated stroke risk.	We performed densitometric analysis of B-mode images of carotid plaques in nine patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy. All patients had preoperative duplex color imaging and cerebral arteriography. The surgical specimen was analyzed histologically to determine the plaque components (soft plaque/organized thrombus, intraplaque hemorrhage/lipid deposition, fibrosis, and calcification). The specimen findings were correlated with the densitometric measurements to determine whether the density analysis would allow a reliable determination of the plaque substratum.	With 1.0 as a reference point for the moving column of blood, the mean acoustic densities (+/-SD) were as follows: organized thrombus, 1.8 +/- 0.5; intraplaque hemorrhage/lipid deposition, 5.15 +/- 0.9; fibrosis, 9.51 +/- 2.9; and calcification, 15.5 +/- 8.6.	We conclude that densitometric evaluation allows differentiation of the various possible components of carotid plaque. The determination of plaque composition, based on density measurement, may provide information about its potential for thromboembolization.",Remaining

The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 112 consecutive patients (53 boys, 59 girls; mean age 10.9 years, range 10 months-21.7 years) with medically intractable epilepsy who underwent invasive monitoring at the Pediatric Epilepsy Center at St. Louis Children's Hospital between January 1994 and July 2005. There were 122 implantation procedures (85 grids and strips, 32 strips only, five grids only, four with additional depth electrodes), with a mean monitoring period of 7.1 days (range 2-21 days). Operative complications included the need for repeated surgery for additional electrode placement (5.7%); wound infection (2.4%); cerebrospinal fluid leak (1.6%); and subdural hematoma, symptomatic pneumocephalus, bone flap osteomyelitis, and strip electrode fracture requiring operative retrieval (one patient [0.8%] each). There were four cases of transient neurological deficit (3.3%) and no permanent deficit or death associated with invasive monitoring.	Placement of subdural grid and strip electrodes for invasive video electroencephalographic monitoring is generally well tolerated in the pediatric population. The authors found that aggressive initial electrode coverage was not associated with higher rates of blood transfusion or perioperative complications, and reduced the frequency of repeated operations for placement of supplemental electrodes.",Remaining
949,28700589,PloS one,ANK1 is up-regulated in laser captured microglia in Alzheimer's brain; the importance of addressing cellular heterogeneity.,"Recent epigenetic association studies have identified a new gene, ANK1, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although strong associations were observed, brain homogenates were used to generate the data, introducing complications because of the range of cell types analyzed. In order to address the issue of cellular heterogeneity in homogenate samples we isolated microglial, astrocytes and neurons by laser capture microdissection from CA1 of hippocampus in the same individuals with a clinical and pathological diagnosis of AD and matched control cases. Using this unique RNAseq data set, we show that in the hippocampus, ANK1 is significantly (p<0.0001) up-regulated 4-fold in AD microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes from the same individuals. These data provide evidence that microglia are the source of ANK1 differential expression previously identified in homogenate samples in AD.",Remaining
950,3522814,Journal of clinical hypertension,Common carotid blood flow in patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery.,"Common carotid blood flow has been measured using pulsed Doppler techniques in hypertensive patients over 45 years of age, with and without stenosis of the internal carotid artery. In hypertensive patients without stenosis, arterial diameter remained within the normal range, whereas blood flow velocity and blood flow were significantly reduced. Vascular resistance was significantly increased but did not change markedly after administration of the vasodilating drug isosorbid dinitrate. Patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery were compared with two different populations used as controls: In comparison with hypertensive patients without stenosis of the internal carotid artery, both arterial diameter and blood flow velocity were reduced, leading to a more pronounced decrease in blood flow; and in comparison with normotensive patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery, common carotid blood flow was more reduced at any degree of stenosis. In a subset of patients, blood flow returned toward normal ranges after endarterectomy. The study suggested that in patients with hypertension without stenosis of the internal carotid artery, the decrease in blood flow is due to a decrease in blood flow velocity with normal arterial diameter despite the elevated blood pressure, and in patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery, blood flow was more reduced than in the normotensive patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery, suggesting that caution must be taken with indications of antihypertensive treatment.",Remaining

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether chronic unpredicted stress (CUS) mediated neurological alterations are associated with impaired hippocampal insulin signaling or not, and studied the effect of quercetin in this scenario. Male Swiss albino mice were subjected to 21day CUS, during which 30mg/kg quercetin treatment was given orally. After 21days, behavioral functions were evaluated in terms of locomotor activity (Actophotometer), muscle coordination (Rota-rod), depression (Tail Suspension Test (TST), Forced Swim Test (FST)) and memory performance (Passive-avoidance step-down task (PASD)). Further, hippocampal insulin signaling was evaluated in terms of protein expression of insulin, insulin receptor (IR) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) and neurogenesis was evaluated in terms of doublecortin (DCX) expression. 21day CUS significantly impaired locomotion and had no effect on muscle coordination. Stressed animals were depressed and showed markedly impaired memory functions. Quercetin treatment significantly improvement stress-mediated behavior dysfunction as indicated by improved locomotion, lesser immobility time and greater frequency of upward turning in TST and FST and increased transfer latency on the day 2 (short-term memory) and day 5 (long-term memory) in PASD test. We observed significantly higher IR expression and significantly lower GLUT-4 expression in the hippocampus of stressed animals, despite of nonsignificant difference in insulin levels. Further, chronic stress impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, as indicated by the significantly reduced levels of hippocampal DCX expression. Quercetin treatment significantly lowered insulin and IR expression and significantly enhanced GLUT-4 and DCX expression in the hippocampus, when compared to CUS. In conclusion, quercetin treatment efficiently alleviated stress mediated behavioral dysfunction by modulating hippocampal insulin signaling and neurogenesis.",Animal-drug-intervention
952,18392746,Journal of inherited metabolic disease,"AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8 distribution in the central nervous system, in relation to creatine deficiency syndromes: a review.","Creatine deficiency syndromes, either due to AGAT, GAMT or SLC6A8 deficiencies, lead to a complete absence, or a very strong decrease, of creatine within the brain, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. While the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) expresses AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8, the lack of SLC6A8 in astrocytes around the blood-brain barrier limits the brain capacity to import creatine from the periphery, and suggests that the CNS has to rely mainly on endogenous creatine synthesis through AGAT and GAMT expression. This seems contradictory with SLC6A8 deficiency, which, despite AGAT and GAMT expression, also leads to creatine deficiency in the CNS. We present novel data showing that in cortical grey matter, AGAT and GAMT are expressed in a dissociated way: e.g. only a few cells co-express both genes. This suggests that to allow synthesis of creatine within the CNS, at least for a significant part of it, guanidinoacetate must be transported from AGAT- to GAMT-expressing cells, possibly through SLC6A8. This would explain the creatine deficiency observed in SLC6A8-deficient patients. By bringing together creatine deficiency syndromes, AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8 distribution in CNS, as well as a synthetic view on creatine and guanidinoacetate levels in the brain, this review presents a comprehensive framework, including new hypotheses, on brain creatine metabolism and transport, both in normal conditions and in case of creatine deficiency.",Non-systematic-review

However, no High/Low ASQ group differences were observed for EFI-2 (Impulse Control), EFI-3 (Empathy), EFI-5 (Planning) subscales or the EFI-Total Score (p's > .12), although these differences were in the predicted direction (High ASQ < Low ASQ). Use of the EFI as a measure of executive function performance in nonclinical ASQ trait individuals requires further study and may not be sensitive enough of an instrument to assess EF in nonclinical populations with autistic traits.",Remaining

Using a standard recognition memory task, we conducted a pilot study to examine how 24 hours of tobacco abstinence in moderate to heavy smokers would affect memory in males and females. Twenty-five moderate to heavy smokers were tested following a period of smoking normally and following 24 hours of tobacco abstinence. At each session, participants completed a recognition memory task in which items were studied under full- and divided-attention conditions (a standard manipulation of memory encoding) as well as tests of passive short-term and working memory (forward and backward digit span). Tobacco abstinence significantly reduced memory performance under full attention conditions for males but not for females. A significant main effect of smoking status in which abstinence significantly reduced performance, as well as a main effect of encoding condition (divided attention < full attention), were found. Our results demonstrate that there may be substantial sex differences in the cognitive effects of tobacco abstinence. While preliminary, the data suggest the need for further, more extensive study of how males and females differ during tobacco abstinence.

965,25380591,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Downsizing of lean body mass is a key determinant of Alzheimer's disease.,"Lean body mass (LBM) encompasses all metabolically active organs distributed into visceral and structural tissue compartments and collecting the bulk of N and K stores of the human body. Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma protein mainly secreted by the liver within a trimolecular TTR-RBP-retinol complex revealing from birth to old age strikingly similar evolutionary patterns with LBM in health and disease. TTR is also synthesized by the choroid plexus along distinct regulatory pathways. Chronic dietary methionine (Met) deprivation or cytokine-induced inflammatory disorders generates LBM downsizing following differentiated physiopathological processes. Met-restricted regimens downregulate the transsulfuration cascade causing upstream elevation of homocysteine (Hcy) safeguarding Met homeostasis and downstream drop of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) impairing anti-oxidative capacities. Elderly persons constitute a vulnerable population group exposed to increasing Hcy burden and declining H2S protection, notably in plant-eating communities or in the course of inflammatory illnesses. Appropriate correction of defective protein status and eradication of inflammatory processes may restore an appropriate LBM size allowing the hepatic production of the retinol circulating complex to resume, in contrast with the refractory choroidal TTR secretory process. As a result of improved health status, augmented concentrations of plasma-derived TTR and retinol may reach the cerebrospinal fluid and dismantle senile amyloid plaques, contributing to the prevention or the delay of the onset of neurodegenerative events in elderly subjects at risk of Alzheimer's disease.",Remaining

Surgical procedures comprised 25 functional hemispherectomies, two anatomical hemispherectomies, four multilobar resections, seven lobar resections and four focal resections. 7/42 (17%, 95% CI 8-31%) children underwent re-operation. 20/42 (48%, 95% CI 33-62%) children achieved seizure freedom. 18/42 (43%, 95% CI 29-58) demonstrated an improvement in seizure frequency and no children had an increase in seizure frequency. Post-operative complications included subsequent shunt procedure in 5/25 (20%, 95% CI 9-39%) children undergoing hemispherectomy. There were no mortalities. In 23 children pre- and post-operative DQ or IQ was determinable allowing longitudinal comparison. Five children had a decrease in DQ/IQ >15 and two children had an increase DQ/IQ >15.	Epilepsy surgery in children under 3 years of age offers suitable candidates a good chance of significantly improved seizure outcome which compares with rates in older cohorts.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Since CARP is induced by pressure overload to the heart, it is proposed to be a genetic marker for cardiac hypertrophy. We recently identified a novel protein, ankyrin repeat protein with PEST and proline-rich region (ARPP), which is homologous to CARP and is preferentially expressed in type 1 skeletal muscle fibers (cf. slow fibers). We also found that both ARPP and CARP expression is induced in experimentally denervated skeletal muscles in mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that their expression may be induced in skeletal muscles in neurodegenerating disease. This work aimed to determine the expression pattern of ARPP and CARP in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).	In this study, we immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of ARPP and CARP in skeletal muscles of 9 ALS cases.	We found that CARP was aberrantly expressed in atrophic skeletal muscle fibers in ALS. Although ARPP-positive fibers were randomly scattered in a checkerboard-like pattern in normal skeletal muscle, this pattern was absent in ALS muscles. Furthermore, we also found that ARPP was expressed in fast myosin heavy chain-positive fibers (cf. type 2 fiber).	These findings suggest that type-specific expression patterns of ARPP and CARP are altered in skeletal muscles of ALS.",Remaining

Complaints of snoring are examined, and its prevalence, risk factors and screening reliability are discussed. The subjects who participated in the study were 6445 new outpatients from a general hospital. They were asked to answer a sleep questionnaire that consisted of 34 items with seven demographic items; each item was composed of four grades of frequency. In order to offset possible seasonal variations in sleep habits, data were collected across four seasons. Sleep patterns, insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders were covered. Habitual snoring was seen in 16.0% of males and 6.5% of females. Male predominance was noted. From these data, the relationship between habitual snoring and sleep complaints was statistically analyzed. Habitual snorers (HS) were observed to wake up more frequently during sleep (17.8% of males, 21.5% of females) than were non-habitual snorers (NHS; 6.6% of males, 9.7% of females). Mid-sleep awakening of HS was also more frequent than it was for NHS; however, there were no differences in difficulty in falling asleep and early morning awakening.

At present, this population demonstrates decreased participation in physical activities and sport compared to peers due to barriers ranging from body function to accessibility challenges. Sport provides culturally relevant opportunities for social integration, community participation and physical activity and has been shown to improve the fitness, self-esteem, confidence and quality of life of children with disabilities. The Sports Stars physiotherapy group has been designed to support the development of a range of fundamental movement and sports skills through activity skill practice and participation in modified popular Australian sports.	This randomised, waitlist controlled, assessor blinded, superiority trial with two parallel groups will aim to compare the effectiveness of Sports Stars to standard care across all ICF domains. Children in the Sports Stars group are expected to demonstrate greater improvement in their individually-selected, sports related goals measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. This study will aim to assess sixty ambulant children aged six to 12 years with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Children will be excluded if they have had recent Botox or neurological/orthopaedic surgery. The Sports Stars intervention includes eight, one-hour, weekly physiotherapy group sessions with four to six participants and one lead physiotherapist. Outcome measures will be collected pre, post and 12 weeks post the immediate Sports Stars group to assess change immediately after, and at follow up time points.	This will be the first study of its kind to investigate a culturally relevant sports-focussed fundamental movement skills physiotherapy group for ambulant children with cerebral palsy. The findings will add to a growing pool of evidence supporting group physiotherapy for children with cerebral palsy and the Sports Stars group will provide an avenue for children to transition from individual physiotherapy to mainstream and modified recreational and competitive sports.

VFC starts in the precapillaries/capillaries in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) and expands to the granule cell and polymorphic cell layer of the DG, and to the stratum lacunosum/molecular in the CA1 sector. Vasculopathy spreads from the tail to the body and, in a few cases, to the head of the hippocampal formation. Light and electron microscopy reveal thickening of the vascular wall with fibrosis, calcification, and enforcement of the astrocyte interface with vessels with anchorage densities associated with hemidesmosome-like structures. In moderately and severely affected cases, fragmentation and removal of calcified and occluded vessels result in local reduction of vascular network. In two AD subjects, severe vascular calcification extending from the tail to the head of the hippocampal formation was associated with loss of almost all neurons in the CA1 sector and in the subiculum proper, corresponding to hippocampal sclerosis. The topography of affected vessels and the patterns of neuronal loss reflect the middle hippocampal artery distribution with its precapillary/capillary network. The similar prevalence of vasculopathy in the AD group and in the age-matched control group, and the presence of hippocampal VFC in only one subject in the DS cohort, 96% of which is affected by Alzheimer-type pathology, oppose the link between AD and this form of vasculopathy. However, severe VFC affects the pattern of AD pathology locally by deletion of neurofibrillary degeneration and beta-amyloidosis in the CA1 sector, subiculum proper, and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal VFC appears to be a form of vascular pathology with a unique predilection for the middle hippocampal artery and corresponding capillary network, which results in patchy neuronal loss in moderately affected subjects and in almost total neuronal loss in the area of impaired blood supply in severely affected subjects. These observations suggest an etiologic link between hippocampal VFC and hippocampal sclerosis.",Remaining

Eighteen consecutive patients with symptoms of acute stroke underwent PCT at admission. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all patients after 3.6 +/- 1.7 days (range, 1.5-6 days). PCT maps were generated focusing on the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) ipsilateral and contralateral to the ischemic lesion as AIFs. Infarct, penumbra, and total ischemic lesion were delineated on cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps. CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) were calculated in the ischemic regions as provided by the 3 different AIFs, the normality test was applied for the obtained parameters, and the values were correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient). Volumes of the ischemic regions (as obtained by the different AIFs) also were correlated and compared (paired t test) to the follow-up infarct volume.	The CBF and CBV values obtained by the different AIFs in the infarct, penumbra, and total ischemic lesion were significantly correlated (r=0.94-0.96, P<or=0.01). Only in the infarct region calculated MTT values were correlated (r=0.88-0.91, P<0.05) between the different AIFs groups. High correlation coefficients (r=0.79-0.91, P<0.001) were observed between the admission PCT infarct and total ischemic volume and the MRI follow-up infarct volume. ACA as AIF provided the best correlations (r=0.91, P=0.0002) with the follow-up measurements. No statistically significant difference was found between the 3 different AIF-estimated admission total ischemic volumes and the follow-up infarct volume.

OpenVigil FDA provides disproportionality analyses to (i) identify the drug most likely evoking a new adverse event, (ii) compare two drugs concerning their safety profile, (iii) check arbitrary combinations of two drugs for unknown drug-drug interactions and (iv) enhance the relevance of results by identifying confounding factors and eliminating them using background correction. We present examples for these applications and discuss the promises and limits of pharmacovigilance, openFDA and OpenVigil FDA.

Twenty-four patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who reported hallucinated voices were compared with 21 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who did not report voices and 26 normal subjects. Narrative speech perception was assessed through use of a masked speech tracking task with three levels of superimposed phonetic noise. A sentence repetition task was used to assess grammar-dependent verbal working memory, and an auditory continuous performance task was used to assess nonlanguage attention.	Masked speech tracking task and sentence repetition performance by hallucinating patients was impaired relative to both nonhallucinating patients and normal subjects. Although both hallucinating and nonhallucinating patients demonstrated auditory attention impairments when compared to normal subjects, the two patient groups did not differ with respect to these variables.	Results support the hypothesis that hallucinated voices in schizophrenia arise from disrupted speech perception and verbal working memory systems rather than from nonlanguage cognitive or attentional deficits.",Remaining

We aimed to characterize functional and structural alterations in cerebral microvasculature before and after experimental cerebral ischemia in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. We hypothesized that preexisting brain microvascular disease in patients with diabetes might partly explain increased stroke severity and impact on outcome. Diabetes was induced in 4-week-old C57Bl/6J mice by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). After 8 weeks of diabetes, the vasoreactivity of the neurovascular network to CO2 was abolished and was not reversed by nitric oxide (NO) donor administration; endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) mRNA, phospho-eNOS protein, nNOS, and phospho-nNOS protein were significantly decreased; angiogenic and vessel maturation factors (vascular endothelial growth factor a [VEGFa], angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), Ang2, transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β], and platelet-derived growth factor-β [PDGF-β]) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) occludin and zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) expression were significantly decreased; and microvessel density was increased without changes in ultrastructural imaging. After permanent focal cerebral ischemia induction, infarct volume and neurological deficit were significantly increased at D1 and D7, and neuronal death (TUNEL+ / NeuN+ cells) and BBB permeability (extravasation of Evans blue) at D1. At D7, CD31+ / Ki67+ double-immunolabeled cells and VEGFa and Ang2 expression were significantly increased, indicating delayed angiogenesis.

The aim of this study was to compare the socio-demographic profiles, the practices and drug consumption patterns of the two groups attending specialized centres.	The Oppidum Programme (observation of illegal drugs and misuse of psychotropic medications), a multi-centric survey, surveys drug-dependent subjects attending specialized care centres throughout France annually. Data were collected by questionnaire on socio-demographic variables and drug use during the preceding week.	During October 1998, 46 centres took part in the survey. The methadone group (n = 424) was older, with a better economic situation; 16% used cocaine regularly. The HD buprenorphine group (n = 616) consumed more heroin (12% vs. 8%) and engaged in more misuse, such as intravenous use, illicit acquisitions or irregular consumption. These practices were more frequent for patients consuming the drug 'outwith protocol' or for patients obtaining the drug from a general practitioner.	Our results suggest that patterns of consumption of methadone and buprenorphine are different in several respects: concomitant use of licit or illicit psychoactive substances, route of administration, and illegal acquisition.

Based on the literature and our earlier findings, we believe that the impairments of overall (not emotion specific) facial expression recognition is associated with a more general, non-specific psychiatric distress. Thus, first it was hypothesized that overall facial expression recognition would be correlated negatively with SCL-90 global severity index (GSI). Our second hypothesis was that the severity of the impairment in facial expression recognition would be correlated with symptom severity measured by the BECK Depression Inventory (BDI).	One hundred and six depressed subjects participated in the study. We used a 'Virtual Human' for presenting the 35 emotional and neutral facial expressions. Subjects filled in the BDI and SCL-90 questionnaires after the facial expression recognition task.	Significant negative association was found between the GSI of SCL-90 and the overall facial expression recognition. Furthermore, significant negative correlation was found between the recognition of happy facial expressions and the depression severity measured by the BDI questionnaire and the SCL-90 depression subscale.	The negative association found between overall facial expression recognition and the GSI score provide empirical support to our first hypothesis, which states that the impairment of not emotion specific, overall facial expression recognition may correlate with a general psychiatric distress. Our findings indicate that those depressed subjects who had higher scores on BDI could recognize happy facial expression at a significantly lower rate. Abnormalities in reward sensitivity may explain this association between happy face recognition difficulties and the severity of depressive symptoms among depressive patients. Consequently, we can conclude that the recognition of happy facial expressions can be a useful tool for monitoring the severity of depression.",Non-systematic-review

At least two of the diseases are believed to exhibit a common ground of pathophysiological mechanisms. These are granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). ANCA directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) are preferentially associated with GPA, and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA are associated mainly with MPA and eosinophilic GPA (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). Anti-MPO and anti-PR3 antibodies can activate neutrophils in vitro. In vivo data are available for humans and mice on the pathogenicity of anti-MPO but it is more controversial for PR3-ANCA. A recent genome-wide association study of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitides confirmed the genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of these conditions, with significant association of PR3-ANCA and human leukocyte antigen-DP and the genes encoding α1-antitrypsin and PR3. MPO-ANCA were significantly associated with human leukocyte antigen-DQ. Thus, recent results from epidemiological studies, genome-wide association study and therapeutic trials have suggested that these entities are, in fact, distinct. We have summarised these results and discuss the idea that these two entities should be studied separately as the nature of the two auto-antigens suggests at a molecular level despite shared ANCA involvement.",Non-systematic-review

990,16696567,Chemical research in toxicology,Ebselen induced C6 glioma cell death in oxygen and glucose deprivation.,"Studies have shown that ebselen is an antiinflammatory and antioxidative agent. Its protective effect has been investigated in oxidative stress related diseases such as cerebral ischemia in recent years. However, experimental evidence also shows that ebselen causes cell death in several different cell types. Whether ebselen will have a beneficial or detrimental effect on cells under ischemic condition is not known. Herein, we studied the effect of ebselen on C6 glioma cells under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro ischemic model. We found that ebselen significantly enhanced cell death after 3 h of OGD as observed by lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cellular morphological changes. Further studies revealed that depletion of cellular glutathione level by the combined action of ebselen and OGD played a role in enhanced cell death as demonstrated by the following evidence: (1) cellular GSH was significantly depleted by the combined effort of ebselen and OGD, compared to that of ebselen or OGD insult alone; (2) exogenous addition of N-acetyl cysteine completely diminished the cell damage induced by ebselen and OGD; (3) supplement of glucose, which provides cellular reducing agents and thus maintains cellular GSH level, to the OGD medium diminished C6 cell damage induced by ebselen. We conclude that depleting cellular glutathione plays an important role in ebselen-induced cell death with OGD. Our results suggest that ebselen can have a beneficial or toxic effect, depending on the availability of GSH.",In-vitro-study

American journal of neuroradiology,The radiologic assessment of trigeminal neuropathy.,"The clinical and radiologic records of 76 patients with trigeminal neuropathy and an abnormal imaging study (CT and/or MR) were analyzed retrospectively. The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) was divided into proximal (brainstem, preganglionic, gasserian ganglion, and cavernous sinus) and distal (extracranial V1, V2, and V3) segments. Lesions were organized according to segments and correlated with the type and distribution of clinical symptoms or signs. The purpose of the study was to (1) determine the efficacy of clinical localization of cranial nerve V lesions, (2) compare CT and MR for cranial nerve V imaging, (3) develop an MR protocol for effective cranial nerve V imaging, and (4) construct a differential diagnosis by anatomic segment for lesions of cranial nerve V. Clinical localization was found to be extremely inaccurate. CT was not as sensitive as MR for lesions involving the basal cisterns and skull base and will not detect the most common brainstem lesions (small infarcts and multiple sclerosis plaques). The MR protocol developed does not rely heavily on clinical localization. On the basis of lesions found in this series, a differential diagnosis by segment was developed. Patients with cranial nerve V symptoms should undergo MR imaging according to the protocol provided in this article. CT is not as effective as MR in imaging some cranial nerve V segments. Clinical localization is inaccurate.",Remaining

Previous studies focused on the relationship between suicide attempts and metabolism in elderly patients with MDD, while ignore the young people. The aim of this study is to find the potential relationship between suicide attempts and metabolism in young patients with MDD to find a way to prevent and ultimately reduce suicide in young patients with MDD.	Cross-sectional design was employed in the study.740 patients aged between 18 and 45 years old with MDD had been consecutively recruited in this study between 2011 and 2017, 128 of whom had suicide attempts. Their serum samples used to monitor fasting blood glucose, serum lipids as well as socio-demographic characteristics were collected. Besides, some clinical scales were also employed to measure symptoms of anxiety, depression and other conditions.	This study indicated that compared with non-suicide attempters, suicide attempters in young patients with MDD showed higher levels of FBG, TC, LDL-C (all p <  0.05) and lower levels of HDL-C(p <  0.001). Further logistic regression analysis suggested that suicide attempts were associated with increased FBG, decreased HDL-C, the course of disease, HAMD scores and obvious anxiety.	Suicide attempts in young patients with MDD may be predicted by metabolic levels in the future. And our findings suggested that the level of FBG and HDL-C can be promising biomarkers to predict the occurrence of this event.",Remaining

An interviewer-based questionnaire was used to obtain relevant clinical information from 50 WWE on CBZ and LEV monotherapy, respectively, and 50 age-matched controls. The diagnosis of epilepsy was clinical with electroencephalographic features taken into consideration and the seizures classified using the 2017 International League Against Epilepsy classification. The diagnosis of PCOS was based on the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine.	The frequency of PCOS and its subcomponent were higher among WWE compare to controls. PCOS was present in 22 (44%) of LEV group compare to 8 (16%) CBZ group. The frequency of its subcomponent was higher among those on LEV except for comparable effect with regard to oligomenorrhea. The levels of the sex steroid hormone were comparable in both groups of WWE except luteal phase luteinizing hormone, which was lower among the LEV group (P .001). The follicular phase estradiol level was lower (P .021), and follicle-stimulating hormone level was about 2-fold higher (P .03) among WWE compare to controls. The mean value testosterone was significantly lower among controls compared to WWE.	The increased frequency of PCOS and its subcomponent and the unsatisfactory effect of LEV compared to CBZ on reproductive endocrine function underscore the need for routine reproductive endocrine evaluation to improve overall quality of life.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Levels of circulating interleukin-18 (IL-18) have been positively correlated with carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and coronary plaque area and have identified IL-18 levels as important predictors of coronary events and cardiovascular mortality. This study aimed to examine the relationship between serum IL-18 and H. pylori-IgG antibody as a sign of H. pylori infection in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.	The carotid IMT, traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, levels of serum H. pylori-IgG and IL-18 were measured in 573 health checkup examinees.	Serum IL-18 and H. pylori-IgG levels were significantly increased in subjects with increased IMT in comparison with those with normal IMT. In subjects with increased IMT, serum H. pylori-IgG was positively correlated with serum IL-18 (r = .402, p = .002), and the association was independent of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors (β = 0.310, p < .001).	In health checkup examinees with increased IMT, serum IL-18 and H. pylori-IgG were independently correlated and were significantly higher than in subjects with normal IMT.",Remaining

In the present study, we investigate the effect of individually prescribed coloured overlays on the rate of reading. Subjects were 33 children and adults who: had consulted a specific learning difficulties clinic; had received treatment to normalise any conventional optometric and orthoptic anomalies; and subsequently reported symptomatic relief from coloured filters. These subjects carried out the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (which assesses visual rather than linguistic factors) under two conditions: with their chosen coloured overlay and with a control filter. Steps were taken to ensure that a strong placebo effect was associated with the control overlay and, when asked which they preferred, subjects were not significantly more likely to prefer their coloured overlay than the control filter (p=0.11). Nonetheless, the rate of reading was significantly faster with the coloured overlay than with the control (p=0.0019). Further analyses support the conclusion that individually prescribed coloured filters can improve reading performance for reasons that cannot be solely attributed to conventional optometric factors or to placebo effects.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention
996,18367428,Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape,Long-term cognitive and behavioural follow-up in three patients with eye closure-triggered paroxysmal activity.,"To study clinical, EEG, neuropsychological and behavioural evolution of three patients presenting with epileptic activity triggered by eye closure (EC) over a mean 10-year follow-up period.	All patients were studied at the time of the first observation (T0) and after a long follow-up period (T1). At both T0 and T1, each patient underwent: 1) traditional and specific activation techniques during prolonged video-EEG monitoring to detect possible inducing factors; 2) neuropsychological evaluations during video-EEG monitoring either with eyes closed or eyes open to detect any transient cognitive impairment (TCI); 3) detailed neuropsychological assessment without simultaneous EEG recording, to detect any stable cognitive impairment (SCI).	EEG recordings showed transient, generalized paroxysms in one case and a continuous epileptic activity triggered by eye closure in the other two cases, at both T0 and T1. In all patients, no particular epileptiform discharge-induced factors were identified except for eye blinking (spontaneous, voluntary or induced by corneal reflex). The results of neuropsychological assessment while eyes were closed as compared to performances with eyes open, showed no significant differences at T0 or at T1 in two cases, thus possibly indicating the absence of TCI. Wechsler Intelligence Scales showed a decrease in performance at T1 in the two patients with eye closure-induced, continuous epileptiform activity. Detailed neuropsychological assessment without EEG recordings demonstrated an impairment of facial recognition ability in all three patients at T1.	The lack of any differences between the results of neuropsychological tests performed with eyes open and eyes closed in two patients might suggest that not all eye-closure-triggered paroxysms are associated with TCI. On the other hand, our data highlight that EC-triggered, EEG epileptic discharges can produce long-lasting neuropsychological and behavioural effects, and also indicate that EEG discharges recurring over time might exert a disruptive effect on cognitive functions. Our three patients showed extreme variability across the neuropsychological tasks except for a facial recognition deficit that was evident in all cases, thus suggesting a possible dysfunction of temporo-occipital brain structures and/or of the fusiform face area as recently demonstrated by combined fMRI/EEG studies in patients with fixation-off sensitivity.",Remaining
997,37060000,BMC neurology,Association of body mass index and waist-to-height ratio with outcomes in ischemic stroke: results from the Third China National Stroke Registry.,"Conflicting reports of obesity paradox have led to confusion about weight management strategies for post-stroke patients. The main purpose of this study is to determine whether the obesity paradox measured by body mass index (BMI) or by waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is real.	We evaluated the association of general obesity measured by BMI, and abdominal obesity measured by WHtR with 1-year all-cause mortality, recurrence of stroke and combined vascular events of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients in a cohort -- the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III). Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were performed to investigate the association between obesity and clinical outcomes.	A total of 14,146 patients with ischemic stroke were included. When BMI was used as a measure of obesity, compared to the normal weight patients, mortality decreased in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.91], P = 0.0035) and obese patients (HR 0.54 [0.40-0.73], P < 0.0001); and increased in underweight patients (HR 2.55 [1.75-3.73], P < 0.0001). After adjustment for confounding factors, the protective effect of obesity and overweight disappeared. BMI had no association with recurrence of stroke or combined vascular events. When WHtR was used as a measure of obesity, obese patients had lower 1-year all-cause mortality (HR 0.64 [0.43-0.97], P = 0.0357). After adjustment for confounding factors, this difference disappeared; overweight patients still had lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42 [0.26-0.67], P = 0.0003), recurrence of stroke (aHR 0.77 [0.60-0.99], P = 0.0440) and combined vascular events (aHR 0.75 [0.58-0.95], P = 0.0198).	Among Chinese patients with AIS, our study does not support the BMI paradox; overweight patients measured by WHtR had a more favorable prognosis.

Medicaid claims data from two states were analyzed with a focus on adults treated for schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia. Patient groups were compared regarding demographic characteristics, pharmacologic treatment, and health service use during 180 days before and after a claim for either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.	A larger proportion of patients were treated for schizophrenia (N=38,760; 70.1%) than for schizoaffective disorder (N=16,570; 29.9%). During the 180 days before the index diagnosis claim, significantly more patients with schizoaffective disorder than those with schizophrenia were treated for depressive disorder (19.6% versus 11.4%, p<.001), bipolar disorder (14.8% versus 5.8%, p<.001), substance use disorder (11.8% versus 9.7%, p<.001), and anxiety disorder (6.9% versus 5.3%, p<.001). After the index claim, a similar proportion of both diagnostic groups were treated with antipsychotic medications (schizoaffective disorder, 87.3%; schizophrenia, 87.0%), although patients with schizoaffective disorder were significantly more likely than patients with schizophrenia to receive antidepressants (61.7% versus 44.0%, p<.001), mood stabilizers (55.2% versus 34.4%, p<.001), and anxiolytics (43.2% versus 35.1%, p<.001). Patients with schizoaffective disorder were also significantly more likely than patients with schizophrenia to receive psychotherapy (23.4% versus 13.0%, p<.001) and inpatient mental health care (9.4% versus 6.2%, p<.001), although the latter was not significant after the analysis controlled for background characteristics.	Schizoaffective disorder is commonly diagnosed among Medicaid beneficiaries. These patients often receive complex pharmacologic regimens, and many also receive treatment for mood disorders. Differences in service use patterns between schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia argue for separate consideration of their health care needs.",Remaining

This study was completed in three parts: (1) a narrative review of the literature; (2) an open-ended survey sent to the first authors of the identified articles; and (3) a descriptive analysis of responses. Results revealed that 56.7% of the identified articles did not report enough information of assessment procedures, 18.9% followed the assessment manual, 16.9% provided accommodations on a needs basis, and 7.5% used a consistent modified protocol. Individual responses showed that extra demonstrations (n = 5) were the most frequent accommodation, followed by extra breaks (n = 3), picture cards (n = 2), and hand-over-hand assistance (n = 1); some respondents stated that they did not provide accommodations. The findings indicate that a clear set of accommodation for motor skill assessments does not exist, though some commonalities were reported.

When injected into C57BL/6J mice, MPTP penetrates into the brain and is converted to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP[+]) by monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B in astrocytes. MPP[+] has high affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) on dopaminergic neurons, and is taken up into the cell to cause cell death. There have been relatively few researches on the acute MPTP toxicity to embryonic or newborn mice. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the influence of MPTP and MPP[+] on embryonic and newborn mice by measuring sequential changes in major indexes of MPTP toxicity and MPTP metabolism; levels of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), DAT, MAO-A and MAO-B. In addition, we measured the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in the brain of newborn mice. A single injection of MPTP and MPP[+] reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, in the brain of newborn mice about 6-12 hr after the injection. Similarly the levels of mRNAs and proteins of DAT and TH were lowered in the brain of embryonic and newborn mice as well. The levels of these indexes were generally recovered at 24 hr after injection, indicating that the neurotoxicity induced by a single injection of MPTP or MPP[+] is temporary and recoverable in embryonic and newborn mice. By contrast, no significant changes in the expression levels of MAO-A and MAO-B were observed in either MPTP- or MPP[+]-treated mice.",Animal-other

One factor that is generally assumed to be an important indicator of quality of care is the opportunity for community contact that users of a residential service have. This is illustrated by its inclusion in most instruments designed to assess quality of care in psychiatric services. The present study set out to examine the amount of community contact made by residents of three units of a London psychiatric rehabilitation service. Level of community contact was indeed found to be unrelated to the location of these facilities on a hospital site or in the community. However, interesting differences did emerge across units in the type of community contact made by residents and in the identity of residents' companions on community trips.",Remaining

It is demonstrated that iodine deficiency can be considered as sole cause of many thyroid abnormalities including mental disorders. Iodine deficiency of sufficient degree to cause hypothyroidism during fetus life and early infancy will be accompanied with brain abnormality possibly to the stage of mental retardation. The iodine deficiency among subjects in their early stage of childhood is not as severe as those in their fetus or infancy. In adult subjects the sever iodine deficiency can be also associated with mental disorders due to the direct side effects of hypothyroidism occurred by lack of iodine. The clinical manifestation of iodine deficiency show itself with psychological disorders in adult subjects. The status of iodine within blood can be evaluated through measurement of urinary iodine level and the low urinary concentration is an indicative of hypothyroidism. Mental retardation and brain damage due to iodine deficiency can be prevented if iodine supplementation prescribed duly on time.,Non-systematic-review
1004,2125805,Acta neurochirurgica,Haemodynamic aspects of clinical cerebral angiography. Concurrent two vessel monitoring using transcranial Doppler ultrasound.,"To overcome the technical limitations which have precluded noninvasive Doppler ultrasound in investigation of rapid cerebral haemodynamic responses in two cerebrovascular beds at the same time, we have modified a commercial 2 MHz pulsed Doppler instrument with online spectrum analysis. Two probes are activated intermittently, recording eight averaged Doppler-shifted spectra from each probe sequentially. Concurrent recordings of blood velocity in both middle cerebral arteries were performed during 25 selective iohexol carotid angiography runs in 13 patients with near normal cerebral vasculature. The technique permitted the differentiation between the specific responses confined to the recipient vascular bed, and the general responses occurring in remote brain areas as well. The specific response to iohexol was biphasic; a significant decrease in blood velocity occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, probably due to the high viscocity of iohexol. Between 4 and 12 s. blood velocity was significantly increased, reflecting the cerebrovascular response to hypertonic solutions. The blood velocity on the opposite side increased from less than 4 s through 45 s after iohexol. This concurs with studies using electromagnetic flowmetry, and suggests that these general responses are elicited by anxiety, discomfort and pain. Thus, no general responses were seen during angiography under general anaesthesia. Eight patients investigated during catheter flushing with normal saline showed a biphasic specific response reciprocal to that due to iohexol. A significant blood velocity peak occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, followed by a decrease between 4 and 60 s. The saline injections produced no pain and evoked no significant general response.",Remaining

The sample included 13,241 working people, 18-29, 30-39, and 40-59-years-old, randomly selected in France and interviewed by phone. Occupation, type of employment, physical demands, psychological demands, job dissatisfaction, gender, age, educational level, and income were considered. Data were analyzed with logistic models.	Alcohol abuse affected 20.4% of men and 7.5% of women; smoking 32.1% and 24.2%, respectively. Their patterns of association with the occupational factors varied with gender and age. Job dissatisfaction was the leading factor among young men (adjusted odds ratio for alcohol abuse and smoking: 1.71 and 2.02), whereas short-term employment was the leading factor among young women (1.69 and 1.58), this pattern being reversed in older generations. The pattern of associations of physical and psychological demands with outcomes is more complex, but overall psychological demands were more important for women (especially the younger ones) than men, especially for smoking (OR>1.6). Smoking within 5 min after waking was much more common among male and female smokers with these occupational factors, suggesting a potential dependency.	Workers with short-term employment and occupational demands are subject to a higher risk for alcohol abuse and smoking with high gender and age disparities. Gender and age should be considered when designing measures to prevent substance abuse related to occupation.",Remaining

1007,22363216,PLoS genetics,GTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of Parkinson's disease-associated LRRK2 is regulated by ArfGAP1.,"Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common cause of autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and also contribute to idiopathic PD. LRRK2 encodes a large multi-domain protein with GTPase and kinase activity. Initial data indicates that an intact functional GTPase domain is critically required for LRRK2 kinase activity. PD-associated mutations in LRRK2, including the most common G2019S variant, have variable effects on enzymatic activity but commonly alter neuronal process morphology. The mechanisms underlying the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of LRRK2 GTPase and kinase activity, and the pathogenic effects of familial mutations, are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a novel functional interaction between LRRK2 and ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 1 (ArfGAP1). LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 interact in vitro in mammalian cells and in vivo in brain, and co-localize in the cytoplasm and at Golgi membranes. PD-associated and functional mutations that alter the GTPase activity of LRRK2 modulate the interaction with ArfGAP1. The GTP hydrolysis activity of LRRK2 is markedly enhanced by ArfGAP1 supporting a role for ArfGAP1 as a GTPase-activating protein for LRRK2. Unexpectedly, ArfGAP1 promotes the kinase activity of LRRK2 suggesting a potential role for GTP hydrolysis in kinase activation. Furthermore, LRRK2 robustly and directly phosphorylates ArfGAP1 in vitro. Silencing of ArfGAP1 expression in primary cortical neurons rescues the neurite shortening phenotype induced by G2019S LRRK2 overexpression, whereas the co-expression of ArfGAP1 and LRRK2 synergistically promotes neurite shortening in a manner dependent upon LRRK2 GTPase activity. Neurite shortening induced by ArfGAP1 overexpression is also attenuated by silencing of LRRK2. Our data reveal a novel role for ArfGAP1 in regulating the GTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of LRRK2; reciprocally, LRRK2 phosphorylates ArfGAP1 and is required for ArfGAP1 neuronal toxicity. ArfGAP1 may represent a promising target for interfering with LRRK2-dependent neurodegeneration in familial and sporadic PD.",In-vitro-study

Drawing from a growing, but limited, literature on the topic, we outline a process map for identifying and troubleshooting barriers to care in this at-risk population.	Young adults with ADHD frequently lack the organizational skills, time management, prioritization, and persistence to manage their health care at an expected level of adult independence. These difficulties are compounded by a health-care system that has less time or fewer resources for supporting young adult patients.

We used human Tau purified from yeast models to generate new monoclonal antibodies, of which three were further characterized. The first antibody, ADx201, binds the Tau proline-rich region independently of the phosphorylation status, whereas the second, ADx215, detects an epitope formed by the Tau N terminus when Tau is not phosphorylated at Tyr(18). For the third antibody, ADx210, the binding site could not be determined because its epitope is probably conformational. All three antibodies stained tangle-like structures in different brain sections of THY-Tau22 transgenic mice and Alzheimer patients, and ADx201 and ADx210 also detected neuritic plaques in the cortex of the patient brains. In hippocampal homogenates from THY-Tau22 mice and cortex homogenates obtained from Alzheimer patients, ADx215 consistently stained specific low order Tau oligomers in diseased brain, which in size correspond to Tau dimers. ADx201 and ADx210 additionally reacted to higher order Tau oligomers and presumed prefibrillar structures in the patient samples. Our data further suggest that formation of the low order Tau oligomers marks an early disease stage that is initiated by Tau phosphorylation at N-terminal sites. Formation of higher order oligomers appears to require additional phosphorylation in the C terminus of Tau.

Before entering the ciliary compartment, IFT complexes and transported cargoes accumulate at or near the base of the cilium. The spatial organization of IFT proteins at the cilia base is key for understanding cilia formation and function. Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and computational averaging, we show that seven TZ, nine IFT, three Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and one centrosomal protein, form 9-clustered rings at the cilium base of a ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In the axial dimension, analyzed TZ proteins localize to a narrow region of about 30 nm while IFT proteins dock approximately 80 nm proximal to TZ. Moreover, the IFT-A subcomplex is positioned peripheral to the IFT-B subcomplex and the investigated BBS proteins localize near the ciliary membrane. The positioning of the HA-tagged N- and C-termini of the selected proteins enabled the prediction of the spatial orientation of protein particles and likely cargo interaction sites. Based on the obtained data, we built a comprehensive 3D-model showing the arrangement of the investigated ciliary proteins.",Remaining

A prospective six-year follow-up.,"A prospective, six-year follow-up investigation of 66 convicted female felons indicated that psychiatric, social, and familial factors defined and measured at the time of the index study affected the rate of criminal recidivism. Wide individual variation in the course of female criminality was observed. Prolonged supervision on parole or probation appeared to have therapeutic benefit. The most powerful predictors of recidivism were the diagnoses of drug dependence and antisocial personality, and a history of homosexuality. Familial criminality and maternal hysteria were also associated with an increased risk of serious and persistent recidivism. Educational, marital, and employment status contributed to a lesser extent, while race and type of index offense were only significant (P less than .05) when minor offenses were considered.",Remaining
1014,31667735,"American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions",Bioequivalence of a Newly Developed Dabigatran Etexilate Tablet Versus the Commercial Capsule and Impact of Rabeprazole-Induced Elevated Gastric pH on Exposure in Healthy Subjects.,"Dabigatran etexilate (DE) is an anticoagulant with proven efficacy and tolerability for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. For the commercial capsule, a complex formulation is used to maintain the acidic microenvironment required for maximal absorption. Consequently, its efficacy and safety are similar with or without concomitant intake of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). A simplified DE tablet formulation was developed and tested in two studies. One investigated bioequivalence (BE) of the novel DE tablet versus the commercial DE capsule. The other investigated DE bioavailability (BA) under pretreatment with the PPI rabeprazole and assessed the effect of elevated pH on exposure to dabigatran.	BE of the novel DE tablet versus the DE capsule was assessed in a randomized two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence crossover study (NCT03070171). The effect of rabeprazole on the BA of the DE tablet was assessed in an open-label, single-arm study (NCT03143166). Both studies were conducted at sites in Japan. Participants were healthy male volunteers, aged ≥ 20-40 years. In the BE study, participants received the DE tablet or capsule (single oral dose, 110 mg); primary endpoints were area under the concentration-time curve from baseline to the last quantifiable data point (AUC0-tz) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of unconjugated dabigatran. In the relative BA study, participants received the DE tablet (single oral dose, 110 mg) with or without rabeprazole pretreatment (once daily for 5 days, 20 mg); primary endpoints were AUC0-tz and Cmax of total dabigatran.	In total, 160 participants were randomized in the BE study; 36 participants were enrolled in the BA study. The 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean (gMean) ratios for AUC0-tz (101.4-116.0%) and Cmax (101.8-116.6%) of unconjugated dabigatran were within pre-defined acceptance criteria for BE. In the relative BA study, the gMeans of AUC0-tz (667 to 192 ng h/mL) and Cmax (83.1 to 21.8 ng/mL) were decreased by approximately 70% when the tablet was administered under rabeprazole pretreatment. The reduction in BA was observed at a mean gastric pH of 5.3. Treatment was well tolerated; no deaths, serious adverse events (AEs) or significant AEs were reported in either study.	The DE tablet demonstrated BE to the capsule; however, at high gastric pH, BA of the tablet was reduced by approximately 70%, which may lead to reduced efficacy. Data indicate the importance of examining not only BE under standard conditions, but relative BA at elevated gastric pH. Such investigations may avoid the reduced BA at elevated pH that is quite common in the target population (the elderly and/or patients treated with gastric-acid modifying co-medications), and therefore reduce treatment failure with DE.

1015,2202982,Postgraduate medical journal,The measurement of anxiety.,"Selected contemporary highlights and issues in the field of anxiety measurement are discussed. The concepts of state and trait anxiety, and the most widely used measures of these, are reviewed. A measure of state anxiety is essential in some clinical and experimental research and it is often very useful in clinical practice. Whilst existing measures are satisfactory for some purposes, none adequately assesses the psychological, somatic and behavioural components of anxiety. The measurement of trait anxiety is also important in some clinical research and as part of the assessment of selected patients. In some circumstances, self report measures of trait anxiety should be used in conjunction with a measure of social desirability. Patients who score low both on trait anxiety and social desirability may respond differently to experimental stressors from those who score low on trait anxiety and high on social desirability. This may have a number of implications, for example in the area of psychoimmunology. Four scales are reviewed in more detail: the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Clinical Anxiety Scale and the Fear Questionnaire. Finally, some future directions for research are outlined.",Non-systematic-review
1016,11172874,Journal of affective disorders,Serotonergic gene expression and depression: implications for developing novel antidepressants.,"The development and configuration of several neural networks is dependent on the actions of serotonin (5-HT) acting through multiple hetero- and autoreceptor subtypes. During early brain development 5-HT modulates morphogenetic activities, such as neural differentiation, axon outgrowth, and synaptic modeling. In the adult brain, midbrain raphe serotonergic neurons project to a variety of brain regions and modulate a wide range of physiological functions. Several lines of evidence indicate that genetically determined variability in serotonergic gene expression, as it has been documented for the 5-HT transporter, influences temperamental traits and may lead to psychopathological conditions with increased anxiety, depression, and aggression. Investigation of the regulation of serotonergic gene transcription and its impact on neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis spur interest to identify serotonergic gene-related molecular factors underlying disease states and to develop more effective antidepressant treatment strategies. Gene targeting strategies have increasingly been integrated into investigations of brain function and along with the fading dogma of a limited capacity of neurons for regeneration and reproducibility, it is realized that gene transfer techniques using efficient viral vectors in conjunction with neuron-selective transcriptional control systems may also be applicable to complex disorders of the brain. Given the fact that the 5-HT system continues to be an important target for drug development and production, novel strategies aiming toward the modification of 5-HT function at the level of gene expression are likely to be exploited by enterprises participating actively in the introduction of alternative therapeutic approaches.",Non-systematic-review

After completing a 12-month trial of home monitoring in hypertensive stroke patients, we investigated the following: 1. The proportion of 118 control patients offered a monitor at the end of the trial without nurse support who used it at least monthly after 6 months. 2. The proportion of 119 intervention patients continuing to use their monitor monthly after 18 months. 3. Possible predictors of monitoring weekly in the first month after receiving a monitor: age, gender, ethnicity, cognition, anxiety, disability, ability to monitor blood pressure unaided and smoking.	Participants (mean age 71, 34% with disability and 21% from ethnic minorities) were surveyed 1 and/or 6 months after the trial ended by postal and/or telephone questionnaire.	Of 237 potential participants, 53 (22%) declined, 16 (6%) were lost and 9 (4%) died during follow-up. Overall, reported monthly use of the monitor without nurse support was 47% [54/114, 95% confidence interval (CI) 38.2-56.5] at 6 months and 50% (57/114, 95% CI 40.8-59.2) at 18 months. Participants who monitored weekly after 1 month were more likely than the remainder to have no disability [Rankin score ≤ 1; relative risk (RR) 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5] and low anxiety levels (FEAR score = 0; RR 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.0).

1018,11510567,International review of cytology,Nonneuronal cellular prion protein.,"The normal cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is a membrane sialoglycoprotein of unknown function having the unique property of adopting an abnormal tertiary conformation. The pathological conformer PrP(sc) would be the agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases. They include scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The conversion of PrP(c) into PrP(sc) in the brain governs the clinical phenotype of the disease. However, the three-dimensional structure change of PrP(c) can also take place outside the central nervous system, in nonneuronal cells particularly of lymphoid tissue where the agent replicates. In natural infection, PrP(c) in nonneuronal cells of peripheral extracerebral organs may play a key role as the receptor required to enable the entry of the infectious agent into the host. In the present review we have undertaken a first evaluation of compelling data concerning the PrP(c)-expressing cells of nonneuronal origin present in cerebral and extracerebral tissues. The analysis of tissue, cellular, and subcellular localization of PrP(c) may help us better understand the biological function of PrP(c) and provide some information on physiopathological processes underlying prion diseases.",Non-systematic-review

In some severe cases, behavioral, environmental, and pharmacological interventions are not sufficient to alleviate these potentially life-threatening symptoms. It has been suggested that in those cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) could be an option. This review summarizes the scientific literature on ECT for agitation and aggression in dementia.	We performed a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Two reviewers extracted the following data from the retrieved articles: number of patients and their age, gender, diagnoses, types of problem behavior, treatments tried before ECT, specifications of the ECT treatment, use of rating scales, treatment results, follow-up data, and adverse effects.	The initial search yielded 264 articles, 17 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, one was a prospective cohort study, one was a case-control study, and the others were retrospective chart reviews, case series, or case reports. Clinically significant improvement was observed in the majority (88%) of the 122 patients described, often early in the treatment course. Adverse effects were most commonly mild, transient, or not reported.	The reviewed articles suggest that ECT could be an effective treatment for severe and treatment-refractory agitation and aggression in dementia, with few adverse consequences. Nevertheless, because of the substantial risk of selection bias, the designs of the studies reviewed, and their small number, further prospective studies are needed to substantiate these preliminary positive results.",Human-systematic-review
1022,36810252,JCI insight,UBE3A expression during early postnatal brain development is required for proper dorsomedial striatal maturation.,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by loss of functional ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). Previous studies showed that UBE3A plays an important role in the first postnatal weeks of mouse brain development, but its precise role is unknown. Since impaired striatal maturation has been implicated in several mouse models for NDDs, we studied the importance of UBE3A in striatal maturation. We used inducible Ube3a mouse models to investigate the maturation of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from dorsomedial striatum. MSNs of mutant mice matured properly till postnatal day 15 (P15) but remained hyperexcitable with fewer excitatory synaptic events at later ages, indicative of stalled striatal maturation in Ube3a mice. Reinstatement of UBE3A expression at P21 fully restored MSN excitability but only partially restored synaptic transmission and the operant conditioning behavioral phenotype. Gene reinstatement at P70 failed to rescue both electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. In contrast, deletion of Ube3a after normal brain development did not result in these electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. This study emphasizes the role of UBE3A in striatal maturation and the importance of early postnatal reinstatement of UBE3A expression to obtain a full rescue of behavioral phenotypes associated with striatal function in AS.",Animal-other

With strictly defined MRI diagnostic criteria, the electroencephalographic (EEG) focus was correctly lateralized in 86% of patients. Excluding patients with structural lesions, the criteria provided for correct lateralization of the epileptogenic focus in 78% and false lateralization in 5%. Hippocampal atrophy on T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity from mesial structures on T2-weighted scans were highly reliable for lateralization. Postoperative outcome did not differ between the patients with normal and those with abnormal findings on MRI, but the group sample was inadequate to assess the issue of surgical outcome. These findings suggest that with appropriate techniques and strictly defined diagnostic criteria, MRI can provide reliable seizure lateralization in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy.",Remaining

Surgical resection of medullary hemangioblastomas is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. We present a unique institutional experience over a 12-year period.	Between 1987 to 1998, 47 hemangioblastomas were surgically resected and analyzed retrospectively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to 136 months with an average of 35 months.	Thirty-nine single hemangioblastomas were distributed in 3 anatomical areas: pontomedullary, medullary, and cervico-medullary. They were either focal intramedullary or dorsal exophytic. There were cyst formations in 97.4% of the single hemangioblastomas. The major feeding arteries and the tumor blush could be clearly visualized on angiogram, sometimes even on MRA. All medullary hemangioblastomas were radically removed. Postoperatively, 61.5% patients had clinical improvement, two patients' symptoms remained unchanged and 11 patients deteriorated; of the latter, 8 patients improved later with proper therapy, and 2 patients died.	Preoperative diagnosis of medullary hemangioblastoma is possible with MRI. With improved microsurgical technique and better understanding of the vascular pattern of the tumor, total surgical resection can be performed with <5% mortality. The surgical strategy is en bloc excision, as piecemeal resection can lead to uncontrollable hemorrhage. Removal of large solid hemangioblastomas may result in severe postoperative edema and/or hemorrhage in the medulla affecting the respiratory and vagal centers. Preoperative embolization through the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) can be helpful in this situation.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

The CLA was covalently linked to PTX. The conjugate was stable in PBS and rat plasma in vitro and had no microtubule assembly activity in solution and slight effect of arresting cell cycle progression at the G(2)-M phase. The in vitro cytotoxicity of conjugate was lower than that of PTX (p < 0.05). The conjugate showed higher cellular uptake efficiency on C6 glioma cells. The entire pharmacokinetic index revealed the significant enhancement of the conjugate pharmacokinetics compared with that in PTX (p < 0.01). The conjugate, unlike PTX, could distribute in brain tissue and retained higher concentrations throughout 360 h. The anti-tumor efficacy in brain tumor-bearing rats after administering conjugate was significantly higher than that after giving Taxol (p < 0.01). In conclusion, this CLA-PTX conjugate showed great potential to become a new prodrug of PTX and the methodology can be applied to other anticancer drugs.",Animal-drug-intervention

Differences in how studies operationalize social media use and consider potential moderating effects of sex and extraversion could contribute to inconsistencies. A distinction has been made between three types of social media use: passive, active and problematic. This study examined longitudinal associations between these types of adolescents' social media use and depression/anxiety symptoms and moderation effects of sex or extraversion. At ages 13 (T1) and 14 (T2), 257 adolescents completed an online questionnaire regarding their depression and anxiety symptoms and problematic social media use as well as three social media use diaries. Cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) revealed a positive association between problematic use and later anxiety symptoms (β = .16, p = .010). Extraversion moderated the association between active use and anxiety (β = -.14, p = .032). Specifically, active use predicted higher subsequent anxiety symptoms only in adolescents with low to moderate levels of extraversion. No sex moderation was found. While social media use (active or problematic) predicted later anxiety symptoms (but not depression), the reverse was not the case. However, highly extraverted individuals seem to be less vulnerable to potential negative effects of social media use.",Remaining

In the first follow-up series, borderline psychopathology was associated with higher levels of psychiatric service use (emergency, daycare, and inpatient). Markov analyses indicated that the transition between levels of psychiatric service use followed a stationary, second order process (i.e. the immediate past and current service use, predicted use on the next follow-up, and the relationship did not depend on the point in time examined in the follow-up series). Further, the transition probabilities generated from this model did not depend significantly on diagnosis. Predictions from the Markov model about the cumulative probability that subjects would use the highest level of psychiatric services were tested on a second series of follow-ups on the same subjects 20 months later. The model-based predictions (starting from the observed levels in the first two follow-ups of the second series) clustered into three groups, of high, middle, and low predicted probabilities. The subject group with the lowest predicted likelihood had a cumulative probability of 0.19 for using emergency, daycare, or inpatient hospitalization by 22 months of follow-up, whereas the group with the highest likelihood (containing a disproportionate number of BPD subjects) had a cumulative observed probability of 0.80. The Markov model generated from this second series supported the stationarity of the transition process. BPD subjects began using high levels of psychiatric services, but their transition from one level to another over time followed a process similar to that of non-BPD subjects.",Remaining

An open-label, conversion study was conducted, consisting of a 2-week LTG-IR Baseline Phase, followed by a 2-week LTG-XR Treatment Phase and a 1-week LTG-IR Phase. Forty-four subjects (> or =13 years of age) were enrolled and grouped as metabolically neutral (15), induced (15), or inhibited (14) based on the effects of the concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the clearance of LTG. The primary outcome was LTG PK parameters upon conversion. Secondary outcomes included seizure frequency, adverse events, and subject's preference.	LTG-XR and LTG-IR regimens were similar with respect to area under curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC (0-24)), apart from the induced group, where the AUC (0-24) of LTG-XR was on average 21% lower than for LTG-IR. A reduction in the LTG Cmax was observed for LTG-XR compared to LTG-IR resulting in a decrease in the peak-to-trough fluctuation in serum LTG concentrations. The steady-state, dose-normalized, trough concentrations for LTG-XR were similar to those of LTG-IR. The median time to peak concentration (Tmax) following administration of LTG-XR ranged from 4 to 6 h, 6 to 10 h, and 9 to 11 h in the induced, neutral, and inhibited groups, respectively.

Organotypic cultures were exposed at 37 degrees C for 0, 7, 30 and 60 min to a glucose-free NaCN-containing medium. Histological analysis using thionin staining and MAP2 immunostaining showed differences in the temporal profile of neuronal damage in hippocampal and neocortical structures, i.e., in decreasing order, CA1 (7 min) > CA3 and neocortical layers II, III, V, VI (30 min) > DG and neocortical layer IV (60 min). In parallel to the neurodegeneration study, the time course and the regional pattern of microglial and astroglial changes were also examined using GS-B4 isolectin and GFAP as immunohistochemical markers, respectively. The GS-B4 isolectin staining revealed an early (at 7 min for the hippocampus) and a specific microglial activation located in areas undergoing neuronal damage. For both organotypic cultures, astrogliosis occurred later (after 30 min of stress) with no specific regional distribution. Both hippocampal and neocortical cultures submitted to histotoxic ischemia allowed the replication of many of the cellular events observed in response to global ischemia in vivo. These findings support the hypothesis that neuron-neuron connections as well as interactions between neurons and glial cells are essential to reproduce in vitro the selective neuronal vulnerability described in vivo.",In-vitro-study

For the sake of improving the hemodynamic cerebral ischemia, we performed stent replacement for innominate artery stenosis and right carotid artery stenting. Endovascular treatment of subclavian and innominate artery disease is a safe procedure. In addition, for the protection of thromboembolic migration, we performed balloon protection of the external carotid artery and filter protection of the internal carotid artery.	Stent replacement for these lesions can be performed safely with the right approach and protection methods, even when the only accessible route is the right brachial artery.",Human-case-report
1036,32000208,Professional case management,The Montreal Cognitive Test Intervention: The Relationship Between Cognitive-Impaired Patients and Readmissions.,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between cognitive impairment among Medicare patients and hospital readmissions. Although there has been research on cognitive impairment and readmissions, seldom action has been done in regard to economic costs with hospitals. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) established the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program in 2012. Hospitals may not be fully reimbursed for Medicare patient readmissions within 30 days ().	An ethnographic approach was utilized with purposive sampling.This was a nonrandomized purposive sampling intervention study using data from Epic health systems database.	The intervention spanned over 5 months and the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) intervention was conducted in the hospital in a 3-phase study. The purpose of the study was for quality improvement and to detect cognitive impairment among Medicare readmitted patients.	The result shows cognitive impairment is prevalent among the Medicare population. Seventy-one (61%) had evidence of cognitive impairment (i.e., obtained a score below 25). The mean MoCA score for the 71 patients identified as having evidence of cognitive impairment was 17.84 (SD, ±5.06; range, 5-24). MoCA is useful in the acute care setting for identifying patients who are at increased risk for readmission. A randomly assigned controlled clinical trial test is warranted to further validate the association between cognitive impairment and readmissions.	The ACA aims to improve case management by improving effective outcomes for individuals, care coordination among hospital professionals, economic efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and the collaborative process that services the patient. Hospitals across the country are implementing polices that adhere to patient-centered care. Before the ACA was passed, health care services were value metric. The ACA regulates hospitals toward holistic care or quality metrics. Case management will be critical, as hospitals look toward innovative methods to evaluate their patients.",Remaining

A Qualitative Study.,"The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the health service is increasing. In spite of limitations, such as lack of time and experience, the deployment of ICTs in the healthcare system has advantages which include patient satisfaction with secure messaging, and time saving benefits and utility for patients and health professionals. ICTs may be helpful as either interventions on their own or as complementary tools to help patients stop smoking.	To gather opinions from both medical professionals and smokers about an email-based application that had been designed by our research group to help smoking cessation, and identify the advantages and disadvantages associated with interventions based on the utilization of ICTs for this purpose.	A qualitative, descriptive-interpretative study with a phenomenological perspective was performed to identify and interpret the discourses of the participating smokers and primary healthcare professionals. Data were obtained through two techniques: semi-structured individual interviews and discussion groups, which were recorded and later systematically and literally transcribed together with the interviewer's notes. Data were analyzed with the ATLAS TI 6.0 programme.	Seven individual interviews and four focal groups were conducted. The advantages of the application based on the email intervention designed by our research group were said to be the saving of time in consultations and ease of access for patients who found work timetables and following a programme for smoking cessation incompatible. The disadvantages were thought to be a lack of personal contact with the healthcare professional, and the possibility of cheating/ self-deception, and a greater probability of relapse on the part of the smokers.	Both patients and healthcare professionals viewed the email-based application to help patients stop smoking as a complementary aid to face-to-face consultations. Nevertheless, ICTs could not substitute personal contact in the smoking cessation programme.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

A new stroke imaging protocol was initiated at Emory University Hospital including computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and computed tomographic perfusion (CTP). All patients presenting within 4.5 hours from last known normal time with suspected stroke were prospectively identified. Impact of CTA and CTP on the clinical management was recorded prospectively by stroke team members.	During the study period, 87 patients met eligibility criteria for the CTA/CTP protocol, of which 83 (95%) underwent this upfront comprehensive imaging protocol and 30 (34%) received IV thrombolytics. Overall, stroke team members reported that CTA and/or CTP aided their clinical management in 39 (47%) cases, including aiding in identification of a nonstroke diagnosis (n = 18), triage to the neurologic intensive care unit (n = 9), early triage to endovascular therapy (n = 4), and initiation of IV thrombolytic for low National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score with large vessel occlusion (n = 3). Door to needle time ≤60 minutes was achieved in only 18% of patients receiving IV thrombolysis during the study period, but had improved to 44% in the subsequent 6-month period.	An upfront CTA/CTP protocol aided stroke team decision-making in nearly half of cases. Implementation of a CTA/CTP protocol was associated with a learning curve of 6 months before door to needle time ≤60 minutes returned to similar rates as the pre-CTA/CTP protocol.",Remaining
1040,32967293,Genes,Unveiling Sex-Based Differences in the Effects of Alcohol Abuse: A Comprehensive Functional Meta-Analysis of Transcriptomic Studies.,"The abuse of alcohol, one of the most popular psychoactive substances, can cause several pathological and psychological consequences, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). An impaired ability to stop or control alcohol intake despite adverse health or social consequences characterize AUD. While AUDs predominantly occur in men, growing evidence suggests the existence of distinct cognitive and biological consequences of alcohol dependence in women. The molecular and physiological mechanisms participating in these differential effects remain unknown. Transcriptomic technology permits the detection of the biological mechanisms responsible for such sex-based differences, which supports the subsequent development of novel personalized therapeutics to treat AUD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of transcriptomics studies regarding alcohol dependence in humans with representation from both sexes. For each study, we processed and analyzed transcriptomic data to obtain a functional profile of pathways and biological functions and then integrated the resulting data by meta-analysis to characterize any sex-based transcriptomic differences associated with AUD. Global results of the transcriptomic analysis revealed the association of decreased tissue regeneration, embryo malformations, altered intracellular transport, and increased rate of RNA and protein replacement with female AUD patients. Meanwhile, our analysis indicated that increased inflammatory response and blood pressure and a reduction in DNA repair capabilities are associated with male AUD patients. In summary, our functional meta-analysis of transcriptomic studies provides evidence for differential biological mechanisms of AUD patients of differing sex.",Human-systematic-review

Activated macrophages have been shown to induce vascular proliferation and play an important role in ischemic stroke. In this study, we examined the therapeutic effect of GM-CSF on the ischemic brain by activating microglia/macrophages. Rats were subjected to 1-h intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and received an intracarotid injection of GM-CSF (5 ng) or saline immediately after reperfusion. Infarct volume, neurological function and histological findings were assessed 48 h later. An intracarotid injection of GM-CSF reduced the infarct volume and improved neurological function at 48 h after reperfusion. Histological analysis revealed that the number of activated microglia/macrophages to be increased and the number of apoptotic cells to be decreased in the area of the penumbra. These results suggest that intracarotid injection of GM-CSF may have a therapeutic effect on brain ischemia via activation of microglia/macrophages.",Animal-drug-intervention

A total of 88 children, 5-14 years old, diagnosed with PMNE were enrolled in this randomized control trial (RCT) from June 2017 to June 2020. After informed written consent patients were randomized to one of the two therapeutic groups. Group 1 received one puff of desmopressin nasal spray 1 h before bedtime every night. Group 2 received one pill of solifenacin 5 mg plus one puff of desmopressin nasal spray 1 h before bedtime every night. All patients were evaluated after three months for their response to treatment and drug side effects.	The mean age in desmopressin alone group and solifenacin plus desmopressin group was 8.1 ± 2.2 (5-14) and 7.9 ± 2.2 (5-14) years respectively (p-value >0.05). In group 2, 37/44 (84.09%) patients achieved complete response after three months of treatment in comparison to group 1 in which 27/44 (61.36%) patients showed complete response (p-value <0.05).

Six years of annual data were analyzed for 506 boys using a mixed effects polynomial growth curve model. They tested whether distinct measures of psychopathology and behavioral problems (i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, depression, and violence) assessed in early adolescence could prospectively predict level and change in alcohol and marijuana use. Higher levels of all of the types of psychopathology predicted higher levels of alcohol use, and higher levels of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and violence predicted higher levels of marijuana use. Only conduct disorder predicted linear growth in alcohol use, and none of the measures predicted growth in marijuana use. The results suggest that drug use prevention programs should target youths with early symptoms of psychopathology.",Remaining

In this study, rats harboring RG-2 tumors were given 15-minute intracarotid infusions of LTC4 at concentrations ranging from 0.5 microgram to 50.0 micrograms (seven rats in each dose group). Blood-tumor and blood-brain barrier permeability were determined by quantitative autoradiography using 14C aminoisobutyric acid. The transfer constant for permeability (Ki) within the tumors was increased twofold by LTC4 doses of 2.5, 5.0, and 50.0 micrograms compared to vehicle alone (90.00 +/- 21.14, 92.68 +/- 15.04, and 80.17 +/- 16.15 vs. 39.37 +/- 6.45 microliters/gm/min, respectively; mean +/- standard deviation; p less than 0.01). No significant change in Ki within the tumors was observed at the 0.5-microgram LTC4 dose. Blood-brain barrier permeability was selectively increased within the tumors. At no dose in this study did leukotrienes increase permeability within normal brain. To determine the duration of increased opening of the blood-tumor barrier by LTC4 administration, Ki was measured at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after termination of a 15-minute LTC4 infusion (seven rats at each time point). The mean Ki value was still high at 15 minutes (92.68 +/- 15.04 microliters/gm/min), but declined at 30 minutes (56.58 +/- 12.50 microliters/gm/min) and 60 minutes (55.40 +/- 8.10 microliters/gm/min) after the end of LTC4 infusion. Sulfidopeptide leukotrienes LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 and LTF4 were infused to compare their potency in opening the blood-tumor barrier. The mean leukotriene E4 was the most potent, increasing the permeability value 3 1/2-fold compared with vehicle alone (139.86 +/- 23.95 vs. 39.37 +/- 6.45 microliters/gm/min).",Animal-drug-intervention
1046,30291873,Pharmacological research,Neuronal and astrocytic primary cilia in the mature brain.,"Primary cilia are tiny microtubule-based signaling devices that regulate a variety of physiological functions, including metabolism and cell division. Defects in primary cilia lead to a myriad of diseases in humans such as obesity and cancers. In the mature brain, both neurons and astrocytes contain a single primary cilium. Although neuronal primary cilia are not directly involved in synaptic communication, their pathophysiological impacts on obesity and mental disorders are well recognized. In contrast, research on astrocytic primary cilia lags far behind. Currently, little is known about their functions and molecular pathways in the mature brain. Unlike neurons, postnatal astrocytes retain the capacity of cell division and can become reactive and proliferate in response to various brain insults such as epilepsy, ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative β-amyloid plaques. Since primary cilia derive from the mother centrioles, astrocyte proliferation must occur in coordination with the dismantling and ciliogenesis of astrocyte cilia. In this regard, the functions, signal pathways, and structural dynamics of neuronal and astrocytic primary cilia are fundamentally different. Here we discuss and compare the current understanding of neuronal and astrocytic primary cilia.",Non-systematic-review

It was hypothesized that DVP in combination with quetiapine would be more effective than DVP alone for treating mania associated with adolescent bipolar disorder. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that quetiapine would be well tolerated.	Thirty manic or mixed bipolar I adolescents (12-18 years) received an initial DVP dose of 20 mg/kg and were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of combination therapy with quetiapine, which was titrated to 450 mg/day (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15). Primary efficacy measures were change from baseline to endpoint in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score and YMRS response rate. Safety and tolerability were assessed weekly.	The DVP + quetiapine group demonstrated a statistically significantly greater reduction in YMRS scores from baseline to endpoint than the DVP + placebo group (F(1,27) = 5.04, p =.03). Moreover, YMRS response rate was significantly greater in the DVP + quetiapine group than in the DVP + placebo group (87% versus 53%; Fisher exact test, p =.05). No significant group differences from baseline to endpoint in safety measures were noted. Sedation, rated as mild or moderate, was significantly more common in the DVP + quetiapine group than in the DVP + placebo group.	The findings of this study indicate that quetiapine in combination with DVP is more effective for the treatment of adolescent bipolar mania than DVP alone.

Uncertainties remain whether there is a single underlying mechanism for visual hallucinations or they have different disease-dependent causes. However, irrespective of mechanism, visual hallucinations are difficult to treat. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded a research programme to investigate visual hallucinations in the key and high burden areas of eye disease, dementia and Parkinson's disease, culminating in a workshop to develop a unified framework for their clinical management. Here we summarise the evidence base, current practice and consensus guidelines that emerged from the workshop.Irrespective of clinical condition, case ascertainment strategies are required to overcome reporting stigma. Once hallucinations are identified, physical, cognitive and ophthalmological health should be reviewed, with education and self-help techniques provided. Not all hallucinations require intervention but for those that are clinically significant, current evidence supports pharmacological modification of cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic systems, or reduction of cortical excitability. A broad treatment perspective is needed, including carer support. Despite their frequency and clinical significance, there is a paucity of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial evidence where the primary outcome is an improvement in visual hallucinations. Key areas for future research include the development of valid and reliable assessment tools for use in mechanistic studies and clinical trials, transdiagnostic studies of shared and distinct mechanisms and when and how to treat visual hallucinations.",Non-systematic-review

Results indicated that in this unique sample of detained persons with psychotic disorders; (1) increase in the severity of community violence is associated with medication non-adherence, all dimensions of poor insight into illness, and several previously reported covariates such as substance use comorbidity; (2) no relationship was found between insight and adherence in this particular sample; (3) multivariate analyses showed that select covariates, along with medication adherence, and select insight domains predicted a total of 73% of the magnitude of ODV behavior in this sample. Overall, medication non-adherence explained a large amount of how violently participants behaved toward others. Since non-adherence was independent of poor insight, it may be more worthwhile for clinicians to develop treatment strategies to target medication adherence without directly addressing an elusive target such as insight into illness. Treatment addressing medication adherence needs to concomitantly target substance use behaviors since the latter was responsible for a substantial increase in ODV.",Remaining

Peri- and postmenopausal women participating in a prospective study of HIV-infected and at-risk midlife women (the Ms. Study) were interviewed to determine whether they experienced hot flashes and/or vaginal dryness and to what they attributed these symptoms.	Of 278 women, 70% were perimenopausal; 54% were HIV-infected; and 52% had used crack, cocaine, heroin, and/or methadone within the past 5 years. Hot flashes were reported by 189 women and vaginal dryness was reported by 101 women. Overall, 69.8% attributed hot flashes to menopause and 28.7% attributed vaginal dryness to menopause. In bivariate analyses, age 45 years and older was associated with attributing hot flashes and vaginal dryness to menopause, and postmenopausal status and at least 12 years of education were associated with attributing vaginal dryness to menopause, but HIV status was not associated with attribution to menopause. In multivariate analysis, significant interactions between age and menopause status were found for both attribution of hot flashes (P=0.019) and vaginal dryness (P=0.029). Among perimenopausal women, older age was independently associated with attribution to menopause for hot flashes (adjusted odds ratio=1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.4, P=0.001) and vaginal dryness (adjusted odds ratio=1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6, P=0.011). None of the tested factors were independently associated with attribution to menopause among postmenopausal women.	Tailored health education programs may be beneficial in increasing the knowledge about menopause among HIV-infected and drug-using women, particularly those who are perimenopausal.",Remaining

Direct contact with patients during pharmacy experiential education helps establish positive attitudes toward people with mental illness yet may not be available to all students. The use of film in pharmacy education has the potential to facilitate learning and improve attitudes.	We evaluated students' perceptions regarding the impact of an elective course for pharmacy students which incorporated feature films about mental illnesses. Students completed surveys addressing their perceptions of each film's role in facilitation of learning, attitudes about mental illness, and comfort level for interacting with patients with mental illness.	A total of 125 students completed a course featuring 17 films over the four-year study period. The films with the highest weighted positive rankings were Temple Grandin, Helen, As Good As It Gets, Born on the Fourth of July, Iris, A Beautiful Mind, and Silver Linings Playbook. Less favored films included One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Prozac Nation, and My Own Private Idaho.	Direct contact with patients may best prepare future pharmacists to serve the needs of people with mental illness. This study suggests that students perceive feature films used in an elective course may have a positive impact on facilitating learning and improving attitudes of pharmacy students toward individuals with mental illness. Further well-designed studies are warranted, including in other health professions students, to substantiate and define the role of film as a tool to teach and address stigma.",Remaining

Further efforts are required to develop novel and more efficacious therapeutic strategies, especially for refractory epileptic syndromes showing few and anecdotic therapeutic options.	Stiripentol (STP) is a second generation AED that shows GABAergic activity, with immature brain selectivity, and an indirect metabolic action on co-administered AEDs. Two pivotal studies demonstrated STP efficacy in patients with Dravet syndrome with refractory partial seizures, and marketing authorization in Europe, Canada and Japan was granted thereafter. Post-marketing surveys reported a good efficacy and tolerability profile. In addition, interesting data is currently emerging regarding off-label experimentation of STP in other forms of epilepsy.	STP is an important addition to the limited treatment options available for patients resistant to common AEDs. The possibility to inhibit seizures through the metabolic pathway of lactate dehydrogenase and the inhibitory effects on the entry of Na(+) and Ca(2+) are the most recent findings to emerge about STP and could be proof of its neuroprotective action. Moreover, its positive effects on cognitive function, its good safety and tolerability profile and the increasing data about STP efficacy on other refractory epileptic syndromes may prove to be fertile grounds for further investigation.",Non-systematic-review
1061,23880590,Current opinion in psychiatry,Implementation strategies for collaborative primary care-mental health models.,"Extensive research exists that collaborative primary care-mental health models can improve care and outcomes for patients. These programs are currently being implemented throughout the United States and beyond. The purpose of this study is to review the literature and to generate an overview of strategies currently used to implement such models in daily practice.	Six overlapping strategies to implement collaborative primary care-mental health models were described in 18 selected studies. We identified interactive educational strategies, quality improvement change processes, technological support tools, stakeholder engagement in the design and execution of implementation plans, organizational changes in terms of expanding the task of nurses and financial strategies such as additional collaboration fees and pay for performance incentives.	Considering the overwhelming evidence about the effectiveness of primary care-mental health models, there is a lack of good studies focusing on their implementation strategies. In practice, these strategies are multifaceted and locally defined, as a result of intensive and required stakeholder engagement. Although many barriers still exist, the implementation of collaborative models could have a chance to succeed in the United States, where new service delivery and payment models, such as the Patient-Centered Medical Home, the Health Home and the Accountable Care Organization, are being promoted.",Non-systematic-review
1062,23262119,Experimental neurology,Serotonergic pharmacotherapy promotes cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury.,"Cortical reorganization plays a significant role in recovery of function after injury of the central nervous system. The neural mechanisms that underlie this reorganization may be the same as those normally responsible for skilled behaviors that accompany extended sensory experience and, if better understood, could provide a basis for further promoting recovery of function after injury. The work presented here extends studies of spontaneous cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury to the role of rehabilitative strategies on cortical reorganization. We use a complete spinal transection model to focus on cortical reorganization in response to serotonergic (5-HT) pharmacotherapy without any confounding effects from spared fibers left after partial lesions. 5-HT pharmacotherapy has previously been shown to improve behavioral outcome after SCI but the effect on cortical organization is unknown. After a complete spinal transection in the adult rat, 5-HT pharmacotherapy produced more reorganization in the sensorimotor cortex than would be expected by transection alone. This reorganization was dose dependent, extended into intact (forelimb) motor cortex, and, at least in the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex, followed a somatotopic arrangement. Animals with the greatest behavioral outcome showed the greatest extent of cortical reorganization suggesting that the reorganization is likely to be in response to both direct effects of 5-HT on cortical circuits and indirect effects in response to the behavioral improvement below the level of the lesion.",Animal-drug-intervention

Primary neurons were isolated and cultured. Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups and fed diets with different amounts of n‑3 PUFAs. A model of spinal cord contusion was created at the T10 spinal segment and the composition of PUFAs was analyzed using gas chromatography. Spinal repair and motor function were evaluated postoperatively. Assessment of the effects of n‑3 PUFAs on autophagy and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) was performed using immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. In vitro, n‑3 PUFAs inhibited mTORC1 and enhanced autophagy. The n‑3 PUFA levels and the ratio of n‑3 PUFA to n‑6 PUFA in the spinal cord and serum of rats fed a high‑n‑3 PUFA diet were higher before and after operation (P<0.05). Additionally, rats in the high‑n‑3 PUFA group showed improved motor function recovery, spinal cord repair‑related protein expression level (MBP, Galc and GFAP). Expression levels if these protiens in the high‑n‑3 PUFA diet group expressed the highest levels, followed by the low‑n‑3 PUFA diet group and finally the control group (P<0.05). high‑n‑3 PUFA diet promoted autophagy ability and inhibited activity of the mTORC1 signaling pathway compared with the low‑n‑3 PUFA diet group or the control group (P<0.05). These results suggest that exogenous dietary n‑3 PUFAs can inhibit mTORC1 signaling and enhance autophagy, promoting functional recovery of rats with SCI.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

1067,25080285,Brain : a journal of neurology,Genetic impact on cognition and brain function in newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: ICICLE-PD study.,"Parkinson's disease is associated with multiple cognitive impairments and increased risk of dementia, but the extent of these deficits varies widely among patients. The ICICLE-PD study was established to define the characteristics and prevalence of cognitive change soon after diagnosis, in a representative cohort of patients, using a multimodal approach. Specifically, we tested the 'Dual Syndrome' hypothesis for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, which distinguishes an executive syndrome (affecting the frontostriatal regions due to dopaminergic deficits) from a posterior cortical syndrome (affecting visuospatial, mnemonic and semantic functions related to Lewy body pathology and secondary cholinergic loss). An incident Parkinson's disease cohort (n = 168, median 8 months from diagnosis to participation) and matched control group (n = 85) were recruited to a neuroimaging study at two sites in the UK. All participants underwent clinical, neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments. The three neuroimaging tasks (Tower of London, Spatial Rotations and Memory Encoding Tasks) were designed to probe executive, visuospatial and memory encoding domains, respectively. Patients were also genotyped for three polymorphisms associated with cognitive change in Parkinson's disease and related disorders: (i) rs4680 for COMT Val158Met polymorphism; (ii) rs9468 for MAPT H1 versus H2 haplotype; and (iii) rs429358 for APOE-ε2, 3, 4. We identified performance deficits in all three cognitive domains, which were associated with regionally specific changes in cortical activation. Task-specific regional activations in Parkinson's disease were linked with genetic variation: the rs4680 polymorphism modulated the effect of levodopa therapy on planning-related activations in the frontoparietal network; the MAPT haplotype modulated parietal activations associated with spatial rotations; and APOE allelic variation influenced the magnitude of activation associated with memory encoding. This study demonstrates that neurocognitive deficits are common even in recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease, and that the associated regional brain activations are influenced by genotype. These data further support the dual syndrome hypothesis of cognitive change in Parkinson's disease. Longitudinal data will confirm the extent to which these early neurocognitive changes, and their genetic factors, influence the long-term risk of dementia in Parkinson's disease. The combination of genetics and functional neuroimaging provides a potentially useful method for stratification and identification of candidate markers, in future clinical trials against cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease.",Remaining
1068,24828314,Disability and rehabilitation,Attending to biographical disruption: the experience of rehabilitation following tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury.,"To explore the experience of rehabilitation from the perspective of individuals with tetraplegia.	Semi-structured interviews of between 40 and 60 min were conducted with three men and one woman, with spinal injuries at C7 or higher, within 6 months of discharge from inpatient spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. Data were subject to an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).	Participants described their injuries as more than a biological impairment that limited certain functional abilities. For them, SCI was a sudden event that also disrupted one's 'life biography'. Interviews uncovered three key themes essential to an individual's ability to restore feelings of self-agency and biographical continuity: The importance of information, regaining control, and restoring a sense of personal narrative.	Findings from studies using IPA have much to contribute to discussion and debate at the level of rehabilitation theory and can guide future research directions. The findings of the present study support a growing body of literature that argues that rehabilitation research needs to focus more intensely on the biographical disruption caused by SCI. Implications for Rehabilitation Participants in the present study experienced a significant disruption to their biographical narratives following a SCI as they entered an unknown and uncertain world. The findings from the present study provide an evidence-base that is best applied to discussion regarding psychosocial adjustment at the level rehabilitation theory. The concepts of identity and biographical disruption are appearing more frequently in qualitative literature and both merit further investigation to assess their prevalence among the wider SCI populations.",Remaining

We designed a cohort study to construct prediction models for chronic kidney disease in the Chinese population.	A total of 5168 participants were followed up during a median of 2.2 (interquartile range, 1.5-2.9) years, and 190 individuals (3.7%) developed chronic kidney disease, defined by a glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).	We developed a point system to estimate chronic kidney disease risk at 4 years using the following variables: age (8 points), body mass index (2 points), diastolic blood pressure (2 points), and history of type 2 diabetes (1 point) and stroke (4 points) for the clinical model, with the addition of uric acid (2 points), postprandial glucose (1 point), hemoglobin A1c (1 point), and proteinuria 100 mg/dL or greater (6 points) for the biochemical model. Similar discrimination measures were found between the clinical model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.768; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.738-0.798) and the biochemical model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.765; 95% CI, 0.734-0.796). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the clinical model was 0.667 (95% CI, 0.631-0.703) for the external validation data from community-based cohort participants. The optimal cutoff value for the clinical model was set as 7, with a sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.66.	We constructed a clinical point-based model to predict the 4-year incidence of chronic kidney disease.

However, the specific contribution of the cerebellum to the DMN abnormalities remains unclear in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients. Forty-six unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients and 46 healthy controls were recruited for a resting-state scan. The images were analyzed using the functional connectivity (FC) method. The siblings showed significantly increased FCs between the left Crus I and the left superior medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), as well as between the lobule IX and the bilateral MPFC (orbital part) and right superior MPFC compared with the controls. No significantly decreased FC was observed in the siblings relative to the controls. The analyses were replicated in 49 first-episode, drug-naive patients with schizophrenia, and the results showed that the siblings and the patients shared increased FCs between the left Crus I and the left superior MPFC, as well as between the lobule IX and the left MPFC (orbital part) compared with the controls. These findings suggest that increased cerebellar-DMN connectivities emerge earlier than illness onset, which highlight the contribution of the cerebellum to the DMN alterations in unaffected siblings. The shared increased cerebellar-DMN connectivities between the patients and the siblings may be used as candidate endophenotypes for schizophrenia.",Remaining

Our aim was to perform an expanded extensive assessment of motor and nonmotor manifestations in PD to identify whether RBD was associated with differences in the nature and severity of these manifestations. PD patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) to diagnose the presence of RBD. Participants then underwent an extensive evaluation by a movement disorders specialist blinded to PSG results. Measures of disease severity, quantitative motor indices, motor subtypes, therapy complications, and autonomic, psychiatric, visual, and olfactory dysfunction were assessed and compared using regression analysis, adjusting for disease duration, age, and sex. Of 98 included patients, 54 had RBD and 44 did not. PD patients with RBD were older (P = 0.034) and were more likely to be male (P < 0.001). On regression analysis, the most consistent links between RBD and PD were a higher systolic blood pressure (BP) change while standing (-23.9 ± 13.9 versus -3.5 ± 10.9; P < 0.001), a higher orthostatic symptom score (0.89 ± 0.82 versus 0.44 ± 0.66; P = 0.003), and a higher frequency of freezing (43% versus 14%; P = 0.011). A systolic BP drop >10 could identify PD patients with RBD with 81% sensitivity and 86% specificity. In addition, there was a probable relationship between RBD and nontremor predominant subtype of PD (P = 0.04), increased frequency of falls (P = 0.009), and depression (P = 0.009). Our results support previous findings that RBD is a multifaceted phenomenon in PD.

We used information collected from 8752 families in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) on grandparent involvement when the study children were aged 8, 15 and 24 months; potential maternal and family predictors of grandparent care; and behavioural outcomes at age 4 years.	Forty-four percent of children were regularly cared for by grandparents at each age. Throughout the sample, key correlates of grandparent care were maternal age and education. In families without access to paid help with childcare, the child's ordinal position, maternal employment, the mother's recall of parenting by her own mother and the reasons for choosing the type of childcare were also associated with variations in grandparent care. Grandparent care was associated with some elevated rates of hyperactivity and peer difficulties at age 4, but these were largely attributable to variations in the types of families using grandparent care.	The popular belief that the extended family is no longer an important part of British life is not borne out by this study. Grandparents played a significant role in the care of their young grandchildren.

This study examined, in a convenience sample, the relationship between novelty-seeking behaviors, as determined by Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), and attendance variables during participation in a buprenorphine-based treatment program for 21 heroin-dependent cocaine users that took place in the late 1990s. Approximately two-thirds of the participants were male and primarily African-American. About half of them were employed and had at least a high school education. Approximately one-third of them were married or cohabitating and they all resided in the greater Detroit, Michigan area of the United States. The Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) was administered to the participants prior to entering the treatment program. Demographic variables, psychiatric distress, and substance use severity were also evaluated. Variables with significant bivariate relationships with poor attendance measures were entered into a regression analysis predicting attendance measures. Participants who scored high on the TPQ Novelty Seeking Scale attended significantly fewer regularly scheduled visits, had a greater overall number of missed visits, and shorter treatment retention times.

In this study, we examined performance on the IFS in subjects with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), an inherited condition leading to the early onset of SVD. We further explored associations between performance on the IFS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of SVD.	We recruited 24 asymptomatic CADASIL subjects and 23 noncarriers from Colombia. All subjects underwent a research MRI and a neuropsychological evaluation, including the IFS. Structural MRI markers of SVD were quantified in each subject, together with an SVD Sum Score representing the overall burden of cerebrovascular alterations. General linear model, correlation, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to explore group differences on the IFS and relationships with MRI markers of SVD.	CADASIL subjects had a significantly reduced performance on the IFS Total Score. Performance on the IFS correlated with all quantified markers of SVD, except for brain atrophy and perivascular spaces enlargement. Finally, while the IFS Total Score was not able to accurately discriminate between carriers and noncarriers, it showed adequate sensitivity and specificity in detecting the presence of multiple MRI markers of SVD.

The treatment results were evaluated by the ADHD Rating Scale-DSM-IV and The Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale - Parent Report (WFIRS-P). While the core symptoms of ADHD were according ADHD-DSM-IV diminished after 2 months, the improvement of WFIRS-P parameters required the longer duration of medical treatment. Only after 4 months of treatment, the improvement was achieved in selfesteem and social activities, and after 6 months in learning and behavior at school as well as in the level of life skills along with the decrease of risky activities. Thus, getting over psychosocial adaptation problems needs the longer treatment duration than the decrease of ADHD core symptoms.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
1085,1652390,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,'Atypical TIAs' may herald cardiac rather than cerebral events.,"Sixty-four patients with atypical transient cerebral or visual symptoms that could not be classified as unequivocal TIAs nor as migraine, epilepsy or neurosis, were followed up for a mean of 3.75 years (range 11 months and 9 years, 240 patient years). Their mean age was 55 years. Only two patients suffered a (non-disabling) stroke, but eight patients had a major cardiac event: fatal myocardial infarction in three, sudden death in one and non-fatal myocardial infarction in four patients. Seven of these eight patients were known to have cardiovascular risk factors. Visual symptoms were relatively benign with regard to cardiac events (2 events in 28 patients), whereas dizziness alone and focal sensory symptoms alone were more strongly associated with subsequent cardiac complications (2 out of 4, and 4 out of 13 patients, respectively). In a control group of 185 patients with 'typical' TIAs or minor strokes, followed for a total of 233 patient years, seven patients had a ischaemic stroke, and only one a cardiac event. Our results suggest that patients with atypical transient cerebral deficits and cardiovascular risk factors may carry a low risk of subsequent stroke, but a high risk of major cardiac events.",Remaining

In this study, we developed Bo-TSA-NP, a novel tanshinone IIA (TSA) loaded nanoparticles modified by borneol, which has long been proved with the ability to enhance other drugs' transport across the BBB. The Bo-TSA-NP, with a particle size of about 160 nm, drug loading of 3.6%, showed sustained release and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition property. It demonstrated a significantly higher uptake by 16HBE cells in vitro through the clathrin/caveolae-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis. Following intranasal (IN) administration, Bo-TSA-NP significantly improved the preventive effect on a rat model of CIRI with improved neurological scores, decreased cerebral infarction areas and a reduced content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rat brain. In conclusion, these results indicate that Bo-TSA-NP is a promising nose-to-brain delivery system that can enhance the prevention effect of TSA on CIRI.",Animal-drug-intervention

1088,2018095,American journal of medical genetics,Cognitive profiles of the carrier fragile X woman.,"Cognitive deficits in females with fragile X [fra(X)] syndrome have been reported, but studies have rarely focused on women with normal intelligence, nor have they separated fra(X)-negative carriers from fra(X)-positive carriers. Questions specifically addressed here are: 1) is the degree of fragility predictive of IQ? 2) are cognitive patterns consistent across fragility levels? and 3) do consistent individual profiles exist? These questions were addressed with the help of 74 heterozygous women, 38 of whom were fra(X)-negative carriers. All women completed the WAIS-R, and full-scale IQ was normally distributed (mean = 99.65). A strong inverse relationship between IQ and fragility levels was found. Also, the group of fra(X)-positive women had a significantly different subtest pattern from that of the fra(X)-negative women. However, when results were analyzed individually, no consistent patterns emerged. The cognitive performance of fra(X)-negative carriers has probably been underestimated due to the lack of differentiation between positive and negative carrier females in previous studies. These women appear to be cognitively unimpaired and should be considered separately from fra(X)-positive women. Since consistent WAIS-R patterns are not observable on an individual basis, their use as a diagnostic/predictive tool appears to be inappropriate.",Remaining

These applications involve treatment protocols with automated content delivery and relatively low clinical contact. Whilst such CBT applications are promising, however, further investigation is needed to establish the efficacy of this treatment approach for individuals with OCD. The aim of the present study was to review the efficacy of technology-delivered CBT with minimal clinician support for OCD using a meta-analytic approach.	Randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified through PsycINFO, Medline and Scopus resulting in 18 eligible studies (n = 1707). Control conditions comprised both passive (namely no treatment, other treatments and waitlist controls) and active. Measurement of OCD symptoms improvement was the outcome in each study.	Participants in the technology-delivered CBT group scored lower on Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) (g = - 0.59, 95% CI = [- 0.99, - 0.18], p = 0.01), Y-BOCS and Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS) combined (g = - 0.55, 95% CI = [- 0.87, - 0.24], p = 0.003) and Obsessive-Compulsive-Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) (g = - 0.36, 95% CI = [- 0.62, - 0.09], p = 0.02) at post-treatment than passive control groups. There were no significant findings when compared to controls with other treatments.	This meta-analysis suggests that technology-delivered CBT with low personal contact intensity, relative to passive control groups, is an efficacious and promising treatment option for individuals with OCD.

We sought to determine if CT use for pediatric head trauma has decreased among US emergency departments (EDs).	This was a cross-sectional analysis of the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Medical Survey database of nationally representative ED visits from 2007 to 2015. We included children <18 years of age evaluated in the ED for head injury. Survey weighting procedures were used to estimate the annual proportion of children who underwent CT neuroimaging and to perform multivariable logistic regression.	There were an estimated 14.3 million pediatric head trauma visits during the 9-year study period. Overall, 32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29%-35%) of children underwent CT neuroimaging with no significant annual linear trend (P trend = .50). Multivariate analysis similarly revealed no difference by year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.97-1.07) after adjustment for patient- and ED-level covariates. CT use was associated with age ≥2 years (aOR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.13-2.01), white race (aOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.10-1.86), highest triage acuity (aOR: 8.24 [95% CI: 4.00-16.95]; P < .001), and presentation to a nonteaching (aOR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.05-2.06) or nonpediatric (aOR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.05-2.23) hospital.

1093,27520275,Molecular neurobiology,Intranasal Delivery of a Caspase-1 Inhibitor in the Treatment of Global Cerebral Ischemia.,"Caspase-1 is an enzyme implicated in neuroinflammation, a critical component of many diseases that affect neuronal degeneration. However, it is unknown whether a caspase-1 inhibitor can modify apoptotic neuronal damage incurred during transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) and whether intranasal administration of a caspase-1 inhibitor is an effective treatment following GCI. The present study was conducted to examine the potential efficiency of post-ischemic intranasal administration of the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK in a 4-vessel occlusion model of GCI in the rat. Herein, we show that intranasal Boc-D-CMK readily penetrated the central nervous system, subsequently inhibiting caspase-1 activity, decreasing mitochondrial dysfunction, and attenuating caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway in ischemia-vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region. Further investigation regarding the mechanisms underlying Boc-D-CMK's neuroprotective effects revealed marked inhibition of reactive gliosis, as well as reduction of the neuroinflammatory response via inhibition of the downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal Boc-D-CMK post-treatment also significantly enhanced the numbers of NeuN-positive cells while simultaneously decreasing the numbers of TUNEL-positive and PARP1-positive cells in hippocampal CA1. Correspondingly, behavioral tests showed that deteriorations in spatial learning and memory performance, and long-term recognition memory following GCI were significantly improved in the Boc-D-CMK post-treated animals. In summary, the current study demonstrates that the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK coordinates anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions to attenuate neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region following GCI. Furthermore, our data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 is a promising neuroprotective strategy to target ischemic neuronal injury and functional deficits following transient GCI.",Animal-drug-intervention
1094,32514154,Scientific reports,A heritable profile of six miRNAs in autistic patients and mouse models.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of developmental pathologies that impair social communication and cause repetitive behaviors. The suggested roles of noncoding RNAs in pathology led us to perform a comparative analysis of the microRNAs expressed in the serum of human ASD patients. The analysis of a cohort of 45 children with ASD revealed that six microRNAs (miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-3613-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-499a-5p) were expressed at low to very low levels compared to those in healthy controls. A similar but less pronounced decrease was registered in the clinically unaffected parents of the sick children and in their siblings but never in any genetically unrelated control. Results consistent with these observations were obtained in the blood, hypothalamus and sperm of two of the established mouse models of ASD: valproic acid-treated animals and Cc2d1a[+/-] heterozygotes. In both instances, the same characteristic miRNA profile was evidenced in the affected individuals and inherited together with disease symptoms in the progeny of crosses with healthy animals. The consistent association of these genetic regulatory changes with the disease provides a starting point for evaluating the changes in the activity of the target genes and, thus, the underlying mechanism(s). From the applied societal and medical perspectives, once properly confirmed in large cohorts, these observations provide tools for the very early identification of affected children and progenitors.",Animal-other

We retrospectively identified 56 subjects who underwent antemortem MRI and had Lewy body (LB) pathology at autopsy. Subjects were pathologically classified as high (n = 25), intermediate (n = 22), and low likelihood DLB (n = 9) according to the Third Report of the DLB Consortium criteria. We included 2 additional pathologic comparison groups without LBs: one with low likelihood Alzheimer disease (AD) (control; n = 27) and one with high likelihood AD (n = 33). The associations between MRI-based volumetric measurements and the pathologic classification of DLB were tested with analysis of covariance by adjusting for age, sex, and MRI-to-death interval.	Antemortem hippocampal and amygdalar volumes increased from low to intermediate to high likelihood DLB (p < 0.001, trend test). Smaller hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were associated with higher Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage (p < 0.001). Antemortem dorsal mesopontine gray matter (GM) atrophy was found in those with high likelihood DLB compared with normal control subjects (p = 0.004) and those with AD (p = 0.01). Dorsal mesopontine GM volume decreased from low to intermediate to high likelihood DLB (p = 0.01, trend test).	Antemortem hippocampal and amygdalar volumes increase and dorsal mesopontine GM volumes decrease in patients with low to high likelihood DLB according to the Third Report of the DLB Consortium criteria.

The high frequency of obsessive-compulsive symptoms reported in subjects with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome) or Prader-Willi syndrome (15q11-13 deletion of the paternally derived chromosome), suggests that gene dosage effects in these chromosomal regions could increase risk for OCD.

We screened the 15q11-13 and 22q11.2 chromosomal regions for genomic imbalances in 236 patients with OCD using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).	No deletions or duplications involving 15q11-13 or 22q11.2 were identified in our patients.	Our results suggest that deletions/duplications of chromosomes 15q11-13 and 22q11.2 are rare in OCD. Despite the negative findings in these two regions, the search for copy number variants in OCD using genome-wide array-based methods is a highly promising approach to identify genes of etiologic importance in the development of OCD.",Remaining

1099,33139210,Current problems in pediatric and adolescent health care,Nocturnal events in children: When and how to evaluate.,"Nocturnal events of wide variety and concern are frequently reported by patients and their caregivers. To evaluate suspected abnormal events, primary care physicians must first be familiar with normal behaviors, movements and breathing patterns. Abnormal nocturnal events can then be categorized as nocturnal seizure, parasomnia, sleep-related movement disorder or sleep-related breathing disorder. Diagnoses in the above categories can be made clinically; however, it is important to know when to refer for additional evaluation. Comprehensive literature review was undertaken of nocturnal and sleep-related disorders. This guide reviews nocturnal seizures, normal and abnormal nonepileptic movements and behaviors, discusses broad indications for referral for electroencephalography (EEG) or polysomnography (PSG), and guides counseling and management for patients and their families, ultimately aiding in interpretation of both findings and prognosis. Epilepsy syndromes can result in seizures during sleep or adjacent periods of wakefulness. Parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders tend to also occur in childhood and may be distinguished clinically. Referral to additional specialists for specific studies including EEG or PSG can be necessary, while other times a knowledgeable and vigilant clinician can contribute to a prompt diagnosis based on clinical features. Nocturnal events often can be managed with parental reassurance and watchful waiting, but treatment or evaluation may be needed. Sleep-related breathing disorders are important to recognize as they present very differently in children than in adults and early intervention can be life-saving. This review should allow both primary and subspecialty non-neurologic pediatric and adolescent health care providers to better utilize EEG and PSG as part of a larger comprehensive clinical approach, distinguishing and managing both epileptic and nonepileptic nocturnal disorders of concern while fostering communication across providers to facilitate and coordinate better holistic long-term care of pediatric and adolescent patients.",Non-systematic-review

1102,26747211,Neurobiology of disease,"Ocular inflammation induces trigeminal pain, peripheral and central neuroinflammatory mechanisms.","Ocular surface diseases are among the most frequent ocular pathologies, with prevalence ranging from 20% of the general population. In addition, ocular pain following corneal injury is frequently observed in clinic. The aim of the study was to characterize the peripheral and central neuroinflammatory process in the trigeminal pathways in response to cornea alteration induced by chronic topical instillations of 0.2% benzalkonium chloride (BAC) in male C57BL/6J mice. In vitro BAC induced neurotoxicity and increases neuronal (FOS, ATF3) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6) markers in primary mouse trigeminal ganglion culture. BAC-treated mice exhibited 7days after the treatment reduced aqueous tear production and increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the cornea. Hypertonic saline-evoked eye wipe behavior was enhanced in BAC-treated animals that exhibited increased FOS, ATF3 and Iba1 immunoreactivity in the trigeminal ganglion. Ocular inflammation is associated with a significant increase in IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA expression in the trigeminal ganglion. We reported a strong increase in FOS and Iba1 positive cells in particular in the sensory trigeminal complex at the ipsilateral interpolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) transition and Vc/upper cervical cord (Vc/C1) regions. In addition, activated microglial cells were tightly wrapped around activated FOS neurons in both regions and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was markedly enhanced specifically in microglial cells during ocular inflammation. Similar data were obtained in the facial motor nucleus. These neuroanatomical data correlated with the increase in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2) and neuronal (FOS and ATF3) markers. Interestingly, the suppression of corneal inflammation 10days following the end of BAC treatment resulted in a marked attenuation of peripheral and central changes observed in pathological conditions. This study provides the first demonstration that corneal inflammation induces activation of neurons and microglial p38 MAPK pathway within sensory trigeminal complex. These results suggest that this altered activity in intracellular signaling caused by ocular inflammation might play a priming role in the central sensitization of ocular related brainstem circuits, which represents a significant factor in ocular pain development.",Animal-other

The effect of the triglyceride form of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (TG-DHA) was assayed in vitro and in vivo to assess the protective and anti-inflammatory activity of this compound. In the in vitro study, BV-2 microglia cells were previously treated with TG-DHA and then activated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). TG-DHA treatment protected BV-2 microglia cells from oxidative stress toxicity attenuating NO production and suppressing the induction of inflammatory cytokines. When compared with DHA in the ethyl-ester form, a significant difference in the ability to inhibit NO production in favor of TG-DHA was observed. TG-DHA inhibited significantly splenocyte proliferation but isolated CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation was unaffected. In a mice model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 250 mg/kg/day oral TG-DHA treatment was associated with a significant amelioration of the course and severity of the disease as compared to untreated animals. TG-DHA-treated EAE mice showed a better weight profile, which is a symptom related to a better course of encephalomyelitis.

1104,9292187,Brain and cognition,The decoding of emotional concepts in patients with focal cerebral lesions.,"The effects of focal brain lesions on the decoding of emotional concepts in facial expressions were investigated. Facial emotions are hierarchically organized patterns comprising (1) structural surface features, (2) discrete (primary) emotional categories and (3) secondary dimensions, such as valence and arousal. Categorical decoding was measured using (1) selection of category labels and selection of the named emotion category; (2) matching one facial expression with two choice expressions. Dimensional decoding was assessed by matching one face with two different expressions with regard to valence or arousal. 70 patients with well documented cerebral lesions and 15 matched hospital controls participated in the study. 27 had left brain damage (LBD; 10 frontal, 10 temporal, 7 parietal); 37 had right brain damage (RBD; 15 frontal, 11 temporal, 11 parietal). Six additional patients had lesions involving both frontal lobes. Right temporal and parietal lesioned patients were markedly impaired in the decoding of primary emotions. The same patients also showed a reduced arousal decoding. In contrast to several patients with frontal and left hemisphere lesions, emotional conceptualization and face discrimination was not independent in these groups. No group differences were observed in valence decoding. However, right frontal lesions appeared to interfere with the discrimination of negative valence. Moreover, a distraction by structural features was noted in RBD when facial identities were varied across stimulus and response pictures in matching tasks with differing conceptual load. Our results suggest that focal brain lesions differentially affect the comprehension of emotional meaning in faces depending on the level of conceptual load and interference of structural surface features.",Remaining

Higher throughput techniques to monitorCBFchanges in rodent models ofHIEcan help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology. We developed a laser speckle imaging (LSI) technique to continuously monitorCBFin six postnatal-day 10 (P10) rats simultaneously before, during, and after unilateral hypoxia-ischemia (HI, ligation of the left carotid artery followed by hypoxia in 8% oxygen). After ligation,CBFto the ligated side fell by 30% compared to the unligated side (P < 0.0001). Hypoxia induced a bilateral 55% reduction inCBF, which was partially restored by resuscitation. Compared to resuscitation in air, resuscitation in 100% oxygen increasedCBFto the ligated side by 45% (P = 0.033). Individual variability inCBFresponse to hypoxia between animals accounted for up to 24% of the variability in hemispheric area loss to the ligated side. In both P10 and P7 models of unilateralHI, resuscitation in 100% oxygen did not affect hemispheric area loss, or hippocampalCA1 pyramidal neuron counts, after 1-week survival.

The purpose of the present study was to ascertain whether sera from patients with MMN can open the BNB, and which component of patient sera is the most important for this disruption.	We evaluated the effects of sera from patients with MMN, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and control subjects on the expression of tight junction proteins and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and on the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) in human peripheral nerve microvascular endothelial cells (PnMECs).	The sera from patients with MMN decreased the claudin-5 protein expression and the TEER in PnMECs. However, this effect was reversed after application of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) neutralising antibody. The VEGF secreted by PnMECs was significantly increased after exposure to the sera from patients with MMN. The sera from patients with MMN also increased the VCAM-1 protein expression by upregulating the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signalling. The immunoglobulin G purified from MMN sera decreased the expression of claudin-5 and increased the VCAM-1 expression in PnMECs.	The sera from MMN patients may disrupt the BNB function via the autocrine secretion of VEGF in PnMECs, or the exposure to autoantibodies against PnMECs that are contained in the MMN sera. Autoantibodies against PnMECs in MMN sera may activate the BNB by upregulating the VCAM-1 expression, thereby allowing for the entry of a large number of circulating inflammatory cells into the peripheral nervous system.",In-vitro-study

Remission was comparatively rapid with 70% of subjects remitting within 6 months. Only 6% failed to do so by 15 months. However, 40% relapsed over the subsequent 15 months, with all the relapses occurring in the first 10 months. Greater severity of the depression and longer duration of the illness predicted a longer time to remission. Greater initial severity of depression also predicted relapse. Subjects with a worse outcome had not received less adequate treatment than the remainder. Our results confirm the comparatively poor outcome subsequent to remission that has been reported in recent literature, in spite of the availability of modern methods of treatment. The clustering of relapses in the first 10 months gives some support to the distinction between relapse and later recurrence.",Remaining

She was prescribed with three antidepressants (paroxetine, duloxetine, and mirtazapine), which were not effective in relieving her symptoms. She was also prescribed bromazepam, which was also not effective. Subsequently, she was switched to lamotrigine, which resulted in a marked improvement in symptoms. The antidepressants and bromazepam were gradually tapered and discontinued.

1112,23095594,L'Encephale,"[Acute catatonia: Questions, diagnosis and prognostics, and the place of atypical antipsychotics].","Acute catatonia is a non-specific, relatively frequent syndrome, which manifests itself through characteristic motor signs that enables its diagnosis. It occurs in association with mood disorders, psychotic disorders and several somatic or toxic diseases. Its short-term prognosis is of paramount importance. Without effective treatment, it is associated with high mortality. Despite the vital risk inherent in this disorder, it is not recognized as an independent diagnostic category by international rankings, which makes its diagnostic detection difficult and consequently does not allow adequate therapeutic care. However, if benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy have proved effective in the treatment of acute catatonia, the role of atypical antipsychotics remains controversial. In fact, despite the progress made by the DSM-IV-TR and CIM 10 by the recognition of the etiologic diversity of catatonia, we deplore the absence to date of a consensus on clinical management and therapy of catatonia, which constitutes a source of confusion for practitioners in their approach to catatonic patients. To illustrate the difficulty in supporting these patients, we report here a clinical vignette.	Mr. M. aged 21, without psychiatric history, has shown a functional acute psychotic episode involving a delirious and hallucinatory syndrome associated with a marked catatonic dimension. Olanzapine was initiated at a dose of 10mg/d on the nineth day of hospitalization; the clinical picture was complicated by a malignant catatonia justifying the halt of olanzapine and the institution, in intensive units, of 15mg per day of lorazepam. After 72hours, the patient has not responded to this treatment. ECT was expected, but the patient died on the 12th day.	This case raises a threefold question: the crucial issue of immediate vital prognosis, that of the truthfulness of the positive diagnosis of this psychotic table and finally the issue of therapeutic care, primarily the well-founded or otherwise use of an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of this type of psychotic disorder. For Mr. M., the clinical diagnosis that he has shown, according to the DSM IV-TR, is brief psychotic disorder 'temporary diagnosis'. This diagnosis - brief psychotic disorder - does not actually allow for a specific clinical approach to this type of psychotic table. The immediate vital prognosis inherent in the catatonic dimension may not be properly evaluated and the therapeutic conduct may miss the application of the specific treatment of the catatonic syndrome. The proper diagnosis for this type of psychotic disorder would be 'catatonia' as proposed by Taylor and Fink, instead of 'brief psychotic disorder' if the international rankings have included this disorder as a separate and independent diagnosis. The identification by international rankings of the catatonic syndrome as an independent diagnostic category seems essential for clinicians to allow: its clinical detection, the establishment of a syndromic diagnosis of catatonic disorder, appropriate prognostic evaluation and finally, the application of a suitable therapeutic strategy. Conventional treatment, benzodiazepine- and/or ECT-based, can solve the catatonic episode in a few days, irrespective of its etiology and its severity. Moreover, while all authors agree that conventional antipsychotics may induce a catatonic state or worsen a preexisting catatonia into a malignant catatonia and should thus be avoided for catatonic patients or with prior catatonic episodes, recent data from the literature emphasize the frequent and successful use of atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, in various clinical forms of benign catatonia. However, our patient did not respond to treatment with olanzapine and got even more complicated. Was the malignant catatonia that this patient has shown induced by olanzapine ? The answer to this question seems difficult since some authors report the efficacy of olanzapine in malignant catatonia. We wonder if we should have kept olanzapine and strengthen its dosage like Cassidy et al. in 2001 and Suzuki et al. in 2010 for the treatment of the malignant form constituted in this patient rather than having stopped it and used lorazepam as indicated by Taylor and Fink in 2003.	The non-recognition of catatonia as an independent entity, the lack of a therapeutic consensus and the pending issue on the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of catatonia are at the origin of the difficulties of therapeutic support of catatonic patients.",Non-systematic-review

Their ictal perfusion patterns were analyzed in relation to temporal and frontal hyperperfusion during TLE seizures using SPECT subtraction.	Thirty-three TLE patients had interictal and ictal SPECT, video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, and volumetric MRI. SPECT subtraction with MRI coregistration was performed using commercial software. The presence of ictal hyperperfusion was determined in the ipsilateral and contralateral temporal lobe, frontal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia.	All patients showed ictal hyperperfusion in the temporal lobe of seizure origin. Vermian cerebellar hyperperfusion (CH) was observed in 26 patients (78.8%) and hemispheric CH was found in 25 (75.8%). Compared with the side of the epileptogenic temporal lobe, there were 7 patients with ipsilateral hemispheric CH (28.0%), 15 with contralateral hemispheric CH (60.0%), and 3 with bilateral hemispheric CH (12.0%). CH was observed more frequently in patients with additional frontal hyperperfusion (14/15, 93.3%; 2 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 10 contralateral, and 2 bilateral) than in patients without frontal hyperperfusion (11/18, 61.1%). Among 18 patients with temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion, 11 patients showed hemispheric CH (5 ipsilateral to seizure focus, 5 contralateral, 1 bilateral). Hyperperfusion in the basal ganglia (BGH) was seen in 11 of the 15 patients with temporal and frontal hyperperfusion (73.3%) and in 11 of the 18 with only temporal hyperperfusion (61.1%). In 17 patients with unilateral BGH (13 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 4 contralateral), CH contralateral to the BGH was observed in 14 (82.5%), CH ipsilateral to the BGH was found in 2 (11.8%), and CH bilateral to the BGH was found in 1 (5.9%).	During TLE seizures, hemispheric CH occurred not only in contralateral but also in ipsilateral or bilateral cerebellar hemispheres to the side of seizure origin. Although temporal lobe origin seizures associated with additional frontal hyperperfusion produced more frequent hemispheric CH, seizures showing only temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion could produce BGH and CH. To determine the side of hemispheric CH, the most important factor appears to be the side of BGH, not the side of seizure origin.",Remaining

Treatment-induced pericystic inflammation and its association with blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, as determined by Evans blue (EB) extravasation, was studied in infected untreated and anthelmintic-treated pigs. We compared the magnitude and extent of the pericystic inflammation, presence of EB-stained capsules, the level of damage to the parasite, expression of genes for proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue remodeling by quantitative PCR assays between treated and untreated infected pigs and between EB-stained (blue) and non stained (clear) cysts. Inflammatory scores were higher in pericystic tissues from EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts from untreated pigs and also from anthelmintic-treated pigs 48 hr and 120 hr after treatment. The degree of inflammation correlated with the severity of cyst wall damage and both increased significantly at 120 hours. Expression levels of the proinflammatory genes for IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α were higher in EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts and unaffected brain tissues, and were generally highest at 120 hr. Additionally, expression of some markers of immunoregulatory activity (IL-10, IL-2Rα) were decreased in EB-stained capsules. An increase in other markers for regulatory T cells (CTLA4, FoxP3) was found, as well as significant increases in expression of two metalloproteases, MMP1 and MMP2 at 48 hr and 120 hr post-treatment. We conclude that the increase in severity of the inflammation caused by treatment is accompanied by both a proinflammatory and a complex regulatory response, largely limited to pericystic tissues with compromised vascular integrity. Because treatment induced inflammation occurs in porcine NCC similar to that in human cases, this model can be used to investigate mechanisms involved in host damaging inflammatory responses and agents or modalities that may control damaging post treatment inflammation.",Animal-other
1116,19544314,Depression and anxiety,Comorbid anxiety as a suicide risk factor among depressed veterans.,"Depressive disorders greatly increase suicide risk; however, little is known about the contribution of comorbid anxiety disorders or anxiety symptoms to the risk of suicide death among depressed patients. We examined whether depressed veterans with comorbid anxiety had higher risks of suicide death.	Using VA administrative databases we identified 887,859 patients with depression. We then used univariate and multivariate logistic regression, controlling for demographics and substance use disorders, to determine the odds ratios of completed suicide associated with individual comorbid anxiety disorders, the presence of any comorbid anxiety disorder, the prescription of an antianxiety medication, or the prescription of a high dose of an antianxiety medication.	In multivariate analyses, the odds of completed suicide were significantly increased for patients with panic disorder (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.53), generalized anxiety disorder (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.47), and anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified (OR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12-1.38). The odds of completed suicide were also greater among patients who received any antianxiety medication (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.55-1.88), and were further increased among those who received high dose treatment (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.98-2.57). Odds of completed suicide were decreased among patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.97), and there was no statistically significant relationship between social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and all other anxiety disorders and suicide.	These findings emphasize the importance of comorbid anxiety disorders and symptoms in increasing suicide risk among depressed patients and may inform suicide prevention efforts among these patients.",Remaining

DHEA is a neuroactive corticosteroid hormone synthesized both in the adrenal cortex and in the brain. Its antioxidant properties are well known. As oxidative stress seems to play a major role in epileptogenesis in the iron-induced model of posttraumatic epilepsy, it was of interest to examine whether DHEA would exert antiepileptic activity. DHEA at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day administered intraperitoneally for 7, 14, and 21 days to iron-induced epileptic rats prevented epileptiform electrophysiological activity. Morris water maze and open-field tests on iron-induced epileptic rats revealed that DHEA also prevented behavioral alterations related to epileptiform activity. Thus, DHEA attenuated the cognitive defects produced by epileptic activity. Moreover, alterations in epileptogenesis-related biochemical parameters-lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase (sodium pump) activity--were also countered by DHEA.",Animal-drug-intervention

One male patient died of suicide (1.1%) and 18 (19.6%) individuals repeated parasuicide using self-poisoning. The rate of repeated parasuicidal behaviour in this investigation was considerably higher than that reported in comparable studies from developing countries but similar to that from a number of western European cities. The data indicated that the probability of further episodes of parasuicidal behaviour increased in the few months after the index episode. Although the repeaters and non-repeaters were essentially similar in most of their sociodemographic characteristics, the former were a distinctive group in many respects. The factors found to be significantly associated with subsequent parasuicide included self-poisoning by prescribed drugs at the index parasuicide, previous parasuicidal behaviour prior to the index, occupational status of a housewife, past history of depression and/or dependence and precipitating life events in the family environment. Contrary to our hypothesized theory, none of the types of attitudes received by the patients from their family members at the index parasuicide related to outcome. The global level of social readjustment of non-repeaters was about three times higher than that of repeaters of parasuicide. The implications of these findings for future policy making were discussed with respect to prevention of parasuicide.",Remaining

Behavior was analyzed using both the EthoVision behavior tracking system and by blind scoring of videotapes of social behaviors. Compared to controls, rats treated with PPA displayed social behavior impairments as indicated by significantly greater mean distance apart, reduced time spent in close proximity, reduced playful interaction, and altered responses to playful initiations. Treatment with another short chain fatty acid, sodium acetate, produced similar impairments, but treatment with the alcohol analog of PPA, 1-propanol, did not produce impairments. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue taken from rats treated with PPA revealed reactive astrogliosis, indicating a neuroinflammatory response.

Recently, several genetic variants of its key components, which may be clinically relevant and thus prove to be useful in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, have been described. We therefore investigated the association between ACE I/D, AGT M235T, and AT1 A1266C gene polymorphisms and early signs of target organ damage in 215 untreated patients with essential hypertension (EH).	Genotyping was based on the polymerase chain reaction technique, with further restriction analysis when required. Albuminuria was measured as the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed by echocardiography (LVH = LVMI > or = 125 g/m2), carotid wall thickness (IMT) by an ultrasonographic (US) scan, and retinal vascular changes by direct ophthalmoscopy (Keith-Wagener classification).	The prevalence of microalbuminuria (Mi), LVH, and retinal vascular changes was 14, 46, and 74%, respectively. ACE, AGT, and AT1 genotype distribution was in agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no difference in age, duration of disease, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipid profile when data were analyzed on the basis of genotype. Serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were related to the ACE genotype (10.2 +/- 0.5, DD; 8.2 +/- 0.3, ID; 6.5 +/- 0.4 IU/mL, II; P < 0. 0001 by analysis of variance). The ACE genotype independently influences serum ACE levels and accounts for approximately 14% of its variations (F = 26.7, r2 = 0.1393, df 1 to 214, P < 0.0001). Patients with DD and ID genotypes showed higher levels of ACR (1.59 +/- 0.2, DD + ID; 0.8 +/- 0.2 mg/mmol, II; P < 0.006 by ANOVA) and bigger LVMI (124.1 +/- 2.3, DD + ID vs. 117.8 +/- 3.6 g/m2, II; P < 0.01 by ANOVA). No differences in the prevalence and degree of target organ damage (TOD) were found when data were analyzed on the basis of the AGT and AT1 genotypes, respectively. Potentially unfavorable combinations of genotypes were also investigated by K-means cluster analysis.

A national survey of Physician Health Programs.,"Physicians with substance use disorders receive care that is qualitatively different from and reputedly more effective than that offered to the general population, yet there has been no national study of this distinctive approach. To learn more about the national system of Physician Health Programs (PHPs) that manage the care of addicted physicians, we surveyed all 49 state PHP medical directors (86% responded) to characterize their treatment, support, and monitoring regimens.	PHPs do not provide substance abuse treatment. Under authority from state licensing boards, state laws, and contractual agreements, they promote early detection, assessment, evaluation, and referral to abstinence-oriented (usually) residential treatment for 60 to 90 days. This is followed by 12-step-oriented outpatient treatment. Physicians then receive randomly scheduled urine monitoring, with status reports issued to employers, insurers, and state licensing boards for (usually) 5 or more years. Outcomes are very positive, with only 22% of physicians testing positive at any time during the 5 years and 71% still licensed and employed at the 5-year point.	Addicted physicians receive an intensity, duration, and quality of care that is rarely available in most standard addiction treatments: (a) intensive and prolonged residential and outpatient treatment, (b) 5 years of extended support and monitoring with significant consequences, and (c) involvement of family, colleagues, and employers in support and monitoring. Although not available to the general public now, several aspects of this continuing care model could be adapted and used for the general population.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
1129,30931632,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,Systematic review of the prognostic role of body mass index in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Studies have suggested that obesity is associated with better prognosis among individuals with various types of neurodegenerative diseases, and while some studies suggest that the same is true of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), other works cast doubt on this conclusion. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the role of body mass index in the prognosis of ALS. PubMed was systematically searched to identify eligible articles, and data on long-term survival were meta-analyzed in terms of hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Level of heterogeneity among studies and publication bias were estimated. A total of 17 studies with 9991 ALS patients were included in the review. Each increase of 1 kg/m[2] in body mass index was associated with significantly better long-term overall survival (HR 0.95, 95%CI 0.93-0.97; p < 0.001). Obesity may also be a strong predictor of favorable long-term prognosis (HR 0.73; 95%CI 0.62-0.86; p < 0.001). Our results suggest that higher body mass index and obesity are associated with better long-term survival of ALS patients.",Human-systematic-review
1130,33076949,Molecular brain,Brain transcriptome analysis reveals subtle effects on mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis of mutations in the SORL1 gene implicated in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease.,"To prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we must understand its molecular basis. The great majority of AD cases arise sporadically with a late onset after 65 years of age (LOAD). However, rare familial cases of AD can occur due to dominant mutations in a small number of genes that cause an early onset prior to 65 years of age (EOfAD). As EOfAD and LOAD share similar pathologies and disease progression, analysis of EOfAD genetic models may give insight into both subtypes of AD. Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) is genetically associated with both EOfAD and LOAD and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between both forms of AD. Currently, the role of SORL1 mutations in AD pathogenesis is unclear. To understand the molecular consequences of SORL1 mutation, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the orthologous gene in zebrafish. We generated an EOfAD-like mutation, V1482Afs, and a putatively null mutation, to investigate whether EOfAD-like mutations in sorl1 display haploinsufficiency by acting through loss-of-function mechanisms. We performed mRNA-sequencing on whole brains, comparing wild type fish with their siblings heterozygous for EOfAD-like or putatively loss-of-function mutations in sorl1, or transheterozygous for these mutations. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small number of differentially expressed genes due to the sorl1 genotypes. We also performed enrichment analysis on all detectable genes to obtain a more complete view on changes to gene expression by performing three methods of gene set enrichment analysis, then calculated an overall significance value using the harmonic mean p-value. This identified subtle effects on expression of genes involved in energy production, mRNA translation and mTORC1 signalling in both the EOfAD-like and null mutant brains, implying that these effects are due to sorl1 haploinsufficiency. Surprisingly, we also observed changes to expression of genes occurring only in the EOfAD-mutation carrier brains, suggesting gain-of-function effects. Transheterozygosity for the EOfAD-like and null mutations (i.e. lacking wild type sorl1), caused apparent effects on iron homeostasis and other transcriptome changes distinct from the single-mutation heterozygous fish. Our results provide insight into the possible early brain molecular effects of an EOfAD mutation in human SORL1. Differential effects of heterozygosity and complete loss of normal SORL1 expression are revealed.",Remaining

Participants with major depressive disorder (N = 2875) at primary and specialty care sites who received the first step treatment with citalopram in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression study were included. Patients were enrolled between July 2001 and April 2004. Melancholic features were ascribed by previously developed algorithms of telephone interview ratings prior to treatment. Demographics, clinical features, and treatment response were compared between those with and without melancholic features.	The 23.5% of participants with melancholic features were characterized by higher severity scores, greater rates of previous suicide attempts and ratings of current suicidal risk, and more concurrent psychiatric comorbidity. Unadjusted remission rates for those with melancholic features were statistically significantly reduced in absolute terms by up to 8.4% compared to those without melancholic features, which is a 24.1% decrease in relative chance of remission (p < .0001). Following adjustments for between-group baseline differences, remission rates were no longer different.	Melancholic features are associated with a significantly reduced remission rate with an SSRI. This effect appears to be accounted for by demographic and clinical features associated with melancholic features.	clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT0021528.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
1132,23909246,Journal of neurosurgery,"Transsylvian hippocampal transection for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: surgical indications, procedure, and postoperative seizure and memory outcomes.","Amygdalohippocampectomy is a well-established, standard surgery for medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). However, in the case of MTLE without hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, amygdalohippocampectomy is associated with decreased postoperative memory function. Hippocampal transection (HT) has been developed to overcome this problem. In HT the hippocampus is not removed; rather, the longitudinal hippocampal circuits of epileptic activities are disrupted by transection of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus. The present study describes a less invasive modification of HT (transsylvian HT) and presents the seizure and memory outcomes for this procedure.	Thirty-seven patients with MTLE (18 men and 19 women; age range 9-63 years; 19 with surgery on the right side and 18 with surgery on the left side; seizure onset from 3 to 34 years) who were treated with transsylvian HT were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had left-side language dominance, and follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 94 months (median 49 months). Seizure outcomes were evaluated for all patients by using the Engel classification. Memory function was evaluated for 22 patients based on 3 indices (verbal memory, nonverbal memory, and delayed recall), with those scores obtained using the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Patients underwent evaluation of the memory function before and after surgery (6 months-1 year).	Engel Class I (completely seizure free) was achieved in 25 patients (67.6%). Class II and Class III designation was achieved in 10 (27%) and 2 patients (5.4%), respectively. There were differences in memory outcome between the sides of operation. On the right side, verbal memory significantly increased postoperatively (p = 0.003) but nonverbal memory and delayed recall showed no significant change after the operation (p = 0.718 and p = 0.210, respectively). On the left side, all 3 indices (verbal memory, nonverbal memory, and delayed recall) showed no significant change (p = 0.331, p = 0.458, and p = 0.366, respectively).	Favorable seizure outcome and preservation of verbal memory were achieved with transsylvian HT for the treatment of MTLE without hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Recent studies have demonstrated that several antagonists of NMDA receptors have important cardiovascular effects. In this study, we examined whether the cardiovascular effects of ACPC involve the role of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its antioxidant effect in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Male SHRSP were divided into two groups: a control group and an ACPC group administered ACPC at 50 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks by peritoneal injection. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mortality of stroke were significantly lower in the ACPC group than in the control group. Urinary Na(+) and Cl(-) excretion and plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were increased in the ACPC group. Western analysis detected proteins that were immunoreactive to anti-nitrotyrosine antibody and showed lower levels of expression in the cerebral cortex compared to that in the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was reduced in the ACPC group. Quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that administration of ACPC also significantly decreased the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA in the hippocampus and endotherial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA in the cerebral cortex, and drastically increased HO-1 mRNA in the cerebral cortex. Enhanced HO-1 staining on sections from the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was observed in the ACPC group. These data suggest that the normalization by ACPC of blood pressure elevation and mortality of stroke involves induction of the expression of HO-1, which exerts antioxidant and vascular relaxation effects, in SHRSP.",Animal-drug-intervention

The present study aimed to examine 1) whether DAX-1 is expressed in human pituitary adenomas, and 2) if it is expressed, what types of adenoma express the factor.	Adenoma tissues examined included 18 clinically non-functioning adenomas, 14 GH-secreting adenomas and 7 PRL-secreting adenomas. The expression of the following genes were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): DAX-1, Adrenal-4-binding protein/steroidogenic factor-1 (Ad4BP/SF-1), Pit-1, LH beta, FSH beta, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R), GH, PRL, and TSH beta, as well as beta-actin as a control.	Eleven clinically non-functioning adenomas expressed DAX-1, 10 of which also expressed Ad4BP/SF-1. Nine out of the 11 DAX-1 expressing adenomas also expressed LH beta, FSH beta and GnRH-R as well, indicating that these adenomas possessed gonadotrophic properties. Nine clinically non-functioning adenomas expressed Pit-1 as well as GH, PRL and/or TSH beta, thus having somatomammotrophic or thyrotrophic properties, 3 of which overlapped with the above DAX-1-expressing adenomas. One non-functioning adenoma expressed Ad4BP/SF1 and FSH beta but not DAX-1, and another one expressed DAX-1 and Ad4BP/SF-1 with PRL. On the other hand, all GH-secreting and PRL-secreting adenomas expressed Pit-1 and GH and/or PRL, but neither DAX-1 nor Ad4BP/SF-1.	The results shown here indicate that DAX-1 is expressed in the majority of human pituitary adenomas of gonadotrophic origin in parallel with Adrenal-4-binding protein/steroidogenic factor-1.",Remaining

The complex intermittent multisensory rehabilitation consisted of currently used major therapeutic procedures targeted at the improvement of cognitive functions; including multisensory and motor stimulation and enriched environment. We have confirmed this positive effect of early multisensory rehabilitation on the recovery of motor functions after traumatic brain injury. However, we have been able to prove a positive effect on the recovery of cognitive functions only with respect to the frequency of efficient search strategies in a Barnes maze test, while results for search time and travelled distance were not significantly different between study groups. We have concluded that the positive effects of an early treatment of functional deficits are comparable with the clinical results in early neurorehabilitation in human patients after brain trauma.

Social prescribing programmes are being widely promoted within the United Kingdom (UK) and United States as non-pharmaceutical interventions for those living with addiction and substance misuse needs. These needs have been exasperated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis, with emerging research indicating short-term and long-term detrimental effects on physical and mental health due to substance misuse and addictions. Psychosocial interventions utilize psychological or social factors rather than an overreliance on biological interventions to treat the health impacts of mental illnesses such as addictions and substance use disorder.

Purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamics of T2* changes in ischemic tissue.	We investigated earliest temporo-spatial dynamics within ischemic tissue, measured with quantitative T2* imaging in the histologically defined infarct core and surrounding surviving tissue. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced by a filament model in mice. Serial multiple gradient-echo T2* sequences and diffusion-weighted images were acquired for 60min after MCAO and repeated for 60min after recanalization. T2* maps were co-registered with histology and T2* changes were compared to the contralateral hemisphere.	Within the histologically defined infarct core, relative T2* values decreased significantly by -10.8±2.8% (P=0.003) compared to the contralateral hemisphere within 3.5±0.7min after MCAO. Relative T2* values in volume exceeding the histologically determined infarct core were significantly less decreased (-6.7±2.1%; P=0.02) and increased after recanalization (+3.9±1.9%; P=0.045). Volume with T2* decrease showed continuous growth over 60min after MCAO (P=0.002) and decreased during 60min after recanalization (P=0.026), showing most significant correlations between infarct core volume and T2* abnormality volume (r=0.66; P=0.037) of the last image acquired after recanalization.	To our best knowledge, this is the first application of non-invasive quantitative T2* measurements to assess changes in levels of deoxyhemoglobin as an indirect biomarker for metabolic impairment in ischemic tissue.

Amplification of chromosome 12q13-q15 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) amplicon) is frequently observed in numerous human cancers including GBM. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE) is a group of GTP-binding proteins that belong to the subgroup of centaurin GTPase family, encoded by CENTG1 located in CDK4 amplicon. However, the pathological significance of CDK4 amplicon in GBM formation remains incompletely understood. In the current study, we show that co-expression of PIKE-A and CDK4 in TP53/PTEN double knockout GBM mouse model additively shortens the latency of glioma onset and survival compared to overexpression of these genes alone. Consequently, p-mTOR, p-Akt and p-ERK pathways are highly upregulated in the brain tumors, in alignment with their oncogenic activities by CDK4 and PIKE-A stably transfected in GBM cell lines. Hence, our findings support that PIKE amplification or overexpression coordinately acts with CDK4 to drive GBM tumorigenesis.",Animal-other

Some associations, although sporadic, can be particularly challenging both in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management and in terms of theoretical perspective. Here, we report a child affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). The child was diagnosed with classical T1DM at 15 months of age, with a tendency toward hypoglycemia. A few months later, during an acute intercurrent infective episode, the child displayed acute hypotonia of the lower limbs and limbs dystonia. A brain MRI showed bilateral striatal necrosis, suggesting GA1 diagnosis. Treatment with a low-lysine dietary regimen and carnitine supplementation was started and resulted in an improvement in metabolic control and a reduction of hypoglycemic episodes along with an increasing in insulin daily dose. After 2 years, the neurological outcome consisted of a reduction in dystonic movements and a metabolic stability of both diseases.	This case provides some insight into the reciprocal interconnections between the two metabolic disorders. Similar pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the neuronal injury might have impacted each other, and a strict relationship between a specific aspect of GA1-impaired metabolism and glucose homeostasis might explain how the tailored management of GA1 was not only effective in controlling the disease, but it also resulted in an improvement in the control of the glycemic profile. What in known: • Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) usually presents in childhood with severe and possibly irreversible neuronal damage, triggered by a catabolic stress • The association of GA1 with other diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), is a rare event, complicating the treatment management What is new: • Insulin treatment has a role in preventing GA1 metabolic decompensation, even in the catabolic condition of hypoglycemia • Promoting GA1 metabolic equilibrium by tailoring drug and dietary treatment in our patient affect by T1DM has a positive impact also in improving glycemic balance.",Human-case-report

Loss-of-function mutations in GEMIN5 lead to a neurodevelopmental syndrome among patients presenting with developmental delay, motor dysfunction, and cerebellar atrophy by perturbing SMN complex protein expression and assembly. Currently, molecular determinants of GEMIN5-mediated disease have yet to be explored. Here, we identified SMN as a genetic suppressor of GEMIN5-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo. We discovered that an increase in SMN expression by either SMN gene therapy replacement or the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), Nusinersen, significantly upregulated the endogenous levels of GEMIN5 in mammalian cells and mutant GEMIN5-derived iPSC neurons. Further, we identified a strong functional association between the expression patterns of SMN and GEMIN5 in patient Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)-derived motor neurons harboring loss-of-function mutations in the SMN gene. Interestingly, SMN binds to the C-terminus of GEMIN5 and requires the Tudor domain for GEMIN5 binding and expression regulation. Finally, we show that SMN upregulation ameliorates defective snRNP biogenesis and alternative splicing defects caused by loss of GEMIN5 in iPSC neurons and in vivo. Collectively, these studies indicate that SMN acts as a regulator of GEMIN5 expression and neuropathologies.",Remaining

Prospective study.	This study was hospital-based and included 62 inpatients with stroke.	The primary outcome was swallowing ability at discharge. The swallowing ability was assessed using the Food Intake Level Scale (FILS). The FILS change was calculated by subtracting FILS at admission from FILS at discharge. Ultrasound images were acquired at admission using B-mode ultrasound imaging. Muscle mass and intramuscular adipose tissue of the quadriceps were assessed based on muscle thickness and echo intensity, respectively. The mean muscle thickness and echo intensity of the right and left quadriceps were used in the analysis. A multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors independently associated with the FILS at discharge and FILS change. The independent variables were the muscle thickness and echo intensity of the quadriceps, FILS at admission, age, sex, body mass index, days from stroke onset, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index, number of medications, unit number of rehabilitation therapy, and Barthel Index score at admission.	Muscle thickness of the quadriceps was significantly and independently associated with FILS at discharge (β = 0.27) and FILS change (β = 0.40). Echo intensity of the quadriceps was not significantly and independently associated with FILS at discharge (β = 0.22) and FILS change (β = 0.31).	Our results indicated that greater quadriceps muscle mass at post-acute care admission was associated with better swallowing ability at discharge in patients with stroke. Assessing muscle mass of the quadriceps at admission is important for predicting recovery of swallowing ability and interventions for quadriceps muscle mass may be effective for improving swallowing ability of patients with stroke.",Remaining

The literature search identified 92 articles, only 16 of which were suitable for inclusion in this review. We reviewed only original, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies have small sample size, but findings from the 16 publications reviewed here suggest that mind-body practices are associated with positive impacts on PTSD symptoms. Mind-body practices incorporate numerous therapeutic effects on stress responses, including reductions in anxiety, depression, and anger, and increases in pain tolerance, self-esteem, energy levels, ability to relax, and ability to cope with stressful situations. In general, mind-body practices were found to be a viable intervention to improve the constellation of PTSD symptoms such as intrusive memories, avoidance, and increased emotional arousal.	Mind-body practices are increasingly used in the treatment of PTSD and are associated with positive impacts on stress-induced illnesses such as depression and PTSD in most existing studies.

1151,25365615,Archives of Iranian medicine,The same haplotype for two unrelated Wilson disease patients with new ATP7B mutation.,"Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation in the ATP7B gene. The combination of markers (such as SNPs) on a single chromosome can be used to understand the structure of haplotype in the human genome, in which provide notable information on the origin of the mutation in human genetic disorders. The purpose of this study was to determine a haplotype analysis of two unrelated Wilson disease patients with the same missense mutation, c.2335T>G (g.58164 T>G) in exon 8.	DNA was prepared from two patients with the c.2335T>G mutation, their first-degree relatives, and 50 selected homozygous individuals from consanguineous marriage for eight SNPs around this particular ATP7B mutation. PCR was performed for SNPs of exons 4 (g.47964 C>T), 5 (g.51482G>A), 6 (g.54622A>G), 7 (g.56255G>A), 9 (g.59042G>T), 11 (g.66363G>A), 13 (g.70004 G>C), and 14 (g.72244 A>G), which are located in upstream and downstream of this mutation. Then, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for these eight SNPs was designed and performed using eight different restriction enzymes.	Eight different haplotypes were found in the present study and the patients with the same missense mutation had the same haplotype. The most prevalent haplotype in 100 normal studied ATP7B alleles was the same as reference haplotype (C G A G T G G G A) for ATP7B gene (NG_008806.1).	As these two geographically separated families with the same mutation had the same haplotype, we concluded that this mutation possibly had the same origin in this population.",Remaining

1153,9762379,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,Novel antipsychotics and patient care in state hospitals.,"To review and highlight the opportunities and challenges of pharmacologic advances in the use of antipsychotics for the state hospital system.	A critical review was performed of studies published either as articles or abstracts, on the use of novel antipsychotics, particularly as they relate to the patient population within the state mental hospital system.	The recent availability of new antipsychotic medications within state facilities has resulted in more progressive treatment, reduced recidivism (and consequently cost savings), and preliminary evidence of preferential and superior treatment response in specific patient subgroups (e.g., those with aggression). At the same time, inpatient pharmacy budget increases and uncertainty in guiding the use of novel antipsychotics have influenced the availability of these agents in state hospitals.	State hospital services have, by and large, embraced the developments in pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. Optimal use of these new agents in this population requires additional information on their relative efficacy in specific patient subgroups.",Non-systematic-review

Because previous studies have largely been in chronic patients, it is not known whether these membrane abnormalities also occur early in illness. In the present study, red blood cell membrane fatty acid levels were determined by capillary gas chromatography from 24 neuroleptic-naive patients with first episode schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 31 age-matched normal controls. Relative to normal subjects, patients had significant reductions in total PUFA (-13%) but not in monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids. Specifically, significant reductions were found in arachidonic acid (-18%), docosapentaenoic acid (-36%), and docosahexaenoic acid (-26%) concentrations. These reductions were not related to age, gender, smoking status, or cotinine levels. These results confirm previous findings of membrane deficits in schizophrenia and show that significant PUFA reductions occur early in the illness, prior to initiation of treatment, raising the possibility that these deficits are trait related. The findings also suggest that membrane fatty acid losses are quite specific to the highly unsaturated fatty acids.",Remaining

A prospective assessment of untreated anxiety symptoms and disorders among primary care patients.	Approximately 10% of eligible patients screened in clinic waiting rooms of a mixed-model health maintenance organization reported elevated symptoms and/or disorders of anxiety that were unrecognized and untreated. These patients with untreated anxiety reported significantly worse functioning on both physical and emotional measures than 'not anxious' comparison patients; in fact these patients reported reduced functioning levels within ranges that would be expected for patients with chronic physical diseases, such as diabetes and congestive heart failure. The most severe reductions in functioning were reported by untreated patients whose anxiety was mixed with depression symptoms or disorders.

1156,30059733,NeuroImage,Neonatal brain injury and aberrant connectivity.,"Brain injury sustained during the neonatal period may disrupt development of critical structural and functional connectivity networks leading to subsequent neurodevelopmental impairment in affected children. These networks can be characterized using structural (via diffusion MRI) and functional (via resting state-functional MRI) neuroimaging techniques. Advances in neuroimaging have led to expanded application of these approaches to study term- and prematurely-born infants, providing improved understanding of cerebral development and the deleterious effects of early brain injury. Across both modalities, neuroimaging data are conducive to analyses ranging from characterization of individual white matter tracts and/or resting state networks through advanced 'connectome-style' approaches capable of identifying highly connected network hubs and investigating metrics of network topology such as modularity and small-worldness. We begin this review by summarizing the literature detailing structural and functional connectivity findings in healthy term and preterm infants without brain injury during the postnatal period, including discussion of early connectome development. We then detail common forms of brain injury in term- and prematurely-born infants. In this context, we next review the emerging body of literature detailing studies employing diffusion MRI, resting state-functional MRI and other complementary neuroimaging modalities to characterize structural and functional connectivity development in infants with brain injury. We conclude by reviewing technical challenges associated with neonatal neuroimaging, highlighting those most relevant to studying infants with brain injury and emphasizing the need for further targeted study in this high-risk population.",Non-systematic-review
1157,22880116,PloS one,The cortical signature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The aim of this study was to explore the pattern of regional cortical thickness in patients with non-familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to investigate whether cortical thinning is associated with disease progression rate. Cortical thickness analysis was performed in 44 ALS patients and 26 healthy controls. Group differences in cortical thickness and the age-by-group effects were assessed using vertex-by-vertex and multivariate linear models. The discriminatory ability of MRI variables in distinguishing patients from controls was estimated using the Concordance Statistics (C-statistic) within logistic regression analyses. Correlations between cortical thickness measures and disease progression rate were tested using the Pearson coefficient. Relative to controls, ALS patients showed a bilateral cortical thinning of the primary motor, prefrontal and ventral frontal cortices, cingulate gyrus, insula, superior and inferior temporal and parietal regions, and medial and lateral occipital areas. There was a significant age-by-group effect in the sensorimotor cortices bilaterally, suggesting a stronger association between age and cortical thinning in ALS patients compared to controls. The mean cortical thickness of the sensorimotor cortices distinguished patients with ALS from controls (C-statistic ≥ 0.74). Cortical thinning of the left sensorimotor cortices was related to a faster clinical progression (r = -0.33, p = 0.03). Cortical thickness measurements allowed the detection and quantification of motor and extramotor involvement in patients with ALS. Cortical thinning of the precentral gyrus might offer a marker of upper motor neuron involvement and disease progression.",Remaining

We report the case of a patient receiving dabrafenib and trametinib for metastatic melanoma who developed intracranial hemorrhage while on therapy. Combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib improves progression-free survival of patients with BRAF V600-positive metastatic melanoma. Nevertheless, it is associated with an increased incidence and severity of any hemorrhagic event. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of intracranial hemorrhage with pathological confirmation.	We present the case of a 48-year-old man with metastatic melanoma of unknown primary site. He had metastases to the right clavicle, brain, liver, adrenal gland, and the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. He progressed on treatment with alpha-interferon. He was found to have a 4.5-cm mass in the left frontotemporal lobe and underwent gross total resection followed by adjuvant CyberKnife stereotactic irradiation. He was subsequently started on ipilimumab. Treatment was stopped due to kidney injury. He was then placed on dabrafenib and trametinib. He returned for follow-up complaining of severe headache and developed an episode of seizure. MRI showed a large area of edema at the left frontal lobe with midline shift. Emergency craniotomy was performed. Intracranial hemorrhage was found intra-operatively. Pathology from surgery did not find tumor cells, reported as organizing hemorrhage and necrosis with surrounding gliosis; immunohistochemistry for S100 and HMB45 were negative.	This case demonstrates the life-threatening adverse effects that can be seen with the newer targeted biological therapies. It is therefore crucial to maintain a high index of suspicion when patients on this combination therapy present with new neurologic symptoms.",Human-case-report

It has been shown to produce medicinal effects against hyperactivity, agitation and mania, as well as schizophrenia. Long-term usage of haloperidol raises the risk of acquiring a neurological condition like Parkinson's disease. Haloperidol causes drug-induced Parkinsonism (DIP) by blocking central dopamine receptors and causing extrapyramidal symptoms during long-term treatment. Quercetin has been shown to reduce the loss of striatal neurons, which may enhance motor capabilities and protect against agents that cause the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a result, present study intended to evaluate the efficacy of quercetin on haloperidol-related motor abnormalities. To develop behavioral impairments, rats (n=24) randomly divided to control and haloperidol group for four weeks. The animals were split into four groups after four weeks: Control, quercetin, haloperidol and haloperidol + quercetin. Animals were administered haloperidol i.p injections of 5mg/kg and quercetin (100mg/kg) orally for 21 days.

Based on our real-world experience in an academic medical center, we performed an economic analysis of a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients taking SSRIs on a course of acute and continuation treatment recommended by the American Psychiatric Association. We used standard costing of antidepressants, sildenafil, and unit costs for physician visits within a managed care environment and cost-of-illness methodology to calculate the annualized cost of depression for different treatment outcomes. After 6 months of SSRI treatment, the sildenafil add-on group had the lowest cost estimates compared with groups that discontinued SSRIs, substituted another SSRI (switching), or added a non-SSRI to the existing SSRI (augmentation). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the physician visit was the single most important cost component in this hypothetical population and relapse/remission the most costly outcome. Sildenafil can be a cost-effective add-on therapy to control SSRI-induced erectile dysfunction.

These studies describe application of simultaneous high-speed video kinematics with multichannel electromyography (EMG) to characterize the movement disorder exhibited by tottering mutant mice. These mice provide a uniquely valuable model, because they exhibit paroxysmal dystonia superimposed on mild baseline ataxia, permitting the examination of these two different problems within the same animals. At baseline with mild ataxia, the mutants exhibited poorly coordinated movements with increased variation of stance and swing times, and slower spontaneous walking velocities. The corresponding EMG showed reduced mean amplitudes of biceps femoris and vastus lateralis, and poorly modulated EMG activities during the step cycle. Attacks of paroxysmal dystonia were preceded by trains of EMG bursts with doublets and triplets simultaneously in the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis followed by more sustained coactivation. These EMG characteristics are consistent with the clinical phenomenology of the motor phenotype of tottering mice as a baseline of mild ataxia with intermittent attacks of paroxysmal dystonia. The EMG characteristics of ataxia and dystonia in the tottering mice also are consistent with EMG studies of other ataxic or dystonic animals and humans. These studies provide insights into how these methods can be used for delineating movement disorders in mice and for how they may be compared with similar disorders of humans.",Animal-other
1170,32750380,Neuroscience,Genetic Inactivation of Cholinergic C Bouton Output Improves Motor Performance but not Survival in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons and leads to death a few years after symptom onset. Despite its high morbidity and mortality, its underlying pathogenic mechanisms still remain poorly understood. Although there is increasing evidence for significant changes in the structure and function of synapses on motor neurons, there is a need for a systematic investigation of the role of each synapse subtype in the course of the disease. Here, we focus on large cholinergic synapses on motor neurons, known as C boutons, and investigate their role during ALS progression. We implement a genetic strategy for inactivation of the cholinergic output of C boutons in the SOD1[G93A] transgenic mouse model of ALS. We demonstrate that although C bouton cholinergic inactivation does not alter mouse survival, it exerts a beneficial effect on motor performance in the rotarod motor task, as evidenced by an increased latency to fall in SOD1[G93A] mice lacking C bouton cholinergic output. Our results suggest that C bouton cholinergic transmission exerts a negative effect on motor neuron function in ALS, possibly via aberrant excitation, and render C boutons a potential target for future pharmacological intervention.",Animal-drug-intervention

Post-hoc analyses of randomized clinical trial data of 369 outpatients with primary PD/AG (DSM-IV-TR criteria) treated with a 12-session manualized CBT (n = 301) and a waitlist control group (n = 68).

The experiments were carried out on hippocampal slices of guinea pigs. EFP were elicited by omission of Mg2+ from the perfusate and recorded from stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum in the CA1 subfield. Single electrical stimuli were applied to the Schaffer collateral pathway. Verapamil was added to the bath solution in concentrations of 40 and 60 mumol verapamil/l at normal (4 mmol/l) and elevated (8 mmol/l) K+ levels. After omission of Mg2+ from the perfusate, spontaneously occurring EFP appeared in all trials. These spontaneously occurring EFP were suppressed dose-dependently upon addition of verapamil to the perfusate. At elevated K+ levels, the latencies to suppression were significantly reduced and the dose dependency was abolished for the two doses of verapamil used. Triggered EFP reappeared upon stimulation after spontaneously occurring EFP had been suppressed, except for trials with 60 mumol verapamil/l bath solution with elevated K+ levels. The stimulus-evoked EFP were abolished with continuing perfusion of verapamil except for trials with 40 mumol/l at normal extracellular K+ concentrations. This effect was again dose dependent and enhanced by elevating the K+ level. In all experiments, stimulus-evoked EFP reappeared upon wash-out of verapamil.

In recent years, numerous experiences and indications for the use of FUS in clinical and preclinical studies have rapidly expanded. Focused ultrasound-mediated BBB opening induces cognitive enhancement and neurogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated.	Here, we investigate the effects of FUS-mediated BBB opening on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive function in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We applied FUS with microbubble to the hippocampus and LTP was measured 6 weeks after BBB opening using FUS. Field recordings were made with a concentric bipolar electrode positioned in the CA1 region using an extracellular glass pipette filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Morris water maze and Y-maze was performed to test cognitive function.	Our results demonstrated that FUS-mediated BBB opening has a significant impact on increasing LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 synapses and rescues cognitive dysfunction and working memory. These effects persisted for up to 7 weeks post-treatment. Also, FUS-mediated BBB opening in the hippocampus increased PKA phosphorylation.	Therefore, it could be a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases as it remarkably increases LTP, thereby improving working memory.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

Approximately 30% of patients fail to respond to present therapies. Therefore, the search for novel antidepressant drugs continues.	The most prescribed antidepressants are serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, which only indirectly affect dopaminergic neurotransmission. As a consequence, residual symptoms remain, including impaired motivation and impaired pleasure. This article reviews the development of new broad-spectrum antidepressants, the triple reuptake inhibitors, which also increase brain dopamine levels.	In this review, a distinction is made between the subtypes of melancholic and atypical depressions and their associated brain abnormalities and dysfunctions in neurotransmitter systems. Subsequently, we propose a hypothetical model: 'the monoamine hypothesis revisited' to predict what kind of pharmacological treatment will be effective in the different subtypes of depression. It is expected that the triple reuptake inhibitors, inhibiting the reuptake of all three monoamines, can produce a greater efficacy than traditional antidepressants especially in atypical depression. Since triple reuptake inhibitors may also dampen states of hyperglutamatergic activity and subsequent excitotoxicity, it is suggested that these new drugs have a considerable neuroprotective potential in major depression, especially in melancholic depression.",Non-systematic-review
1176,29518790,Neonatology,Impact of Xenon on CLIC4 and Bcl-2 Expression in Lipopolysaccharide and Hypoxia-Ischemia-Induced Periventricular White Matter Damage.,"Premature birth is a significant health care burden. Xenon (Xe) is a general anesthetic with neuroprotective effects.	Here, we investigate the neuroprotective role of Xe in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced white matter damage (WMD) model.	Three-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham group (group A, n = 24), an LPS + HI group (group B, n = 24), and an LPS + HI + Xe group (group C, n = 72). The onset of Xe inhalation started at 0, 2, and 5 h in subgroups C1, C2, and C3, respectively. Next, we performed TUNEL and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining; and examined the expression of CLIC4 and Bcl-2 in brain tissues.	HE staining revealed distorted cytoarchitecture, tangled nerve fibers, and pyknosis in group B, while Xe treatment improved these histological alterations in the group C pups. Following LPS and HI insult, the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased in group B at 48 and 72 h (p < 0.05), and Xe significantly alleviated apoptosis (p < 0.001) at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Similarly, CLIC4 mRNA expression was significantly increased in group B (p < 0.05), and Xe produced a marked reduction in CLIC4 mRNA expression in group C subgroups (p < 0.05). Western blotting demonstrated enhanced Bcl-2 expression in group C when compared to group B (p < 0.05).	These results demonstrate that LPS and HI successfully induced WMD, and Xe decreased neuronal apoptosis via Bcl-2- and CLIC4-mediated pathways. Moreover, the therapeutic time window of Xe extended for up to 5 h. These findings suggest that Xe can be used as a protective treatment for WMD in premature infants.",Animal-drug-intervention

Starting SUD treatment offers the opportunity to also quit smoking. The ACT-ATAC project aims to identify the predictors associated with smoking cessation among persons treated for alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder in Barcelona. This manuscript reports its methodology and the experience of carrying it out during the COVID-19 pandemic.	Mixed methods project with three substudies. Substudy 1 (S1) comprises heterogeneous discussion groups among clinicians. S2 has two prospective cohorts composed of smokers under treatment for alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder and the clinicians in charge of these patients. Participating smokers will be followed for 12 months and interviewed about their substance use and the tobacco cessation services received using the Spanish version of the users' Knowledge, Attitudes, and Services (S-KAS) scale. The clinicians will be asked about their self-reported practices in smoking cessation using the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (S-KAP) scale. S3 comprises heterogeneous discussion groups with smokers. Data will be triangulated using qualitative and quantitative analyses. To facilitate the recruitment process, the researchers have introduced several strategies (design clear protocols, set monthly online meetings, extend the project, provide gift cards, etc.).	The results of S1 were used to develop the questionnaires. S2 required some adjustments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the follow-up interviews being conducted by phone instead of face-to-face, and the recruitment rhythm was lower than expected. Recruitment will last until reaching at least 200-250 users. The fieldwork could not have been possible without the collaboration of the ACT-ATAC team and the introduction of several strategies.

A long-term follow-up study.,"The clinical and neuroradiological outcome of carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication was evaluated prospectively in 30 patients over a follow-up period of 3 years. Among the patients studied, 22 had been acutely exposed to CO while 8 were chronically exposed. One month after CO poisoning, 12 of the 22 patients with acute intoxication showed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities: 6 also had neurological sequelae and 6 were asymptomatic. The remaining 10 patients showed neither MRI abnormalities nor neurological sequelae. During the 3-year follow-up, 4 of the patients with both MRI abnormalities and neurological sequelae improved in both clinical features and MRI findings. One of the 6 asymptomatic patients with MRI abnormalities developed a progressive cognitive impairment 2 months after acute intoxication, with a concomitant severe worsening of the MRI lesions. Among the 10 patients with neither MRI abnormalities nor neurological sequelae, only 1 developed neurological sequelae after a clear period of 4 months. In the group of patients who experienced chronic CO intoxication, only 1 presented with a neuropsychiatric syndrome which improved at follow-up. Brain MRI showed white matter lesions which remained unchanged at control scan after 1 year. In conclusion, we observed that some patients with severe CO poisoning and neurological sequelae may fully regain normal functions after approximately 1 year. The presence of MRI lesions 1 month after CO poisoning did not accurately predict the subsequent outcome. The observation of a clear period longer than the usual 2-40 day interval in 2 patients should be considered for careful planning of follow-up and for prognosis in CO-poisoned patients.",Remaining
1179,36916904,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Expanding the Phenotypic Spectrum of Kenny-Caffey Syndrome.,"Kenny-Caffey syndrome (KCS) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by short stature, hypoparathyroidism, and electrolyte disturbances. KCS1 and KCS2 are caused by pathogenic variants in TBCE and FAM111A, respectively. Clinically the phenotypes are difficult to distinguish.	The objective was to determine and expand the phenotypic spectrum of KCS1 and KCS2 in order to anticipate complications that may arise in these disorders.	We clinically and genetically analyzed 10 KCS2 patients from 7 families. Because we found unusual phenotypes in our cohort, we performed a systematic review of genetically confirmed KCS cases using PubMed and Scopus. Evaluation by 3 researchers led to the inclusion of 26 papers for KCS1 and 16 for KCS2, totaling 205 patients. Data were extracted following the Cochrane guidelines and assessed by 2 independent researchers.	Several patients in our KCS2 cohort presented with intellectual disability (3/10) and chronic kidney disease (6/10), which are not considered common findings in KCS2. Systematic review of all reported KCS cases showed that the phenotypes of KCS1 and KCS2 overlap for postnatal growth retardation (KCS1: 52/52, KCS2: 23/23), low parathyroid hormone levels (121/121, 16/20), electrolyte disturbances (139/139, 24/27), dental abnormalities (47/50, 15/16), ocular abnormalities (57/60, 22/23), and seizures/spasms (103/115, 13/16). Symptoms more prevalent in KCS1 included intellectual disability (74/80, 5/24), whereas in KCS2 bone cortical thickening (1/18, 16/20) and medullary stenosis (7/46, 27/28) were more common.	Our case series established chronic kidney disease as a new feature of KCS2. In the literature, we found substantial overlap in the phenotypic spectra of KCS1 and KCS2, but identified intellectual disability and the abnormal bone phenotype as the most distinguishing features.",Remaining

1181,16000159,Journal of neurochemistry,Blockade of L-type voltage-gated Ca channel inhibits ischemia-induced neurogenesis by down-regulating iNOS expression in adult mouse.,"Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian hippocampus may contribute to repairing the brain after injury. The signals that regulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus following ischemic stroke insult are not well known. We have previously reported that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression is necessary for ischemia-stimulated neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus. Here, we show that mice subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) significantly increased the number of new neurons and up-regulated iNOS expression in the dentate gyrus. Blockade of the L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (L-VGCC) prevented neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone (SVZ), and down-regulated iNOS expression in the dentate gyrus after cerebral ischemia. This study suggests that Ca(2+) influx through L-VGCC is involved in ischemia-induced neurogenesis by up-regulating iNOS expression.",Animal-other

Half the schools were randomly allocated to the computerised prevention program (n=397), and half to their usual health classes (n=367). The Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis prevention course is facilitated by the internet and consists of novel, evidence-based, curriculum consistent lessons aimed at reducing alcohol and cannabis use. Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately post, and at six months following the intervention.	Compared to the control group, students in the intervention group showed significant improvements in alcohol and cannabis knowledge at the end of the course and the six month follow-up. In addition, the intervention group showed a reduction in average weekly alcohol consumption and frequency of cannabis use at the six month follow-up. No differences between groups were found on alcohol expectancies, cannabis attitudes, or alcohol and cannabis related harms.	The course is acceptable, scalable and fidelity is assured.

1184,22627142,Neurobiology of disease,"Subchronic ketamine treatment leads to permanent changes in EEG, cognition and the astrocytic glutamate transporter EAAT2 in mice.","Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with psychotomimetic, dissociative, amnestic and euphoric effects. When chronically abused, ketamine users display deficits in cognition and information processing, even following long-term abstinence from the drug. While animal studies have shown evidence of behavioral changes and cognitive deficits that mimic those seen in humans within the period immediately following subchronic ketamine, a few animal studies have assessed long-term changes following cessation of ketamine exposure. To this end, the present study assessed event related potentials (ERPs) and EEG oscillations in mice exposed to subchronic ketamine following a 6month period of abstinence from the drug. Ketamine-treated mice showed no change in P20, but did show marked reductions in amplitude of the later N40 and P80 components, consistent with previous studies of acute ketamine exposure. Additionally, ketamine-treated animals showed a significant reduction in stimulus evoked theta oscillations. To assess the functional significance of these changes, mice were also assessed on a series of behavioral and cognitive tests, including progressive ratio (motivation), extinction (behavioral flexibility) and win-shift radial maze (spatial memory). Subchronic ketamine produced marked disruptions in reversal learning and spatial memory. Analysis of brains from ketamine-treated mice failed to show evidence of neuronal degeneration as determined by NueN immunohistochemistry, but did show increased astrocyte proliferation and decreased expression of the glial specific glutamate transporter, GLT-1. These results strongly suggest: 1) that subchronic ketamine induces significant changes in brain function that long exceed exposure to the drug; 2) that ketamine exposure in mice induces lasting cognitive impairments closely resembling those observed in human ketamine abusers; 3) that ERP and EEG measures are highly sensitive to alterations in brain function associated with reduced cognitive function; and 4) that the brain changes induced by chronic ketamine treatment are suggestive of long-term adaptive or plastic, rather than degenerative, changes.",Animal-drug-intervention

We examined predictors of obesity in children with ASD with body mass index data for the proband, 1 sibling, and 2 parents using data from the multisite Simons Simplex Collection.	In a stepwise logistic regression model, proband obesity status was associated with obesity status of the sibling (odds ratio [OR] 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92-3.70), mother (OR 2.10; 95% CI, 1.59-2.77), and father (OR 1.51; 95% CI, 1.15-1.98).

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics",Identification of pharmacogenetic markers in smoking cessation therapy.,"Pharmacogenetic clinical trials seek to identify genetic modifiers of treatment effects. When a trial has collected data on many potential genetic markers, a first step in analysis is to screen for evidence of pharmacogenetic effects by testing for treatment-by-marker interactions in a statistical model for the outcome of interest. This approach is potentially problematic because (i) individual significance tests can be overly sensitive, particularly when sample sizes are large; and (ii) standard significance tests fail to distinguish between markers that are likely, on biological grounds, to have an effect, and those that are not. One way to address these concerns is to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests [Berger (1985) Statistical decision theory and Bayesian analysis. New York: Springer; Kass and Raftery (1995) J Am Stat Assoc 90:773-795], which are typically more conservative than standard uncorrected frequentist tests, less conservative than multiplicity-corrected tests, and make explicit use of relevant biological information through specification of the prior distribution. In this article we use a Bayesian testing approach to screen a panel of genetic markers recorded in a randomized clinical trial of bupropion versus placebo for smoking cessation. From a panel of 59 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on 11 candidate genes, we identify four SNPs (one each on CHRNA5 and CHRNA2 and two on CHAT) that appear to have pharmacogenetic relevance. Of these, the SNP on CHRNA5 is most robust to specification of the prior. An unadjusted frequentist test identifies seven SNPs, including these four, none of which remains significant upon correction for multiplicity. In a panel of 43 randomly selected control SNPs, none is significant by either the Bayesian or the corrected frequentist test.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

A prospective cluster randomized comparative trial of the two interventions.	A total of 136 primary care practices in two study areas within the West Midlands and the South West regions of England.	A total of 143 family members affected by the alcohol or drug problem of a relative were recruited into the study by primary health-care professionals.

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a short version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale assessing changes on 4 different dimensions of impulsivity, namely urgency, (lack of) premeditation, (lack of) perseverance, and sensation seeking, arising in the course of a neurodegenerative disease. To this end, caregivers of 83 probable AD patients completed a short questionnaire adapted from the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the data were performed and revealed that a model with 4 distinct but related latent variables corresponding to 4 different dimensions of impulsivity fit the data best. Furthermore, the results showed that lack of perseverance, followed by lack of premeditation and urgency, increased after the onset of the disease, whereas sensation seeking decreased. Overall, the multifaceted nature of impulsivity was confirmed in a sample of AD patients, whose caregivers reported significant changes regarding each facet of impulsivity. Consequently, the short version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale opens up interesting prospects for a better comprehension of behavioral symptoms of dementia.",Remaining

We aim to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke.	Studies published up to 4 November 2022 on Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched. We included studies of adults with stroke, where depression was assessed at a prespecified time point. Studies excluding people with aphasia and history of depression are excluded. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme(CASP) cohort study tool was used to assess risk of bias. A total of 77 studies were included in the pooled estimates of the prevalence of poststroke depression (PSD). The overall prevalence of depression was 27% (95% CI 25 to 30). Prevalence of depression was 24% (95% CI 21 to 28) by clinical interview and 29% (95% CI 25 to 32) by rating scales. Twenty-four studies with more than one assessment time point reported the natural history of PSD. Among people who were depressed within 3 months of stroke, 53% (95% CI 47 to 59) experienced persistent depression, while 44% (95% CI 38 to 50) recovered. The incidence of later depression (3 to 12 months after stroke) was 9% (95% CI 7 to 12). The cumulative incidence during 1 year after stroke was 38% (95% CI 33 to 43), and the majority (71% (95% CI 65 to 76)) of depression had onset within 3 months after stroke. The main limitation of the present study is that excluding people in source studies with severe impairments may produce imprecise estimates of the prevalence of PSD.	In this study, we observed that stroke survivors with early-onset depression (within 3 months after stroke) are at high risks for remaining depressed and make up two-thirds of the incident cases during 1 year after stroke. This highlights the need for ongoing clinical monitoring of patients depressed shortly after stroke.	PROSPERO CRD42022314146.",Human-systematic-review

1191,1480765,Progress in brain research,"Brain banking and the human hypothalamus--factors to match for, pitfalls and potentials.","The study of an increasing number of processes occurring in the human brain can be carried out on autopsy material. The availability of this material, whether fresh, frozen or fixed, makes it possible to develop methodologies for studying the neuroanatomical and neurochemical aspects of the human brain. It has also become possible in recent years to correlate functional changes with neurochemical changes and with neuroanatomical abnormalities in disease states. Some compounds and structures are damaged irreversibly within minutes after death and some brain components are known to disintegrate within seconds. This led to the widespread idea that autopsy material would not be suitable for basic research purposes and would not supply the necessary answers on the various fundamental questions regarding processes occurring in normal or diseased brain. However, from data published in recent years in which autopsy material has been routinely used, it becomes more and more evident that this is a misconception. There is an increasing number of reports based on the use of normal and pathological human brain tissue obtained by autopsies in spite of the fact that there is a worrying continuous decline in autopsy rate which causes serious concern among scientists world-wide (Anderson and Hill, 1989). It also became evident that when using the proper fixation procedures, sufficient structural integrity is retained in the tissue to allow morphological and morphometrical studies (Swaab and Uylings, 1988). Electron microscopic examination of synaptosomal preparations from post-mortem human brain showed them to be only slightly less pure than preparations from fresh tissue although there was some degree of damage (Hardy et al., 1982). Agonal state effects the stability of brain compounds and causes brain hypoxia. This again forms a tremendous difficulty for the study of human neurological and psychiatric diseases as one of the frequent causes of death is bronchopneumonia which leads to brain hypoxia and results in pronounced lactic acidosis. The Netherlands Brain Bank has succeeded to partly circumvent some of the serious problems encountered in providing human tissue for research by performing rapid autopsies with an average post-mortem delay of 2-4 h. This has become possible by a close collaboration of numerous nursing homes in Amsterdam and its vicinity and with the neuropathologists of the Free University in Amsterdam. We also measure the pH of the tissue as indicator of agonal state in order to reveal unsuitable specimens.

The image-based degree of stenosis in the carotid artery and the plaque burden can be predicted using the automated carotid lumen diameter (LD)/inter-adventitial diameter (IAD) measurements from B-mode ultrasound images. The objective of this review is to present the state-of-the-art methods and systems for the measurement of LD/IAD in CCA based on automated or semi-automated strategies. Further, the performance of these systems is compared based on various metrics for its measurements.	The automated algorithms proposed for the segmentation of carotid lumen are broadly classified into two different categories as: region-based and boundary-based. These techniques are discussed in detail specifying their pros and cons. Further, we discuss the challenges encountered in the segmentation process along with its quantitative assessment. Lastly, we present stenosis quantification and risk stratification strategies.	Even though, we have found more boundary-based approaches compared to region-based approaches in the literature, however, the region-based strategy yield more satisfactory performance. Novel risk stratification strategies are presented. On a patient database containing 203 patients, 9 patients are identified as high risk patients, whereas 27 patients are identified as medium risk patients.

We examined T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans of unmedicated, right-handed female patients with BPD (according to DSM-IV criteria) and healthy controls matched for age, intelligence and education using fully automated DARTEL voxel-based morphometry. Our regions of interest analyses included the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hypothalamus.	We enrolled 30 patients and 33 controls in our study. The grey matter of patients with BPD was reduced in the hippocampus, but increased in the hypothalamus compared with healthy participants. Hypothalamic volume correlated positively with the history of traumatization in patients with BPD. No significant alterations were found in the amygdala and ACC.	This study is limited by the lack of measures of corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels. Furthermore, moderate sample size and comorbid disorders need to be considered.	Our findings provide new evidence for grey matter alterations in the hypothalamus and replicate previously reported decrements in hippocampal volume in patients with BPD. Understanding the role of the hypothalamus and other central stress-regulating structures could help us to further understand the neurobiological underpinnings of this complex disorder.",Remaining

This study investigated whether ME10092 regulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)-mediated signal transduction in vivo. The effect of ME10092 treatment (1-100 pmol/mouse) on nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, activation of expression of inflammatory mediators and production of nitric oxide were measured in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced brain inflammation model in mice in vivo. The antinociceptive activity of ME10092 was tested in the formalin-induced paw licking test. ME10092 dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, transcription of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements showed that ME10092 inhibited the LPS-induced increase in nitric oxide content in mouse brain tissue in a dose-dependent manner. In the formalin-induced paw licking test, ME10092 (at the dose of 3mg/kg, p.o. twice daily for eight days) significantly reduced nociceptive response.

This report describes early results from the implementation of this plan in the county of Västra Götaland, in southwestern Sweden. During 2002-2004 interviews were conducted with the main project representative in each of the county's 49 municipalities. In addition, more extensive data gathering, involving interviews with a broad range of stakeholders and systematic examination of project-related documentation, was undertaken in four representative municipalities. Findings indicated that community* alcohol consumption prevention has been strengthened and that the activity level is high in all municipalities, especially in relation to youth. However, problematic alcoholic beverage consumption by adults was rarely targeted; the limited resources were dispersed over too many projects; there was too little collaboration between stakeholding authorities and adherence to evidence-based practice still is lacking.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Neuroimaging offers a variety of techniques for non-invasive evaluation of alterations in metabolism, as well as structural and functional changes of the brain in patients after TIPS implantation. In this article, we review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of post-TIPS HE. The potential of neuroimaging including positron emission tomography and multimodality magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the pathophysiology of post-TIPS HE is presented. We also give a perspective on the role of neuroimaging in this field.",Non-systematic-review

However, there is a lack of literature in quantitative measures of motor control, which may potentially characterize the nature of the speech impairments in these children. This study investigated speech motor control in children with cerebral palsy (CP) using kinematic analysis.	We collected 10 children with mild spastic CP, aged 4.8 to 7.5 years, and 10 age-matched children with typical development (TD) from rehabilitation department at a tertiary hospital. All children underwent analysis of percentage of consonants correct (PCC) and kinematic analysis of speech tasks: poly-syllable (PS) and mono-syllable (MS) tasks using the Vicon Motion 370 system integrated with a digital camcorder. Kinematic parameters included spatiotemporal indexes (STIs), and average values and coefficients of variation (CVs) of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity. An ANOVA was conducted to determine whether PCC and kinematic data significantly differed between groups.	CP group had relatively lower PCCs (80.0-99.0%) than TD group (p = 0.039). CP group had higher STIs in PS speech tasks, but not in MS tasks, than TD group did (p = 0.001). The CVs of utterance duration for MS and PS tasks of children with CP were at least three times as large as those of TD children (p < 0.01). However, average values of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity and CVs of other kinematic data for both tasks did not significantly differ between two groups.	High STI values and high variability on utterance durations in children with CP reflect deficits in relative spatial and/or especially temporal control for speech in the CP participants compared to the TD participants. Children with mild spastic CP may have more difficulty in processing increased articulatory demands and resulted in greater oromotor variability than normal children. The kinematic data such as STIs can be used as indices for detection of speech motor control impairments in children with mild CP and assessment of the effectiveness in the treatment.",Remaining

Sludge-induced distal vasculopathy explains 25% of strokes in SCD, while proximal vasculopathy is responsible for 75% of cases. The stenoses observed in SCD-related proximal vasculopathy are progressive and can be detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD), a reliable, non-invasive and low-cost imaging method. High velocities (> 2 mls) are associated with a 40% risk of stroke within 36 months, but initiation of a transfusion program maintaining the HbS level under 30% reduces the risk to less than 2%. TCD must be performed in all children at 12-18 months of age to detect cerebral vasculopathy and prevent stroke. This approach has been adopted in our institution, based on a cohort of SCD newborns screened at birth: the risk of stroke was reduced from the expected 11% to less than 2% at 18 years. Genoidentical stem cell transplantation, which safely obviates the need for transfusion programs and provides a 95% chance of cure, should be offered early to patients at risk of stroke.

That is, the relationship between these cues and the outcome is learned about less well than a cue presented on its own with an outcome (e.g., C - O1). The current study sought to explore the relationship between overshadowing and the positive and negative dimensions of schizotypy. A total of 256 participants completed an overshadowing procedure embedded within a causal judgement task and the Short Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE) which measured the different dimensions of schizotypy. A unilateral overshadowing effect was observed, however, none of the dimensions of schizotypy predicted the magnitude of this effect. These results are the first to demonstrate this finding using an appropriately powered sample and reveal that a tendency to experience symptoms of schizophrenia does not impact upon the overshadowing effect.",Remaining

We aimed to assess the uptake of slow-release oral morphine (SROM) as second-line OAT among medically ill, hospitalised patients with opioid use disorder who declined buprenorphine and methadone.	This study included consecutive hospitalised patients with untreated moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder referred to an inpatient addiction medicine consultation service, between June 2018 and September 2019, in Nova Scotia, Canada. We assessed the proportion of patients initiating first-line OAT (buprenorphine or methadone) in-hospital, and the proportion initiating SROM after declining first-line OAT. We compared rates of outpatient OAT continuation (i.e., filling outpatient OAT prescription or attending first outpatient OAT clinic visit) by medication type, and compared OAT selection between patients with and without chronic pain, using χ[2] tests.	Thirty-four patients were offered OAT initiation in-hospital; six patients (18%) also had chronic pain. Twenty-one patients (62%) initiated first-line OAT with buprenorphine or methadone. Of the 13 patients who declined first-line OAT, seven (54%) initiated second-line OAT with SROM in-hospital. Rates of outpatient OAT continuation after hospital discharge were high (>80%) and did not differ between medications (P = 0.4). Patients with co-existing chronic pain were more likely to choose SROM over buprenorphine or methadone (P = 0.005).	The ability to offer SROM (in addition to buprenorphine or methadone) increased rates of OAT initiation among hospitalised patients.

The hypothesis of this study was that altered central serotonergic activity is related to aggression in AD. Twenty-two institutionalized, nondepressed elderly (12 M/10 F, mean age +/- SD: 82.2 +/- 6.4) with probable AD, severe cognitive impairment (MMSE = 4.1 +/- 4.7) and significant behavioral disturbance (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score > or = 8) were studied. The prolactin (PRL) response to d,l-fenfluramine (60 mg p.o.) was used as an index of central serotonergic function. The NPI aggression score, NPI irritability score, and Behavioral Pathology in AD aggression score were positively correlated to prolactin concentrations following fenfluramine challenge (r(S) =.61, p =.003; r(S) =.53, p =.012; and r(S) =.47, p =.029 respectively). In addition, aggressive patients showed a greater mean PRL increase (% baseline) (215 +/- 60, n = 11) than nonaggressive subjects (123 +/- 54, n = 11) (p =.01, 2-tailed t-test). The change in PRL concentration depended on level of cognitive impairment (p =.0004) and the gender x aggression interaction (p =.015) with the overall regression model accounting for 74% of the variance (r = 0.86, F = 11.9, p =.0001). Female aggressive subjects with less cognitive impairment had the largest response to fenfluramine challenge.

Therefore, we herein investigated the relationship between SARC-F scores and functional outcomes in stroke patients. The primary outcome in the present study was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 3 months after stroke. The relationship between SARC-F scores and poor functional outcomes was examined using a logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the applicability of SARC-F scores to the assessment of poor functional outcomes was analyzed based on the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC). Eighty-one out of the 324 patients enrolled in the present study (25%) had poor functional outcomes (mRS ≥ 4). The results of the multivariate analysis revealed a correlation between SARC-F scores (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.05-1.59, p = 0.02) and poor functional outcomes. A cut-off SARC-F score ≥ 4 had low-to-moderate sensitivity (47.4%) and high specificity (87.3%).

To assess the relation between intra-individual variability of systolic orthostatic blood pressure change (DeltaSBP) and cardiovascular outcomes, an algorithm was developed to identify DeltaSBP instability using repeated supine and standing BP measurements. A cohort of 673 nursing home residents underwent baseline postural BP measurements (supine to 1 minute of standing, four times in a single day) and were followed for up to 2 years. Two groups (stable vs. unstable) were identified based on an analysis of DeltaSBP variance components. Differences in outcomes were compared via Cox survival analysis. At baseline 12.6% were unstable, defined as a one standard deviation difference of at least 20.2 mmHg between DeltaSBP readings. Unstable subjects were more likely to have OH on at least one measurement (systolic BP drop of 20 mmHg or more; 85% vs. 36%, respectively) and to be on psychotropic medication at baseline (47% vs 35%) (P-values <0.001). Other characteristics (including previous stroke) did not differ. During a mean follow-up of 10.3 months, stroke incidence was higher in unstable subjects (13.1% vs. 4.9%; P = 0.012), but ischemic heart disease and mortality rates were not significantly different (respectively, 13.5% vs. 7.4%, P = 0.115; 14.8% vs. 10.7%, P = 0.178). Survival analyses (adjusted for age, sex, psychotropic medications, body mass index, ischemic heart disease, and supine systolic pressure) confirmed a higher risk of stroke in unstable subjects (relative risk = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.6-8.4). Highly variable orthostatic BP measures may reflect impaired BP regulatory mechanisms in elders with occult cerebrovascular disease, or may directly affect cerebral blood flow. Orthostatic BP variability may be a better indicator of future stroke than a single supine or orthostatic change measure.",Remaining

The illness distresses the person and impairs his or her social functioning and quality of life. MDD is characterized by marked sadness or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, and is accompanied by weight change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, physical impairment and a high suicide rate. In 2000, the World Health Organization, or WHO, identified MDD as the fourth ranked cause of disability and premature death in the world. WHO projected that by 2020, MDD would rise in disease burden to be second only to ischemic heart disease. The disorder is common in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence rate of 17 percent and a recurrence rate of more than 50 percent.	MDD may be associated with extensive dental disease, and people may seek dental treatment before becoming aware of their psychiatric illness. MDD frequently is associated with a disinterest in performing appropriate oral hygiene techniques, a cariogenic diet, diminished salivary flow, rampant dental caries, advanced periodontal disease and oral dysesthesias. Many medications used to treat the disease magnify the xerostomia and increase the incidence of dental disease. Appropriate dental management requires a vigorous dental education program, the use of saliva substitutes and anticaries agents containing fluoride, and special precautions when prescribing or administering analgesics and local anesthetics.	Dentists cognizant of these signs and symptoms have an opportunity to recognize patients with occult MDD. After confirmation of the diagnosis and institution of treatment by a mental health practitioner, dentists usually can provide a full range of services that may enhance patients' self-esteem and contribute to the psychotherapeutic aspect of management.",Non-systematic-review

First-year university students (n = 151, 54 % females) classified as binge drinkers (n = 71, ≥6 binge drinking episodes, defined as 5/7 standard drinks per occasion in the last 180 days) and controls (n = 80, <6 binge drinking episodes in the last 180 days) performed a beverage Go/NoGo task (pictures of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks were presented according to the condition as Go or NoGo stimuli; Go probability = 0.75) during event-related potential recording. In binge drinkers but not controls, the amplitude of the anterior N2-NoGo was larger in response to nonalcohol than in response to alcohol pictures. No behavioural difference in task performance was observed. In terms of dual-process models, binge drinkers may require increased activation to monitor conflict in order to compensate for overactivation of the affective-automatic system caused by alcohol-related bias.",Remaining

PD patients ranged from Stage 1-3, with median Stage 2 (Hoehn and Yahr Classification) with mean Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III score of 19 ± 10.42, and average disease duration of 5.8 ± 2.78 years. Visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields were unaffected but contrast sensitivity was significantly worse than controls (P < 0.001).

Significant RNFL thinning was observed in the average RNFL (P = 0.033), superior (P = 0.018), and temporal (P = 0.036) quadrants. Significant ganglion cell layer loss was captured on SD-OCT with average, minimum GCL-IPL, and all 6 sectors showing thinning (P ≤ 0.003). The functional changes correlated significantly with structural changes, disease duration, and severity. There was no correlation between structural changes in the retina and disease duration or severity.	Subclinical visual dysfunction was observed in patients with PD with good structural-functional correlation.

To gain insight into the proportion and type of psychiatric disorders in perpetrators of filicide. method Literature search by means of PubMed, Embase Psychiatry and PsychInfo on the basis of the search terms filicide, neonaticide, infanticide, gender, psychiatric disorder. results Perpetrators of filicide were found to have many types of psychiatric disorders. The most frequent types of diagnostic categories were affective disorders with or without psychotic features. The second most frequent type was schizophrenia. There was a considerable overlap between these disorders, personality disorders and symptoms of drug-dependence. Often perpetrators were also found to have lower-than-average intelligence.	A psychiatric disorder in one or both parents constitutes a major risk factor for child murder by parents. The identification of other risk factors and their possible interrelatedness is important for our understanding of these criminal acts, for the detection of warning signs and for the development of preventive strategies.",Non-systematic-review

Healthy subjects received venlafaxine 75 mg/day (Study 1; N = 38) or escitalopram 10 mg/ day (Study 2; N = 25) with the addition of aripiprazole 10-20 mg/day (10 mg/day fixed dose in Study 2) for 14 days. Patients with MDD (N = 498; Studies 3 and 4) received escitalopram (10-20 mg/day), fluoxetine (20-40 mg/day), paroxetine controlled-release (37.5-50 mg/day), sertraline (100-150 mg/day) or venlafaxine extended-release (150-225 mg/day) for 8 weeks plus placebo. Incomplete responders were randomised (1:1) to placebo or adjunctive aripiprazole 2-20 mg/day. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of ADTs.

Before surgery, 2,266 participants (median age 46 years; 78.6% female; 86.9% white; median body mass index 45.9 kg/m(2)) of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study completed eating behavior survey items in the self-administered LABS-2 Behavior form. Other measures included the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, the LABS-2 Psychiatric and Emotional Test Survey, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12, the Short Form-36 Health Survey, and Impact of Weight Quality of Life-Lite Survey.	The majority (92.1%) of participants reported eating dinner regularly, whereas just over half (54.0%) reported eating breakfast regularly. Half of the participants reported eating at least four meals/week at restaurants; two meals/week were fast food. Loss of control eating was reported by 43.4%, night eating syndrome by 17.7%; 15.7% satisfied criteria for binge eating disorder (BED), 2% for bulimia nervosa. Factors that independently increased the odds of BED were being a college graduate, eating more times per day, taking medication for psychiatric or emotional problems, and having symptoms of alcohol use disorder, lower self-esteem and greater depressive symptoms.	Before undergoing bariatric surgery a substantial proportion of patients report problematic eating behaviors. Several factors associated with BED were identified, most suggesting other mental health problems, including higher levels of depressive symptomotology. The strengths of this study include the large sample size, the multi-center design and use of standardized assessment practices.",Remaining
1223,32938453,BMC biology,Genetic modifiers ameliorate endocytic and neuromuscular defects in a model of spinal muscular atrophy.,"Understanding the genetic modifiers of neurodegenerative diseases can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying these disorders. Here, we examine the relationship between the motor neuron disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is caused by reduced levels of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein, and the actin-bundling protein Plastin 3 (PLS3). Increased PLS3 levels suppress symptoms in a subset of SMA patients and ameliorate defects in SMA disease models, but the functional connection between PLS3 and SMN is poorly understood.	We provide immunohistochemical and biochemical evidence for large protein complexes localized in vertebrate motor neuron processes that contain PLS3, SMN, and members of the hnRNP F/H family of proteins. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) SMA model, we determine that overexpression of PLS3 or loss of the C. elegans hnRNP F/H ortholog SYM-2 enhances endocytic function and ameliorates neuromuscular defects caused by decreased SMN-1 levels. Furthermore, either increasing PLS3 or decreasing SYM-2 levels suppresses defects in a C. elegans ALS model.	We propose that hnRNP F/H act in the same protein complex as PLS3 and SMN and that the function of this complex is critical for endocytic pathways, suggesting that hnRNP F/H proteins could be potential targets for therapy development.",Animal-drug-intervention

HHE syndrome usually occurs in children younger than 4 years of age. Although most HHE syndrome patients live into adult life, only a few cases of the syndrome have been reported in the elderly. In our case, cerebral hemiatrophy, left mesial temporal sclerosis and crossed cerebellar atrophy were observed. Because this is the oldest case ever reported, we further investigated age-related neuropathological changes and found an interhemispheric difference in amyloid-β-related neuropathologic changes. There were almost no senile plaques or amyloid-laden vessels in the left hemisphere.

1226,1444769,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,Phenol block for hip flexor muscle spasticity under ultrasonic monitoring.,"Hip flexor spasticity, which is often associated with central nervous system (CNS) diseases, is a major impediment in rehabilitation. In order to cope with this problem, lumbar nerve blocking techniques developed by Meelhuysen and major and minor psoas muscle blocking techniques developed by Awad have been used in combination with physical therapies. Based on these techniques, we conducted major and minor psoas muscle phenol block (motor point block or intramuscular nerve block) under ultrasonic monitoring. Phenol block was conducted in nine patients with cerebral infarction (13 blocking procedures) and three with spinal cord injuries (six blocking procedures) while keeping them in a lateral position with the operation side upside. The beginning of the femoral nerves and part of the lumbar artery were visualized by ultrasound in some patients. As a result of the improvement of hip flexor spasticity, the range of hip joint motion (determined by the Mundale technique, prone hip extension and Thomas test) improved shortly after blocking. When physical therapy was conducted after blocking, improvement of skin care management was observed in eight cases, ability to keep in a stable sitting position in nine, improvement of a standing posture in three, increases in the ability to walk in two and alleviation of pain in three. Although nerve block is reported to result in hematoma, decreases in muscle force, pain, cystic/rectal disorders and hypogonadism, we have observed no such complication in our patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

We retrospectively sampled and analyzed 31 patients treated for ruptured Distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) aneurysms from a larger sample of 250 patients treated for ruptured aneurysms between July 2018 and July 2021. The outcomes of patients who underwent clipping and EVT were compared using chi-square tests. T-tests were used for univariate analysis and a logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors affecting outcomes.	Of the 31 patients, 20 were treated with clipping and 11 with EVT. Patients treated with EVT had a mean age of 35.45 ± 6.66. The mean age of the clipping group was 44.4 ± 6.94 years (p=0.002). Intraoperative rupture was significantly more common in the clipping group (p=0.025). There were no significant differences in the postoperative incidence of vasospasm or hydrocephalus (p=0.12). Modified Rankin Scale scores (p=0.017) and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores (p=0.02) both at discharge and 6-month follow-ups were significantly better in the EVT group than in the clipping group. Length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was 9.27 ± 2.6 days following EVT and 23.60 ± 6.29 following clipping (p=0.001). Age (p=0.0136), Hunt and Hess grade (p=0.02), and the occurrence of intraprocedural rupture (p=0.009) were found to significantly affect outcomes.	The outcomes of EVT were better than those for clipping and required a shorter stay in the ICU and the hospital. This may be partially attributable to the dual-trained neurovascular surgeon who performed the procedures. Older age, poorer Hunt and Hess grades, and intraoperative aneurysm rupture adversely affected outcomes.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Participants were 1,521 U.S. Army soldiers 3-12 months postdeployment reporting their most distressing postdeployment ICs (mean number of ICs reported was 1.20). ICs were transcribed and content was categorized by 13 emergent themes. The most commonly reported ICs were of injury or death (48.2%) and combat (43.5%), and soldiers with probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n = 187) were more likely to report the presence of these ICs, χ(2) s(1) = 35.27, ps < .001, φs < .16 than those without probable PTSD (n = 1,331). Other domains also emerged frequently, including ICs about friends (31.0%), family (15.8%), and leadership concerns (13.8%). IC content was a small, but significant correlate of distress after adjusting for combat exposure (ΔR(2) ≥ .02, ps ≤ .001). The presence of ICs of injury or death, combat, military sexual trauma, health, leadership, and family (βs > .06, ps < .02) were unique correlates of distress. Results suggested that ICs about a wide range of topics should be addressed in postdeployment interventions.",Remaining

The influence of recanalization on DST outcome has not yet been thoroughly evaluated.	Thirty-seven consecutive patients with DST were prospectively examined. Neurological deficits were graded with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on hospital admission and discharge. Functional outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) on hospital discharge and after 12 months. All patients were treated with intravenous heparin in the acute stage of illness, followed by oral anticoagulation for 12 months. Imaging follow-up with MR angiography and, in a few cases, with CT or conventional angiography was performed on hospital discharge and after 6 and 12 months.	Twelve-month functional outcome was excellent in 89% of patients with an mRS of 0 or 1. A recanalization rate of 60% was already observed on hospital discharge (22+/-6 days); thereafter, recanalization rates increased insignificantly. Early recanalization was not related to NIHSS score on hospital discharge or an mRS of 0 on discharge or after 12 months.	We found a high frequency of early recanalization but without influence on clinical outcome parameters. Frequent imaging follow-ups in DST are not useful because they provide no information on patient outcome.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Between April 1994 and August 2000, 450 patients (270 men; mean age 70.2 years, range 27-89) had stents implanted to treat 472 cervical carotid artery stenoses. Over half (257, 57%) of the patients were symptomatic. A variety of stents were implanted percutaneously after predilation of the lesion; a third of the patients received glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa inhibitors intraprocedurally in addition to a standard oral antiplatelet regimen (aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel). Occurrence and management of neurological complications within the 30-day periprocedural period were reviewed.	There were 14 (3.1%) transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), 10 (2.2%) minor strokes, and 3 (0.7%) major strokes. Among 6 (1.3%) procedure-related deaths, 4 had neurological causes. The total stroke and death rate was 4.2% (n = 19). All the TIAs, 4 of which occurred between 1 and 14 days poststenting, were treated medically, as were the minor strokes, 3 of which occurred >24 hours after stenting. Only 2 minor stroke patients had mild residual upper extremity motor deficits. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy was administered in 5 cases (2 major strokes survivors and 3 patients who suffered a neurologically-related death); occlusions were identified in the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 3 and the distal MCA in 2. Angiographic improvement was noted in 4 (80%), but only the 2 (40%) with distal MCA occlusions did well clinically.	Neurological complications following carotid artery stenting are inevitable. The occurrence of minor strokes >24 hours following stenting may indicate a possible late embolic phenomenon, which warrants investigation. Likewise, the marginal efficacy of intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy demonstrates an inability to lyse embolic plaque and underscores the need for effective distal protection.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

A technical description and initial results.,"This study aimed to propose an alternative treatment for carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) using the balloon-assisted sinus coiling (BASC) technique and to describe this procedure in detail. Under general anesthesia, we performed the BASC procedure to treat five patients with traumatic CCF. Percutaneous access was obtained via the right femoral artery, and a 7F sheath was inserted, or alternatively, a bifemoral 6F approach was accomplished. A microcatheter was inserted into the cavernous sinus over a 0.014-inch microwire through the fistulous point; the microcatheter was placed distal from the fistula point, and a 'U-turn' maneuver was performed. Through the same carotid access, a compliant balloon was advanced to cross the point of the fistula and cover the whole carotid tear. Large coils were inserted using the microcatheter in the cavernous sinus. Coils filled the adjacent cavernous sinus, respecting the balloon. Immediate complete angiographic resolution was achieved, and an early angiographic control (mean = 2.6 months) indicated complete stability without recanalization. The clinical follow-up has been uneventful without any recurrence (mean = 15.2 months). An endovascular approach is optimal for direct CCF. Because the detachable balloon has been withdrawn from the market, covered stenting requires antiplatelet therapy and its patency is unconfirmed, but cavernous sinus coiling remains an excellent treatment option. Currently, there is no detailed description of the BASC procedure. We provide detailed angiograms with suitable descriptions of the exact fistula point, and venous drainage pathways. Familiarity with these devices makes this technique effective, easy and safe.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

This was a single-centre, single-arm prospective study, enrolling all patients with localised prostate cancer scheduled for RARP with five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function scores of >17, from July 2015 to September 2016. All patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. The demographics, perioperative, postoperative and complications data were evaluated. Potency recovery data were evaluated in particular and any sign/symptom of local allergy/intolerance to the ChiMe was recorded and evaluated.	In all, 140 patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. Applying the ChiMe was easy in almost all the cases, and did not compromise the safety of the procedure. None of the patients reported signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging.	In our experience, ChiMe applied on the NVBs after NS-RARP was feasible and safe, without compromising the duration, difficulty or complication rate of the 'standard' procedure.

We were able to resolve, with milliseconds temporal resolution, changes in activation patterns involving suspected epileptic foci and other brain regions in the epileptic network during spike and slow wave. Using summary maps (called SSWAS maps) which show the activation frequency of voxels, we found that suspected epileptic foci tend to be significantly active during this interval. SSWAS maps also enabled the detection of the epileptic foci in 4 of 5 patients where the conventional event-timing-based analysis failed to identify.	These findings demonstrated the efficacy of the method and the potential application of SSWAS maps to identify epileptic foci.	The method could help resolve activation changes during epileptic spike and could provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology of these changes.",Remaining

1236,9630769,Folia medica,Traumatic intracerebral hematomas--diagnostic and therapeutic problem.,A retrospective analysis was performed of 79 patients with hematomas treated surgically or conservatively. The surgical modality was most often opted for in the following cases: patients with hematomas exceeding 4 cm in diameter; patients with hematomas causing a pronounced dislocation of cerebral structures; patients with multiple hematomas that can be accessed through a bone flap. Hematomas smaller than 4 cm in diameter as well as those located in several brain regions were found to tend easily to resorption at the control computer tomography due to which we preferred treating them using conservative therapeutic methods. This therapeutic approach to the patients with hematomas is supported by the statistical analysis. Comparison of the groups of survivors and nonsurvivors shows that the former predominated in cases of hematomas located in the frontal lobe; the latter are predominant when the hematomas are located in the temporal lobe of the brain. There was no difference between the groups of surgically and conservatively treated patients with respect to the outcome of the disease if it is improvement or death. In the group of patients who underwent conservative treatment there was a predominance of those patients that showed no improvement of the initial state. The following conclusions can be made: 1. Surgical treatment is most often administered to patients with hematomas greater than 4 cm in diameter and hematomas causing dislocation of the cerebral structures. 2. The patients at highest risk for adverse outcome are those with temporal location of the hematoma.,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Thirty-two patients (mean age 47 years) with histologically proven or suspected high grade glioma (n = 12) or metastatic brain lesions (n = 20) were prospectively examined by MR imaging. After the administration of gadolinium dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) the lesions were imaged with a T1-weighted MT-fast low angle shot (FLASH) pulse sequence and with a conventional T1-weighted SE sequence without MT saturation.	The mean CNR of enhancing lesions on T1-weighted MT-FLASH was 15 +/- 5 compared to 11 +/- 4 on SE images, representing a significant (p < .01) improvement. The mean tumor diameter of malignant gliomas was significantly (p < .01) larger measured on T1-weighted MT-FLASH images compared to those obtained from T1-weighted SE images and were comparable for metastatic lesions. Lesion conspicuity and delineation were improved in 50% of patients with high grade gliomas and in 35% of patients with brain metastases. Lesion conspicuity was markedly improved in the posterior fossa. Additional contrast enhancing lesions were detected in 10% of patients with metastases on MT-FLASH images.	It is concluded that contrast-enhanced MT-FLASH images may improve lesion detection and delineation in the planning process of radiosurgery in patients with intracranial high grade gliomas or metastases or even alter the treatment approach.",Remaining

However, few studies have clearly discussed the protective effects and potential mechanism of PIP in different neurological diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of PIP against 3-nitropropioninc acid (3-NP) induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in animals.Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered control group, received normal saline (p.o.). Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg.b.wt., i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received PIP (10 mg/kg.b.wt., p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP injection. Upon termination of treatment schedule, behavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes. The brain striatal tissue was used for the estimation of monoamine oxidase activity and serotonin level. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by GFAP immunostaining.Results: Our results showed that 3-NP induced behavioral impairments are attenuated by PIP co-treatment. Next, the extent of neuronal loss and astrocytes activation was reduced in the striatal brain region in PIP treated rats. Finally, it was observed that PIP alleviated the behavioral, biochemical, immunohistochemical and histological alterations.Conclusion: The results of the current study reveal the neuroprotective competency of PIP against Huntington disease like symptoms in rats.",Animal-drug-intervention

Transient global ischemia was produced by four vessel-occlusion, the occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries following the electrocautherization of the vertebral arteries. 3mg/kg of PPS or 300IU/kg of dalteparin was administered i.v. immediately after 7min-occlusion/reperfusion. Seven days after the operation, the animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and paraffinized coronal brain sections measuring 6microm in thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Neuronal damage was then estimated as a ratio of the number of degenerated neurons to that of both the surviving and degenerated neurons in three distinct area of the CA1 subfield. The ratio of neuronal death increased with the length of the occlusion-time, at 5, 7 and 10min. Both PPS and dalteparin significantly inhibited the neuronal damage induced by 7min-occlusion. These results demonstrated that both PPS and dalteparin could thus protect brain neurons against ischemia/reperfusion-induced damage thus suggesting that they may be potentially useful therapeutic agents for acute ischemic stroke.",Animal-drug-intervention

1242,2744979,The International journal of social psychiatry,A normality for us without confinement for them: notes on the associations of families of the mentally ill.,"Associations of families of the mentally ill arose in Italy in the early 1980s mainly in the country's northern and central regions. They denounced the inadequacies of an extramural service conceived of as an out-patient clinic filling the void left by the shutting down of asylums. The positions elaborated by these associations focus on four main themes: the distribution of the 'burden of care' for the ill between services and families; the ill-conceived interpretation of the families' needs owing to the professional's alleged tendency to 'point the finger of guilt' at the families themselves; the demand for greater power in regard to decisions made by the services; the interaction with the rights and liberties of the mentally ill. Two different ranges of problems are discussed. First, there is the conflict within the family between the interests and rights of its income-producing and its 'dependent' members. This conflict points not to a loss but to an overload of functions shifted to the family at a time of rising expectations for the satisfaction of needs. It therefore calls for services of a new kind, i.e. services capable of making these conflicting interests and rights compatible.

1243,15680341,Brain research,The effect of central cholinergic and noradrenergic denervation on hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth and apoptosis-like reactivity in the rat.,"In this study, the effect of intraseptal injection of specific cholinotoxin 192-IgG saporin (SAP) +/- intraperitoneal injection of N-[chloroethyl]-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) (noradrenergic fiber neurotoxin) was examined in rat hippocampus. Medial septal lesions resulted not only in selective cholinergic denervation of hippocampus (Medial septal lesion + ganglionectomy; SAP + Gx) but also in hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth (IG) of adrenergic fibers (Medial septal lesion + sham ganglionectomy; SAP + IG). Saporin-induced septal lesions produced a significant reduction in hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity in all tested groups (SAP + IG +/- DSP-4 and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4), and an increase in noradrenaline concentration in the SAP + IG group. Visualization of noradrenergic fibers by histofluorescence revealed a mixture of fine and thick varicosities in the SAP + IG but only fine fibers in control and SAP + Gx animals. SAP + IG + DSP-4 lesions produced significant reduction in noradrenaline concentration in all groups with a concomitant decrease in visualization of central noradrenergic fibers in dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Treatment of SAP + IG animals with DSP-4 left mostly thick fibers, probably derived from peripheral sympathetic ingrowth. No fluorescence was seen in either the control + DSP-4 or SAP + Gx + DSP-4 animals. Apoptotic-like changes, using in situ oligonucleotide ligation techniques, were also assessed. Proapoptotic changes were seen in the SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 group as compared to CON +/- DSP-4 groups. SAP + IG regardless of DSP-4 treatment protected hippocampal cells from apoptotic cell death when compared to positive control and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 groups. In summary, elevated noradrenaline concentration following specific cholinergic denervation probably reflects compensatory hippocampal ingrowth originating from the peripheral sympathetic system which may be responsible for neuroprotective effects, i.e., antiapoptosis-like effect. Since cholinergic and noradrenergic systems are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive function, knowing how these neurotransmitters work after specific lesions may be of importance as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease and as a potential target for Alzheimer's disease drug therapies.",Animal-other
1244,28765170,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,Herpes simplex virus type 1 and Alzheimer's disease: possible mechanisms and signposts.,"Support for the concept that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), when present in the brains of apolipoprotein E-ε4 carriers, is a major risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing steadily, with over 120 publications providing direct or indirect evidence relevant to the hypothesis. No articles have contested the concept, apart from 3 published 13-18 yr ago. This review describes very recent studies on the role of HSV1 but refers also to older studies that provide background for some lesser-known related topics not covered in other recent reviews; these include the relevance of herpes simplex encephalitis and of epilepsy to AD, the action of IFN, and the possible relevance of the different types of DNA damage to AD-in particular, those caused by HSV1-and mechanisms of repair of damage. New epidemiologic data supporting previous studies on mild cognitive impairment and progression to AD are reviewed, as are those examining the relationship between total infectious burden (additive seropositivity to various microbes) and cognition/AD. The latter indicates the involvement of HSV1 and cytomegalovirus (and the necessity of taking into account any marked differences in sensitivity of antibody detection). Recent studies that provide further support for the occurrence of repeated reactivation of latent HSV1 in the brain in AD pathogenesis are also discussed.-Itzhaki, R. F.

Twenty female patients who underwent GONB with lidocaine were included in the study. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale (RLSSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and headache diary results before and after the treatment of the patients were compared.	We included 20 patients (all females) in our study. The mean age was 35.80 ± 8.82 years (range 24-50). After GON blockade, the number of days with pain (p < 0.001), duration of pain (p < 0.001), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score (p < 0.001) were significantly lower than before. After GONB, BDI (p = 0.007), BAI (p = 0.022), ISI (p = 0.009), and PSQI (p = 0.026) scores were significantly lower than before. After GONB, sleep quality was better than before (p = 0.035).

Thirty rats were randomly divided into three groups. Morris water maze was used to investigate the learning and memory functions, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze the levels of Klotho and IGF-1. Klotho and IGF-1 levels in the model group were lower than those in other 2 groups. Morris water maze test showed that the model group had longer escape latency times and shorter step platform times compared to other groups. Line correlation model demonstrated that Klotho level was positively correlated with IGF-1 level in rats with dementia (P= 0. 029). The levels of Klotho and IGF-1 both reduced at hippocampus in rats with dementia model, suggesting that it may be a close relationship between Klotho and IGF-1 in the pathogenesis of dementia.",Animal-other

The T1-weighted images showed a loss of the hyperintense signal of the posterior pituitary and thickening of the pituitary stalk. DDAVP was started with the diagnosis of lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis (LINH). Three months later, she complained of right visual acuity loss. MRI revealed right optic nerve swelling, compatible with the diagnosis of the retrobulbar optic neuritis. She had two other such episodes in the next 3 months. She developed a transient oculomotor and abducens nerve palsies as well. Each time the symptoms disappeared with corticosteroid therapy. The pituitary stalk became normal in size 6 months later. LINH and recurrent optic neuritis occurred in a short duration. Accordingly, a common causative background is suspected. Since the auto-immune process has been hypothesized as a cause of optic neuritis, our case may present further clinical evidence to support the hypothesis of an auto-immune mechanism for LINH.",Human-case-report

We sought to investigate whether OSA increases the incidence of a composite of stroke or coronary heart disease (CHD) in women, and the role of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on this association.	This was a prospective, observational study conducted in two Spanish teaching hospitals between 1998 and 2007. Consecutive women referred for suspected OSA and free of previous stroke and CHD were analyzed. Women with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) less than 10 comprised the control group, and those with an AHI greater than or equal to 10 were diagnosed with OSA and classified as CPAP-treated (adherence ≥ 4 h/d) or untreated (adherence < 4 h/d or not prescribed). The follow-up ended in December 2010.	A total of 967 women were studied (median follow-up, 6.8 yr; interquartile range, 5.2-8.2). The untreated OSA group showed a greater incidence rate of the composite outcome than the control group (2.19 vs. 0.54 per 100 person-years; P < 0.0005). Compared with the control group, the fully adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome incidence were 2.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-5.62) for the untreated OSA group, and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.43-1.95) for the CPAP-treated group. When the type of cardiovascular event was separately assessed, untreated OSA showed a stronger association with incident stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.44; 95% CI, 1.46-28.3) than with CHD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 0.76-4.09).	In women, untreated OSA is associated with increased incidence of serious cardiovascular outcomes, particularly incident stroke.

1250,29040911,Medical image analysis,A deep learning model integrating FCNNs and CRFs for brain tumor segmentation.,"Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation is a critical component in cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and treatment outcome evaluation. Build upon successful deep learning techniques, a novel brain tumor segmentation method is developed by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in a unified framework to obtain segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency. We train a deep learning based segmentation model using 2D image patches and image slices in following steps: 1) training FCNNs using image patches; 2) training CRFs as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) using image slices with parameters of FCNNs fixed; and 3) fine-tuning the FCNNs and the CRF-RNN using image slices. Particularly, we train 3 segmentation models using 2D image patches and slices obtained in axial, coronal and sagittal views respectively, and combine them to segment brain tumors using a voting based fusion strategy. Our method could segment brain images slice-by-slice, much faster than those based on image patches. We have evaluated our method based on imaging data provided by the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) 2013, BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method could build a segmentation model with Flair, T1c, and T2 scans and achieve competitive performance as those built with Flair, T1, T1c, and T2 scans.",Remaining
1251,25833032,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",Cognitive impairment following consumption of alcohol with and without energy drinks.,"The aim of this study was to assess the relative effects of alcohol mixed with energy drink (AmED) versus alcohol alone on cognitive performance across the ascending and descending breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) limb using doses similar to real-world intake.	Using a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 19 participants completed 4 sessions where they received: (i) placebo, (ii) alcohol, (iii) AmED 500 ml energy drink (ED), and (iii) AmED 750 ml ED. Performance on measures of psychomotor function (Compensatory Tracking Task [CTT]), information processing (Digit Symbol Substitution Task [DSST]; Inspection Time Task [ITT]), and response inhibition (Brief Stop-Signal Task [Brief SST]) was assessed at ~0.05% ascending BrAC, ~0.08% peak BrAC, and ~0.05% descending BrAC.	The ITT and Brief SST showed no differential effect of AmED versus alcohol (gs < 0.30 and gs < 0.36, respectively). Moderate magnitude improvements in alcohol-induced impairment of CTT and DSST performance were observed after AmED versus alcohol on the descending BrAC limb (gs > 0.45 and gs > 0.37, respectively). A moderate magnitude decrease in DSST errors was also observed after AmED relative to alcohol at 0.050% ascending target BrAC (gs > 0.43).	Changes in cognitive function after AmED administration were dependent on the degree of intoxication, BrAC curve limb, and ED volume. Co-administration of ED doses which matched (500 ml) and exceeded (500 ml) maximum daily intake guidelines with alcohol decreased impairment of psychomotor function and global information processing after alcohol consumption. These results cannot be necessarily interpreted to suggest that people are less impaired after AmED, as behavior is the result of coordination of multiple cognitive functions, and reduced impairment on one aspect of cognition may not translate into global improvements.",Remaining

We enrolled Japanese spinal cord injury patients with cystometrically confirmed neurogenic detrusor overactivity who experienced urinary incontinence at least once a week either because they were refractory to anticholinergics or had to discontinue treatment because of adverse events. Patients received 200 units of onabotulinumtoxinA injected into the bladder wall after a 2-week washout of anticholinergics, and urodynamic variables were assessed before and 1 month after injection. Catheterization and urinary incontinence data, as well as International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form scores, were assessed before injection and every month thereafter until the cessation of treatment effects.	The study enrolled 19 patients (13 men, six women, age range 22-67 years). One month after injection, the mean number of urinary incontinence episodes decreased from 4.3 to 1.5 times/day (P = 0.004), and the maximum cystometric capacity increased from 100 mL to 296 mL (P = 0.0004).

1257,11593032,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Specific treatment of autoimmunity with recombinant invariant chains in which CLIP is replaced by self-epitopes.,"The invariant chain (Ii) binds to newly synthesized MHC class II molecules with the CLIP region of Ii occupying the peptide-binding groove. Here we demonstrate that recombinant Ii proteins with the CLIP region replaced by antigenic self-epitopes are highly efficient in activating and silencing specific T cells in vitro and in vivo. The Ii proteins require endogenous processing by antigen-presenting cells for efficient T cell activation. An Ii protein encompassing the epitope myelin basic protein amino acids 84-96 (Ii-MBP84-96) induced the model autoimmune disease experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) with a higher severity and earlier onset than the peptide. When applied in a tolerogenic manner, Ii-MBP84-96 abolished antigen-specific T cell proliferation and suppressed peptide-induced EAE more effectively than peptide alone. Importantly, i.v. administration of Ii proteins after EAE induction completely abrogated the disease, whereas peptides only marginally suppressed disease symptoms. Ii fusion proteins are thus more efficient than peptide in modulating CD4(+) T cell-mediated autoimmunity, documenting their superior qualities for therapeutic antigen delivery in vivo.",Animal-drug-intervention

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of aminocaproic acid (AMICAR), an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, on all hemorrhagic complications of ECMO including intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In 1990, 49 neonates and 5 older children received ECMO therapy. None of these patients received AMICAR. In 1991, 51 neonates and 5 older children received ECMO. Forty-two of these patients who were considered to be at high risk for bleeding complications (preexisting or anticipated surgical procedures, preexisting ICH, or profound hypoxia, acidosis, coagulopathy, or prematurity) were given AMICAR. The remaining 14 low-risk neonates did not receive AMICAR, and for purposes of analysis were combined with the 1990 group. AMICAR was administered just prior to or after cannulation (100 mg/kg, intravenously) and was infused continuously at 30 mg/kg/h until decannulation. Except for the addition of AMICAR, the ECMO protocol was identical for these two patient groups. Patients who received AMICAR had significantly less bleeding while on ECMO (P = .03) and required fewer blood transfusions (P = .01) than patients not receiving AMICAR. This difference was most significant in the congenital diaphragmatic hernia and cardiac subgroups (P = .0001) and was not significant in the meconium aspiration subgroup (P = .1). The incidence of ICH in the neonatal subgroup was also significantly reduced with no patient on AMICAR developing a new or extending a preexisting ICH (P = .007). Reexploration of the cannulation site for bleeding was also reduced in the AMICAR-treated group but the difference failed to reach statistical significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Pelvic ischemia is a complication of the technique, but reports vary as to the rate and severity. This study reports our experience with IIA embolization and compares the results to those of other published series. The vascular unit database of the Leicester Royal Infirmary was used to identify patients who had undergone IIA coil embolization prior to EVAR. Data were collected from hospital case notes and by telephone interviews. Thirty-eight patients were identified; 29 of these were contactable by telephone. A literature search was performed for other studies of IIA embolization and the results were pooled. In this series buttock claudication occurred in 55% (16 of 29 patients) overall: in 52% of unilateral embolizations (11 of 21) and 63% of bilateral embolizations (5 of 8). New erectile dysfunction occurred in 46% (6 of 13 patients) overall: in 38% of unilateral embolizations (3 of 8) and 60% of bilateral embolizations (3 of 5).

Buttock claudication occurred in 28% overall (178 of 634 patients): in 31% of unilateral embolizations (99 of 322) and 35% of bilateral embolizations (34 of 98) (p = 0.46, Fisher's exact test). New erectile dysfunction occurred in 17% overall (27 of 159 patients): in 17% of unilateral embolizations (16 of 97) and 24% of bilateral embolizations (9 of 38) (p = 0.33). We conclude that buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction are frequent complications of IIA embolization and patients should be counseled accordingly.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

1266,12570354,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,Prodromal frontal/executive dysfunction predicts incident dementia in Parkinson's disease.,"To identify the cognitive characteristics predictive of incident dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD), we examined the baseline neuropsychological profiles of 18 initially non-demented patients with PD who met diagnostic criteria for dementia (PDD) at one-year follow-up. PDD participants' baseline neuropsychological test scores were compared to the baseline performance of 18 patients with PD who did not meet criteria for dementia at one-year follow-up (PDND) and 18 normal controls (NC). The three groups were matched on baseline demographic and disease variables. Relative to the PDND group, the incident PDD participants demonstrated significantly poorer performance on digits backward (Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised), word list learning and recognition (California Verbal Learning Test), and perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Each of these baseline neuropsychological variables exhibited adequate diagnostic classification accuracy in predicting PDD and PDND group membership at follow-up. These results suggest that subtle frontal/executive dysfunction is evident during the immediate PDD prodrome and may be of prognostic value in identifying PD patients at risk for dementia. Accordingly, neuropsychological evaluation may facilitate early identification of PDD and thereby inform appropriate dispositional planning.",Remaining
1267,32665027,Acta neuropathologica communications,The unfolded protein response is activated in the olfactory system in Alzheimer's disease.,"Olfactory dysfunction is an early and prevalent symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the olfactory bulb is a nexus of beta-amyloid plaque and tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during early AD progression. To mitigate the accumulation of misfolded proteins, an endoplasmic reticulum stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) occurs in the AD hippocampus. However, chronic UPR activation can lead to apoptosis and the upregulation of beta-amyloid and tau production. Therefore, UPR activation in the olfactory system could be one of the first changes in AD. In this study, we investigated whether two proteins that signal UPR activation are expressed in the olfactory system of AD cases with low or high amounts of aggregate pathology. We used immunohistochemistry to label two markers of UPR activation (p-PERK and p-eIF2α) concomitantly with neuronal markers (NeuN and PGP9.5) and pathology markers (beta-amyloid and tau) in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex and the CA1 region of the hippocampus in AD and normal cases. We show that UPR activation, as indicated by p-PERK and p-eIF2α expression, is significantly increased throughout the olfactory system in AD cases with low (Braak stage III-IV) and high-level (Braak stage V-VI) pathology. We further show that UPR activation occurs in the mitral cells and in the anterior olfactory nucleus of the olfactory bulb where tau and amyloid pathology is abundant. However, UPR activation is not present in neurons when they contain NFTs and only rarely occurs in neurons containing diffuse tau aggregates. We conclude that UPR activation is prevalent in all regions of the olfactory system and support previous findings suggesting that UPR activation likely precedes NFT formation. Our data indicate that chronic UPR activation in the olfactory system might contribute to the olfactory dysfunction that occurs early in the pathogenesis of AD.",Remaining
1268,23087000,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Dedifferentiation of neurons and astrocytes by oncogenes can induce gliomas in mice.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans. Here we show that gliomas can originate from differentiated cells in the central nervous system (CNS), including cortical neurons. Transduction by oncogenic lentiviral vectors of neural stem cells (NSCs), astrocytes, or even mature neurons in the brains of mice can give rise to malignant gliomas. All the tumors, irrespective of the site of lentiviral vector injection (the initiating population), shared common features of high expression of stem or progenitor markers and low expression of differentiation markers. Microarray analysis revealed that tumors of astrocytic and neuronal origin match the mesenchymal GBM subtype. We propose that most differentiated cells in the CNS upon defined genetic alterations undergo dedifferentiation to generate a NSC or progenitor state to initiate and maintain the tumor progression, as well as to give rise to the heterogeneous populations observed in malignant gliomas.",Animal-other

However, it is unclear whether co-use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and/or cannabis is associated with higher levels of nicotine dependence than cigarette-only use. We investigated the relationship between cigarette/nicotine dependence and co-use of tobacco and cannabis among 4 groups of cigarette smokers aged 18-35: cigarette-only smokers, cigarette-e-cigarette (CIG-ECIG) co-users, cigarette-cannabis (CIG-CAN) co-users, and cigarette-e-cigarette-cannabis (CIG-ECIG-CAN) co-users.	Data were from a 2018 cross-sectional survey based on a national convenience sample of smokers aged 18-35 (n = 315). Cigarette/nicotine dependence was measured by the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and e-cigarette dependence was measured by the Penn State E-cigarette Dependence Index. Bivariate analyses examined sociodemographic and tobacco/other substance use characteristics by co-use status and multivariable linear regression assessed the relationship between co-use and nicotine dependence.	In the sample, 27.6% were cigarette-only smokers, 24.8% were CIG-ECIG, 27.6% were CIG-CAN, and 20.0% were CIG-ECIG-CAN co-users. Significant differences were observed in sociodemographic and tobacco/other substance use characteristics by co-use status. E-cigarette co-users had low e-cigarette dependence, but moderate FTND scores. In adjusted analyses, only CIG-ECIG co-use was associated with higher FTND scores compared to cigarette-only smoking. However, CIG-ECIG and CIG-ECIG-CAN co-use were associated with higher FTND scores compared to CIG-CAN co-use.	Co-use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes was associated with greater nicotine dependence among smokers aged 18-35. Additional research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of these relationships and inform prevention efforts.",Remaining

By light microscopy the tumours were composed of agranular cells and generally PAS negative cytoplasm. The immunofluorescence technique revealed the presence of immunoreactive FSH (beta-subunit) alone in two cases, of both FSH and LH in six cases with immunoreactive beta endorphin in two of them. By electron microscopy, the cells contained an often dilated moderately or well developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, secretory granules measuring 150 nm to 200 nm which varied in electron density, and numerous microtubules. Basal plasma FSH and LH levels were simultaneously elevated in two cases; FSH levels alone were elevated in two cases; in three cases, both FSH and LH plasma values were normal. FSH and LH intratumour concentrations were simultaneously elevated in five cases; FSH alone was elevated in two cases. In all cases, the concentrations of the other hormones were negligible, except in two cases where beta endorphin concentration was elevated. The comparison of the immunocytochemical findings, the hormonal plasma levels and intratumour concentrations showed a good relationship between the immunoreactivity of the tumour and the intratumour RIA. The gonadotropic adenoma is uncommon but not rare. Its diagnosis is possible if immunocytochemical techniques are applied.",Remaining
1272,37660045,Translational psychiatry,Brain mediators of biased social learning of self-perception in social anxiety disorder.,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by an excessive fear of social evaluation and a persistently negative view of the self. Here we test the hypothesis that negative biases in brain responses and in social learning of self-related information contribute to the negative self-image and low self-esteem characteristic of SAD. Adult participants diagnosed with social anxiety (N = 21) and matched controls (N = 23) rated their performance and received social feedback following a stressful public speaking task. We investigated how positive versus negative social feedback altered self-evaluation and state self-esteem and used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to characterize brain responses to positive versus negative feedback. Compared to controls, participants with SAD updated their self-evaluation and state self-esteem significantly more based on negative compared to positive social feedback. Responses in the frontoparietal network correlated with and mirrored these behavioral effects, with greater responses to positive than negative feedback in non-anxious controls but not in participants with SAD. Responses to social feedback in the anterior insula and other areas mediated the effects of negative versus positive feedback on changes in self-evaluation. In non-anxious participants, frontoparietal brain areas may contribute to a positive social learning bias. In SAD, frontoparietal areas are less recruited overall and less attuned to positive feedback, possibly reflecting differences in attention allocation and cognitive regulation. More negatively biased brain responses and social learning could contribute to maintaining a negative self-image in SAD and other internalizing disorders, thereby offering important new targets for interventions.",Remaining

This framework is used to review literature from the past decade on access to health care and health promotion for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Review of the literature indicates an emerging evidence base for health promotion programs for persons with IDD. Research in health care and health promotion access requires improvements in surveillance and measurement of quality of life, as well as increased participation of persons with IDD and their families in its implementation. While international guidelines for primary health care have been developed for people with IDD, US guidelines are specialty focused and address specific conditions. Despite its recognized importance, there is surprisingly little information on training programs for health care providers to improve care of persons with IDD. Financing of health care continues to threaten access to comprehensive care for persons with IDD, particularly regarding coordination of care and availability of providers who accept Medicaid patients. Community-based sources of health care have been slow to emerge, and there is clear need for assumption of responsibility for providing care to persons with IDD. Future US policy should include consideration of environmental factors in health care access.",Non-systematic-review

We investigated an A --> G substitution polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of exon 8 (E8) of DRD2 with allele frequencies of f(G) = 0.295 - 0.329. No significant association of the DRD2 genotype or allele frequencies with alcoholism was found in an association study including 283 alcoholics and 146 non-alcoholic controls. However, the frequent homozygous E8 A/A genotype with f(AA) = 0.47 - 0.48 was associated with increased anxiety and depression scores in alcoholics during the follow up after clinical detoxification treatment. In addition, E8 A/A was associated with increased suicide attempts and showed a tendency towards more severe withdrawal symptoms, early relapse and reduced responsiveness to the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine. Regression analysis revealed the DRD2 E8 genotype as the only significant factor determining withdrawal severity in female alcoholics. The findings suggest an influence of the DRD2 genotype on the neuropharmacological effects of chronic alcohol exposure and the clinical course of alcoholism.",Remaining

In a placebo-controlled 2X2 design, 7-14 year-olds (N = 95) in parallel pilot trials (depression N = 72; bipolar N = 23) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of Ω3 supplementation (1.4 g eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], 0.2 g docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], and 0.27 g other Ω3 per day); psychoeducational psychotherapy (PEP); their combination; or placebo (mainly oleic and linoleic acid) alone. Blood was drawn at baseline (N = 90) and endpoint (n = 65). Fatty acid levels were expressed as percent of total plasma fatty acids. Correlational and moderator/mediator analyses were done with SPSS Statistics 23.	At baseline: (1) DHA correlated negatively with alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (r = -0.23, p = 0.029); (2) Arachidonic acid (AA, Ω6) correlated negatively with global functioning (r = -0.24, p = 0.022); (3) Total Ω3 correlated negatively with age (r = -0.22, p = 0.036) and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.31, p = 0.006). Moderation: Baseline ALA moderated response to Ω3 supplementation: ALA levels above the sample mean (lower DHA) predicted significantly better placebo-controlled response (p = 0.04). Supplementation effects: Compared to placebo, 2 g Ω3 per day increased EPA blood levels sevenfold and DHA levels by half (both p < 0.001). Body weight correlated inversely with increased EPA (r = -0.52, p = 0.004) and DHA (r = -0.54, p = 0.003) and positively with clinical mood response. Mediation: EPA increase baseline-to-endpoint mediated placebo-controlled global function and depression improvement: the greater the EPA increase, the less the placebo-controlled Ω3 improvement.	Ω3 supplementation at 2 g/day increases blood levels substantially, more so in smaller children. A possible U-shaped response curve should be explored.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention
1276,11115331,Archives of general psychiatry,Increased neocortical neurofibrillary tangle density in subjects with Alzheimer disease and psychosis.,"Psychosis is common in patients with Alzheimer disease. While the relationship between psychosis and clinical variables has been examined frequently, few studies have examined the relationship between psychosis and the 2 major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease: neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. We characterized the occurrence of psychosis in relation to dementia severity and determined if subjects with Alzheimer disease and psychosis had a greater neurofibrillary tangle or senile plaque burden than subjects with Alzheimer disease and no psychosis.	One hundred nine subjects with Alzheimer disease were followed longitudinally with semistructured assessments in order to assign a Clinical Dementia Rating and determine whether psychosis was present. After the subjects died, their brains were obtained for histological examination. Analysis of variance was used to compare the densities of neurofibrillary tangles, total senile plaques, and cored senile plaques in subjects with psychosis vs subjects without psychosis, in several neocortical regions, the hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex.	Psychosis occurred commonly in Alzheimer disease, affecting 63% of subjects. The frequency of psychosis increased with increasing dementia severity. More importantly, we found that subjects with psychosis had a 2.3-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.9) greater density of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles than did subjects without psychosis. The increase was independent of dementia severity. No similar relationship with psychosis was seen for total senile plaques or cored senile plaques.	The increase in psychosis frequency that occurs with the progression of dementia severity and the independent association between psychosis and neurofibrillary tangle density suggest the possibility that some common underlying process or processes specific to Alzheimer disease may regulate both phenomena.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included a total of 79 patients with ADHD or ASDs and controls in the Van region of Turkey. The control group included subjects of matching age and sex with no ADHD, ASDs, or chronic disease and taking no vitamins. The hematological parameters of the patients, including MPV, vitamin B12, and vitamin D, were assessed. RESULTS The study included a total of 79 children and adolescents aged 2-18 years (32 females and 47 males). Of the patients, 36 were in the ADHD group, 18 in the ASDs group, and 25 in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in hematological parameters between the groups, but there were significant differences in terms of vitamin D and vitamin B12. The patient groups showed lower levels of vitamin B12 and vitamin D. In the ADHD group, there was a negative correlation between both vitamins and MPV (p<0.05). Partial correlation analysis of the ADHD group showed that MPV in particular was negatively correlated to vitamin D, and not to vitamin B12 (p: 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Both ADHD and ASDs may accompany increased risk for cardiovascular disease due to the presence of vitamin B12 and D deficiency and their own characteristics. Therefore, these disorders should be closely followed up.",Remaining

The ionic detergent N-lauryl-sarcosine (sarkosyl) effectively solubilizes natively folded proteins in brain tissue allowing the enrichment of detergent-insoluble protein aggregates from a wide range of neurodegenerative proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases. Human control and AD postmortem brain tissues were homogenized and sedimented by ultracentrifugation in the presence of sarkosyl to enrich detergent-insoluble protein aggregates including pathologic phosphorylated tau, the core component of neurofibrillary tangles in AD. Western blotting demonstrated the differential solubility of aggregated phosphorylated-tau and the detergent-soluble protein, Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA1) in control and AD brain. Proteomic analysis also revealed enrichment of β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, snRNP70 (U1-70K), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of AD brain compared to those of control, consistent with previous tissue fractionation strategies.

However, how the activity and neuroplasticity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) change after contextual morphine withdrawal conditioning and what factors determine this change remain to be determined. In this paper, using immunohistochemical and single-cell microinjection techniques, combining behavioral assay, we found that (1) contextual withdrawal conditioning increases the expression of c-Fos, but not Arc, in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (2) at the first day after conditioning, conditioned context has no influence on the expression of c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (3) at the 14th day after conditioning, conditioned context increases the expression of both c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (4) the inhibition of dendritic spines of the ACC or projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC attenuates the conditioned context-induced increase of Arc expression in the ACC and abolishes the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning. These results suggest that the ACC may exhibit a change in neuroplasticity at the 14th day after conditioning, and the dendritic spines of the ACC and the projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC are key determinants for conditioned context induced-increase in Arc expression in the ACC and the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning.",Animal-other

We prospectively enrolled adult patients with suspected TBM, and CSF specimens were analyzed for 18 cytokines/chemokines and soluble programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Enzyme-linked immunospot assays were performed on mononuclear cells from the CSF (CSF-MCs) and peripheral blood (PBMCs).

We have recently identified two families in which choroideremia is inherited with mental retardation and deafness. In family XL-62, an interstitial deletion in Xq21 is visible by cytogenetic analysis and two linked anonymous DNA markers, DXYS1 and DXS72, are deleted. In the second family, XL-45, an interstitial deletion was suspected on phenotypic grounds but could not be confirmed by high-resolution cytogenetic analysis. We used phenol-enhanced reassociation of 48,XXXX DNA in competition with excess XL-45 DNA to generate a library of cloned DNA enriched for sequences that might be deleted in XL-45. Two of the first 83 sequences characterized from the library were found to be deleted in probands from family XL-45 as well as from family XL-62.

The sample workup involved a single-step extraction of 1 mL plasma, buffered to pH 10, with heptane-isoamyl alcohol (98:2 v/v), then evaporation of the heptane phase and reconstitution of the residue in mobile phase. HPLC separation was carried out at on C(18) column using a mobile phase of 0.05 m dipotassium hydrogen orthophosphate (containing 0.3% v/v triethylamine) adjusted to pH 3.7 with orthophosphoric acid (700 mL), and acetonitrile (300 mL). Flow rate was 0.6 mL/min and the detection wavelength was 280 nm. Retention times were 2.6, 3.7 and 5.8 min for 9-hydroxy risperidone, risperidone and the internal standard, respectively. Linearity in spiked plasma was demonstrated from 2 to 100 ng/mL for both risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone (r > or = 0.999). Total imprecision was less than 13% (determined as co-efficient of variation) and the inaccuracy was less than 12% at spiked concentrations of 5 and 80 ng/mL. The limit of detection, determined as three times the baseline noise, was 1.5 ng/mL. Clinical application of the assay was demonstrated for analysis of post-dose (0.55-4.0 mg/day) samples from 28 paediatric patients (aged 6.9-17.9 years) who were taking risperidone orally for behavioural and emotional disorders.",Remaining
1289,16850255,Metabolic brain disease,Neurocircuitry of disgust and anxiety in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a positron emission tomography study.,"Disgust and fear are basic emotions that have different elicitors and expressions, and that appear to be mediated by different neurocircuits. Although obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is classified as an anxiety disorder, disgust may be involved in its pathogenesis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of disgust-inducing visual stimuli in OCD have suggested disorder specific alterations in brain activation during these tasks.	Subjects with OCD and healthy controls (HC) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) brain scanning after injection of H(2) (15)O. During PET, subjects either watched slides designed to evoke feelings of disgust (OCD = 5, HC = 11), expected the delivery of an electrical shock (OCD = 11, HC = 13), or rested (OCD = 11, HC = 14). After the anticipatory anxiety and resting tasks, anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal measures were obtained. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to analyze regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data.	Comparison of OCD subjects with controls on differences in rCBF across the disgust-inducing and resting tasks showed that OCD was characterized by greater rCBF in the left insula. In OCD the disgust-inducing task increased right lateral orbitofrontal cortex rCBF compared to resting, whereas in controls there was no difference in rCBF between these tasks. Anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal activity increased during anticipatory anxiety in both groups, and comparison of rCBF in OCD subjects with controls in anticipatory anxiety versus resting state also found no significant differences.	OCD may be characterized by a disruption in disgust processing, such that there is a decrease in appropriate disgust (such as that evoked by observing disgust in others) and an increase in inappropriate disgust (such as that evoked by contamination stimuli). The insula may play a particularly important role in mediating such putative disruptions. The sample studied here was small, and further work is required to determine whether disgust-induced activation patterns in OCD are more apparent in specific subtypes of this disorder, whether they are specific to OCD, and whether they are normalized by treatment.",Remaining

Participants' (N = 12) narratives were initially analyzed utilizing a grounded theory framework as 68 violent incidents were coded for perceived threat and coping levels. Coping strategies were examined from a Transactional Model of Stress and Coping perspective taking into account the context and severity of each violent exposure itself. A comprehensive assessment map was developed to plot and visually reveal participants (N = 12) overall contextualized coping responses. Overall 'coping zone' scores were generated to index perceived threat and coping responses associated with each violent incident described. These scores were then correlated with indicators of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Results indicated that urban children with less optimal coping zone scores across context have a greater likelihood of PTSD than do children who do not.,Remaining

We studied cognitive functioning in four domains at baseline and change over time in fifty-seven cognitively intact individuals from the EMIF-AD 90+ study. Predictors were Aβ status determined by [[18] F]-flutemetamol PET (normal = Aβ - vs. abnormal = Aβ+), cortical thickness in 34 regions and hippocampal volume. Mediation analyses were performed to test whether effects of Aβ on cognitive decline were mediated by atrophy of specific anatomical brain areas.	Subjects had a mean age of 92.7 ± 2.9 years, of whom 19 (33%) were Aβ+. Compared to Aβ-, Aβ+ individuals showed steeper decline on memory (β ± SE = -0.26 ± 0.09), and processing speed (β ± SE = -0.18 ± 0.08) performance over 1.5 years (P < 0.05). Furthermore, medial and lateral temporal lobe atrophy was associated with steeper decline in memory and language across individuals. Mediation analyses revealed that part of the memory decline observed in Aβ+ individuals was mediated through parahippocampal atrophy.	These results show that Aβ abnormality even in the oldest old with initially normal cognition is not part of normal aging, but is associated with a decline in cognitive functioning. Other pathologies may also contribute to decline in the oldest old as cortical thickness predicted cognitive decline similarly in individuals with and without Aβ pathology.",Remaining

Nevertheless, these modalities are often insufficient for achieving a definite diagnosis. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the combination of these tools.	The SPECT radiotracers [I]-N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) and meta-[I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) were used to research presynaptic dopaminergic projections (DAT SPECT) and myocardial adrenergic innervation (MIBG scintigraphy), respectively. PD patients (n=15; age: 61.5±13.6 years) and non-PD patients (n=19; age: 62.6±14.2 years) who underwent both tests were enrolled in this study. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were used to set the cutoff values of the specific binding ratio in DAT SPECT and the heart to mediastinum ratio in delayed scan in MIBG scintigraphy for differentiating PD from non-PD. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and test accuracy of the individual methods and also the combination of these two modalities.	When DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy were used individually, they showed mild accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD (DAT, 67.6%; MIBG, 67.6%). The combination of the two approaches using cutoff values of less than 3.24 for the specific binding ratio and less than 2.745 for the delayed heart to mediastinum ratio enabled more accurate differentiation between PD and non-PD. The accuracy of these indices in distinguishing PD from non-PD was 79.4%.	These results suggested that the combination of DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy may improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD.",Remaining

Double blind assessments were made at weeks 4, 7, 10, 18, 36, 62 and 114. Results are reported to one year. Clomipramine produced significant improvement in rituals, mood and social adjustment, but only in those patients who initially had depressed mood. The clomipramine effect was maximum from weeks 10 to 18 and diminished thereafter. On stopping clomipramine patients often relapsed and improved again on restarting the drug. Relaxation produced little change. Exposure produced significant lasting improvement in rituals, but less change in mood; improvement generalized to social adjustment at follow-up. Clomipramine plus exposure had a slight additive but not interactional effect. Clomipramine enhanced compliance both with exposure and with relaxation. Clomipramine is useful for compulsive ritualizers with depressed mood, but may need continuation for over a year and combination with exposure in vivo.

Protocol for a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study.","Perioperative sleep disorders (PSD) are an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD), which is a common complication after surgery. Elderly patients who undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) often experience perioperative sleep disorders (PSD). Dexamethasone, a medication that works by inhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-suprarenal cortical axis, can reduce the negative effects of surgical stress. The objective of this study was to determine whether intravenous administration of dexamethasone at the time of anesthesia induction could improve postoperative sleep quality in elderly patients, thereby indirectly reducing the risk of postoperative cognitive impairment and accelerating postoperative rehabilitation.	This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted at a single center. A sample size of 116 patients was determined through calculation, and these patients were randomly assigned to either the dexamethasone group (group D, n = 58) or the blank control group (group C, n = 58). On the day of surgery, the anesthesia nurse prepared either diluted dexamethasone or saline in advance, according to the patient's assigned group. The blinded anesthesiologist administered the medication during induction, and a dedicated person followed up with the patient for three consecutive postoperative days. All other aspects of care were managed equally between the two groups. The primary outcome measure was sleep quality, while secondary outcome measures included postoperative sleep time, postoperative delirium (POD), pain scores, and other complications. Relevant test measures were recorded for analysis.	This study aims to investigate the impact of intravenous dexamethasone on sleep quality and duration of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). If the findings of this study protocol are affirmative, it could enhance the sleep quality of elderly patients after surgery, thereby minimizing the risk of postoperative delirium (POD), and providing substantial evidence for the perioperative enhanced recovery management of elderly patients.

1302,36314672,Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology,Effects of woody plant encroachment by eastern redcedar on mosquito communities in Oklahoma.,"Woody plant encroachment into grasslands is occurring worldwide, affecting ecosystems in ways that likely influence mosquito-borne disease transmission. In the U.S. Great Plains, encroachment by eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) (ERC) may be expanding conducive habitat for mosquitoes and their hosts, but few studies have evaluated associations between ERC encroachment and West Nile virus (WNV). To test the hypotheses that mosquito abundance and WNV-infected mosquitoes increase with increasing ERC cover, we collected mosquitoes in 32 sites in Oklahoma reflecting various ERC encroachment stages. We found support for our first hypothesis, as mean abundance of Aedes albopictus increased significantly with ERC cover. However, Psorophora columbiae and Anopheles quadrimaculatus abundance decreased with increasing ERC. There was no significant association with ERC for other mosquito species. We could not test our second hypothesis due to low WNV prevalence, but the only detected WNV-infected pool of mosquitoes (Cx. tarsalis) was collected in ERC. Our results suggest ERC encroachment increases abundance of at least one medically important mosquito species, but further research is needed to clarify how encroachment affects ecology of the entire WNV disease system through changes to vector and host communities, vector-host interactions, and thus disease transmission and prevalence. Understanding relationships between woody plant encroachment and the nidus of infection for mosquito-borne diseases will be crucial for targeting public health efforts, including land management activities that limit and/or eradicate woody plant encroachment, particularly in areas with high levels of disease risk.",Remaining

Using longitudinal data from an epidemiological twin sample (N = 7463), this study tested whether resilience would act as a buffer for stressful life events (SLEs) against risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Resilience, demographics, and psychopathology were measured at Time 1 and recent SLEs and current MDD and GAD were measured at Time 2.	Final models, controlling for demographic covariates and Time 1 diagnosis, examined the impact of Time 1 resilience, recent SLEs, their interaction, and a three-way interaction adding sex on MDD and GAD.	The pattern of findings was the same for MDD and GAD, wherein main effects and two-way interactions of resilience and SLEs were significant, such that greater resilience was protective even in the context of high numbers of past-year SLEs. The three-way interaction was not significant, suggesting that the relationship between SLEs and resilience on psychopathology was the same for both men and women. Findings support the conceptualization of resilience as a buffer against the impact of future life stressors on common internalizing psychopathology. Longitudinal designs and trajectory-based studies that include recurring measures of SLEs could inform conceptualizations of resilience in the context of ongoing adversity and aid in developing interventions aimed at fostering healthy adaptation in the face of stressors.",Remaining

1307,18991888,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,An endocannabinoid hypothesis of drug reward and drug addiction.,"Pharmacologic treatment of drug and alcohol dependency has largely been disappointing, and new therapeutic targets and hypotheses are needed. There is accumulating evidence indicating a central role for the previously unknown but ubiquitous endocannabinoid physiological control system (EPCS) in the regulation of the rewarding effects of abused substances. Thus an endocannabinoid hypothesis of drug reward is postulated. Endocannabinoids mediate retrograde signaling in neuronal tissues and are involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission to suppress neurotransmitter release by the presynaptic cannabinoid receptors (CB-Rs). This powerful modulatory action on synaptic transmission has significant functional implications and interactions with the effects of abused substances. Our data, along with those from other investigators, provide strong new evidence for a role for EPCS modulation in the effects of drugs of abuse, and specifically for involvement of cannabinoid receptors in the neural basis of addiction. Cannabinoids and endocannabinoids appear to be involved in adding to the rewarding effects of addictive substances, including, nicotine, opiates, alcohol, cocaine, and BDZs. The results suggest that the EPCS may be an important natural regulatory mechanism for drug reward and a target for the treatment of addictive disorders.",Non-systematic-review

Formalin-fixed intact hemispheres from 9 CAA cases and 2 elderly controls were scanned at 3-tesla MRI, including a diffusion-weighted sequence. DTI measures (i.e., fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) and histopathology measures were obtained from 2 tracts: the anterior thalamic radiation and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.	FA was reduced in both tracts and MD was increased in cases with CAA compared to controls. Regional FA was significantly correlated with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, axonal density, and white matter microinfarcts. MD correlated significantly with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, and white matter microinfarcts, but not axonal density. FA and MD did not correlate with oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or gliosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that tissue rarefaction (β = -0.32 ± 0.12, p = 0.009) and axonal density (β = 0.25 ± 0.12, p = 0.04) were both independently associated with FA, whereas myelin density was independently associated with MD (β = -0.32 ± 0.12, p = 0.013). Finally, we found an association between increased MD in the frontal white matter and CAA severity in the frontal cortex (p = 0.035).	These results suggest that overall tissue loss, and in particular axonal and myelin loss, are major components underlying CAA-related alterations in DTI properties observed in living patients.

Weight gain and withdrawal symptoms were analyzed separately as predictors. To determine self-perceived reasons for relapse we created a questionnaire, which was answered by 132 relapsers.	Previous attempts to quit smoking and a low saliva cotinine concentration were significantly associated with abstinence in the nicotine-treated group. A trend toward higher abstinence rates was found among males and among subjects with a low nicotine dependency score. Logistic regression analysis showed higher success rates in subjects with the largest weight gain during the first weeks of quitting in contrast to higher relapse rates in subjects who had the greatest weight gain after 3 months. A high score on withdrawal symptoms was not predictive of relapse. Subjects with 'slips' had a markedly increased relapse rate. Craving for cigarettes was the most often self-reported (48%) reason for relapse.	The relation between weight gain, withdrawal scoring, and outcome seems rather complex.

The accuracy of indirect BP measurement is strongly influenced by the position of both patient and arm during the measurement. Acute stroke patients are often nursed in lateral decubitus positions. The effect of these alternating body positions in relation to affected body side on the outcome and reliability of BP readings in acute stroke patients is unknown.	An automatic oscillometric BP device was used. BP was measured in both arms in the (back) supine and both lateral decubitus positions.	In total, 54 consecutive acute stroke patients were included. Thirty-five patients had right-sided deficits and 19 patients had left-sided deficits. Supine BP readings were similar in the right and left arms regardless of side of deficit. Measurements of BP in the lateral decubitus positions resulted in significantly lower BP readings in the uppermost arm (around 12 mm Hg in both arms) and significantly higher readings in the right lowermost arm (around 6 mm Hg) compared to the supine position. This effect seemed less pronounced when the left lowermost arm was measured. There was no relation between change of BP readings in various lateral positions and side of stroke.	Alternating lateral decubitus positions according to nursing standards in acute stroke patients lead to a mean 18 mm Hg BP fluctuation. This may largely be explained by hydrostatic pressure effects, partly by anatomic factors in the left lowermost arm, but not by the side of stroke.",Remaining
1316,17469116,Annals of neurology,Pathological TDP-43 distinguishes sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with SOD1 mutations.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a common, fatal motor neuron disorder with no effective treatment. Approximately 10% of cases are familial ALS (FALS), and the most common genetic abnormality is superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) mutations. Most ALS research in the past decade has focused on the neurotoxicity of mutant SOD1, and this knowledge has directed therapeutic strategies. We recently identified TDP-43 as the major pathological protein in sporadic ALS. In this study, we investigated TDP-43 in a larger series of ALS cases (n = 111), including familial cases with and without SOD1 mutations.	Ubiquitin and TDP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed on postmortem tissue from sporadic ALS (n = 59), ALS with SOD1 mutations (n = 15), SOD-1-negative FALS (n = 11), and ALS with dementia (n = 26). Biochemical analysis was performed on representative cases from each group.	All cases of sporadic ALS, ALS with dementia, and SOD1-negative FALS had neuronal and glial inclusions that were immunoreactive for both ubiquitin and TDP-43. Cases with SOD1 mutations had ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions; however, no cases were immunoreactive for TDP-43. Biochemical analysis of postmortem tissue from sporadic ALS and SOD1-negative FALS demonstrated pathological forms of TDP-43 that were absent in cases with SOD1 mutations.	These findings implicate pathological TDP-43 in the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS. In contrast, the absence of pathological TDP-43 in cases with SOD1 mutations implies that motor neuron degeneration in these cases may result from a different mechanism, and that cases with SOD1 mutations may not be the familial counterpart of sporadic ALS.",Remaining
1317,28552947,PloS one,Relationship of mechanical impact magnitude to neurologic dysfunction severity in a rat traumatic brain injury model.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major brain injury type commonly caused by traffic accidents, falls, violence, or sports injuries. To obtain mechanistic insights about TBI, experimental animal models such as weight-drop-induced TBI in rats have been developed to mimic closed-head injury in humans. However, the relationship between the mechanical impact level and neurological severity following weight-drop-induced TBI remains uncertain. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the relationship between physical impact and graded severity at various weight-drop heights.	The acceleration, impact force, and displacement during the impact were accurately measured using an accelerometer, a pressure sensor, and a high-speed camera, respectively. In addition, the longitudinal changes in neurological deficits and balance function were investigated at 1, 4, and 7 days post TBI lesion. The inflammatory expression markers tested by Western blot analysis, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, beta-amyloid precursor protein, and bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X, in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were investigated at 1 and 7 days post-lesion.	Gradations in impact pressure produced progressive degrees of injury severity in the neurological score and balance function. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all inflammatory expression markers were increased at 1 and 7 days post-impact injury when compared to the sham control rats. The severity of neurologic dysfunction and induction in inflammatory markers strongly correlated with the graded mechanical impact levels.	We conclude that the weight-drop-induced TBI model can produce graded brain injury and induction of neurobehavioral deficits and may have translational relevance to developing therapeutic strategies for TBI.",Animal-other

The prevalence of CI was 46.20% and positive associations were found for age, gender, level of education, subjective memory complaints, instrumental activities of daily living, reading habits and frequency of leisure activities. In the logistic regression, modelled CI was associated with older age, gender (49.12% women, 39.66% men), instrumental activities of daily living, and reading habits.	Almost half of the adults aged 50+ years attending primary care centres with subjective memory complaints were affected by CI.

1320,6619955,Journal of neurosurgical sciences,Metabolic changes in the hippocampus after prolonged epileptic discharge.,"Sustained epileptic seizures were induced in cats by means of penicillin (PCN). After a three hour period tissue from the archicortex was removed, frozen, and extracted for metabolic studies. The concentration of ATP, ADP, AMP, phosphocreatine, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate, glutamate and aspartate were determined. There was a 50% decrease in phosphocreatine concentration, a slight decrease in the level of ATP and a slight increase in the levels of ADP and AMP. There was a decrease in the total adenine nucleotide and the ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios. The absence of a significant change in adenylate energy charge potential reflects the remarkable ability of the brain to stabilize its energy state even after intense seizure activity. A reflection of increased glycolysis is the presence of decreased glucose (nearly 50%), and increased lactate, concentrations. The metabolic changes observed in the archicortex are comparable to those observed by others in the neocortex, indicating perhaps the relative metabolic uniformity of these two types of cortex.",Animal-other

Subjects were 68 45- to 85-year-old, highly stressed care-givers to spouses with Alzheimer's disease. Results indicate that of the four operationalizations, Satisfaction with Support was the only significant predictor of depression and general psychopathology. The set of four support variables showed the strongest relationship to depression level, next strongest to general psychopathology, and least to physical health. The satisfaction with nine social support dimensions related differentially to the types of adjustment.

1323,31707936,Eating disorders,Changes in meal-related anxiety predict treatment outcomes in an intensive family-based treatment program for adolescents with anorexia nervosa.,"Meal-related anxiety in individuals with eating disorders is associated with reduced caloric intake and persisting eating-disordered behaviors, which may reduce the likelihood of attaining or sustaining remission. The current study is the first to examine changes in meal-related anxiety as a predictor of outcomes in the context of a family-based partial hospitalization program. A sample of 51 adolescents with anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia rated anxiety before and after all treatment meals using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS). Regression analyses suggested that participants experiencing a greater reduction in meal anxiety endorsed fewer eating disordered symptoms on the EDE at the end of treatment. Reductions in meal anxiety did not predict EBW at end of treatment, which could be because family-based treatment (FBT) supports adequate food intake regardless of meal anxiety (i.e., parents ensure food intake). Findings suggest that reductions in meal-related anxiety may be an important predictor of outcomes in family-based interventions, and future research is needed to examine if directly targeting meal anxiety may enhance outcomes.",Remaining

The results presented here are those involving amblyopia induced by strabismus or anisometropia.	A random selection of primary schools provided a sample that included 49 schools with 6541 children in Grades 1 and 6. Examinations of the eyes of 96%, of these children were conducted doing visual acuity screening to 0.5. All 6292 children had an external eye examination. All children failing the visual acuity test had a complete eye examination.	Amblyopia was found in 0.92%, strabismic amblyopia in 0.48%, anisometropic amblyopia in 0.44% and strabismus with or without amblyopia was seen in 0.9%. There was statistically significantly (p<0.05) more amblyopia in 11-12 year olds (Grade 6) when compared with the 6-7 year olds (Grade 1). This difference was only found among the strabismic children.	When compared to Europe or North America the prevalence of strabismic amblyopia is lower, whereas anisometropic amblyopia occurs with approximately the same frequency. The increase of strabismic amblyopia in the older children indicates a development of amblyopia after the age of 6 to 7 years in an untreated population.",Remaining

Sixty patients with ischemic stroke were included: 30 with SV disease and 30 with LV disease. In addition, a control group of 30 apparent healthy subjects were studied. Clinical assessment, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging brain, and genetic study using the polymerase chain reaction of ACE gene were done for all subjects.	We found that the distribution of ACE gene polymorphism frequency was significantly different between the 3 groups. The DD genotype was far more common in stroke patients compared to controls. It was also significantly more common in each of the patient groups compared to controls but rather similar in the 2 patient groups with SV and LV diseases.

We hypothesized that nefazodone added to a standard mood stabilizer would show significant antidepressant efficacy with minimal agitation or induction of mania, by virtue of its selective 5-HT(2A) blockade.	Thirteen DSM-IV pure depressed-phase nonpsychotic bipolar outpatients received an open-label 8-week pilot trial of flexibly dosed nefazodone (mean±SD peak dose=462.5±164.0mg/day) with a concurrent mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic. Primary outcomes included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI-S).	All subjects completed at least 4 weeks of treatment, while 9 (69%) completed the 8-week protocol. Based on last observation point, 8 (62%) had at least a 50% reduction from baseline HAM-D scores. Significant improvement from baseline was observed in both HAM-D (z=2.05, p=.04) and CGI severity ratings (z=2.21, p=.03). Induction of mania occurred in 1 subject (7%). No subjects manifested clinical signs of hepatic failure, and none prematurely terminated the study due to other adverse events (most common side effects included fatigue, insomnia, nausea, or headache).	This was a small open-label pilot study with use of varied concomitant pharmacotherapies and no placebo comparator.	While nefazodone is seldom used in clinical practice due to concerns about rare but severe hepatotoxicity, it may represent a model for postsynaptic 5HT(2A) antagonism that mechanistically could help to inform the development of future treatments for bipolar depression.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

1329,1359657,Surgical neurology,Spinal epidural abscess: a report of 40 cases and review.,"Despite modern medical advances, the morbidity and mortality rates associated with spinal epidural abscess remain significant, and the diagnosis often is elusive. A retrospective study was undertaken to define better the incidence and clinical features of this infection, and to establish current diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. Forty cases of spinal epidural abscess were encountered at our institution between July 1979 and March 1991. All medical records and radiological images were reviewed. We report a significant increase in the incidence of epidural abscess after June 1988 (p = 0.0195). Sixteen patients used drugs intravenously, and six had undergone spinal procedures. Twelve patients were misdiagnosed in various emergency rooms or clinics and discharged. Localized back pain, fever, and neurological deficit remained the typical clinical manifestations. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated uniformly when measured (21 cases). Magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic specifically in 23 of 24 instances. The majority of patients underwent surgical drainage, but five selected patients were managed nonoperatively. The highly variable presentation of spinal epidural abscess may confuse the diagnosis and delay indicated surgical intervention. Localized back pain in a febrile patient at significant risk for epidural abscess warrants erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement. The presence of erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevation or evidence of spinal cord compression on physical examination are indications for immediate magnetic resonance imaging examination with contrast enhancement. Surgical drainage with sustained intravenous antibiotic treatment remains the cornerstone of therapy. Nonoperative management may be considered in selected cases.",Remaining
1330,7401856,The Laryngoscope,The evaluation of dizziness in children.,"A child with symptoms that relate to the balance mechanism can be a complex diagnostic problem. Often an adequate history is difficult to obtain because of the child's age and limitation of expression. Psychosomatic illness can frequently present as dizziness in children; however, this should not preclude a thorough evaluation. It is the purpose of this paper to outline these possibilities and the characteristics unique to each. The differential diagnosis can be grouped into central (central nervous system) and peripheral (otologic) categories, with a few miscellaneous conditions. A basic evaluation should include a complete neurotologic examination, audiogram and electronystagmogram. An electroencephalogram is frequently a valuable diagnostic adjunct. Further testing should be decided on the basis of the patient's history, examination and prior results. The records of children admitted to Boston City Hospital over a one-year period were reviewed. Of 2,088 pediatric patients, 238 had discharge diagnoses pertinent to the balance mechanism. Of these, 14 had a presenting symptom of dizziness. These cases are analyzed.",Non-systematic-review

During the past 15 years, considerable research activity has focused on psychometrically identified individuals hypothesized to be en route to schizophrenia (i.e., putative schizotypes). The Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) has figured prominently in such prediction-oriented psychometric high-risk work. This report examines research using the PAS completed since 1987 that has established the instrument as a valid index for detecting liability for schizophrenia (or schizotypy) and as, arguably, the schizotypy index of choice for research. These results are presented and interpreted in light of Meehl's theoretical framework of schizotypy. Other measures of and assessment devices for schizotypy (schizophrenia-related liability) are identified. Of these other measures, the Chapmans' Magical Ideation Scale and the schizophrenia liability index of Moldin and colleagues are particularly well established. Methodologic suggestions for future psychometric high-risk and other work using objective measures of schizotypic psychopathology are offered. It is strongly recommended that future studies of schizotypy (or those in the planning stages, relying on psychometric detection methods use multiple psychometric indices to tap schizotypy or use a psychometric index in association with other promising biobehavioral markers of schizophrenia liability (e.g., sustained attentional deficits, eye movement dysfunction) for maximum efficiency in both location and definition of schizotypes.",Non-systematic-review

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography were used to examine asymmetries in language-related gray- and white-matter and their relationships to language ability in a sample of 20 children with ASD, aged 4-7 years, and a reference sample of 20 typically developing (TD) children, aged 6-11 years. Children with ASD did not differ significantly from TD children in gray matter asymmetries, but were significantly less left-lateralized than TD children in the volume and radial diffusivity (RD) of the arcuate fasciculus (AF). They did not differ in the fractional anisotropy (FA) or the mean or axial diffusivity of the AF. Within the ASD group, exploratory analyses revealed that decreased leftward/increased rightward asymmetry of pars opercularis was associated with higher language ability and bilaterally increased FA and decreased RD of the AF. In conclusion, children with ASD exhibited atypical asymmetry in language-related white-matter structure as well as an atypical pattern of brain-language relationships that suggest that they may meet language milestones and acquire normal language via a different neurodevelopmental trajectory from TD children.",Remaining

After adjusting for comorbidity, across the medical conditions, enuresis and serious stomach problems were the strongest correlates of ADHD. These findings confirm the pervasive medical comorbidity of ADHD reported in previous clinical and community-based studies. The intriguing salience of enuresis and serious stomach or bowel conditions may also provide an important clue to multisystem involvement in ADHD.",Remaining

Twenty-eight percent of the spouses with ASRD had a carpenter spouse with a similar diagnosis. Twenty-four percent of the families with a child with ASRD had a parent with one of these diagnoses compared to 9.4% of families without any children with ASRD (P < 0.0001). Families of carpenters with alcohol or ASRD also had different patterns of health care utilization.	Utilization patterns were influenced to a significant degree by concordant diagnoses among spouses and children. Excess mental health care was seen among families of carpenters with ASRD above their care for substance abuse treatment.",Remaining

1344,11482695,Acta neurochirurgica,Carotid endarterectomy: a new technique replacing internal shunts.,"Carotid endarterectomy has been reported to increase the time free from cerebral ischemic events in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a high grade of stenosis of the internal carotid artery. In cases in whom the compensatory circulation during the carotid clamp time is not sufficient, the use of intraluminal shunts has been proposed. However, the use of intraluminal shunts present several problems, such as the technical difficulties in positioning the shunt, the variability of time requested for the placement, the inconstancy of the blood flow during surgery, and the need to clamp off the carotid to introduce and remove the shunt. For these reasons, most operators prefer not to employ intraluminal shunts, while others do use them only in selected cases. The purpose of this work is to present, for the first time, a new type of temporary extraluminal shunt, connecting the femoral to the internal carotid artery with the interposition of a roller pump to regulate the blood flow. This method allows one to perform carotid endarterectomy without interrupting the blood flow to the brain.	407 consecutive patients, who underwent carotid endarterectomy between August 1992 and April 2000, were considered. 35 patients presented an absolutely insufficient collateral circulation, demonstrated by important modifications of the electroencephalographic monitoring during the carotid clamp time. In these patients the endarterectomy was performed using a new femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt.	In all the cases in whom the femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt was positioned, the normalisation of electroencephalographic monitoring was achieved by regulating the blood flow with the interposed roller pump. The use and the placement of the shunt was simple and easy. None of the patients showed postoperative complications, except for one who had a stroke two days after surgery.	The results obtained, although to be confirmed by further studies, seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of our femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt, which was simple to use and safe.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

The patients were followed for a period of three months. Significant relief in frequency, duration and severity from migranous attacks was seen in all drug treated groups over placebo. Significant correlation in response was seen in frequency, duration and severity in all the groups which received drugs. Statistically more significant relief was seen in cyproheptadine and propranolol treated group as compared to individual drug treated groups. In cyproheptadine and propranolol treated groups, the dropout rate was lower and associated symptoms were better relieved than in other groups.

The mismatch between the modern diet and the still ancient biological machinery of humans subtly but chronically disorders their internal milieu, giving rise to a prolonged state of low-grade potassium deficiency and low-grade metabolic acidosis whose severity increases with age. Supplemental KCI cannot redress this mismatch and correct this state. However, the mismatch is redressed and the state corrected by restoring intakes of K+ and HCO3- to levels approaching those in the diet of our prehistoric forebearers, with either fruits and vegetables or with supplemental KHCO3. So restored, KHCO3 can: 1) attenuate hypertension and possibly prevent its occurrence by suppressing the phenomenon of normotensive NaCl-sensitivity, in part by its natriuretic effect; (2) prevent kidney stones by reducing urinary excretion of calcium and increasing urinary excretion of citrate; (3) ameliorate and protect against the occurrence of osteoporosis by increasing the renal retention of calcium and phosphorus, and by suppressing bone resorption and enhancing bone formation; and (4) likely prevent stroke.",Non-systematic-review

Cell 71:765). To directly investigate the role of acid SMase in IL-1 and TNF receptor-mediated signal transduction, we examined the ability of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) type A fibroblasts, which are deficient in acid SMase, to induce IL-8 gene expression through activating NFkB. Unexpectedly, IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha efficiently induced IL-8 production and IL-8 mRNA in NPD type A fibroblasts as in normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, activation of NFkB was also induced in NPD type A fibroblasts in response to IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha stimulation to a similar extent as in normal fibroblasts. These results provide evidence that acid SMase is not essential in IL-1 and TNF receptor signaling leading to NFkB activation as well as the cytokine gene activation which is regulated by NFkB.",Remaining

Furthermore, a specific category of women, deemed to be women-at-risk, face particular challenges in their journey and resettlement process. This longitudinal study investigated psychological distress in refugee women-at-risk one year after resettlement in Australia. Follow-up survey of 83 women-at-risk (mean age = 33.41 years; SD = 11.93) assessed: trauma events and symptoms; loss events and loss distress; level of post-migration problems; anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms; and absence of trust in community members. Participants demonstrated no symptom change since initial assessment (p > .05). Substantial proportions of women reported traumatization (39%), PTSD (20%), anxiety (32%), and depression (39%) above clinical cut-offs, and high levels of somatization and loss distress. Post-migration problems, trauma events, and region of birth were associated with all symptoms, with post-migration problems the strongest predictor. Absence of trust in community members was associated with trauma, depression, and somatic symptoms. Initial trauma and somatic symptoms were associated with follow-up traumatic and somatic symptoms. Loss and trauma events were associated with loss distress. Findings underline the role of post-migration problems on psychological distress and the need to consider women's psychological wellbeing in the context of their trauma and loss history, potential impacts of ethnicity, and complex socio-cultural dynamics underpinning issues of trust within communities. Effective service delivery requires that practitioners screen for and address psychological distress in women-at-risk at least up to 18 months after resettlement.",Remaining

Understanding the molecular interaction of these compounds with various anti-Parkinsonian drug targets is of interest. The present study is intended to explore binding modes of catechins with molecular targets having potential role in PD. Lamarckian genetic algorithm methodology was adopted for molecular docking simulations employing AutoDock 4.2 program. Toxicity potential and molecular properties responsible for good pharmacokinetic profile were calculated by Osiris property explorer and Molinspiration online toolkit, respectively. A strong correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.893) was obtained between experimentally reported and docking predicted activities of native co-crystallized ligands of the 18 target receptors used in current study. Analysis of docked conformations revealed monoamine oxidase-B as most promising, while N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor was recognized as the least favorable target for catechins. Benzopyran skeleton with a phenyl group substituted at the 2-position and a hydroxyl (or ester) function at the 3-position has been identified as common structural requirements at majority of the targets. The present findings suggest that epigallocatechin gallate is the most promising lead to be developed as multitarget drug for the design and development of novel anti-Parkinsonian agents.",In-vitro-study

(2) The deficit in terms of frequency of communication was marked even compared with typically developing infants with younger mental age. (3) Young children with autism had different nonverbal communication profile compared with all three comparison groups.	Early social-communicative difficulties in autism involve early triadic communications involving joint attention and possibly dyadic turn-taking skills, which has implications for both early screening and early intervention.",Remaining

In the group of neuronal and mixed glioneuronal neoplasms are lesions with distinctive morphological features that are still not included in a precise classification, including extraventricular neurocytoma, papillary glioneuronal tumor, rosette-forming glioneuronal of the fourth ventricle, glioneuronal with neuropil-like rosette, and DNT-like tumor of the septum pellucidum. The glioneuronal tumor with neuropil-like rosette and oligodendroglioma with neurocytic differentiation represent morphological variants of genetically proven diffuse gliomas. The lipoastrocytoma and the pilomixoid astrocytoma enlarge the group of astrocytic lesions. Rare, low-grade gliomas of the spinal cord with extensive leptomeningeal dissemination associated with unusual neuroimaging are described. The chordoid glioma of the third ventricle and the papillary tumor of the pineal region seem to be correlated by a common histogenesis from the specialized ependyma of the subcommissural organ.

It is essential that usability of adolescent health websites on the internet is improved to help adolescents overcome these barriers and allow them to engage successfully with web-based health care content.	The aim of this review was to synthesize the usability of specific health information websites. These findings were mapped onto the adolescent neurodevelopmental profile, and a design brief based on the findings was developed to tailor future websites for specific adolescent requirements.	A systematic search conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) identified 25 studies that assessed the usability of health information websites. Adolescent feedback was collected by a mixture of surveys, focus groups, interviews, and think-aloud procedures.	A majority of the information websites were developed for specific health issues that may be relevant to adolescents. The most preferred website features were interactive content such as games and quizzes, as well as videos, images, audio clips, and animations. Participants also preferred communicating with other adolescents with similar conditions or learning about their experience through real stories and testimonials. Adolescents found it difficult to use health information websites if they contained too much text, were too cluttered, or had features that made it difficult to access. The findings are considered in the context of adolescent social processes, low tolerance of delayed gratification, and attraction to novelty and mapped onto a neurodevelopmental model of adolescence.	Young people's feedback can determine usability and content that make a health information website easy or informative to use.

These subsamples consisted of 203 adolescents matched for sex and age, and a larger subsample of 1,015 adolescents proportionately matched for sex and age, with the clinical group. Classification accuracy analyses revealed that although clinical base rate did affect the accurate classification of cases, a T-score cutoff of 65 resulted in higher levels of accurate classification overall while minimizing the misclassification of both clinical and normal cases. Implications of these findings for the recommended use of the MMPI-A 'gray zone' are presented, and the relative areas of strength and weakness of the MMPI-A are reviewed in the identification and description of psychopathology.",Remaining

Though more choice is a good thing, it does mandate knowing which drug is the most appropriate in a given clinical situation. Three novel OACs--dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban--are approved for use in atrial fibrillation in Canada. They have each been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials where they have been shown to be noninferior, or in some cases superior, to warfarin (Coumadin). Prescription coverage for these drugs is increasingly available through third party and government drug plans. The major enhancements of the novel OACs relate to their rapid, consistent anticoagulant effect at fixed dosing and the lack of need for monitoring of anticoagulant effect. Nonetheless, their use is not foolproof and practitioners must be familiar with their limitations. On balance, we favour the use of novel OACs over warfarin in patients who are anticoagulant-naive, given their increased ease of use.

Besides motor impairment, PD patients exhibit non-motor symptoms that negatively impact their quality of life and often manifest prior to motor deficits. One such symptom is mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), which is comprised of deficits in executive function such as working memory, attention, cognitive flexibility, and spatial memory. The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced unilateral medial forebrain bundle (MFB) lesion animal model successfully recapitulates PD motor impairment but is also used to assess non-motor deficits. The present study utilizes a unilateral 6-OHDA induced MFB lesion rodent model to investigate prefrontal cortex (PFC)-mediated cognitive processes that are impaired in PD patients. In a test of attentional set shifting, PD rodents demonstrated deficits in simple discrimination, but not in rule reversal or extradimensional shifts. PD rodents also exhibited deficits in a temporal order memory task but had no deficits in novel/spatial object recognition or object-in-place tasks. These results reveal limitations of the 6-OHDA induced unilateral MFB lesion model to completely recapitulate PD-MCI symptoms suggesting a need for better lesion models to study PD-MCI.",Animal-other

This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of fasting in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We found that fasting every other day rather than weekly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor in the nigrostriatal pathway. Therefore, we maintained the animals on alternate-day fasting for 2 weeks and injected MPTP (30 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) for five days. We observed that alternate-day fasting attenuated MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss and astroglial activation in the substantia nigra and the striatum. Moreover, neurochemical analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography showed that alternate-day fasting reduced MPTP-induced depletion of striatal dopamine. Consistent with these results, behavioral tests showed that fasting suppressed the motor impairment caused by MPTP. Furthermore, fasting increased the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B, which are downstream signaling molecules of neurotrophic factors. Fasting also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein, further supporting the involvement of neurotrophic factors in the observed neuroprotective effects. Hence, our results demonstrated the dopaminergic neuroprotection of intermittent fasting in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, supporting the idea that fasting could be an instrumental tool for preventing neurodegeneration in the brain.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

In the il6(+/+) mice, ethanol ingestion decreased bone mineral density, as determined by dual-energy densitometry; decreased cancellous bone volume and trabecular width and increased trabecular spacing and osteoclast surface, as determined by histomorphometry of the femur; increased urinary deoxypyridinolines, as determined by ELISA; and increased CFU-GM formation and osteoclastogenesis as determined ex vivo in bone marrow cell cultures. In contrast, ethanol ingestion did not alter any of these parameters in the il6(-/-) mice. Ethanol increased receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) mRNA expression in the bone marrow of il6(+/+) but not il6(-/-) mice. Additionally, ethanol decreased several osteoblastic parameters including osteoblast perimeter and osteoblast culture calcium retention in both il6(+/+) and il6(-/-) mice.

Furthermore, they suggest that IL-6 achieves this effect by inducing RANKL and promoting CFU-GM formation and osteoclastogenesis.",Animal-other
1368,19419286,Expert review of medical devices,Approaches to rehabilitation for visual field defects following brain lesions.,"Visual field defects often result from stroke and brain injury. The resulting visual impairment can be debilitating for patients, impeding daily activities such as reading and mobility. Historically, it was believed that there was little opportunity for restoration of function following visual system damage. However, the development of various visual rehabilitative strategies suggests that visual field defects are partially repairable and a certain degree of function can be improved. While this provides hope for patients, many of these strategies have been met with skepticism within the clinical and scientific communities. Further development of these strategies through carefully designed studies could validate their efficacy and reveal underlying mechanisms. Novel techniques, aimed at enhancing the effect of these rehabilitative strategies, are also discussed.",Non-systematic-review
1369,29554099,PLoS computational biology,The Pathway Coexpression Network: Revealing pathway relationships.,"A goal of genomics is to understand the relationships between biological processes. Pathways contribute to functional interplay within biological processes through complex but poorly understood interactions. However, limited functional references for global pathway relationships exist. Pathways from databases such as KEGG and Reactome provide discrete annotations of biological processes. Their relationships are currently either inferred from gene set enrichment within specific experiments, or by simple overlap, linking pathway annotations that have genes in common. Here, we provide a unifying interpretation of functional interaction between pathways by systematically quantifying coexpression between 1,330 canonical pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to establish the Pathway Coexpression Network (PCxN). We estimated the correlation between canonical pathways valid in a broad context using a curated collection of 3,207 microarrays from 72 normal human tissues. PCxN accounts for shared genes between annotations to estimate significant correlations between pathways with related functions rather than with similar annotations. We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships. Comprehensive exploration of PCxN can be performed at http://pcxn.org/.",Remaining
1370,32744524,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,Patient-Specific Polyvinyl Alcohol Phantom Fabrication with Ultrasound and X-Ray Contrast for Brain Tumor Surgery Planning.,"Phantoms are essential tools for clinical training, surgical planning and the development of novel medical devices. However, it is challenging to create anatomically accurate head phantoms with realistic brain imaging properties because standard fabrication methods are not optimized to replicate any patient-specific anatomical detail and 3D printing materials are not optimized for imaging properties. In order to test and validate a novel navigation system for use during brain tumor surgery, an anatomically accurate phantom with realistic imaging and mechanical properties was required. Therefore, a phantom was developed using real patient data as input and 3D printing of molds to fabricate a patient-specific head phantom comprising the skull, brain and tumor with both ultrasound and X-ray contrast. The phantom also had mechanical properties that allowed the phantom tissue to be manipulated in a similar manner to how human brain tissue is handled during surgery. The phantom was successfully tested during a surgical simulation in a virtual operating room. The phantom fabrication method uses commercially available materials and is easy to reproduce. The 3D printing files can be readily shared, and the technique can be adapted to encompass many different types of tumor.",Remaining
1371,10429004,Pediatrics,"Relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance in females with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: report from the Maternal Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study.","To examine the relationship of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotypes to biochemical phenotype and cognitive development in maternal phenylketonuria (PKU).	PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS). A total of 84 different mutations were detected, and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals. Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations, 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity (severe PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). Then, 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications. The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity. These patients are considered functionally hemizygous.	The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level. Cognitive performance (IQ) was also significantly related to genotype. The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96, respectively, whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84, respectively. Of the patients with PKU, 92% had been treated during childhood. Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations. Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for >6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group.	The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances. Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU. The significant relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy.",Remaining

The CBFVs, resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were measured in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries (ACA and MCA) of 38 normal neonates.	The mean peak systolic, end diastolic and time-averaged velocities (PSV, EDV and TAV) were 36.3 ± 6.6, 12.4 ± 3.9 and 22.0 ± 4.0 cm/s (ACA) and 41.4 ± 13.2, 13.0 ± 5.5 and 25.8 ± 7.9 cm/s (MCA), respectively. All CBFVs in the ACA correlated with gestation; only EDV was correlated to post-natal age. The RI in the ACA (0.67 ± 0.06) and MCA (0.68 ± 0.07) were correlated (r = 0.72, P < 0.001); RI correlated to post-natal age. Two infants with RI < 0.55 were both fed within 25 mins of the study; RI correlated with post-prandial time (dichotomous, pivot 25 min). The mean PI was 1.11 ± 0.18 (ACA) and 1.17 ± 0.23 (MCA). Correlations were observed with post-natal age and post-prandial time (dichotomous). The average angle of insonation was greater in the ACA than in the MCA (median of 5° vs. 18°).	Results corresponded with previous published studies. No correlation was observed between Doppler indices and gestation as component velocities all increase with advancing gestation. Less variation and smaller standard deviation of CBFV's was associated with a smaller angle of insonation. Low RIs (<0.55), without a pathological cause, warrants further study.",Remaining
1373,32929643,European radiology,Uncontrolled hypertension associates with subclinical cerebrovascular health globally: a multimodal imaging study.,"The study aimed to analyze the association between hypertension control and subclinical cerebrovascular health using a comprehensive multimodal imaging approach.	The study included 200 hypertensive older males without previous cardiovascular diseases. Clinic blood pressure (BP) was measured using a standard approach. Cerebrovascular health was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging in the following four aspects: Intracranial atherosclerosis as determined by vessel wall imaging; Vascular rarefaction (defined as less discernible vessels on angiography) was evaluated using a custom-developed technique. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) were assessed using arterial spin-labeling imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, respectively.	A total of 189 subjects had MRI scans. The mean age was 64.9 (± 7.2) years. For intracranial atherosclerosis, there was a significant association between uncontrolled hypertension and presence of intracranial plaque. When systolic and diastolic BP were analyzed separately, the association remained significant for both. For vascular rarefaction, uncontrolled hypertension was associated with less discernible vessel branches or shorter vessel length on angiography. Further analysis revealed that this is due to uncontrolled diastolic BP, but not uncontrolled systolic BP. There was an association between uncontrolled hypertension and reduced CBF, which was also mainly driven by uncontrolled diastolic BP. We also found that uncontrolled diastolic BP, but not uncontrolled systolic BP, was associated with increased WMH volume.	Uncontrolled hypertension was associated with subclinical cerebrovascular injury globally, with both small and medium-to-large arteries being affected.	• In this study, we leveraged the advantage of a series of cutting-edge MR imaging and analysis techniques and found uncontrolled hypertension is associated with subclinical globally compromised cerebrovascular health. • The detrimental consequences of uncontrolled BP affect not only the small vessels but also the medium-to-large arteries, and uncontrolled systolic and diastolic BP are both independently associated with certain types of cerebrovascular injury. • Our data suggest that cerebrovascular health is impaired globally in uncontrolled hypertension before the onset of stroke.",Remaining

Non-personnel costs were calculated using information from the financial administration of the healthcare organization.	Total costs of a person with dementia per 24 hours, including both care staff and other healthcare providers, were € 151 for small-scale living wards and € 147 for independent living wards. Non-personnel costs were € 37 per day.	This study provides Dutch estimates for total healthcare costs per day for institutionalized persons with dementia.

We introduce a method to determine the best-case κ score (κBEST) for measuring interrater reliability between EEG readers, retrospectively.	We incorporated 1 year of EEG reports read by four adult EEG readers at our institution. We used SQL queries to determine EEG findings for subsequent analysis. We generated logistic regression models for particular EEG findings, dependent on patient age, location acuity, and EEG reader. We derived a novel measure, the κBEST statistic, from the logistic regression coefficients.	Increasing patient age and location acuity were associated with decreased sleep and increased diffuse abnormalities. For certain findings, EEG readers exhibited the dominant influence, manifesting directly as lower between-reader κBEST scores for certain EEG findings. Within-reader κBEST control scores were higher than between-reader scores, suggesting internal consistency.	The κBEST metric can measure significant interrater reliability differences between any number of EEG readers and reports, retrospectively, and is generalizable to other domains (e.g., pathology or radiology reporting). We suggest using this metric as a guide or starting point for focused quality control efforts.",Remaining

Repeated resting-state MEG recordings and clinical assessments were obtained in the context of a unique longitudinal cohort study over a seven-year period using a multiple longitudinal design. We used linear mixed-models to analyze the relationship between neurophysiological (spectral power and functional connectivity) and clinical data. At baseline, early-stage (drug-naïve) PD patients demonstrated spectral slowing compared to healthy controls in both subcortical and cortical brain regions, most outspoken in the latter. Over time, spectral slowing progressed in strong association with clinical measures of disease progression (cognitive and motor). Global functional connectivity was not different between groups at baseline and hardly changed over time. Therefore, investigation of associations with clinical measures of disease progression were not deemed useful. An analysis of individual connections demonstrated differences between groups at baseline (higher frontal theta, lower parieto-occipital alpha2 band functional connectivity) and over time in PD patients (increase in frontal delta and theta band functional connectivity). Our results suggest that spectral measures are promising candidates in the search for non-invasive markers of both early-stage PD and of the ongoing disease process.",Remaining

From March 2006 to July 2008, MRI was performed on 135 pregnant women whose fetuses diagnosed as fetal ventriculomegaly at an average of 32 gestational weeks in Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University. Mild ventriculomegaly was defined when the width of unilateral or bilateral fetal cerebral ventricle triangle was 10-15 mm, moderate ventriculomegaly 16-20 mm and severe ventriculomegaly >20 mm. We introduced the Denver developmental screening test (DDST) to follow-up the mild ventriculomegaly and normal babies, confirmed by MRI, at 6-12 months after birth and a case-control study was conducted. The intelligence and growth of these infants were analyzed.	(1) Diagnostic rate of fetal ventriculomegaly through MRI: Among the 135 gravidas, 60 (44.4%) showed isolated ventriculomegaly, 5(3.7%) complicated with ventricular hemorrhage; 12 (8.9%) complicated with agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) and 2 (1.5%) complicated with cerebellar hypoplasia, while 56 (41.5%) were normal. Seventy-nine cases had fetal ventriculomegaly on MRI and 15.2% (n = 12) of them complicated with ACC. (2) Degree of fetal ventriculomegaly on MRI: Among the 60 isolated ventriculomegaly cases, 55 (91.7%) were mild and 5 (8.3%) moderate ones. Among the 5 cases complicated with ventricular hemorrhage, one was mild ventriculomegaly, and 4 moderate or severe cases. Among the 12 cases with ACC, 8 (66.7%) were moderate ventriculomegaly and 4 (33.3%) severe cases. The 2 cases with cerebellar hypoplasia were both moderate ventriculomegaly fetuses. (3) Follow-up at 6-12 months after birth: thirty out (case group) of the 55 isolated ventriculomegaly cases, 38 out of the 56 normal babies and 42 babies with normal MRI results were followed up, and the later 80 cases were taken as control. Four infants (13.3%) in the case group and 10 (12.5%) in the control group showed abnormal or suspected results in DDST (P > 0.05), the rest babies were all normal. (4) Clinical outcomes of the 79 ventriculomegaly fetuses diagnosed by MRI: thirty mild ventriculomegaly babies and 5 moderate ones were born at term and showed normal at follow ups. However, 7 gravidas were not compliant, 6 pregnancies were terminated, and 12 were lost. Three of the 12 cases with ACC continued the pregnancy, and postnatal MRI of the babies showed the same with the prenatal MRI, 8 pregnancies were induced and one was lost. All of the 5 fetuses with ventricular hemorrhage were induced and the prenatal diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy. One of the 2 fetuses with cerebellar hypoplasia was term delivered and diagnosed as cerebral palsy at the age of 6 months, and the other one was induced.

However, direct evidence of FR production in neurons during seizures has never been presented. Using hippocampal cultured slices we demonstrate that FRs are produced in CA3 but not CA1 pyramidal neurons during the rhythmic synchronous activity induced by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. The production of FRs (measured as changes in the fluorescence emission of dihydrorhodamine 123) was correlated with an increase in the baseline levels of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) estimated by fluo-3 injected into individual neurons via a patch pipette. [Ca2+]i increased during spike bursting and returned to baseline levels after the burst termination in CA1, but not in CA3, pyramidal neurons where 'interburst' calcium concentrations progressively increased. Measurement of cell death, performed with propidium iodide 48 h after a 30-min exposure to bicuculline, revealed most prominent degeneration of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 pyramidal layer. The FR scavengers vitamin E and glutathione significantly reduced the seizure-induced neurodegeneration without supressing spontaneous epileptiform activity. These observations indicate that FR overproduction is related to seizure-induced neuronal death.",In-vitro-study

However, the molecular pathways that result in the pathogenesis of glioma remain elusive. In this study, we found that microRNA-103 (miR-103), microRNA-195 (miR-195), or microRNA-15b (miR-15b), which all have the same 5' 'seed' miRNA portion and share common binding sites in the SALL4 3'-untranslated region (UTR), were downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. These miRNAs suppressed glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, induced cell apoptosis, and decreased the level of the SALL4 protein, but not that of SALL4 mRNA, which was identified as a direct target of all three miRNAs. The caspase-3/7 activity expression in U251 cells overexpressing these miRNAs was rescued during SALL4 upregulation. An obvious inverse correlation was observed between SALL4 and miR-103 or miR-195 expression levels in clinical glioma samples. Moreover, enforced expression of SALL4 stimulated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, these data suggest that miR-103, miR-195, and miR-15b post-transcriptionally downregulated the expression of SALL4 and suppressed glioma cell growth, migration, and invasion, and increased cell apoptosis.

In our present study, we investigated the changes in oxygenation and analyzed the vascular perfusion of the spinal cord in a rodent model of MS. We performed multispectral optoacoustic tomography of the lumbar spinal cord before and after an oxygen enhancement challenge in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. In addition, mice were transcardially perfused with lectin to label the vasculature and their spinal columns were optically cleared, followed by light sheet fluorescence microscopy. To analyze the angioarchitecture of the intact spine, we used VesSAP, a novel deep learning-based framework. In EAE mice, the spinal cord had lower oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration compared to healthy mice, indicating compromised perfusion of the spinal cord. Oxygen administration reversed hypoxia in the spinal cord of EAE mice, although the ventral region remained hypoxic. Additionally, despite the increased vascular density, we report a reduction in length and complexity of the perfused vascular network in EAE. Taken together, these findings highlight a new aspect of neuroinflammatory pathology, revealing a significant degree of hypoxia in EAE in vivo that is accompanied by changes in spinal vascular perfusion. The study also introduces optoacoustic imaging as a tractable technique with the potential to further decipher the role of hypoxia in EAE and to monitor it in MS patients.",Animal-other

Treatment is hampered by GBM's unique biology, including differential cell response to therapy. Although several mitochondrial abnormalities have been identified, how mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations contribute to GBM biology and therapeutic response remains poorly described. We sought to determine the spectrum of functional complex III and IV mtDNA mutations in GBM.	The complete mitochondrial genomes of 10 GBM cell lines were obtained using next-generation sequencing and combined with another set obtained from 32 GBM tissues. Three-dimensional structural mapping and analysis of all the nonsynonymous mutations identified in complex III and IV proteins was then performed to investigate functional importance.	Over 200 mutations were identified in the mtDNAs, including a significant proportion with very low mutational loads. Twenty-five were nonsynonymous mutations in complex III and IV, 9 of which were predicted to be functional and affect mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. Most of the functional candidates were GBM specific and not found in the general population, and 2 were present in the germ-line. Patient-specific maps reveal that 43% of tumors carry at least one functional candidate.	We reveal that the spectrum of GBM-associated mtDNA mutations is wider than previously thought, as well as novel structural-functional links between specific mtDNA mutations, abnormal mitochondria, and the biology of GBM.

In the present experiments we have examined amyloid-containing terminals in more detail, first dual labeling synaptosomes from AD cortex for Abeta and a series of markers, and then using quadrant analysis to compare amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative terminals. Amyloid-positive synaptosomes were larger in size than amyloid-negatives (p<0.007), and significant increases were observed in mean fluorescence for the lipid raft markers cholesterol (27%; p<0.0005) and GM1 ganglioside (24%; p<0.005).

Levels and phosphorylation state of ERK, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and proline-rich/Ca2+-activated tyrosine kinase (PYK2), and levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), were determined using western blotting. C57Bl/6J mice received acute or chronic nicotine (200 microg/mL) in their drinking water or were withdrawn from nicotine for 24 h following chronic exposure. CREB phosphorylation was reduced in the nucleus accumbens following chronic nicotine, consistent with previous reports that decreased accumbens CREB activity increases drug reinforcement. In contrast, CREB phosphorylation was increased in the prefrontal cortex following chronic nicotine exposure and in the ventral tegmental area during nicotine withdrawal. In addition, total and phosphorylated ERK decreased in the amygdala following chronic nicotine exposure, but ERK phosphorylation increased in the prefrontal cortex. TH levels increased in both the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, supporting the hypothesis that increased catecholaminergic tone contributes to nicotine reinforcement. Overall, these results support a role for ERK and CREB activity in neural plasticity associated with nicotine dependence.",Animal-other

A single knockout mouse model, fmr1-tm1Cgr, exists. In this report we further characterize the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of the fmr1-tm1Cgr Fragile X mouse through the use of F1 hybrid mice derived from two inbred strains (FVB/NJ and C57BL/6J). Use of F1 hybrids allows focus on the effects of the fmr1-tm1Cgr allele with reduced influence from recessive alleles present in the parental inbred strains. We find that the cognitive phenotype of fmr1-tm1Cgr mice, including measures of working memory and learning set formation that are known to be seriously impacted in humans with Fragile X Syndrome, are essentially normal. Further testing of inbred strains supports this conclusion. Thus, any fmr1-tm1Cgr cognitive deficit is surprisingly mild or absent. There is, however, clear support presented for a robust audiogenic seizure phenotype in all strains tested, as well as increased entries into the center of an open field. Finally, a molecular examination of the fmr1-tm1Cgr mouse shows that, contrary to common belief, it is not a molecular null.

There is a need to clarify which specific factors of psychopathology are linked with the referral to psychiatric or psychotherapeutic inpatient treatment. This study examined which factors of psychopathology are linked with the referral of BN patients to inpatient treatment while controlling for history of suicide attempts and history of underweight. 126 females with a current diagnosis of BN purging type were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and interviewed about their history of treatment for the BN, history of weight, and history of suicide attempts. Logistic regressions were conducted to examine whether psychiatric comorbidity, suicide attempts, and underweight were associated with inpatient treatment history. Axis I comorbidity in general, but no specific axis I disorder, was associated with inpatient history. Axes II comorbidity, especially Cluster B disorders and to a lesser degree depressive/negativistic personality disorders, was associated with a history of inpatient treatment. History of suicide attempts was also linked with inpatient experience, but history of underweight was not. The results showed that BN patients with specific types of comorbidity are more likely to be hospitalized than others.",Remaining
1394,1910699,Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,Irradiation. A significant risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis.,"Radiation exacerbates the development of atherosclerosis in the large arteries of animals and is postulated to do likewise in human beings. To study this relationship, we used high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography to measure carotid artery wall thickness in 29 previously irradiated head and neck cancer patients and compared the results with those of nine epidemiologically similar but nonirradiated head and neck cancer patients. Maximal intima-media thickness was greater in the study group (mean, 1.28 +/- SE 0.06 mm) than in the control group (mean, 0.90 +/- SE 0.05 mm). Even after the effects of age, hypertension, and tobacco consumption were controlled, these differences remained statistically significant. This study suggests that irradiation may contribute to the development of more severe and extensive carotid atherosclerosis in head and neck cancer patients who receive radiation therapy.",Remaining

Available therapies are unable to treat all the symptoms, and result in strong side effects. For this reason, numerous animal models have been generated to elucidate the pathophysiology of this disorder. All these models present neuronal remodeling and abnormalities in spine stability. It is well known that the complexity in dendritic arborization determines the number of receptive synaptic contacts. Also the loss of dendritic spines and arbor stability are strongly associated with schizophrenia. This review evaluates changes in spine density and dendritic arborization in animal models of schizophrenia. By understanding these changes, pharmacological treatments can be designed to target specific neural systems to attenuate neuronal remodeling and associated behavioral deficits.",Non-systematic-review

1399,37749080,Nature communications,Blockade of interferon signaling decreases gut barrier integrity and promotes severe West Nile virus disease.,"The determinants of severe disease caused by West Nile virus (WNV) and why only ~1% of individuals progress to encephalitis remain poorly understood. Here, we use human and mouse enteroids, and a mouse model of pathogenesis, to explore the capacity of WNV to directly infect gastrointestinal (GI) tract cells and contribute to disease severity. At baseline, WNV poorly infects human and mouse enteroid cultures and enterocytes in mice. However, when STAT1 or type I interferon (IFN) responses are absent, GI tract cells become infected, and this is associated with augmented GI tract and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, accumulation of gut-derived molecules in the brain, and more severe WNV disease. The increased gut permeability requires TNF-α signaling, and is absent in WNV-infected IFN-deficient germ-free mice. To link these findings to human disease, we measured auto-antibodies against type I IFNs in serum from WNV-infected human cohorts. A greater frequency of auto- and neutralizing antibodies against IFN-α2 or IFN-ω is present in patients with severe WNV infection, whereas virtually no asymptomatic WNV-infected subjects have such antibodies (odds ratio 24 [95% confidence interval: 3.0 - 192.5; P = 0.003]). Overall, our experiments establish that blockade of type I IFN signaling extends WNV tropism to enterocytes, which correlates with increased gut and BBB permeability, and more severe disease.",Animal-other
1400,25031221,Schizophrenia bulletin,Mediodorsal and visual thalamic connectivity differ in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with and without psychosis history.,"Empirical and theoretical studies implicate thalamocortical circuits in schizophrenia, supported by emerging resting-state functional connectivity studies (rs-fcMRI). Similar but attenuated alterations were found in bipolar disorder (BD). However, it remains unknown if segregated loops within thalamocortical systems show distinct rs-fcMRI alterations in schizophrenia. For instance, the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus, known to project to prefrontal networks, may be differently altered than the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), known to project to the occipital cortex. Also, it remains unknown if these circuits show different patterns of alterations in BD as a function of psychosis history, which may be associated with a more severe clinical course. We addressed these questions in 90 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 73 remitted BD patients (33 with psychosis history) matched to 146 healthy comparison subjects. We hypothesized that the MD vs LGN would show dissociations across diagnostic groups. We found that MD and LGN show more qualitative similarities than differences in their patterns of dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. In BD, patterns qualitatively diverged between thalamic nuclei although these effects were modest statistically. BD with psychosis history was associated with more severe dysconnectivity, particularly for the MD nucleus. Also, the MD nucleus showed connectivity reductions with the cerebellum in schizophrenia but not in BD. Results suggest dissociations for thalamic nuclei across diagnoses, albeit carefully controlling for medication is warranted in future studies. Collectively, these findings have implications for designing more precise neuroimaging-driven biomarkers that can identify common and divergent large-scale network perturbations across psychiatric diagnoses with shared symptoms.",Remaining

Here, we report a case of narcolepsy type 2 caused by hippocampal glioma of the right temporal lobe.	A 44-year-old male farmer complained of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) over the past 3 months and more.	The lesion of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was removed and its pathological examination was carried out.	General examination showed no abnormalities of his heart, lungs, or abdomen. Neurological examination showed no positive sign. The blood routine and biochemical examination were normal. He scored 7 on the Pittsburg sleep quality index, 16 on the Epworth sleepiness scale, 52 on the self-rating anxiety scale, and 48 on the self-rating depression scale. The multiple sleep latency test data showed 2 periods of sleep-onset rapid eyes movement period across 4 successive tests; the average sleep latency was under 8 minutes, and the rapid eyes movement latency was under 7 minutes. Lesion of glioma in hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and histological examination. After surgical removal of the glioma from the hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe, the patient's EDS symptoms disappeared immediately.

However, the association between levels of LE8 and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes is not known from a large prospective cohort. We aim to analyze the relationship between CVH, indicated by LE8, and risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD. Moreover, we sought to test whether the genetic susceptibility to CHD or stroke could be modified by LE8.	A total of 137 794 participants free of CVD from the UK Biobank were included. CVH was scored using LE8 and categorized as low, moderate, and high.	During a median of 10 years, 8595 CVD cases (6968 CHDs and 1948 strokes) were documented. A higher LE8 score was associated with remarkably lower risks of CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). Comparing the high CVH to the low CVH, the hazard ratios (95% CI) were 0.34 (0.30-0.38) for CHD, 0.45 (0.37-0.54) for stroke, and 0.36 (0.33-0.40) for CVD. Moreover, the model with LE8 achieved higher accuracy and outperformed the model with Life's Simple 7 for CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). The protective associations of the LE8 score with CVD outcomes were more pronounced among women (P interaction, <0.001 for CHD and 0.0013 for CVD, respectively) and among younger adults (P interaction, <0.001, 0.007, and <0.001 for CHD, stroke, and CVD, respectively). In addition, a significant interaction was found between the genetic risk of CHD and the LE8 score (P interaction, <0.001).

To comprehensively investigate the association of ambient temperature with cause-specific CVD mortality, and to estimate and compare the corresponding mortality burden.	We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study of 1000,014 CVD deaths in Jiangsu province, China during 2015-2019 using data from the China National Mortality Surveillance System. Residential daily 24-hour average temperature for each subject was extracted from a validated grid data at a spatial resolution of 0.0625° × 0.0625°. We fitted distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) based on conditional logistic regression to quantitatively investigate the association of ambient temperature with total and cause-specific CVD mortality, which was used to further estimate mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient temperatures.	With adjustment for relative humidity, we observed reverse J-shaped exposure-response associations of ambient temperature with total and cause-specific CVD mortality, with minimum mortality temperatures ranging from 19.5 °C to 23.0 °C. An estimated 20.3% of the total CVD deaths were attributable to non-optimum temperatures, while the attributable fraction (AF) of mortality from chronic rheumatic heart diseases, hypertensive diseases, ischemic heart diseases (IHD), pulmonary heart disease, stroke, and sequelae of stroke was 22.4%, 23.2%, 23.3%, 20.9%, 17.6% and 21.3%, respectively. For total and cause-specific CVDs, most deaths were attributable to moderate cold temperature. We observed significantly higher mortality burden from total and certain cause-specific CVDs in adults 80 years or older and those who were widowed.	Exposure to ambient temperature was significantly associated with increased risk of cause-specific CVD mortality. The burden of CVD mortality attributable to non-optimum temperature was substantial especially in older and widowed adults, and significantly varied across specific types of CVD.",Remaining

Access to evidence-based treatments for opioid use disorders is extremely limited.	HIV Prevention Trials Network 058 (HPTN 058) was a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the impact of 2 medication-assisted treatment (MAT) strategies on HIV incidence or death among opioid-dependent people who inject drugs (PWID). HIV-negative opioid-dependent PWID were recruited from 4 communities in Thailand and China with historically high prevalence of HIV among PWID. A total of 1251 participants were randomly assigned to either (1) a 1-year intervention consisting of 2 opportunities for a 15-day detoxification with buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) combined with up to 21 sessions of behavioral drug and risk counseling [short-term medication-assisted treatment (ST-MAT)] or (2) thrice-weekly dosing for 48 weeks with BUP/NX and up to 21 counseling sessions [long-term medication-assisted treatment (LT-MAT)] followed by dose tapering. All participants were followed for 52 weeks after treatment completion to assess durability of impact.	Although the study was stopped early due to lower than expected occurrence of the primary end points, sufficient data were available to assess the impact of the interventions on drug use and injection-related risk behavior. At week 26, 22% of ST-MAT participants had negative urinalyses for opioids compared with 57% in the LT-MAT (P < 0.001). Differences disappeared in the year after treatment: at week 78, 35% in ST-MAT and 32% in the LT-MAT had negative urinalyses. Injection-related risk behaviors were significantly reduced in both groups after randomization.	Participants receiving BUP/NX 3 times weekly were more likely to reduce opioid injection while on active treatment. Both treatment strategies were considered safe and associated with reductions in injection-related risk behavior. These data support the use of thrice-weekly BUP/NX as a way to reduce exposure to HIV risk. Continued access to BUP/NX may be required to sustain reductions in opioid use.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention

Using a longitudinal design, we examined developmental patterns of the bidirectional links between neural mechanisms and substance use throughout adolescence.	167 adolescents (aged 13-14 years at Time 1, 53% male) were assessed annually four times. Risk-related neural processing was assessed by blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses in the insula during a lottery choice task, cognitive control by behavioral performance during the Multi-Source Interference Task, and substance use by adolescents' self-reported cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use.	Latent change score modeling indicated that greater substance use predicted increased insula activation during risk processing, but the effects of insula activation on changes in substance use were not significant. The coupling effect from substance use to insula activation was particularly strong for adolescents with low cognitive control, which supports the theorized moderating role of cognitive control.	Our results elucidate how substance use may alter brain development to be biased toward maladaptive decision-making, particularly among adolescents with poor cognitive control. Furthermore, the current findings underscore that cognitive control may be an important target in the prevention and treatment of adolescent substance use given its moderating role in the neuroadaptive effects of substance use on brain development.",Remaining

Many limitations of conventional face-to-face psychological interventions could potentially be overcome through Internet-based and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This chapter introduces core features of IMIs, describes areas of application, presents evidence on the efficacy of IMIs as well as potential effect mechanisms, and delineates how Artificial Intelligence combined with IMIs may improve current practices in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in adults. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials clearly show that therapist-guided IMIs can be highly effective for a broad range of mental health problems. Whether the effects of unguided IMIs are also clinically relevant, particularly under routine care conditions, is less clear. First studies on IMIs for the prevention of mental disorders have shown promising results. Despite limitations and challenges, IMIs are increasingly implemented into routine care worldwide. IMIs are also well suited for applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which provides ample opportunities to improve the identification and treatment of mental disorders. Together with methodological innovations, these approaches may also deepen our understanding of how psychological interventions work, and why. Ethical and professional restraints as well as potential contraindications of IMIs, however, should also be considered. In sum, IMIs have a high potential for improving the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders across various indications, settings, and populations. Therefore, implementing IMIs into routine care as both adjunct and alternative to face-to-face treatment is highly desirable. Technological advancements may further enhance the variability and flexibility of IMIs, and thus even further increase their impact in people's lives in the future.",Non-systematic-review

The major objective of the study was to determine whether the systemic hemodynamic changes that occur with pneumothorax are reflected in the cerebral circulation and whether these changes play a role in pathogenesis of IVH. Blood flow velocity was measured in the anterior cerebral arteries by a transcutaneous Doppler technique in nine infants who developed pneumothorax in the first 3 days of life. At the time of pneumothorax there was a marked increase in flow velocity, especially during diastole, and, with resolution of pneumothorax, flow velocity returned to normal levels over the ensuing hours. The changes in flow velocity correlated closely with systemic hemodynamic changes that occurred with pneumothorax, ie, and increase in mean systemic blood pressure, especially diastolic pressure. IVH, documented by serial ultrasound scans, was observed shortly after pneumothorax in the nine infants. The data thus demonstrate a marked increase in flow velocity in the cerebral circulation at the time of pneumothorax. This increase is of importance in the genesis of IVH as is suggested further by the occurrence of IVH soon after the cerebral hemodynamic changes.",Remaining

PLG(Ag) completely abrogated disease induction in an organ specific manner, where the spleen was dispensable for tolerance induction. PLG(Ag) delivered intravenously distributed to the liver, associated with macrophages, and recruited Ag-specific T cells. Furthermore, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was increased on Ag presenting cells and PD-1 blockade lessened tolerance induction.

All specimens displayed variable expression patterns of chronic low-grade foreign body reactions in the vicinity of the incorporated stent struts as characterized by the appearance of CD68-positive macrophages and mainly CD3- and CD45-R0-positive T lymphocytes. Overwhelming proliferations in relation to intimal hyperplasia can be regarded as the main cause of stent-associated vascular restenosis. After a period of 6 months the expression of factor VIII-positive neoendothelial cells on the luminal surface can be detected in individual cases. Reactions of the vascular wall depend on the state of the underlying atherosclerotic lesions prior to stenting. In cases of predominantly atheromatous soft plaques, the typical reaction pattern triggered by the metallic foreign body pressed into vessel tissue can be absent. In summary, the morphological findings show a chronic tissue reaction in response to stent incorporation.

In this study, we report that ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a Ras superfamily small GTPase, is abundantly expressed in invasive human glioma cells. Cellular depletion of ARF6 by small interfering RNA decreased Rac1 activation, impaired HGF-stimulated and serum-stimulated glioma cell migration in vitro, and markedly decreased the invasive capacity of invasive glioma in the brain. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ARF6 in glioma cells promoted cell migration via the activation of Rac1. Upon stimulation of glioma cells with HGF, we show that IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) is recruited and overlaps with ARF6 at the leading edge of migrating cells. However, cellular depletion of ARF6 abrogated this recruitment of IQGAP1 and attenuated the formation of surface protrusions. ARF6 forms complexes with Rac1 and IQGAP1 in glioma cells upon HGF stimulation, and knockdown of IQGAP1 significantly inhibits ARF6-induced Rac1 activation and cell migration. Taken together, these data suggest that ARF6-mediated Rac1 activation is essential for glioma cell invasion via a signaling pathway that requires IQGAP1.",In-vitro-study
1420,3418380,Journal of neurosurgery,CSF leukotriene C4 following subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Leukotrienes derive from arachidonic acid metabolism via the lipoxygenase pathway and modulate several cellular events. In the central nervous system, leukotrienes are mainly synthesized in the gray matter and in vascular tissues. Their production is enhanced in ischemic conditions and in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Previous studies have indicated the ability of the leukotrienes C4 and D4 to constrict arterial vessels in vivo and in vitro and have suggested their involvement in the pathogenesis of cerebral arterial spasm. In the present study, the authors measured lumbar and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of leukotriene C4 in 48 patients who had suffered aneurysmal SAH. In 12 of the cases, symptomatic and radiological spasm was evident. The mean lumbar CSF level of immunoreactive-like activity of leukotriene C4 (i-LTC4) was significantly higher (p less than 0.005) than in control cases, while the cisternal CSF level was higher than the lumbar mean concentration (p less than 0.005). Patients presenting with vasospasm had significantly higher levels of i-LTC4 compared to patients without symptomatic vasospasm. This is the first report concerning monitoring of i-LTC4 levels in the CSF after SAH. The results of this study suggest that: 1) metabolism of arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway is enhanced after SAH; 2) the higher cisternal CSF levels of i-LTC4 may be part of the biological response in the perianeurysmal subarachnoid cisterns after the hemorrhage; and 3) the higher CSF levels of i-LTC4 in patients presenting with vasospasm suggest that a relationship exists between this compound and arterial spasm and/or reflect the development of cerebral ischemic damage.",Remaining
1421,3478668,Postgraduate medicine,How do eating disorders affect thyroid function?,"Abnormal thyroid function in patients with eating disorders can result from malnutrition. A low serum triiodothyronine (T3) level is commonly noted in starvation states and is caused by reduced peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3. Diminished T4 concentrations are also observed. Adequate nutrition normalizes this type of aberrant laboratory profile. Thyroid function tests that give results below the normal range are best repeated initially for verification of results and again after adequate nutrition is reestablished. If no primary endocrinopathy is present, spontaneous correction of these laboratory values can be expected with conventional dietary habits.",Non-systematic-review
1422,33764656,Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,Age differences in broader autism phenotype traits from young adulthood to older adulthood.,"Much of past research has been dedicated to refining the operationalization and correlates of the broader autism phenotype (BAP) and less on how the BAP differs by socio-demographic characteristics, like age-particularly after midlife. This gap is important because other nonclinical trait-like characteristics (e.g., personality) have shown considerable age differences, leading to work assessing the malleability of psychological characteristics and improving outcomes for individuals and their significant others. In the current study, we examined cross-sectional age differences in the BAP in a large sample of adults ranging in age from 18 to 85. We recruited a sample of 2966 adults ranging in age from 18 to 85 (Mage = 36.53, SD = 12.61; 58.9% Female; 1.1% with an ASD diagnosis) recruited from an online survey service. We found that total BAP scores were higher in younger adults and lower among older adults. These differences were particularly true for pragmatic language difficulties, with this component of the BAP showing the most dramatic age differences. Aloofness showed similar negative associations with age, albeit much smaller. Rigidity was not significantly associated with age. The results are consistent with other research showing an abatement of symptoms among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) across early life and theories predicting changes in other psychological characteristics (e.g., personality). The results are discussed in the context of the malleability of ASD and BAP traits across life, the clinical implications of these changes, and the origins and consequences for lifespan differences in BAP. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about how subclinical autistic-like traits among middle-aged and older adults compare to younger adults. We found that these subclinical traits were highest in young adults and lowest in older adults. Knowing how these traits differ by age can provide researchers and clinicians with a sense of how much these traits might change across life, if the traits might be sensitive to interventions, and when in development it might be best to intervene.",Remaining
1423,18787971,International urology and nephrology,Promoting functioning and well-being in older CKD patients: review of recent evidence.,"Osteoporosis, falls, sleep difficulty, cognitive impairment, and depressed mood are major clinical concerns in the geriatric population that are physiologically and psychologically based and are often interrelated. All of these issues have implications for patients' daily functioning and quality of life (QOL). This review synthesizes recent evidence about these prominent issues in geriatric care and related implications for care of older patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent evidence about pre-dialysis and dialysis treatment strategies that may help to optimize management of older patients is also considered. Although elderly patients often report better psychosocial adjustment to dialysis than do younger patients, physical functioning and cognitive functioning losses challenge the QOL of many elderly persons. Early management of CKD and attention to anemia, consideration of the benefits of peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis, and inclusion of some form of exercise or regular physical activity in routine care provide key opportunities to enhance the functioning and well-being of older patients.",Non-systematic-review

We aimed to examine suicide risk among Tunisian UHR and First Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients at baseline, and to evaluate the evolution and correlates of suicidal ideation over a 12-month period in the UHR group exclusively.	35 UHR (aged 22.8 ± 4.0 years, 45.7% male) and 33 FEP (aged 27.3 ± 4.8 years, 63.6% male) participants were included. The Comprehensive Assessment of at Risk Mental States, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were used.	No significant differences were found between the UHR and the FEP groups with regard to levels of suicidal ideation at baseline. Suicidal ideation scores showed a significant decrease over time in UHR participants (p=.014; η2=0.242). An increase in total PANSS scores at 1 year (Beta=0.03; p=.048; 95%CI 0.001, 0.060; η2=0.182) significantly increased suicidal ideation scores at 1 year in the UHR group.

In this disease, the neurons in the brain are considered to be decaying steadily but consistently by the accumulation of amyloid mass, particularly the β-amyloids, amyloid proteins, and Tau proteins. The most responsible amyloid-proteins are amyloid-40 and amyloid-42, which have a high probability of accumulating in excess over the brain cell, interfering with normal brain cell function and triggering brain cell death. The advancement of pharmaceutical sciences leads to the development of Nanotheranostics technology, which may be used to diagnose and treat Alzheimer's. They are the colloidal nanoparticles functionalised with the therapeutic moiety as well as a diagnostic moiety. This article discusses the prognosis of Alzheimer's, various nanotheranostics approaches (nanoparticles, quantum dots, aptamers, dendrimers, etc), and their recent advancement in managing Alzheimer's.

Twenty-four ambulatory patients (mean age, 10.0 years) with spastic cerebral palsy who were scheduled for single event multilevel surgery, including distal hamstring lengthening, were included. Preoperatively, peak isometric muscle strength was measured for the hip flexor, hip extensor, knee flexor, and knee extensor muscle groups using a handheld dynamometer, and three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis and gross motor function measure (GMFM) scoring were also performed. Correlations between peak isometric strength and GMFM, gait kinematics, and gait kinetics were analyzed.	Peak isometric muscle strength of all muscle groups was not related to the GMFM score and the gross motor function classification system level. Peak isometric strength of the hip extensor and knee extensor was significantly correlated with the mean pelvic tilt (r=-0.588, p=0.003 and r=-0.436, p=0.033) and maximum pelvic obliquity (r=-0.450, p=0.031 and r=-0.419, p=0.041). There were significant correlations between peak isometric strength of the knee extensor and peak knee extensor moment in early stance (r=0.467, p=0.021) and in terminal stance (r=0.416, p=0.043).	There is no correlation between muscle strength and gross motor function. However, this study showed that muscle strength, especially of the extensor muscle group of the hip and knee joints, might play a critical role in gait by stabilizing pelvic motion and decreasing energy consumption in a flexed knee gait.",Remaining

We targeted provoked confabulation, false recall and false recognition in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott-paradigm (DRM-paradigm) as well as false recognition in a mirror reading task. ACoA patients produced more provoked confabulations and more false recognition in mirror reading than comparison subjects. Conversely, false recall/false recognition in the DRM-paradigm were similar in patients and controls. Whereas the former two indices of false memories were correlated, no relationship was revealed with the DRM-paradigm.

1429,19630956,Molecular brain,Regulation of endosomal motility and degradation by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2/alsin.,"Dysfunction of alsin, particularly its putative Rab5 guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor activity, has been linked to one form of juvenile onset recessive familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS2). Multiple lines of alsin knockout (ALS2(-/-)) mice have been generated to model this disease. However, it remains elusive whether the Rab5-dependent endocytosis is altered in ALS2(-/-) neurons. To directly examine the Rab5-mediated endosomal trafficking in ALS2(-/-) neurons, we introduced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Rab5 into cultured hippocampal neurons to monitor the morphology and motility of Rab5-associated early endosomes. Here we report that Rab5-mediated endocytosis was severely altered in ALS2(-/-) neurons. Excessive accumulation of Rab5-positive vesicles was observed in ALS2(-/-) neurons, which correlated with a significant reduction in endosomal motility and augmentation in endosomal conversion to lysosomes. Consequently, a significant increase in endosome/lysosome-dependent degradation of internalized glutamate receptors was observed in ALS2(-/-) neurons. These phenotypes closely resembled the endosomal trafficking abnormalities induced by a constitutively active form of Rab5 in wild-type neurons. Therefore, our findings reveal a negatively regulatory mechanism of alsin in Rab5-mediated endosomal trafficking, suggesting that enhanced endosomal degradation in ALS2(-/-) neurons may underlie the pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration in ALS2 and related motor neuron diseases.",In-vitro-study

A total of 7.3% of patients had suicidal ideation during the in-hospital evaluation (acute-onset suicidal ideation), and 11.3% developed it during the chronic 3 to 24 month rehabilitation period (delayed-onset suicidal ideation). Compared with delayed-onset suicidal patients, acute-onset suicidal patients had more predisposing risk factors (i.e., personal psychiatric history and alcohol abuse/dependence) and less social support (i.e., lower frequency of being married). Both acute and delayed-onset suicidal ideation, however, were strongly associated with the existence of major depression and impaired social functioning. These findings suggest that the detection and appropriate treatment of depressive disorders and social isolation may be the most important factor in preventing suicide both during the acute and chronic period following life-threatening physical illnesses.",Remaining

Controversy exists about whether open microsurgical methods serve to reduce shunt dependency compared with endovascular techniques.	To determine predictors of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and functional outcomes after aneurysmal SAH.	A total of 471 patients who were part of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial from 2003 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. All variables including demographic data, medical history, treatment, imaging, and functional outcomes were included as part of the trial. No additional variables were retrospectively collected.	Ultimately, 147 patients (31.2%) required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) in our series. Age, dissecting aneurysm type, ruptured vertebrobasilar aneurysm, Fisher grade, Hunt and Hess grade, admission intraventricular hemorrhage, admission intraparenchymal hemorrhage, blood in the fourth ventricle on admission, perioperative ventriculostomy, and hemicraniectomy were significant risk factors (P < .05) associated with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, intraventricular hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage were independent risk factors for shunt dependency (P < .05). Clipping vs coiling treatment was not statistically associated with VPS after SAH on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients who did not receive a VPS at discharge had higher Glasgow Outcome Scale and Barthel Index scores and were more likely to be functionally independent and to return to work 72 months after surgery (P < .05).	There is no difference in shunt dependency after SAH among patients treated by endovascular or microsurgical means. Patients in whom shunt-dependent hydrocephalus does not develop after SAH tend to have improved long-term functional outcomes.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention

A sample consisting of 618 adolescents, aged from 13 to 17 years, completed a questionnaire assessing EA, exercise characteristics (i.e., frequency and intensity of exercise), depression, body image (i.e., body appreciation and social physique anxiety), and disordered eating (i.e., concerns about eating and body weight gain as well as restrictive and compensatory practices).	The profile analysis identified three EA profiles, which were labelled: low-risk, high-risk with conflict and high-risk without conflict. Based on their scores for the health-related variables considered, the low-risk profile emerged as the least problematic; this increasing in the high-risk without conflict and even more so in the high-risk with conflict profiles. Nevertheless, individuals belonging to the high-risk without conflict profile showed similar body appreciation scores but lower social physique anxiety scores than those belonging to the low-risk profile.	The study is limited by both its cross-sectional design and the self-reported nature of the collected data.	Conflict symptom may be relevant in explaining the differences in certain health-related variables between adolescents showing similarly high levels of EA.",Remaining

1435,21523606,Pediatric radiology,Potential role of 3DUS in infants and children.,"The objective of this review is to discuss basic technical aspects as well as potential pediatric applications of three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS). Different 3DUS-techniques are already commercially available. Most commonly, a transducer-integrated motor drives a scan-head to acquire a volumetric dataset, which is then reconstructed and viewed using various post-processing techniques. It has been proved feasible to apply 3DUS with pediatric transducers in typical pediatric investigations. Based on our own experiences and on review of the literature, 3DUS can be successfully used in infants and children for brain, spine, cardiac, urinary tract (particularly assessment of hydronephrosis, and virtual cystoscopy), and female genital (e.g., for assessment of uterine malformations) US, and for various other applications, particularly in small parts. Power Doppler data can be integrated, allowing 3DUS-angiography. Thus, 3DUS promises to become a useful adjunct for imaging children, particularly as it enhances ultrasound by offering additional, previously inaccessible planes, rendering options and surface assessments. 3DUS should be increasingly exploited, thus hopefully helping reduce the need for more invasive or burdening (e.g., ionizing radiation) investigations in children.",Non-systematic-review

The risk of mechanical restraint was investigated by analyzing all first-time admissions in the period using Cox-proportional hazard models.	In the crude rates patients with dual diagnosis were more often mechanically restrained compared to patients with only psychiatric diagnoses or only other substance use diagnoses. However, this was attenuated when the characteristics of patients were accounted for. Patients with only other substance related diagnoses had the highest risk of being mechanically restrained.

1437,9745353,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,[A study of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in the presenium and senium].,"Recently, with the increase in elderly population, we have had more opportunities to administer neuroleptics to elderly patients for hallucinatory delusional state, delirium, psychomotor excitement, wandering etc. However, little is known about the characteristics of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in elderly patients, which is the most serious side effect of neuroleptics. In this paper, we present the clinical course of five NMS patients in the presenium and senium. Case 1 was 72-year-old male who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with late onset). He showed nocturnal wandering, insomnia, and irritability. Tiapride 60 mg per day had been administered previously. Just after the addition of oxypertine 10 mg per day, NMS occurred, and he died of pneumonia a week later. Case 2 was 75-year-old male who was diagnosed as having vascular dementia. He showed insomnia, hyperactivity and wandering. He had been given levomepromazine (LPZ) 10 mg per day over a long period of time. At first, he had daily episodic fever, however, serum CPK levels did not increase at that time. A month later, all the symptoms of NMS appeared and then the patient's condition suddenly deteriorated and he died three days later. Case 3 was a 64-year-old male who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with early onset). He showed insomnia, irritability and violence. Tiapride 50-125 mg per day was administered along with oxypertine 50-115 mg per day. Almost two months later, NMS occurred. He had daily episodic fever at first, extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic instabilities gradually increased. Soon after symptoms of NMS were completed. In this case, NMS seemed to be induced by bacterial pneumonia after long term administration of LPZ 5 mg per day. Case 4 was a 75-year-old female who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with late onset). She showed hallucinatory delusional state. Although she had autonomic instabilities just after adminstration of haloperidol 1-2 mg per day, NMS itself occurred after discontinuing the neuroleptic. Case 5 was a 61-year-old female who was diagnosed as having schizophrenia at the age of forty. She was given various neuroleptics over a period of time. The neuroimaging in SPECT showed her cerebral cortex was generally hypoactive. She had a tendency to have autonomic instabilities after the administration of relatively high potential neuroleptics. Risperidone 3-6 mg per day was administered, and almost a month later, autonomic instabilities increased and she was diagnosed as having NMS. All the patients would be able to have brain dysfunction, which suggested that such patients may be liable to NMS. In our patients, NMS occurred after the additional administration of oxypertine 10 mg per day or after long time administration of LPZ 5 mg per day. It was suggested that NMS could occur after the administration of low dose and relatively low potential neuroleptics in elderly patients. Our 3 of 5 patients showed the delayed type of NMS, which might be relatively more frequent in senior and presenior patients than in younger patients. In case 3, NMS was induced by the somatic disease (bacterial pneumonia), however in other cases, NMS was not always induced by somatic disease. Our 4 of 5 patients experienced some of the symptoms of NMS--episodic fever, extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic instabilities--before the onset of NMS. Such symptoms may be 'pre-steps' to NMS. Once NMS occurred, the patient's systemic condition tended to deteriorate acutely. Due to the fact that our 2 of 5 patients died, it was suggested that the prognosis of the NMS patients in presenium and senium tends to be much worse. It is important to find the 'pre-steps' to NMS and treat them as soon as possible for better prognosis.",Remaining

The analysis focused on determinants of the health of young people and the role of school settings in the optimisation of health.	Records were examined from the Canadian sample of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Survey. 3402 young people in Ontario, Canada were administered this survey in 2006, of which 1966 were re-administered the survey 1 year later and supplied complete data. Individual items and factor-analytically derived scales were used to examine potential aetiological relationships in a series of structural equation models. Health outcomes examined were serious injury and psychosomatic symptoms. Models developed from cross-sectional data were confirmed longitudinally.	Adolescents who reported negative home and school environments reported higher levels of substance use, psychosomatic symptoms and serious injuries (the latter identified in longitudinal analysis only). Engagement in health risk behaviour partially mediated the link between these two environments and the sentinel health outcomes. Positive school environments were protective in that they moderated associations between negative home environments and engagement in health risk behaviours. The effects observed in longitudinal analyses were generally consistent with those observed cross-sectionally.	Negative home environments clearly place adolescents at risk for engagement in health risk behaviours and associated physical health outcomes. Positive school environments can in part moderate these relationships. Optimisation of school social environments therefore remains warranted as a population health strategy.",Remaining
1439,31443692,BMC neurology,Remote ischemic conditioning improves cognition in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.,"Subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) is very common among the older people, but has no approved treatment. Preclinical trials show that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) reduces recurrence of ischemic stroke. We hypothesize that RIC may also be an effective therapy for patients with SIVD.	Thirty-seven consecutive SIVD cases were enrolled in this randomized control study. Eighteen RIC patients underwent five brief cycles of conditioning (bilateral upper limb compression at 200 mmHg) followed by reperfusion twice daily over 6 consecutive months. Nineteen control patients underwent the same process, but at a pressure of 60 mmHg which caused no restriction on the blood flow of the upper limb. The primary outcome measures were changes in neuropsychological assessments. The secondary outcomes included the changes in high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentration, white matter lesion volume (WMLV), diffusion tension imaging (DTI) metrics of white matter. All data were collected at baseline and follow-up.	A significant treatment difference favoring RIC at 6 months was observed on performance of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Trail Making Test A and B (TMT-A & TMT-B), and Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO) (p < 0.05). The control group did not show much improvement after the treatment, and only with a slight change in HVLT-R and TMT-R (p < 0.05). Covariance analysis of efficacy between the two groups suggested that RIC patients performed better on JLO than control patients at the 6-month follow-up (RIC 23.10 vs. control 18.56; p = 0.013). Although DTI metrics were comparable, Hs-CRP levels and WMLV in RIC patients showed a declining trend.	Over the 6-month treatment period, we found that RIC was safe and effective for improving cognitive function in SIVD patients.

1440,30539767,Schizophrenia research,Hippocampal volume and vasculature before and after exercise in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is associated with poor cognitive function and elevated cardiometabolic disease risk. These health concerns may exacerbate neurocognitive dysfunction associated with hippocampal abnormalities, particularly hippocampal volume reductions. Regular exercise is thought to improve symptom severity, reduce depression, and improve cognition in schizophrenia, and may trigger exercise-mediated hippocampal growth. The potential for the benefits of exercise for treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients has not been clearly assessed. This study aims to assess the effect of exercise on hippocampal plasticity and clinical outcomes in chronic schizophrenia.	Seventeen DSM-IV criteria schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients completed a customized moderate intensity 12-week aerobic or weight-bearing exercise program. Adherence rates were 83% ± 9.4%) with 70% of participants completing the entire exercise program. Concomitant neuroimaging, clinical and cognitive assessments were obtained at baseline and 12-weeks.	At follow-up, symptom severity scores (t(16) = -16.8, p. ≤ 0.0001) and social functioning (t(16) = 4.4, p. = 0.0004) improved.

Change in hippocampal volume and vascular volume was not significantly correlated with change in symptom severity or affect scores.	Adjunct exercise may accelerate symptom improvement in treatment-resistant psychosis patients. While the underlying mechanism remains unclear, these results indicate that chronic schizophrenia patients experience hippocampal plasticity in response to exercise.

Fifty-eight CD and 83 AC patients operated on over 10 years were carefully evaluated. The patients received a disease-related questionnaire and were invited for a follow-up at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurosurgery. Thirty-three CD and 52 AC patients returned the questionnaire; 25 CD and 37 AC patients participated personally. CD patients underwent a dexamethasone suppression test, and IGF-1 levels were assessed in AC patients. Data on postoperative therapy were assessed.	84.8% of those with CD and 75.0% of those with AC had been followed by endocrinologists; 9.1% of CD and 1.9% of AC patients had been under no aftercare; 96% of CD patients were in remission. A recurrence occurred in four patients, two were newly detected by our study. IGF-1 was postoperatively normalized in 25 of 37 AC patients (67.6%). Twenty patients remained in remission, five relapsed. One patient received medical therapy upon recurrence and presented normal IGF-1; four patients with relapse had not been treated yet. Ten of 12 patients with elevated early postoperative IGF-1 received medical therapy that was commenced within 6 months in nine cases. The mean duration of medical therapy was 36 months (range 2-92). IGF-1 was still elevated at the last follow-up in eight of these ten patients, all of them receiving monotherapy. In four patients, the dose had been increased once.	The postoperative transfer back to the endocrinologist after operative treatment is achieved well in both groups. In uncured AC, medical therapy is initiated early, but options of therapy offer room for improvement. Therapy of recurrence is delayed in both pathologies.",Remaining

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PPCS in children after mTBI and to identify clinical variables in children who are at high risk for developing PPCS. A multicenter, retrospective matched cohort in which PPCS symptoms were evaluated in children 8-15-year-old, 6-60 months after being admitted to the emergency department because of mTBI. The control group included children admitted to the emergency department because of uncomplicated distal radius fractures. The children's guardians were interviewed for the presence of PPCS symptoms using the 'Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire'. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of PPCS. Two-hundred and five children were included in the mTBI group and 205 in the control. The median time from the injury was 33.5 months in the mTBI group and 33.8 in the control. The prevalence of PPCS in the mTBI group was 25.3% and PPCS like symptoms in the control was 2.4%, p < 0.001. Within the 6-60 months period, the PPCS prevalence was not influenced by the time that elapsed from the injury. In the mTBI group, motor vehicle accidents and adolescence were found to be risk factors for PPCS. PPCS is underdiagnosed in the pediatric population and 25% of children admitted to the ED due to mTBI may suffer from PPCS. Screening guidelines should be implemented to identify and properly treat these children.",Remaining

1446,8895943,Pharmacopsychiatry,Low plasma thyroid indices of depressed patients are attenuated by antidepressant drugs and influence treatment outcome.,"Decreased turnover of thyroid indices and blunting of TSH release after TRH administration has been associated with depressive disorder. A further decrease in plasma thyroid hormone; during antidepressant treatment has been reported. However, the putative association between the plasma thyroid indices' concentration and response has not been addressed. In the present study 21 depressed inpatients underwent a four-week double blind antidepressant with amitriptyline and mianserin; their plasma thyroid hormone indices (total thyroxine [TT4], free thyroxine [FT4], total triiodothyronine [TT3], free triiodothyronine [FT3], thyrotropin [TSH], and thyroglobulin [TBG]) were quantified to elucidate their involvement in depression and during antidepressant drug treatment. Depressed patients' plasma TSH, when corrected for age, was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects. During antidepressant treatment the entire patient cohort showed a significant decrease in plasma TT4 and FT4 concentrations. Responders showed a significant drop in TT4 FT4, FT3, and T4/TBG, but nonresponders only a decrease in FT4. During mianserin treatment, a decrease was observed in TT4, FT4, FT3, and T4/TBG. FT4 and FT3 baseline levels correlated positively with the improvement in the Hamilton Depression Rating Score (HDRS). These findings show that depressed inpatients' serum TSH levels are within the reference range, but significantly lower than those of healthy subjects, and those patients who turn out to be nonresponders have potentially lower availability of thyroid hormones than responders. Therefore, we hypothesize that in order to assure clinical improvement in depression, an adequate capacity of the thyroid hormone pool is necessary to compensate for the additional antidepressant-provoked decrease in serum thyroid hormone availability.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
1447,23791711,Neurochemistry international,The role of α-synuclein in the pathophysiology of alcoholism.,"Alcoholism has complex etiology and there is evidence for both genetic and environmental factors in its pathophysiology. Chronic, long-term alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are associated with neuronal loss with the prefrontal cortex being particularly susceptible to neurotoxic damage. This brain region is involved in the development and persistence of alcohol addiction and neurotoxic damage is likely to exacerbate the reinforcing effects of alcohol and may hinder treatment. Understanding the mechanism of alcohol's neurotoxic effects on the brain and the genetic risk factors associated with alcohol abuse are the focus of current research. Because of its well-established role in neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders, and its emerging role in the pathophysiology of addiction, here we review the genetic and epigenetic factors involved in regulating α-synuclein expression and its potential role in the pathophysiology of chronic alcohol abuse. Elucidation of the mechanisms of α-synuclein regulation may prove beneficial in understanding the role of this key synaptic protein in disease and its potential for therapeutic modulation in the treatment of substance use disorders as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.",Non-systematic-review

1451,14605324,Stroke,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use is associated with reduced plasma concentration of C-reactive protein in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke.,"High levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with an increased risk of future cardiovascular events in ischemic stroke. It has been hypothesized that the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients at high vascular risk may also result from their anti-inflammatory action. Data evaluating this hypothesis are limited in ischemic stroke.	We conducted a prospective observational study in 507 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke to analyze the effect of ACE inhibitor treatment at the time of stroke onset on CRP levels within the first 24 hours and the relationship to outcome. Risk estimates were calculated according to Cox regression analysis controlled for blood pressure (BP) levels, clinical and neuroradiological confounding variables, and log-normalized CRP levels at entry.	ACE inhibitor treatment was associated with lower (2.6-fold; P<0.0001) median CRP levels and with a reduced 2-year cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.53; P<0.0001) compared with a different BP-lowering regimen. The relationship between ACE inhibitor status and log-normalized CRP levels remained significant (P<0.0001) after we controlled for important confounding variables and concomitant treatments. The reduced risk was also evident in multivariable analysis when ACE inhibitor treatment was controlled for BP, associated risk factors, neuroradiological findings, and concomitant treatments (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.62; P<0.0001). This risk reduction was greatly attenuated and not more significant when log-normalized CRP levels were included (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.04; P=0.0721) in the model.	Concomitant treatment with ACE inhibitor at the time of an acute stroke is associated with lower inflammatory response and better long-term outcomes, apparently apart from the effects on BP.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

In addition to the substantial decline in IPD, increased disease due to nonvaccine serotypes and a changing clinical presentation emerged. The objective of this study is to describe these trends in IPD in the late PCV7-era.	We report on continued, prospective, population-based surveillance of childhood IPD in Massachusetts children during the period 2007 to 2009 and make comparisons with the earlier 2001 to 2006 PCV7-era. Demographic and clinical data were collected for all cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from normally sterile sites were serotyped and further evaluated using antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus sequence typing and eBURST analysis. IPD incidence rates are calculated by age, year and serotype.	There were 326 cases of IPD between 2007 and 2009 in children < 18 years of age. Overall IPD incidence rate was 7.5 cases per 100,000 population and was not statistically different from the observed incidence in 2001 to 2006 (P > 0.05). As compared with the earlier period, the proportion of bacteremic pneumonia among all IPD cases was almost 3-fold greater in 2009 to 2010 (P < 0.01). PCV7 serotypes accounted for 7%, whereas the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes accounted for 77% of all cases between 2007 and 2009. IPD due to serotypes 19A and 7F increased, and 19A and 7F were isolated in 41% and 20% of all IPD cases in the same period, respectively. Serotype 19A also comprised a majority of the penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant isolates. Analysis of multilocus sequence typing data showed a significant increase in ST191, ST695 and ST320 and a significant decrease in ST199 and ST180.	The reduction in IPD after introduction of PCV7 persists in Massachusetts children; however, serotypes causing IPD have changed significantly in the last decade. Continued surveillance is necessary to determine the impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, as well as track potential changes in disease incidence and character due to non-13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Mice were treated with drug-admixed food of increasing concentration (1, 2 and 3 mg/g food) every third day for 9 days. Morphine- and codeine-treated mice showed withdrawal signs when they were given naloxone (5 mg/kg, s.c.), while pethidine-treated mice did not show the withdrawal signs. However, mice treated with pethidine-admixed food (1-6 mg/g food) for 28 days showed naloxone precipitated withdrawal signs. Thus, the data obtained with mice indicate that pethidine produces a weak physical dependence. On the other hand, codeine (40 mg/kg, s.c.) and pethidine (100 mg/kg, s.c.) administration suppressed the abrupt withdrawal signs of morphine-dependent mice that were treated with morphine-admixed food, while the withdrawal signs were completely suppressed in mice administered only 5 mg/kg morphine.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on neurologic recovery after 15-min complete global cerebral ischemia in a canine model. Complete global ischemia was induced in 19 dogs by occlusion of the ascending aorta and the caval veins. Nine dogs were randomized to treatment with hyperbaric oxygenation (3 atmospheres absolute, 100% oxygen for 1 hr) at 3, 24, and 29 hrs after ischemia under spontaneous respiration, while the other ten dogs served as the control group without hyperbaric oxygen therapy (group C). Neurologic recovery was evaluated based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) activity score (1 = normal; 5 = isoelectric) and the neurologic recovery score (100 = normal; 0 = brain death) over a 14-day postischemic period.	The survival rates were 3/10 (30%) in the control group vs. 7/9 (78%) in the group treated with hyperbaric oxygen (p < .05). Over the 14-day postischemic period, the best (lowest) EEG scores of each dog were significantly (1.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.3; mean +/- SE, p < .01) lower in the hyperbaric oxygen-treated group. The best neurologic recovery scores of each dog were significantly (69 +/- 6 vs. 48 +/- 5; mean +/- SE, p < .05) higher in the treated animals. The number of dogs that recovered to a neurologic recovery score of > 65 (assessed as a slight disability) were 1/10 in the control group and 6/9 in the group treated with hyperbaric oxygen (p < .02).

The authors analyze the clinical and financial outcomes of OUD in a contemporary cohort of AMI hospitalizations.	All non-elective adult (≥ 18 years) hospitalizations for AMI were tabulated from the 2016‒2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database using relevant International Classification of Disease codes. Patients were grouped into OUD and non-OUD cohorts. Bivariate and regression analyses were performed to identify the independent association of OUD with outcomes after non-elective admission for AMI, as well as subsequent readmission.	Of an estimated 3,318,257 hospitalizations for AMI meeting study criteria, 36,057 (1.1%) had a concomitant diagnosis of OUD. While OUD was not significantly associated with mortality, OUD patients experienced superior cardiovascular outcomes compared to non-OUD. However, OUD was linked to increased odds of non-cardiovascular complications, length of stay, costs, non-home discharge, and 30-day non-elective readmission.	Patients with OUD presented with AMI at a significantly younger age than non-OUD. While OUD appears to have a cardioprotective effect, it is associated with several markers of increased resource use, including readmission. The present findings underscore the need for a multifaceted approach to increasing social services and treatment for OUD at index hospitalization.",Remaining

The CENTURION study was the first phase 3 study of lasmiditan in Caucasian and Chinese patients with migraine. This post hoc analysis further demonstrates the safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population and was urgently needed.	Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to lasmiditan 200 mg lasmiditan 100 mg, or a control group. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), their severity, and incidence by treated attacks for frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 5%) were evaluated. The duration, onset, and relationship of efficacy with very common TEAEs (≥ 10%) was analyzed.	A total of 281 Chinese patients were included in this post hoc analysis. No deaths and no study drug-related treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were reported. The incidence of at least one TEAE was higher in patients receiving lasmiditan 200 mg (73.9%) and 100 mg (66.3%) versus placebo (26.6%). TEAEs were generally mild or moderate in severity, and the incidence of frequently reported TEAEs was generally highest during the first attack. Very common TEAEs with lasmiditan included dizziness, asthenia, somnolence, muscular weakness, fatigue, and nausea. The duration of dizziness was longest during the first attack. There were no cardio-cerebrovascular ischemic events and serotonin syndrome. The presence of very common TEAEs (except nausea), and severe dizziness, did not appear to have a negative influence on the efficacy.	In the Chinese population of the CENTURION study, most of the TEAEs were neurologic, of mild or moderate severity, and self-limiting. The distribution of frequently reported TEAEs at the first attack differed from the primary cohort, while the overall safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population was generally consistent with the CENTURION primary cohort. No new safety concerns were observed in the Chinese population.	NCT03670810.	Although there is significant unmet medical need among patients with migraine, there has been no novel compound for treatment of migraine over past two decades in China. These unmet medical needs persist because the current available medications for the acute treatment of migraine are reported to have safety and tolerability issues. Lasmiditan is a new class of acute migraine medication (5-HT receptor agonist with high selectivity for the 5-HT1F receptor) with a proven efficacy and safety in phase 2 and 3 studies. Owing to some differences in clinical practice between China and western countries, there is need to get additional evidence on safety of lasmiditan in the Chinese population to support its usage in clinical practice.This post hoc analysis was conducted to present the detailed safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population using data from the CENTURION study. Approximately half of the analyzed population was not covered in the published primary cohort.The results show that in the Chinese population of the study, most of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neurologic, of mild or moderate severity, and self-limiting. The distribution of frequently reported TEAEs at the first attack differed from the primary cohort with no new safety concerns observed in the Chinese population. The overall safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population was generally consistent with the primary cohort.

To assess the spatial and temporal expression patterns of transforming growth factor-beta1 and -beta2 (TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2) in the human spinal cord after traumatic injury.	Germany, Aachen, Aachen University Hospital.	Sections from human spinal cords from 4 control patients and from 14 patients who died at different time points after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) were investigated immunohistochemically.	In control cases, TGF-beta1 was confined to occasional blood vessels, intravascular monocytes and some motoneurons, whereas TGF-beta2 was only found in intravascular monocytes. After traumatic SCI, TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity was dramatically upregulated by 2 days after injury (the earliest survival time investigated) and was detected within neurons, astrocytes and invading macrophages. The staining was most intense over the first weeks after injury but gradually declined by 1 year. TGF-beta2 immunoreactivity was first detected 24 days after injury. It was located in macrophages and astrocytes and remained elevated for up to 1 year. In white matter tracts undergoing Wallerian degeneration, there was no induction of either isoform.	The early induction of TGF-beta1 at the point of SCI suggests a role in the acute inflammatory response and formation of the glial scar, while the later induction of TGF-beta2 may indicate a role in the maintenance of the scar. Neither of these TGF-beta isoforms appears to contribute to the astrocytic scar formation in nerve fibre tracts undergoing Wallerian degeneration.",Remaining

Extreme overloading experienced internally may not be externally visible. Identifying stressful situations at an early stage may avoid socially problematic behaviour from occurring, such as self-injurious behaviour. Activation of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) is involved in the response to anxiety, which can be measured through heart rate variability and skin conductance with the use of portable devices, non-intrusively and pain-free. Thus, developing innovative analysis of signal perception and reaction is necessary, mainly for non-communicative individuals with autism.	The protocol will take place in real life (home and social environments). We aim to associate modifications of the ANS with external events that will be recorded in a synchronous manner through a specific design (spy glasses with video/audio recording). Four phases will be carried out on ASD participants and aged-matched controls: (1) 24-hour baseline pre-experiment (physical activity, sleep), (2) 2 h in a real life situation, (3) 30 min in a quiet environment, interrupted by a few seconds of stressful sound, (4) an interview to record feelings about events triggering anxiety. ASD and control participants will be together for phases 2 and 3, revealing different physiological responses to the same situations, and thus identifying potentially problematic events. The novelty will be to apply time-series analyses (which led to several Nobel Prizes in quantitative finance) on ANS series (heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance) and wrist motion.	Ethical approval has been obtained from Ethics Committee of Clermont-Ferrand (South-East I), France (2014-A00611-46). Trial findings will be disseminated via open-access peer-reviewed publications, conferences, clinical networks, public lectures and our websites.

Malaria pigment, recognizable within the cytoplasm of phagocytic cells by light microscopy may represent a peripheral marker for parasite biomass. One hundred seventy-two index cases of severe malaria and 172 healthy age-, residence-, and ethnicity-matched controls with uncomplicated malaria in Bandiagara, Mali were analyzed prospectively for presence of malaria pigment. The presence of polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) and monocyte pigment was strongly associated with severe disease compared with uncomplicated malaria. Total PMN pigment burden in children with severe malaria was higher in those with cerebral manifestations and with combined cerebral manifestations and severe anemia (hemoglobin < or = 5 g/dL) but was not associated with hyperparasitemia (> 500,000 asexual forms/mm3). Additionally, pigmented PMNs/mm3 was associated with a fatal outcome in patients with severe malaria. This study validates the presence of malaria pigment in monocytes and neutrophils as a marker for disease severity, and demonstrates that pigmented neutrophils are associated with cerebral malaria and with death in children with severe malaria.",Remaining
1468,20058555,Stapp car crash journal,A finite element model of region-specific response for mild diffuse brain injury.,"It is well known that rotational loading is responsible for a spectrum of diffuse brain injuries spanning from concussion to diffuse axonal trauma. Many experimental studies have been performed to understand the pathological and biomechanical factors associated with diffuse brain injuries. Finite element models have also been developed to correlate experimental findings with intrinsic variables such as strain. However, a paucity of studies exist examining the combined role of the strain-time parameter. Consequently, using the principles of finite element analysis, the present study introduced the concept of sustained maximum principal strain (SMPS) criterion and explored its potential applicability to diffuse brain injury. An algorithm was developed to determine if the principal strain in a finite element of the brain exceeded a specified magnitude over a specific time interval. The anatomical and geometrical details of the rat for the two-dimensional model were obtained from published data. Using material properties from literature and iterative techniques, the model was validated under three distinct rotational loading conditions indicative of non-injury, concussion, and diffuse axonal trauma. Validation results produced a set of material properties to define the model and were deemed appropriate to examine the role of sustained strain as an indicator of the mechanics of mild diffuse brain injury at the local level. Using a separate set of histological data obtained from graded mild diffuse brain injury experimental studies in rats, different formulations of SMPS criterion were evaluated. For the hippocampus and parietal cortex regions, 4-4 SMPS criterion was found to most closely match with the pattern of histological results. This was further verified by correlating the fractional areas to the time of unconsciousness for each animal group. Although not fully conclusive, these results are valuable in the understanding of diffuse brain injury pathologies following rotational loading.",Animal-other

Use of fissure dissection is also practical in the posterior fossa. In this study, the microsurgical anatomy of the 3 cerebellar-brainstem fissures (cerebellomesencephalic, cerebellopontine, and cerebellomedullary) and the various procedures exposing these fissures in brainstem surgery were examined. METHODS Seven cadaveric heads were examined with a microsurgical technique and 3 with fiber dissection to clarify the anatomy of the cerebellar-brainstem and adjacent cerebellar fissures, in which the major vessels and neural structures are located. Several approaches directed along the cerebellar surfaces and fissures, including the supracerebellar infratentorial, occipital transtentorial, retrosigmoid, and midline suboccipital approaches, were examined. The 3 heads examined using fiber dissection defined the anatomy of the cerebellar peduncles coursing in the depths of these fissures. RESULTS Dissections directed along the cerebellar-brainstem and cerebellar fissures provided access to the posterior and posterolateral midbrain and upper pons, lateral pons, floor and lateral wall of the fourth ventricle, and dorsal and lateral medulla. CONCLUSIONS Opening the cerebellar-brainstem and adjacent cerebellar fissures provided access to the brainstem surface hidden by the cerebellum, while minimizing division of neural tissue. Most of the major cerebellar arteries, veins, and vital neural structures are located in or near these fissures and can be accessed through them.",Remaining

We examined measures of self-report, as well as behavioral, physiological, and facial responses to errors during a Stop-Change Task. 25 participants with HD and 32 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Participants reported on number of errors committed and pre/post emotional response to errors. Skin conductance response (SCR) during correct and error commission trials was examined. Facial expression during task performance was coded for self-conscious and negative emotions. HD and HC participants had significantly different error rates but comparable error correction and post-error slowing. SCR was significantly lower for HD during error commission than for HC. During error trials, HD participants showed a significant deficit in displays of self-conscious emotions compared to HC. Self-reported emotions were increased in HD, with more negative and self-conscious emotion reported than was reported for HC participants. These findings suggest that hypoactive emotional responding at a physiological level may play a role in how errors are processed in individuals with HD.",Remaining

We performed a systematic analysis of 12 autosomal-dominant PD (AD-PD) genes (SNCA, LRRK2, GIGYF2, VPS35, EIF4G1, DNAJC13, CHCHD2, HTRA2, NR4A2, RIC3, TMEM230, and UCHL1) using panel sequencing and database filtration in a case-control study of a cohort of 391 Chinese sporadic PD patients and unrelated controls. We evaluated the association between candidate variants and sporadic PD using gene-based analysis.	Overall, 18 rare variants were discovered in 18.8% (36/191) of the index patients. In addition to previously reported pathogenic mutations (LRRK2 p.Arg1441His and p.Ala419Val), another four unknown variants were found in LRRK2, which also contribute to PD risk (p = 0.002; odds ratio (OR) = 7.83, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.76-34.93). The cumulative frequency of undetermined rare variants was significantly higher in PD patients (14.1%) than in controls (3.5%) (p = 0.0002; OR=4.54, 95% CI = 1.93-10.69).	Our results confirm the strong impact of LRRK2 on the risk of sporadic PD, and also provide considerable evidence of the existence of additional undetermined rare variants in AD-PD genes that contribute to the genetic etiology of sporadic PD in a Chinese cohort.",Remaining

Neuropsychological performance and neurological status at baseline and at 12-month follow-up.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether HIV infection is associated with neurological or neuropsychological impairment in the asymptomatic and early symptomatic stages of disease. Subjects included 61 gay men (41 HIV-, 20 HIV+) who were assessed at the time of requesting their first HIV test and again 12 months later. The assessments at baseline were conducted double-blind to HIV serostatus. Measures included a neuropsychological battery, neurological examination and full psychiatric assessment. There were no differences between the asymptomatic HIV+ and HIV- groups at baseline or at follow-up in terms of mean scores on neuropsychological tests. Mean scores were within the normal range for all neuropsychological tests for both groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict each individual's performance at follow-up on the basis of their baseline performance, psychiatric state, neurological history and drug use for each of the neuropsychological tests. HIV+ subjects were more likely than control subjects to perform at a significantly lower level at follow-up on one or more tests than predicted on the basis of their baseline performance.",Remaining
1474,28317947,NeuroImage. Clinical,Parietal operculum and motor cortex activities predict motor recovery in moderate to severe stroke.,"While motor recovery following mild stroke has been extensively studied with neuroimaging, mechanisms of recovery after moderate to severe strokes of the types that are often the focus for novel restorative therapies remain obscure. We used fMRI to: 1) characterize reorganization occurring after moderate to severe subacute stroke, 2) identify brain regions associated with motor recovery and 3) to test whether brain activity associated with passive movement measured in the subacute period could predict motor outcome six months later. Because many patients with large strokes involving sensorimotor regions cannot engage in voluntary movement, we used passive flexion-extension of the paretic wrist to compare 21 patients with subacute ischemic stroke to 24 healthy controls one month after stroke. Clinical motor outcome was assessed with Fugl-Meyer motor scores (motor-FMS) six months later. Multiple regression, with predictors including baseline (one-month) motor-FMS and sensorimotor network regional activity (ROI) measures, was used to determine optimal variable selection for motor outcome prediction. Sensorimotor network ROIs were derived from a meta-analysis of arm voluntary movement tasks. Bootstrapping with 1000 replications was used for internal model validation. During passive movement, both control and patient groups exhibited activity increases in multiple bilateral sensorimotor network regions, including the primary motor (MI), premotor and supplementary motor areas (SMA), cerebellar cortex, putamen, thalamus, insula, Brodmann area (BA) 44 and parietal operculum (OP1-OP4). Compared to controls, patients showed: 1) lower task-related activity in ipsilesional MI, SMA and contralesional cerebellum (lobules V-VI) and 2) higher activity in contralesional MI, superior temporal gyrus and OP1-OP4. Using multiple regression, we found that the combination of baseline motor-FMS, activity in ipsilesional MI (BA4a), putamen and ipsilesional OP1 predicted motor outcome measured 6 months later (adjusted-R[2] = 0.85; bootstrap p < 0.001). Baseline motor-FMS alone predicted only 54% of the variance. When baseline motor-FMS was removed, the combination of increased activity in ipsilesional MI-BA4a, ipsilesional thalamus, contralesional mid-cingulum, contralesional OP4 and decreased activity in ipsilesional OP1, predicted better motor outcome (djusted-R[2] = 0.96; bootstrap p < 0.001). In subacute stroke, fMRI brain activity related to passive movement measured in a sensorimotor network defined by activity during voluntary movement predicted motor recovery better than baseline motor-FMS alone. Furthermore, fMRI sensorimotor network activity measures considered alone allowed excellent clinical recovery prediction and may provide reliable biomarkers for assessing new therapies in clinical trial contexts. Our findings suggest that neural reorganization related to motor recovery from moderate to severe stroke results from balanced changes in ipsilesional MI (BA4a) and a set of phylogenetically more archaic sensorimotor regions in the ventral sensorimotor trend, in which OP1 and OP4 processes may complement the ipsilesional dorsal motor cortex in achieving compensatory sensorimotor recovery.",Remaining

Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of cellular dysfunction associated with the expression of faulty PD genes.	We developed a yeast model for full-length LRRK2 studies. We expressed wild-type (wt) LRRK2 and mutations and evaluated their role during oxidative stress conditions. The involvement of mitochondria was assessed by using rho-zero mutants and by evaluating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry. The involvement of endocytosis was also studied by testing several endocytic mutants and by following the vacuolar delivery of the probe FM4-64.	Expression of LRRK2 in yeast was associated to increased hydrogen peroxide resistance. This phenotype, which was dependent on mitochondrial function, was not observed for PD-mutants G2019S and R1441C or in the absence of the kinase activity and the WD40 repeat domain. Expression of the pathogenic mutants stimulated ROS production and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. For the PD-mutants, but not for wild-type LRRK2, endocytic defects were also observed. Additionally, several endocytic proteins were required for LRRK2-mediated protection against hydrogen peroxide.	Our results indicate that LRRK2 confers cellular protection during oxidative stress depending on mitochondrial function and endocytosis.	Both the loss of capacity of LRRK2 pathogenic mutants to protect against oxidative stress and their enhancement of dysfunction may be important for the development of PD during the aging process.",In-vitro-study
1476,15365721,Acta neuropathologica,Adult onset thalamocerebellar degeneration in dogs associated to neuronal storage of ceroid lipopigment.,"Late onset of hereditary cerebellar cortical abiotrophy has been described in a large variety of canine breeds. In some reported conditions, the cerebellar lesion is combined with degeneration of other systems. Here we describe a new hereditary cerebellar cortical degeneration in eight adult American Staffordshire and Pit Bull Terriers. The neuronal degeneration in these animals not only affects Purkinje cells of the cerebellum but also certain thalamic nuclei. In addition, nerve cell loss appears to be associated with a lysosomal storage disease, which is restricted to the affected cell populations. The stored material was histologically and ultrastructurally identified as fluorescent lipopigment. Since animals were euthanized at various stages of the disease, it could be shown that lysosomal storage preceded neuronal loss. Selective involvement of restricted neuronal populations is highly unusual in ceroid lipofuscinoses. It remains to be determined if the present neurodegenerative disease is caused by a primary or secondary neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.",Animal-other

The present study aimed to comprehensively examine the psychometric profile and criterion-related validity of an 18-item RAPI adapted to measure negative consequences resulting from alcohol and other drug use in an at-risk adolescent population.	Categorical confirmatory factor analysis and the graded response model were used for evaluations of the latent factor structure, item properties, test information, and item invariance across gender, age groups (middle vs. late adolescence), and drug use profiles (readily available drugs vs. other illicit drugs), as well as computation of the item response theory scale scores for each of 617 alternative high school students (44% female).	A reduced set of 16 RAPI items provided plausible evidence of unidimensionality and good measurement precision at a relatively wide range of the latent trait continuum. All but two items were invariant across the drug use profiles. The other illicit drug group had higher levels of the latent substance-related problems than the readily available drug group. Criterion-related validity was supported using a measure of past-year polysubstance use.	The RAPI can be effectively modified to measure negative consequences resulting from alcohol and other drug use and reflects a sufficiently wide range of the latent continuum of problem use.",Remaining
1479,21668435,Clinical and experimental immunology,Immune adaptive microenvironment profiles in intracerebral and intrasplenic lymphomas share common characteristics.,"A large body of evidence indicates that the immune microenvironment controls tumour development. Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) are aggressive tumours growing in the central nervous system (CNS). To evaluate the role and characteristics of this immune-privileged site in anti-tumour defences, we compared the cellular and molecular immune microenvironments of growing murine lymphoma B cells injected into the brain or the spleen. In the brain, immune cells, including dendritic cells and T lymphocytes with a large proportion of CD4(+) forkhead box P3 (FoxP3(+)) regulatory T cells, rapidly infiltrated the tumour microenvironment. These populations also increased in number in the spleen. The T cell cytokine profiles in tumour-bearing mice were similar in the two sites, with predominant T helper type 1 (Th1)/Th17 polarization after polyclonal stimulation, although some interleukin (IL)-4 could also be found. We demonstrated that these T cells have anti-tumour activity in the CNS, although less than in the spleen: nude mice that received lymphoma cells intracerebrally died significantly earlier than immunocompetent animals. These results demonstrate that the brain is able to recruit all the major actors to mount a specific anti-tumour immune response against lymphoma.",Animal-other

A two-stage cross-sectional study, carried out between 2012 and 2014, included all 9th grade students from 5 Arab localities, representative of 77% of the Muslim and 100% of Druze citizens in Israel. During the screening stage, 1639 students completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in the classroom (response rate = 69.3%). During the follow-up stage, 704 adolescent-mother dyads were interviewed at home; using the Development and Well-Being Assessment, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12, the Subjective Feeling of Discrimination Index (FDI), and socio-demographic questions (response rate = 84.4%).	Prevalence of any disorder, internalizing or externalizing disorders among Muslim adolescents were 19.2, 15.8 and 4.2%, respectively and among Druze adolescents 10.9, 5.9 and 5.5%, respectively. Muslim adolescents were 3.2 times more likely than Druze adolescents to have an internalizing disorder, while Druze were 2 times more likely than Muslim to have an externalizing disorder. Males were at higher risk than females for externalizing disorders in both populations, though among Druze the risk was more striking. Learning disabilities increased the likelihood of having an externalizing disorder in both populations. Risk factors for internalizing disorders among Muslim adolescents were female gender, a very low socio-economic level, few siblings, LD, high maternal GHQ-12 score and high FDI; and for externalizing disorders, male gender, a relatively low socio-economic level but not the lowest, learning disability and high maternal GHQ-12 score.	We found an association between religion/ethnicity and internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as a strong correlation between religion/ethnicity and socio-economic variables. Therefore, we tend to conclude that not religion per se but the multifaceted socio-cultural and economic factors that characterize religious groups are associated with mental disorders. Very low socio-economic level and feeling discriminated which were traits connected only to Muslim adolescents, were associated with internalizing disorders. When preparing preventive measures aimed at furthering mental health among minority adolescents, authorities should focus on improving the socio-economic status of minorities and reducing institutional and personal discrimination.

Occupational therapists play a central role in rehabilitation as members of a multidisciplinary team. Occupational therapy is a client-centered profession that uses meaningful activities across the spectrum of physical and mental domains to reduce limitations after stroke. Where remediation is not possible, occupational therapists implement compensatory strategies to promote independence. Rehabilitation is based on the concept of brain plasticity, which implies that it is possible to modulate or facilitate cerebral reorganization by external inputs. Occupational therapy activities are specifically geared to promote this re-education process and encourage the development of lost skills while accommodating for specific physical, cognitive or affective impairments. Principles of motor, sensory, cognitive and affective rehabilitation are incorporated into effective task-specific activities and environments are adapted to create the optimum conditions for successful rehabilitation.

Out of the 21 883 patients included, 29% started benzodiazepine/Z-drug treatment, of whom one in five became long-term users. Patients who were prescribed clonazepam or alprazolam had high odds for subsequent long-term use (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] 3.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24-6.38] and 2.03 [95% CI 1.30-3.18], respectively), compared to those prescribed diazepam. Polytherapy with benzodiazepines/Z-drugs also predicted long-term use (aOR 2.46, 95% CI 1.79-3.38), as did age ≥60 years (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.46-2.53, compared to age <30 years), and concomitant treatment with psychostimulants (aOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.33-2.39).	The incidence of subsequent long-term use among bipolar benzodiazepine initiators is high. Patients on clonazepam, alprazolam or benzodiazepine/Z-drug polytherapy have the highest risk of becoming long-term users, suggesting that these treatments should be used restrictively.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
1490,35154618,Journal of healthcare engineering,Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression: Evaluation of Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Accurate diagnosis of this disease in the early stages is crucial for its initial treatment. This paper aims to present a comparative study on the methods developed by machine learning techniques in PD diagnosis. We rely on clustering and prediction learning approaches to perform the comparative study. Specifically, we use different clustering techniques for PD data clustering and support vector regression ensembles to predict Motor-UPDRS and Total-UPDRS. The results are then compared with the other prediction learning approaches, multiple linear regression, neurofuzzy, and support vector regression techniques. The comparative study is performed on a real-world PD dataset. The prediction results of data analysis on a PD real-world dataset revealed that expectation-maximization with the aid of SVR ensembles can provide better prediction accuracy in relation to decision trees, deep belief network, neurofuzzy, and support vector regression combined with other clustering techniques in the prediction of Motor-UPDRS and Total-UPDRS.",Remaining
1491,34057668,Journal of gambling studies,Predicting Problem Gambling Severity: Interplay between Emotion Dysregulation and Gambling-related Cognitions.,"Understanding how emotion regulation and gambling-related cognitive distortions relate to gambling problems has direct relevance for problem gambling prevention and treatment. Although these factors have been identified as robust psychological correlates for problem gambling, the interplay between emotional regulation and cognitive biases in influencing problem gambling behaviours is yet to be fully understood. Accordingly, this study examined the explanatory role of cognitive distortions in the association between emotion regulation difficulties and problem gambling behaviours and also explored the interaction between emotion regulation and cognitive distortions in predicting gambling severity. A total of 301 adults (182 males and 119 females; age range: 18-71 years, M = 32.62, SD = 10.03) completed an online questionnaire comprising measures of emotional regulation difficulties, gambling-related beliefs and problem gambling severity. Analyses revealed that emotion regulation difficulties and erroneous gambling beliefs were positively related to problem gambling severity. Further, cognitive distortions partially accounted for the relationship between emotional regulation difficulties and problem gambling, although emotion regulation retained a direct relationship with problem gambling. There was no interaction between emotional regulation and cognitive distortions. The findings indicate that emotion regulation may serve as a precursor to the development of cognitive distortions, while also directly influencing problem gambling. Implications for assessment and treatment of problem gambling are discussed.",Remaining

Other partner dances may be more suitable and preferable for those with Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of tango, waltz/foxtrot and no intervention on functional motor control in individuals with Parkinson's disease.	This study employed a randomized, between- notsubject, prospective, repeated measures design.	Fifty-eight people with mild-moderate Parkinson's disease participated.	Participants were randomly assigned to tango, waltz/foxtrot or no intervention (control) groups. Those in the dance groups attended 1-h classes twice a week, completing 20 lessons in 13 weeks. Balance, functional mobility, forward and backward walking were evaluated before and after the intervention.	Both dance groups improved more than the control group, which did not improve. The tango and waltz/foxtrot groups improved significantly on the Berg Balance Scale, 6-minute walk distance, and backward stride length. The tango group improved as much or more than those in the waltz/foxtrot group on several measures.	Tango may target deficits associated with Parkinson's disease more than waltz/foxtrot, but both dances may benefit balance and locomotion.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention

It is insidious and multifactorial. Clinical management can be complex. This systematic review describes effects of interventions for the prevention and management of respiratory disease in young people with CP.	Nine databases (Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, EMCare, MEDLINE, PEDro, OpenGrey, ScienceDirect, and SpeechBITE) were searched. Eligibility criteria were as follows: the population included at least 50% individuals with CP aged under 26 years, the intervention was for chronic respiratory illness, the outcomes were any measurable indicators of respiratory health or morbidity; the study design could be any original study reporting effects of an intervention on measurable outcomes, and the study was published January 1998 or later. The American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine methodology guided study appraisal and synthesis. The review was registered with PROSPERO (reference number CRD42018086314).	The search yielded 3,347 papers; 37 papers (reporting 34 studies) of these met the eligibility criteria. They included 582 participants with CP (ranging from 1 to 77 across studies) with ages from 5 months to 25 years. Interventions were diverse and included: airway clearance techniques, exercise, positioning, mealtime management, salivary management, upper airway interventions, antibiotics, gastro-intestinal interventions, and spinal surgery. There were no interventions aimed at prevention of respiratory disease in this population. Research designs were classified as Levels 2 (n = 3), 3 (n = 2), 4 (n = 25), and 5 (n = 4).	Evidence for most respiratory interventions for young people with CP is absent or weak. No controlled trials demonstrated significant effects on respiratory morbidity, owing to their scarcity, weak designs, and inadequate power. There is an urgent need for well-designed prospective controlled studies investigating prevention and management of respiratory disease in young people with CP.",Human-systematic-review

This cross-sectional study involved 163 patients having been hospitalised for at least 24 hours. The patients were asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire previously approved by the Greek Ministry of Health. Four aspects of satisfaction were investigated (medical, hotel accommodation/ organisational facilities, nursing, global). Using Principal Component Analysis, summated scales were formed and tested for internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The non parametric Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was also used and the threshold p-value for statistical significance (2-sided) was set at 0.05.	The results revealed a high degree of global satisfaction (73.31%), yet satisfaction was higher for the medical (88.88%) and nursing (84.26%) services. Moreover, satisfaction derived from the accommodation facilities and the general organisation was found to be more limited (74.17%). Statistically significant differences (based on various demographic variables) in the participants' global satisfaction were not observed. On the contrary, self-assessment of health status at admission was negatively correlated with medical (r(s)=-0.157, p=0.045) and nursing (r(s)=-0.168, p=0.032) satisfaction. Greek citizenship contributed to bigger satisfaction scores in the accommodation/organisational facilities dimension (r(s)=0.158, p=0.044). Finally, age was positively linked to nursing satisfaction (r(s)=0.181, p=0.02).	The present study confirmed in part the results of previously published Greek surveys assessing general patient populations.

1498,27070004,Journal of Parkinson's disease,Impaired Switching from Self-Prepared Actions in Mild Parkinson Disease.,"Planned and initiated actions frequently need to be terminated in favor of another action. It is known that many individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) have more difficulty self-initiating movement (i.e., endogenously evoked movement)than moving in response to environmental stimuli (i.e., exogenously evoked movement). However, it is not known if individuals with PD display this same endogenous-exogenous asymmetry when needing to terminate, disengage, and reprogram movements.	This study used a novel reaction time (RT) paradigm to test whether patients with mild PD have subclinical deficits of endogenous movement initiation and endogenous movement reprogramming.	Twelve non-demented individuals with PD on medication and 15 demographically similar healthy control (HC)participants completed an experimental paradigm that examined their RTs (key press) following self-selected valid action preparation (endogenous cues) versus valid exogenously presented cues. The paradigm also assessed participants' ability to rapidly stop their endogenous or exogenous preparation following an invalid cue and execute an alternative action (key press).	Participants with PD produced similar RTs as controls following endogenous and exogenous valid cues, and following invalid exogenous cues. However, following invalid endogenous cues, PD participants were slower than HC participants to stop an endogenous preparation and execute an alternative action.	Despite having mild disease and being on dopaminergic medication, these individuals with PD displayed deficits in motor disengagement and reprograming of self-selected actions. Future studies should examine how this phenomenon influences every day actions, as well as possible treatments for this deficit.",Remaining
1499,13680082,Psychopharmacology,"The sleep-improving effects of doxepin are paralleled by a normalized plasma cortisol secretion in primary insomnia. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over study followed by an open treatment over 3 weeks.","In primary care, sedating antidepressants are often used for treating insomnia, although their underlying sleep-promoting mechanisms are only incompletely understood. Since enhanced evening and nocturnal plasma cortisol levels are supposed to maintain insomniac sleep complaints, a functional link between sleep and cortisol secretion in the mode of action of antidepressants in insomnia might be suspected.	We therefore investigated the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin on nocturnal sleep and plasma cortisol concentration in ten patients (age 41.3+/-9.5 years) with chronic primary insomnia between 1700 hours and 0800 hours.	Single infusions of placebo and 25 mg doxepin were applied following a double-blind, randomized cross-over design. Afterward, all patients received 25 mg doxepin p.o. for 3 weeks in an open-study design.	Both doxepin application forms improved sleep significantly and reduced mean cortisol levels from 9.0+/-1.7 microg/l (single placebo i.v.) to 7.5+/-1.6 microg/l (single doxepin i.v.) or 7.6+/-2.0 microg/l (subchronic doxepin p.o.). The duration of the quiescent period of the cortisol rhythm was significantly prolonged following both doxepin administrations compared with placebo.	The results implicate that the sleep-improving effects of doxepin are mediated at least in part by a normalization of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functions. Although in some patients rebound insomnia and specific side effects must be considered, our findings give a further rationale for the use of antidepressants in the treatment of primary insomnia.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention
1500,27035548,Journal of neurosurgery. Pediatrics,Toward a better understanding of the cellular basis for cerebrospinal fluid shunt obstruction: report on the construction of a bank of explanted hydrocephalus devices.,"OBJECTIVE Shunt obstruction by cells and/or tissue is the most common cause of shunt failure. Ventricular catheter obstruction alone accounts for more than 50% of shunt failures in pediatric patients. The authors sought to systematically collect explanted ventricular catheters from the Seattle Children's Hospital with a focus on elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying obstruction. METHODS In the operating room, explanted hardware was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Weekly, samples were transferred to buffer solution and stored at 4°C. After consent was obtained for their use, catheters were labeled using cell-specific markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1), and choroid plexus (transthyretin) in conjunction with a nuclear stain (Hoechst). Catheters were mounted in custom polycarbonate imaging chambers. Three-dimensional, multispectral, spinning-disk confocal microscopy was used to image catheter cerebrospinal fluid-intake holes (10× objective, 499.2-μm-thick z-stack, 2.4-μm step size, Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with motorized stage and charge-coupled device camera). Values are reported as the mean ± standard error of the mean and were compared using a 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. Significance was defined at p < 0.05. RESULTS Thirty-six ventricular catheters have been imaged to date, resulting in the following observations: 1) Astrocytes and microglia are the dominant cell types bound directly to catheter surfaces; 2) cellular binding to catheters is ubiquitous even if no grossly visible tissue is apparent; and 3) immunohistochemical techniques are of limited utility when a catheter has been exposed to Bugbee wire electrocautery. Statistical analysis of 24 catheters was performed, after excluding 7 catheters exposed to Bugbee wire cautery, 3 that were poorly fixed, and 2 that demonstrated pronounced autofluorescence. This analysis revealed that catheters with a microglia-dominant cellular response tended to be implanted for shorter durations (24.7 ± 6.7 days) than those with an astrocyte-dominant response (1183 ± 642 days; p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Ventricular catheter occlusion remains a significant source of shunt morbidity in the pediatric population, and given their ability to intimately associate with catheter surfaces, astrocytes and microglia appear to be critical to this pathophysiology. Microglia tend to be the dominant cell type on catheters implanted for less than 2 months, while astrocytes tend to be the most prevalent cell type on catheters implanted for longer time courses and are noted to serve as an interface for the secondary attachment of ependymal cells and choroid plexus.",Remaining

We examined the association between this knowledge and event rate.	We studied 174 anticoagulated patients with AF aged 69±10.7 years (median CHA2DS2 -VASc 4). Knowledge was assessed at baseline using the Jessa AF Knowledge Questionnaire (JAKQ). The primary endpoint was a composite of ischemic cerebrovascular events, major or non-major clinically relevant bleeding, and death, recorded during a median follow-up of 42 months.	The primary endpoint occurred in 48 (27.5%) patients (10.5 per 100 patient-years) including 12 ischemic cerebrovascular events (2.2 per 100 patient-years) and 29 bleeding episodes (5.8 per 100 patient- years). Lower baseline JAKQ scores were associated with the primary outcome (p=0.007), solely when patients who bled during follow-up were compared with the remainder (p=0.007). Patients who were aware of the importance of a regular anticoagulant intake despite the absence of AF symptoms, had, however, a lower risk of cerebrovascular events (p<0.0001). The subjects who experienced bleeding or the primary endpoint were less likely to understand the essence of AF (p=0.03), to know safe painkillers used in combination with OAC (p<0.001), and what to do when the anticoagulant was forgotten (p=0.02). Worse knowledge about AF and OAC, longer OAC therapy, and higher CHA2DS2 -VASc score were independent predictors for the primary endpoint.	Our study shows a prognostic value of low knowledge about AF and OAC supporting the need for improved education of AF patients.",Remaining
1502,7512580,Journal of neuroimmunology,Transforming growth factor-beta 1 inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha/lymphotoxin production and adoptive transfer of disease by effector cells of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,"We previously reported that the CD4+ suppressor cells (Ts) that regulate recovery of Lewis rats from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) produce transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We also reported that TGF-beta downregulates interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, by the CD4+ effector T cells (Te) that mediate EAE. We now report that TGF-beta also inhibits the production of tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin (TNF/LT) by EAE effector cells. When activated in vitro with myelin basic protein (MBP), Te produced TNF/LT, as measured using a WEHI 164 cytotoxicity assay. The specificity of cytokine action was demonstrated using neutralizing antibodies to TNF/LT. When added to the Te+MBP cultures, TGF-beta inhibited TNF/LT production in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibodies augmented TNF/LT production in the Te+MBP cultures. We also confirm that TGF-beta inhibits adoptive transfer of EAE. In contrast, murine IL-10 only partially inhibited TNF/LT and IFN-gamma production by Te. We conclude that TGF-beta production by Ts plays a major role in recovery from EAE in the Lewis rat by inhibiting TNF/LT and IFN-gamma production by the effector cells that mediate EAE.",Animal-drug-intervention

We estimated the population-weighted exposure level (PWEL) of PM10 concentrations in Malaysia for 2000, 2008, and 2013 using aerosol optical density (AOD) data from publicly available remote sensing satellite data (MODIS Terra). The PWEL was then converted to PM2.5 using Malaysia's WHO ambient air conversion factor. We used AirQ+ 2.0 software to calculate all-cause (natural), ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer (LC), and acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) excess deaths from the National Burden of Disease data for 2000, 2008 and 2013. The average PWELs for annual PM2.5 for 2000, 2008, and 2013 were 22 μg m-3, 18 μg m-3 and 24 μg m-3, respectively. Using the WHO 2005 Air Quality Guideline cut-off point of PM2.5 of 10 μg m-3, the estimated excess deaths for 2000, 2008, and 2013 from all-cause (natural) mortality were between 5893 and 9781 (95 % CI: 3347-12,791), COPD was between 164 and 957 (95 % CI: 95-1411), lung cancer was between 109 and 307 (95 % CI: 63-437), IHD was between 3 and 163 deaths, according to age groups (95 % CI: 2-394) and stroke was between 6 and 155 deaths, according to age groups (95 % CI: 3-261). An increase in estimated health endpoints was associated with increased estimated PWEL PM2.5 for 2013 compared to 2000 and 2008. Adhering the ambient PM2.5 level to the Malaysian Air Quality Standard IT-2 would reduce the national health endpoints mortality.",Remaining

An effort to support impaired practitioners and to ensure patient safety and quality of care seem incompatible. To facilitate both, violations of the state nurse practice act must be reported, and the employee terminated if your documentation is adequate and treatment options you offer are not pursued. This harsh approach is necessary when the impaired practitioner puts patient care at risk. Kindness promotes chemical dependency, and the harsh action may be the only event that breaks through the denial. Fifteen percent of impaired practitioners who receive coordinated, supportive, and confrontational management are not motivated to seek treatment. Nurses must remember, however, that the remaining 85% respond positively to an established and comprehensive chemical dependency policy. Defined decision-making strategies concerning chemical dependency at the state and local level motivate practitioners to seek treatment to avoid licensure action. Perioperative nurses must meet the challenge to effectively manage chemical dependency. Employing recovering nurses in a structured framework is creative resource management.

Bilateral monocular and binocular visual acuities were assessed using high contrast (black letters on white background) and low contrast (2.5%, 1.25% grey letters on white background) visual acuity charts under controlled lighting conditions following refraction. Binocular summation was calculated as the difference between binocular and best monocular acuity scores. There were no associations between binocular or monocular high contrast visual acuity or low contrast visual acuity and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis (generalized estimating equation models accounting for age). Binocular summation was similar in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and control subjects. There was a small magnitude association between increased duration of ALS symptoms and reduced 1.25% low contrast visual acuity. This study does not confirm prior observations of impaired visual acuity in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and does not support this particular measure of visual function for use in broad scale assessment of visual pathway involvement in ALS patients.",Remaining

Activation of melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in several neurological diseases. In the present study, we have explored the role of MC1R activation on neuroinflammation and the potential underlying mechanisms after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats.	A total of 169 post-natal day 10 unsexed rat pups were used. HI was induced by right common carotid artery ligation followed by 2.5 h of hypoxia. BMS-470539, a specific selective MC1R agonist, was administered intranasally at 1 h after HI induction. To elucidate the potential underlying mechanism, MC1R CRISPR KO plasmid or Nurr1 CRISPR KO plasmid was administered via intracerebroventricular injection at 48 h before HI induction. Percent brain infarct area, short- and long-term neurobehavioral tests, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot were conducted.	The expression levels of MC1R and Nurr1 increased over time post-HI. MC1R and Nurr1 were expressed on microglia at 48 h post-HI. Activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 significantly reduced the percent infarct area, brain atrophy, and inflammation, and improved short- and long-term neurological deficits at 48 h and 28 days post-HI. MC1R activation increased the expression of CD206 (a microglial M2 marker) and reduced the expression of MPO. Moreover, activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 significantly increased the expression levels of MC1R, cAMP, p-PKA, and Nurr1, while downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β) at 48 h post-HI. However, knockout of MC1R or Nurr1 by specific CRISPR reversed the neuroprotective effects of MC1R activation post-HI.	Our study demonstrated that activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 attenuated neuroinflammation, and improved neurological deficits after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats.

1512,15642876,Archives of internal medicine,Statin use and survival outcomes in elderly patients with heart failure.,"Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of heart failure. Statins are efficacious drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, but their value in persons with heart failure remains unknown.	We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study involving the entire province of Ontario, Canada, restricting participants to those aged 66 to 85 years who were free of cancer and who survived at least 90 days following hospitalization for newly diagnosed heart failure. The primary study outcome was the risk of death from all causes, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke among persons newly dispensed statins (n = 1,146) relative to those who were not (n = 27,682).	The mean age of all participants was 76.5 years, and half were women. During the 7-year study period, death, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 217 statin recipients (13.6 per 100 person-years) vs 12,299 nonrecipients (21.8 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.83). Most of the benefit from statins was related to a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78). No significant reduction was seen for subsequent myocardial infarction (adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63-1.03) or stroke (adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.53-1.25).	Statin use is associated with a lower risk of death among seniors newly diagnosed as having congestive heart failure. While statin use has been previously shown to be efficacious in patients with coronary heart disease and stroke, we could not control for all prognostic risk factors in the present study, including left ventricular ejection fraction and serum lipid levels. Better evidence can direct clinicians about which patients with heart failure might benefit from these drugs.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

The aim of this study was to investigate the current state and estimated need for ECT in forensic psychiatry in Germany.	A questionnaire was designed consisting of questions about the current practice and estimated need for ECT in this population. This questionnaire was sent electronically (and by post if needed) to the forensic psychiatric hospitals in Germany.	We received replies from 52 hospitals (66%) and 29 of these hospitals stated that they were capable of treating patients with ECT. An indication for ECT treatment was seen in 3.4% of all detained patients across all forensic hospitals. In 1 year (2018) 32 ECT treatment courses were carried out with on average good effectiveness and a mean clinical global impressions (CGI) scale of 2.32. The most frequent reason for not using ECT was lack of structural requirements. Approximately one third of the forensic psychiatric hospitals stated that there was a medium or even high need for ECT in forensic psychiatry.	The use of ECT in German forensic psychiatry is currently very limited. It is striking that the number of applied ECT treatments is eight times lower in comparison to the frequency of indications. Nevertheless, approximately two thirds of the forensic hospitals stated a medium or high need for ECT, which seems to suggest a shortage of ECT in the treatment of forensic psychiatry patients.	HINTERGRUND UND ZIEL DER ARBEIT: Für die Elektrokonvulsionstherapie (EKT) liegen Leitlinienempfehlungen zur Behandlung schwerer affektiver und psychotischer Erkrankungen vor, wie sie auch bei Patienten im Maßregelvollzug (MRV) vorkommen.

Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist eine Erhebung des Ist-Zustands sowie des geschätzten Bedarfs an EKT im MRV.	Es wurde ein Fragebogen zur Erhebung der aktuellen Anwendung sowie der Einschätzung des Bedarfs an EKT in dieser Population entwickelt. Dieser wurde elektronisch und bei Bedarf postalisch an die forensischen Kliniken in Deutschland versendet.	Wir erhielten Antwort von 52 Kliniken (66 %). 29 der Kliniken gaben an, Patienten mit EKT behandeln zu können. Eine Behandlungsindikation wurde klinikübergreifend für 3,4 % der untergebrachten Patienten gesehen. In einem Jahr (2018) wurden insgesamt 32 EKT-Behandlungen an 12 Kliniken des Maßregelvollzugs mit durchschnittlich guter Wirksamkeit (Ø CGI‑I 2,32) durchgeführt.

ANCOVAR using Aphasia Screening as a covariate produced significant LHD versus RHD differences on PIQ. These data question the utility of VIQ-PIQ difference scores in the diagnosis of unilateral brain damage.

1515,32542379,Nucleic acids research,Full length RTEL1 is required for the elongation of the single-stranded telomeric overhang by telomerase.,"Telomeres cap the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and distinguish them from broken DNA ends to suppress DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest and genomic instability. Telomeres are elongated by telomerase to compensate for incomplete replication and nuclease degradation and to extend the proliferation potential of germ and stem cells and most cancers. However, telomeres in somatic cells gradually shorten with age, ultimately leading to cellular senescence. Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HHS) is characterized by accelerated telomere shortening and diverse symptoms including bone marrow failure, immunodeficiency, and neurodevelopmental defects. HHS is caused by germline mutations in telomerase subunits, factors essential for its biogenesis and recruitment to telomeres, and in the helicase RTEL1. While diverse phenotypes were associated with RTEL1 deficiency, the telomeric role of RTEL1 affected in HHS is yet unknown. Inducible ectopic expression of wild-type RTEL1 in patient fibroblasts rescued the cells, enabled telomerase-dependent telomere elongation and suppressed the abnormal cellular phenotypes, while silencing its expression resulted in gradual telomere shortening. Our observations reveal an essential role of the RTEL1 C-terminus in facilitating telomerase action at the telomeric 3' overhang. Thus, the common etiology for HHS is the compromised telomerase action, resulting in telomere shortening and reduced lifespan of telomerase positive cells.",In-vitro-study

An eight year follow-up study.,"The objective of this study was to report changes in characteristics of admissions to an established Psychiatric Emergency Care Centre (PECC) eight years after its opening.	Key clinical characteristics of admissions to the PECC were documented for 327 patients in 2015 and compared with the 477 patients in 2007, which is when the centre first opened. The characteristics of admission were evaluated using an audit of medical records from June to December in both 2007 and 2015.	Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) between 2007 and 2015 were: a reduction in the numbers of patients admitted with depression; a reduction in the numbers of patients diagnosed with adjustment disorder; an increase in the numbers of patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder; a reduction in pro re nata (prn) use, including a reduction in the need for chemical restraint with midazolam and a decrease in the length of admission in the PECC.	The significant reduction in aggression, the use of prn medication and the number of people with longer stays within the PECC support the usefulness of PECCs in relation to patient satisfaction and adherence to admission criteria policy. These factors may be considered as indicators of the efficiency of a PECC.",Remaining
1517,2625165,European journal of vascular surgery,Extracranial carotid artery aneurysms.,"Aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries are uncommon vascular lesions. During the period 1976 to 1986 we encountered 18 extracranial carotid aneurysms in 14 patients. The aneurysms were atherosclerotic (12 in 9 patients), congenital (3 in 2 patients), mycotic (1) and secondary (false aneurysms) after previous carotid surgery (2 in 2 patients). The patients presented with neurological symptoms (11) or a pulsating mass in the neck (2). In one patient the aneurysm was detected accidentally during angiography. From this study it became clear that 'carotid aneurysm' is not a well defined entity. The 'normal' configuration of the carotid bulb with its usually larger diameter, is in part a cause of the problem of definition. A recently described technique for predicting normal vessel diameters in stenosing lesions of the carotid arteries was retrospectively applied to all our patients with aneurysms. With these measurements, made on standard preoperative angiograms, it was possible to quantify the degree of dilatation, and confirm the diagnosis of aneurysm. Eleven of the 14 patients were operated on without mortality, no neurological deficits were seen as a result of the operation and minimal morbidity occurred in six patients. From this study we conclude that surgical correction of accessible carotid artery aneurysms is a relatively safe procedure and these lesions should be operated on irrespective of symptoms. This is the first report that gives clear guidelines for measuring dilatation of the extracranial carotid arteries and based on these guidelines we suggest criteria for the discrimination between physiological dilatation and pathological aneurysm formation, the latter condition being an indication for operation.",Remaining

Muscle tone underpins movement. We investigated muscle tone in 34 ASD children using a standardized neuro-developmental battery, which uses the French norms for muscular tone in children.	Dangling and extensibility were used to examine passive muscle tone in the upper and lower limbs and the body axis. A comparison between muscles of the right and left sides enabled the determination of tonic laterality.	We found a disharmonious tonic typology, with a tonic component for the muscles of the trunk and the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and a laxity component for the ankles and the proximal and distal muscles of the upper limbs (wrists and shoulders). No establishment of tonic laterality was found in the upper limbs in 61% of ASD children (P<0.001).	The disturbed tonic organization influenced by subcortical structures, such as the cerebellum, may partially explain the motor disorders, and indefinite tonic laterality may also be linked to low hemispheric brain dominance described in autism. This preliminary examination is necessary before any gross motor assessments to understand the nature of movement disorders, explore typologies and highlight possible soft neuro-motor signs.",Remaining
1520,19194374,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,A polymorphism of the MAOA gene is associated with emotional brain markers and personality traits on an antisocial index.,"Association studies suggest that the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-uVNTR polymorphism confers risk for emotional disturbances associated with antisocial traits, particularly in males. Here, we assessed the low (MAOA-L) activity variant in relation to both brain function and a behavioral index of antisocial traits. From an initial sample of 290 healthy participants, 210 had low (MAOA-L) or high (MAOA-H) activity variants. Participants underwent a brief assessment of personality traits and event-related potential (ERP) recording during an emotion-processing task. Genotype differences in ERPs were localized using LORETA. The MAOA-L genotype was distinguished by elevated scores on the index of antisocial traits. These traits were related to altered ERPs elicited 120-280ms post-stimulus, particularly for negative emotion. Altered neural processing of anger in MAOA-L genotypes was localized to medial frontal, parietal, and superior temporo-occipital regions in males, but only to the superior occipital cortex in females. The MAOA low activity variant may increase susceptibility to antisocial traits through alterations to the neural systems for processing threat-related emotion, especially for males. Monoamines such as noradrenalin and serotonin may modulate these relationships, given that their metabolism varies according to MAOA variants, and that they modulate both emotional brain systems and antisocial aggression.",Remaining

However, little is known about the incidence and risk factors of IC at stroke onset in LHI. Besides, stroke-related complications and clinical outcomes in relation to the development of IC has not been systematically examined. Data of 256 consecutive patients with LHI were collected. IC at stroke onset was retrospectively collected from the initial emergency department and/or admission records. Of the 256 LHI patients enrolled, 93 (36.3%) had IC at stroke onset. LHI patients with IC at stroke onset were older (median age 66 vs. 61, p = 0.041), had shorter prehospital delay (24 vs. 26 h, p < 0.001and higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (19 vs. 12, p < 0.001). Independent risk factors of IC at stroke onset were high NIHSS score (odds ratio, OR 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.23) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.47). Dyslipidemia appeared to protect against IC at stroke onset (adjusted OR 0.416, 95% CI 0.175 to 0.988). IC at stroke onset was associated with higher frequency of stroke-related complications (90.32% vs. 67.48%, p < 0.001), especially brain edema (45.16% vs. 23.31%, p < 0.001) and pneumonia (63.44% vs. 47.82%, p = 0.019). The IC group had higher rates of in-hospital death (23.66% vs. 11.66%, p = 0.012), 3-month mortality (49.46% vs. 24.87%, p = 0.002), and 3-month unfavorable outcome (64.51% vs. 49.07%, p = 0.017). However, after adjusting for age, baseline NIHSS score and other confounders, IC at stroke onset was not an independent predictor of in-hospital death (adjusted OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.47), 3-month mortality (adjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.14) and 3-month unfavorable outcome (adjusted OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.33) in LHI patients (all p > 0.05). Our results suggested that IC occur in 1 out of every 3 LHI patients at stroke onset and was associated with initial stroke severity and atrial fibrillation. LHI patients with IC at stroke onset more frequently had stroke-related complications, 3-month mortality and unfavorable outcome, whereas IC was not an independent predictor of poor outcomes.",Remaining
1522,21055392,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,In yeast redistribution of Sod1 to the mitochondrial intermembrane space provides protection against respiration derived oxidative stress.,"The antioxidative enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Sod1) is an important cellular defence system against reactive oxygen species (ROS). While the majority of this enzyme is localized to the cytosol, about 1% of the cellular Sod1 is present in the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria. These amounts of mitochondrial Sod1 are increased for certain Sod1 mutants that are linked to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To date, only little is known about the physiological function of mitochondrial Sod1. Here, we use the model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae to generate cells in which Sod1 is exclusively localized to the IMS. We find that IMS-localized Sod1 can functionally substitute wild type Sod1 and that it even exceeds the protective capacity of wild type Sod1 under conditions of mitochondrial ROS stress. Moreover, we demonstrate that upon expression in yeast cells the common ALS-linked mutant Sod1(G93A) becomes enriched in the mitochondrial fraction and provides an increased protection of cells from mitochondrial oxidative stress. Such an effect cannot be observed for the catalytically inactive mutant Sod1(G85R). Our observations suggest that the targeting of Sod1 to the mitochondrial IMS provides an increased protection against respiration-derived ROS.",In-vitro-study

After birth, it may cause a series of neurological symptoms, even with retina, kidney, liver, and other organ abnormalities, which is defined as Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD). Molecular genetics research contributes to disease prediction and genetic counseling. Prenatal diagnosis is rare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually the first-choice diagnostic modality with typical brain images characterized by the molar tooth sign. We describe a case of JS prenatally and Dandy-Walker malformation for the differential diagnosis based on ultrasonograms. We also review the etiology, imaging features, clinical symptoms, and diagnosis of JSRD.	A 22-year-old woman was pregnant at 27 1/7 weeks' gestation with fetal cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. Fetal ultrasonography and MRI confirmed a diagnosis of JS at our center. The couple finally opted to terminate the fetus, which had a normal appearance and growth parameters. The couple also had an AHI1 gene mutation on chromosome 6.	Currently, a diagnosis of JS is commonly made after birth. Fewer cases of prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonography have been made, and they are more liable to be misdirected because of some nonspecial features that also manifest in Dandy-Walker malformation, cranio-cerebello-cardiac syndrome, and so on.",Non-systematic-review

In order to enhance their specificity and incremental validity, the scales were constructed to be relatively independent of already known general personality variables such as Stress Reaction (neuroticism), Locus of Control, Hypochondriasis, and Absorption. Three scales, derived from orthogonal factor analyses, were developed and cross-validated: (1) Autonomic Response Frequency, assessing spontaneous fluctuations in autonomic responding; (2) Autonomic Response to Stress, assessing the amount of autonomic arousal perceived by a subject in stress situations; and (3) Somatic Response Control, a self-report measure of capacity to control both autonomic and fine muscle responses. The hypothesis that sympathetic and parasympathetic awareness might define two distinct dimensions was not supported by the data. The new scales will be useful in testing hypotheses of possible relationships among the factors measured and behavioral and psychophysiological indicators of the response to stress.",Remaining

In an attempt to answer this question, we first investigated the time course of the changes in the amount and composition of free fatty acids (FFAs) accumulated during 5-min ischemia and after various postischemic recirculation durations (3 min, 1 h, 24 h, 3 days, and 6 days) in the gerbil cerebral cortex. Then those of FFAs liberated in response to the second 5-min ischemia at various recirculation intervals (3 min, 1 h, 3 days, and 6 days) following the initial one were also measured to evaluate the changes in the cellular response. The former study disclosed that the FFA levels transiently returned to the control levels at 1-h recirculation, increased again a few days after the onset of recirculation, followed by the final return to the control levels after 6-day recirculation. The latter study disclosed that the cellular response to the second ischemia was quite different from that to the initial one even after 6-day recirculation, suggesting that membrane lipid metabolism had not yet been recovered even at such a late period.

Self-reported sleep disturbance generally predicted self-report but not objective measures of cognitive dysfunction. Objective sleep measures (e.g., polysomnography, actigraphy) generally predicted objective impairments in processing speed and attention; however, objective sleep disturbance was more variable in predicting performance in other cognitive domains (e.g., memory, executive function).

The main symptoms of AS are severe impairment in social interaction and communication, and restricted interests, without significant delay in cognitive and language development. Its prevalence is not clearly established but might be around 0.26 per 1000. Symptoms of high-functioning autism (HFA), which is not an official diagnostic category, are quite similar. Children and adolescents with AS or HFA mostly have a social skills deficit, in connection with a lack of understanding concerning the rules governing social interactions. This deficit often leads to social isolation and peer rejection, which can alter their quality of life. Their lack of social skills can also have effects on success at school or work, integration among peers and mental health. According to recent guidelines of the French national authority for health (Haute autorité de santé, HAS) about the special needs of persons with PDD, professionals have to develop evidence-based interventions, emphasizing social interactions and participation, as described by the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF): social and professional participation as well as participation in leisure activities, clubs and societies, etc.	To explore the studies that give evidence of the value of these social skills training groups, to review the methods and programs worked out in these groups, and to highlight the best general operating principles to be adopted and combined.	Systematic searches of electronic databases, journals, and reference lists identified 12 studies published since 1984, involving social competence group interventions, led by psychotherapists who were trained in cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), for children and adolescents from 6 to 18years old with a diagnosis of AS or HFA.	According to these 12 studies, these interventions are useful and significantly effective. Adaptation of their contents and educational means to how children and adolescents with AS function is necessary to facilitate learning and decrease anxiety. Concerning the groups' setting, most of these studies insist on the value of working with a small number of participants and creating a friendly, predictable and structured environment (even the progress of the sessions itself has to be structured). The programs' contents should ally didactic teaching and training exercises, which should be diverse and adapted to the objectives. The techniques usually applied in CBT (role plays, modeling, problem-solving strategies, etc.), must be completed with strategies known to be appropriate for children and adolescents with ASD, such as social scenarios.	Although new studies are necessary to assess the generalization and long-term efficacy of such approaches, this review confirms the advantages of the main methods of social skills training groups for children and adolescents with AS. It opens up perspectives to developing new programs of social skills training groups, integrating various approaches, dimensions and objectives, working on a long-term basis.",Non-systematic-review

This study investigates whether IMRS can be an adequate dosimetric alternative to DCARS for cranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).	Forty-five SRS procedures for solitary brain metastasis (range: 0.44-29.18 cm 3) performed at our institution were selected for this study. Two plans were generated per patient: One IMRS plan using a multileaf collimation (MLC) of 5 mm, and one DCARS plan designed with a 3 mm micro-MLC. Dosimetric comparison metrics include the target coverage (Cov), conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gradient index (GI), and volume of the normal brain tissue receiving ≥12 Gy (V12). In addition, maximum doses to organs at risk (OAR) (brainstem, optic apparatus and cochlea) were compared for both techniques.	Compared to DCARS, IMRS improved mean CI (IMRS: 0.81 vs.	0.63, P < 0.001), with no significant difference in target Cov (IMRS: 0.99 vs.	0.99, P > 0.05), HI (IMRS: 1.22 vs.	1.24, P > 0.05), GI (IMRS: 5.44 vs.	5.44, P > 0.05). A weak significant difference in V12 (IMRS: 4.6 cm 3 vs. 5.2 cm 3, P = 0.033) was obtained. Subgroup analysis per target volume (small: <1 cm 3, intermediate: ≤1 cm 3 and <5 cm 3 and large: ≥5 cm 3) only revealed the statistically difference for CI metric (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found for maximum dose to the OAR.	We have shown that IMRS provides the dosimetric advantages compared with DCARS.

Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the best predictors for the occurrence of stroke were the presence of ophthalmic ischemic symptoms at diagnosis (OR 5, 95% CI 2.14-12.33, p = 0.0002) and the absence of anemia (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.99, p = 0.04).	Stroke, especially in the vertebrobasilar territory, is more likely to occur in patients with GCA who experience recent ophthalmic ischemic symptoms and who exhibit low inflammatory variables.",Remaining
1534,34622713,Bioengineered,Effects of dexmedetomidine on postoperative cognitive function of sleep deprivation rats based on changes in inflammatory response.,"We aimed to assess the effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on postoperative cognitive function of sleep deprivation (SD) rats based on changes in inflammatory response. Male rats were randomly divided into blank control (C), SD, DEX, and SD+DEX groups. The SD model was established through intraperitoneal injection of DEX. The escape latency was detected through Morris water maze test daily, and the mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency were detected for 8 d. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in hippocampus homogenate were determined, and the morphological changes in neurons were detected through Nissl staining. The concentration of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-6 in the hippocampus was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the Rac1/protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) expressions were detected by Western blotting. The changes in immunofluorescence localization of NF-κB were observed by confocal microscopy. Compared with SD group, the escape latency was shortened, original platform-crossing times increased, MDA content declined, SOD activity rose, neurons were arranged orderly and number of Nissl bodies increased in the hippocampal CA1 region, levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the hippocampus decreased, Rac1/AKT/NF-κB expressions were down-regulated, and proportion of NF-κB entering the nucleus declined in SD+DEX group (P < 0.05). DEX can effectively alleviate postoperative hippocampal inflammation and improve cognitive function of SD rats. The ability of DEX to relieve oxidative stress of hippocampal neurons, restore damaged cells, and reduce hippocampal inflammation in SD rats may be related to the Rac1/AKT/NF-κB pathway.",Animal-drug-intervention

The purpose of this study was to examine whether the pathway from ADI to AUD symptoms by early adulthood is moderated by ethnicity and possessing an alcohol-metabolizing gene ALDH2*2 variant allele.	We used multigroup structural equation modeling, including 5 groups split by ethnicity and ALDH2*2, to examine the consistency of the path from ADI to AUD symptoms in 604 Chinese-, Korean-, and White-American college students. We further examined the effects of ALDH2*2, ethnicity, and their interaction in Asians to better understand their unique contributions to the moderation.	The association between ADI and AUD symptoms was moderated, with ADI negatively associated with AUD symptoms among Koreans without ALDH2*2 and Whites, but not among Koreans with ALDH2*2 or Chinese regardless of ALDH2*2. Both ALDH2*2 and ethnicity within Asians contributed unique variability in the effect.	Ethnicity and ALDH2*2 altered the relationship of ADI as a risk factor for AUD symptoms. Being Chinese and possessing an ALDH2*2 allele within Koreans both buffered against the risk for AUD symptoms associated with earlier ADI, indicating that this relationship can be attenuated by protective factors.",Remaining

Our aim was to contribute to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by mapping auditory evoked potentials (AEP). Evoked potentials represent the electric response of the CNS to an external stimulus and can be represented as a sequence of waves. Brain mapping allows a chromotopogram to be compiled showing chromatic maps.	A group of 12 patients were studied aged between 68 and 84 years old who were referred to our attention at the Department of Geriatrics and Gerontology at Catania University and the A.O. Cannizzaro, Geriatrics Unit. All patients completed an assessment form (MM-SE, ADAS) and underwent brain NMR and AEP.	These tests enabled us to identify two types of patients (Group A and Group B) based on the responses shown. The overall evaluation of results revealed that patients with Alzheimer-type dementia present an anomalous cortical neurogenic response to mapped AEP, and that patients in Group A showed anomalous wave morphology, latency and localisation and asymmetric impregnation. The data gathered in this study did not confirm any specific characteristics of AEP given that similar anomalies are found in metabolic dysfunction syndromes and demyelination pathologies.	However, while it does not constitute a specific technique for screening against Alzheimer's disease, the mapping of AEP may contribute to the diagnosis of this disease.",Remaining
1537,27469219,Current drug metabolism,Delivery of Nanoparticles for Treatment of Brain Tumor.,"Malignant brain tumor is a highly challenging disease for diagnosis, treatment, and management. Cytotoxicity, distribution and the ability to cross blood brain barrier are some of the most significant issues for the chemotherapy of brain tumors. Nanotechnology has been widely exploited in drug delivery with great potential in improving the drug efficiency and efficacy. The advent of nanotechnology would greatly facilitate the early detection and treatment of brain tumors. This review will be primarily focused on current nano drug delivery system for brain cancer therapy. Meanwhile, the existing impediments for therapeutic nanomedicines and critical analysis of the different delivery nanoparticles are also discussed.	We systematically evaluated the major factors that impact the current nanomedicines for brain tumor therapy. Meanwhile, various nanoparticle-based formulations for brain cancer detection and therapy are evaluated.	124 papers were included in this review. From the analysis of the nanomaterials, seven major nanomaterials have been discussed regarding the functionality and current therapeutic significance. The review also explains in detail about the different types of nanomaterials and their functionalities. This shows that each of these nanomaterials has specialized functions for the treatment of various kinds of brain cancer.	Nanomaterials provide a viable potential diagnosis mechanis. In the future, more research needs to be focused on developing a better diagnosis tool for detection of cancer on an urgent basis. Blood-brain barrier and cytotoxicity are some of the primary root causes for the impediment of treatment of cancer using nanoparticles. Therefore, different delivery systems should be exploited for the nanoparticles to surmount these issues.",Non-systematic-review
1538,11771945,Experimental neurology,Changes in dopaminergic and glutamatergic excitatory mechanisms of micturition reflex after middle cerebral artery occlusion in conscious rats.,"Previous reports have shown that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic and D2 dopaminergic mechanisms have independent excitatory effects on bladder activity in normal and cerebral infarcted (CI) rats under urethane anesthesia. The study presented here was undertaken to investigate the interaction between these two mechanisms on bladder activity in conscious Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without cerebral infarction. Occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery or a sham operation (SO) was performed under halothane anesthesia. After recovery from the anesthesia, bladder activity was monitored continuously by means of infusion cystometrography in awake rats. The effects of cumulative intravenous doses of quinpirole (0.001-1 mg/kg), a D2 dopamine receptor agonist, were studied in awake SO and CI rats with or without dizocilpine (10 mg/kg) pretreatment. The effects of dizocilpine (1 or 10 mg/kg) were also examined in other SO or CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole. Bladder capacity in CI rats was significantly smaller (0.18 ml) than that in SO rats (0.48 ml). Quinpirole (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) further reduced bladder capacity in both types of rats, an effect blocked by sulpiride (20 mg/kg), a D2 dopamine receptor antagonist. The effect of quinpirole was also antagonized by dizocilpine (1 mg/kg) to a significantly (P < 0.01) greater degree in CI than in SO rats. In SO rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, dizocilpine significantly increased bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. After the maximum dose (10 mg/kg) of dizocilpine, sulpiride did not produce any changes in bladder activity. In CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, 1 mg/kg of dizocilpine increased bladder capacity. After administration of the maximum dose of dizocilpine (10 mg/kg), which did not produce an additional effect, sulpiride (20 mg/kg) increased bladder capacity by 58.3%. These results indicate that in awake rats D2 dopaminergic excitatory effects on the urinary bladder are mediated in part by NMDA glutamatergic mechanisms and in part by non-NMDA mechanisms. The latter type was more prominent in CI rats, indicating that the bladder hyperactivity induced by cerebral infarction may be mediated by an alteration in dopaminergic-glutamatergic interactions in the brain.",Animal-other
1539,30035586,Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,Severe and enduring anorexia nervosa? Illness severity and duration are unrelated to outcomes from cognitive behaviour therapy.,"The present study aimed to examine whether Anorexia Nervosa (AN) illness severity or duration is associated with retention or treatment response in outpatient, enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-E).	Patients with a confirmed AN diagnosis (N = 134) completed measures of eating disorder symptoms and quality of life, and had their BMI objectively measured before, during, and after treatment. We evaluated whether illness severity or duration predicted treatment outcomes, using longitudinal regression models.	Greater levels of illness severity and duration were not associated with poorer treatment outcomes.	Patients with more severe or long-standing AN illness did just as well in CBT-E as any other patient starting treatment. Therefore, classifying individuals as 'severe and enduring' appears to lack clinical utility in CBT-E. Clinicians should continue to administer evidence-supported treatments such as CBT-E for patients with AN, regardless of duration or severity of AN illness.

1540,30462117,Food & function,Resveratrol alleviates motor and cognitive deficits and neuropathology in the A53T α-synuclein mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Lewy pathology and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Lewy pathology mainly consists of abnormal aggregates of α-synuclein, which play a pivotal role in PD pathophysiology. However, the complexity of PD leads to clinical challenges, and there are still no treatments to halt or slow the neurodegenerative process. Resveratrol (RV) is a natural polyphenol compound with multiple biological activities, which has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects on several neurological diseases. Here we first provided evidence that RV treatment alleviated motor and cognitive deficits in the A53T α-synuclein mouse model of PD in a dose-dependent manner. The beneficial effects of RV against PD resulted from inhibiting α-synuclein aggregation and cytotoxicity, lowering the levels of total α-synuclein and oligomers, reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that RV has promising therapeutic potential for PD and other synucleinopathies.",Animal-drug-intervention
1541,21801595,Neurological research,Differential effects of endothelin receptor A and B antagonism on behavioral outcome following traumatic brain injury.,"Previously we have reported that endothelin receptor A and B antagonists elicit differential effects on cerebral blood flow and cellular damage. In summary, endothelin receptor A antagonists restore microcirculation and diminish cellular damage after injury, while endothelin receptor B antagonists had no effect on either parameter. However, what is not known is the effect of either antagonist on behavioral outcome. Therefore, this work was designed to test the effects of endothelin receptor A and B antagonism on behavioral outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI).	A total of 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats (400-450 g) were used in this study. Four groups (n = 12 per group) were generated as follows: sham operation, trauma+vehicle (0·9% saline), trauma+40 nmol BQ-123 (a selective endothelin receptor A antagonist) and trauma +20 nmol BQ-788 (a selective endothelin receptor B antagonist). All treatments were delivered via intracerebroventricular injection. Trauma was induced using a weight acceleration impact device. Twenty-four hours post-injection animals were tested for 21 days on a radial arm maze task to determine cognitive outcome.	Our data indicated that endothelin receptor A antagonism significantly reduced the extent of behavioral deficits following TBI while endothelin receptor B and vehicle injection had no effect.	The results suggest that endothelin receptor A, but not endothelin receptor B, antagonism improves behavioral outcome following TBI. Furthermore, these data provide a functional correlate to previously published findings in our laboratory showing that endothelin receptor A antagonism improves both blood flow and cellular outcome following TBI. In a broader sense, this work demonstrates that hypoperfusion following TBI likely contributes to poor outcome following head injury.",Animal-drug-intervention
1542,36148759,Sleep medicine,Effects of dopamine transporter in the ventral tegmental area on sleep recovery after propofol anesthesia in sleep-deprived rats.,"Previous studies indicate that propofol can help with recovery from sleep deprivation and has anti-anxiety effects. However, the underlying neurochemical mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on sleep and anxiety recovery after propofol anesthesia in rats with 24 h total sleep deprivation (TSD).	Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were in natural sleep or sleep deprived for 24 h in a sleep deprivation rat system. The rats received propofol anesthesia (75 mg/kg, i.p.) or natural sleep. Dopamine transporter knockdown was performed by microinjection of AAV-DAT-RNAi vector. EEG was measured in each group to evaluate the subsequent sleep. The elevated plus maze test (EPMT) and open field test (OFT) were used to evaluate locomotion and anxiety level in rats. Immunofluorescence was used to verify virus location and transfection efficiency.	Compared with NC group, the anxiety level of Propofol group showed no significant difference, but REM sleep decreased. Compared with the TSD group, the anxiety level of the TSD + Propofol group was reduced and the sleep recovery was closer to baseline. Compared with TSD + AAV-NC group, anxiety level and sleep time increased in TSD + AAVi group, REM increased within 24 h after sleep deprivation. The sleep time of TSD + AAVi + Propofol group was between those of TSD + AAV-NC group and TSD + AAVi group. TSD + AAV-NC + Propofol group had the least sleep time and the lowest anxiety level.	1. Propofol did not change anxiety level in normal rats, but reduced REM sleep, while it could accelerate sleep recovery and reduce anxiety level in sleep-deprived rats. 2. In sleep deprived rats with DAT knockdown, propofol improved sleep and anxiety levels more slowly, especially producing more REM rebound, suggesting that the improvement of sleep and anxiety levels in sleep-deprived rats with propofol may be related to DAT in VTA region.",Animal-other
1543,24243441,Schizophrenia bulletin,"Aberrant coupling within and across the default mode, task-positive, and salience network in subjects at risk for psychosis.","The task-positive network (TPN) is anticorrelated with activity in the default mode network (DMN), and possibly reflects competition between the processing of external and internal information, while the salience network (SN) is pivotal in regulating TPN and DMN activity. Because abnormal functional connectivity in these networks has been related to schizophrenia, we tested whether alterations are also evident in subjects at risk for psychosis. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was tested in 28 subjects with basic symptoms reporting subjective cognitive-perceptive symptoms; 19 with attenuated or brief, limited psychotic symptoms; and 29 matched healthy controls. We characterized spatial differences in connectivity patterns, as well as internetwork connectivity. Right anterior insula (rAI) was selected as seed region for identifying the SN; medioprefrontal cortex (MPFC) for the DMN and TPN. The 3 groups differed in connectivity patterns between the MPFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), and between the rAI and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In particular, the typically observed antagonistic relationship in MPFC-rDLPFC, rAI-PCC, and internetwork connectivity of DMN-TPN was absent in both at-risk groups. Notably, those connectivity patterns were associated with symptoms related to reality distortions, whereas enhanced connectivity strengths of MPFC-rDLPFC and TPN-DMN were related to poor performance in cognitive functions. We propose that the loss of a TPN-DMN anticorrelation, accompanied by an aberrant spatial extent in the DMN, TPN, and SN in the psychosis risk state, reflects the confusion of internally and externally focused states and disturbance of cognition, as seen in psychotic disorders.",Remaining

The neuroligin-neurexin adhesion is Ca2+-dependent and regulated by alternative splicing.

The structure revealed a delicate neuroligin-neurexin assembly mediated by a hydrophilic, Ca2+-mediated and solvent-supplemented interface, rendering it capable of being modulated by alternative splicing and other regulatory factors. Thermodynamic data supported a mechanism wherein splicing site B of NL1 acts by modulating a salt bridge at the edge of the NL1-NX1beta interface. Mapping neuroligin mutations implicated in autism indicated that most such mutations are structurally destabilizing, supporting deficient neuroligin biosynthesis and processing as a common cause for this brain disorder.",In-vitro-study

The ratings of the participants showed that they expected the alcohol-dependent versions of both individuals to be less agreeable and less conscientious. The participants expected the alcohol-dependent college student to be more extraverted and the alcohol-dependent lawyer-father to be more neurotic. The expected personality characteristics of the alcohol-dependent versions of the two described persons were very similar to the actual personality characteristics of alcohol-dependent individuals. The results were consistent with prior findings regarding narrow-band personality traits related to the Big Five. The results help explain prior findings about the social handicap of problem drinking with regard to making friends, dating, marriage, and working.

1549,9919465,Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,The implications of hypothermia for early tracheal extubation following cardiac surgery.,"Thermoregulation is impaired during anesthesia for cardiac surgery. Redistribution of body heat and heat loss to the environment result in mild hypothermia before cardiopulmonary bypass. Maintenance of normothermia, rather than hypothermia, may facilitate early tracheal extubation. Hypothermia alters the distribution and decreases the metabolism of most drugs, including anesthetic drugs and muscle relaxants, thus prolonging recovery. Postoperative shivering increases metabolic rate and potentially leads to myocardial ischemia; prevention is therefore critical to the success of early tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery. Coagulopathies, increased incidence of surgical wound infection, and perioperative cardiac morbidity are other potential risk factors identified in noncardiac patients. Hypothermia, however, does have potential benefits to the patient, including protection from cerebral ischemia and hypoxemia. Mild core hypothermia (approximately 34 degrees C) may represent the optimal balance between risks and benefits for fast-track patients.",Non-systematic-review

The SVZ may become a target for radiation therapy in glioblastoma patients. However, reports studying the effect of irradiation of the SVZ on glioblastoma patient survival show conflicting results. We studied the correlation between incidental SVZ radiation dose and survival in a cohort of isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDHwt) glioblastoma patients with inclusion of important survival prognosticators.	In this retrospective analysis, only adult patients with supratentorial IDHwt glioblastoma were included who were treated with temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy after surgery. The SVZ was contoured on the radiotherapy planning imaging. Cox proportional regression overall survival (OS) analysis was used to study the correlation between SVZ dose and survival. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score, extent of resection and O[6]-methylguanine-methyl-DNA-transferase gene promoter (MGMTp) methylation were used as covariates in multivariate analysis.	In total, 137 patients were included. Median OS was 13.3 months. The MGMTp methylation was present in 40% of cases. Ipsilateral SVZ (iSVZ) mean dose was 44.4 Gy and 27.2 Gy for the contralateral SVZ (cSVZ). Univariate survival analysis showed an inverse relationship between cSVZ mean dose and OS (HR 1.029 (1.003-1.057); p= .032). However, there was no correlation between cSVZ mean dose and OS in multivariate analysis. iSVZ dose did not correlate with survival.	In this cohort of 137 IDHwt glioblastoma patients, iSVZ did not correlate with OS. Higher cSVZ dose was inversely correlated with OS in univariate survival analysis but lost its significance in multivariate analysis, including MGMTp-methylation. Hence, the correlation between SVZ radiation and glioblastoma patient survival remains unclear.

1554,3489155,Medicine,Renal disease from habitual antipyretic analgesic consumption: an assessment of the epidemiologic evidence.,"The quantitative evidence relating habitual antipyretic analgesic consumption to the development of renal disease is reviewed. For purposes of analysis, 'abuse' of analgesics is defined as regular, usually daily consumption. The prevalence of habitual consumption demonstrates marked geographic variation for poorly defined reasons. Prevalence tended to be highest in those populations in which phenacetin was available and popular. The prevalence of nephropathy among habitual consumers also shows marked interpopulation variability. A highly significant linear relationship exists between the prevalence of habitual analgesic consumption in a given population and the prevalence of nephropathy in the subset of that population that habitually consumes analgesics. This relationship may represent a dose-response curve relating amount of analgesic intake to prevalence of nephropathy. Four cross-sectional studies, 1 longitudinal, and 1 case-control study have shown significant differences in prevalence of nephropathy between habitual users of phenacetin-containing analgesics and control populations. Conversely, 2 cross-sectional studies and 1 case control study showed no difference between habitual users of analgesics and control populations. However, those studies showing no difference were performed in populations with low prevalence of habitual consumption of compound analgesics and a lower prevalence of nephropathy than was found in those populations where differences were observed. The relative risk for developing various manifestations of analgesic nephropathy has been estimated in 4 studies and varies depending on which abnormality is considered. Data are available only for subjects consuming phenacetin-containing compound analgesics. The relative risk for elevated serum creatinine is in the range of 8 to 11, about twice that for an abnormal renal concentrating test (approximately 4). The relative risk for clinical papillary necrosis is approximately 18, and for cause-specific death (and by inference for end-stage renal disease) about 4. The difference in risk between most clinical manifestations of analgesic nephropathy and death (or end-stage renal disease) may be due to the fact that most patients with nephropathy do not progress to terminal renal failure. Rheumatology clinic studies indicate that the prevalence of nephropathy in habitual consumers of phenacetin-containing compounds is higher than that for habitual consumers of aspirin alone. Removal of phenacetin from compound analgesics in Scandinavian countries appears to have reduced the prevalence of papillary necrosis and death from interstitial nephritis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Non-systematic-review
1555,28849573,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Functional Network Disruptions in Schizophrenia.,"It has been long recognized that schizophrenia, unlike certain other mental disorders, appears to be delocalized, i.e., difficult to attribute to a dysfunction of a few specific brain areas, and may be better understood as a disruption of brain's emergent network properties. In this chapter, we focus on topological properties of functional brain networks obtained from fMRI data, and demonstrate that some of those properties can be used as discriminative features of schizophrenia in multivariate predictive setting. While the prior work on schizophrenia networks has been primarily focused on discovering statistically significant differences in network properties, this work extends the prior art by exploring the generalization (prediction) ability of network models for schizophrenia, which is not necessarily captured by such significance tests. Moreover, we show that significant disruption of the topological and spatial structure of functional MRI networks in schizophrenia (a) cannot be explained by a disruption to area-based task-dependent responses, i.e., indeed relates to the emergent properties, (b) is global in nature, affecting most dramatically long-distance correlations, and (c) can be leveraged to achieve high classification accuracy (93%) when discriminating between schizophrenic vs. control subjects based just on a single fMRI experiment using a simple auditory task.",Remaining

Neonatal and surgical data were obtained retrospectively to assess prognostic factors.	19 patients (12 boys), median age 9.9 years (range 6.2-13.1), gestational age 31.0 weeks (range 25.2-40), birth weight 1 250 g (range 780-3 175) were evaluated. Infants with an enterostomy (n=14) scored lower on intelligence than children with a primary anastomosis (n=5): VIQ 85 ± 12 vs. 101 ± 15, p=0.04; PIQ 79 ± 13 vs. 92 ± 11, p=0.06; TIQ 82 ± 11 vs. 97 ± 13, p=0.04. Motor skills were either suspect or clinically impaired in 74%. Clinical classification of results suggest more children in the enterostomy group had a performance rated as clinically impaired compared to the primary anastomosis group, although no statistical difference in M-ABC score was found. There were no differences between primary anastomosis and enterostomy patients with regard to gestational age, birth weight, comorbidities, preoperative Bell stage, residual small and large bowel lengths, inotropic medication, duration of ventilatory support, NICU and hospital stay, and physical exam data on follow-up. However, a selection bias could not be ruled out.	The results suggest that an enterostomy in SNEC patients could be associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes by the age of 6-13 years compared to a primary anastomosis, although the severity of illness was comparable between both groups. Further studies are needed to prevent selection bias and to elucidate the impact of abdominal surgical factors on neurodevelopmental outcome and the underlying pathophysiology.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
1557,35164524,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,Lithium plus antipsychotics or anticonvulsants for bipolar disorder: Comparing clinical response and metabolic changes.,"Patients with bipolar disorder treated with lithium often require additional antipsychotics or anticonvulsants. However, the comparative effectiveness and safety of these agents as add-on to lithium has not been studied.	This secondary analysis combined two similar 24-week trials on outpatients with bipolar disorder randomized to lithium (target serum level 0.4-0.6 mEq/L). Guideline-based adjunctive antipsychotics (Li+AP) and anticonvulsants (Li+AC) could be used if clinically indicated and was assessed at every study visit. Response was measured on the Clinical Global Impression scale and we performed adjusted mixed effects linear regression analyses. Analysis of variance tests compared metabolic measures including a binary diagnosis of metabolic syndrome before and after 24 weeks of treatment.	Among 379 outpatients (57% female, mean age 38 years, mean Clinical Global Impression 4.4), users of Li+AP (N = 50, primarily quetiapine and aripiprazole) improved to a similar degree (mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.6, standard deviation = 1.5) as those using lithium-only (i.e. without adjunctive antipsychotics or anticonvulsants, N = 149, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.7, standard deviation = 1.4) (p = 0.59). Users of Li+AC (N = 107, primarily lamotrigine and valproate, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.2, standard deviation = 1.3) and users of Li+AP+AC (N = 73, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.1, standard deviation = 1.3) showed worse response compared to lithium-only users (all p < 0.01). When comparing Li+AP to Li+AC, users of Li+AP improved slightly better on general (p = 0.05) and manic symptoms (p = 0.01), but showed a worse development of glucose, triglycerides, and metabolic syndrome.	Despite treatment-by-indication confounding, these findings are relevant for real-world treatment settings and emphasize the need for randomized trials on this clinically important topic.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

1559,27349722,Scientific reports,Central tendency effects in time interval reproduction in autism.,"Central tendency, the tendency of judgements of quantities (lengths, durations etc.) to gravitate towards their mean, is one of the most robust perceptual effects. A Bayesian account has recently suggested that central tendency reflects the integration of noisy sensory estimates with prior knowledge representations of a mean stimulus, serving to improve performance. The process is flexible, so prior knowledge is weighted more heavily when sensory estimates are imprecise, requiring more integration to reduce noise. In this study we measure central tendency in autism to evaluate a recent theoretical hypothesis suggesting that autistic perception relies less on prior knowledge representations than typical perception. If true, autistic children should show reduced central tendency than theoretically predicted from their temporal resolution. We tested autistic and age- and ability-matched typical children in two child-friendly tasks: (1) a time interval reproduction task, measuring central tendency in the temporal domain; and (2) a time discrimination task, assessing temporal resolution. Central tendency reduced with age in typical development, while temporal resolution improved. Autistic children performed far worse in temporal discrimination than the matched controls. Computational simulations suggested that central tendency was much less in autistic children than predicted by theoretical modelling, given their poor temporal resolution.",Remaining

1563,36146383,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Utility of the Full ECG Waveform for Stress Classification.,"The detection of psychological stress using the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is most commonly based on the detection of the R peak-the most prominent part of the ECG waveform-and the heart rate variability (HRV) measurements derived from it. For stress detection algorithms focused on short-duration time windows, there is potential benefit in including HRV features derived from the detection of smaller peaks within the ECG waveform: the P, Q, S, and T waves. However, the potential drawback of using these small peaks is their smaller magnitude and subsequent susceptibility to noise, making them more difficult to reliably detect. In this work, we demonstrate the potential benefits of including smaller waves within binary stress classification using a pre-existing data set of ECG recordings from 57 participants (aged 18-40) with a self-reported fear of spiders during exposure to videos of spiders. We also present an analysis of the performance of an automated peak detection algorithm and the reliability of detection for each of the smaller parts of the ECG waveform. We compared two models, one with only R peak features and one with small peak features. They were similar in precision, recall, F1, area under ROC curve (AUC), and accuracy, with the greatest differences less than the standard deviations of each metric. There was a significant difference in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which represented the information loss of the model. The inclusion of novel small peak features made the model 4.29×1028 times more probable to minimize the information loss, and the small peak features showed higher regression coefficients than the R peak features, indicating a stronger relationship with acute psychological stress. This difference and further analysis of the novel features suggest that small peak intervals could be indicative of independent processes within the heart, reflecting a psychophysiological response to stress that has not yet been leveraged in stress detection algorithms.",Remaining
1564,21606375,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,ES cell-derived renewable and functional midbrain dopaminergic progenitors.,"During early development, midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuronal progenitors (NPs) arise from the ventral mesencephalic area by the combined actions of secreted factors and their downstream transcription factors. These mDA NPs proliferate, migrate to their final destinations, and develop into mature mDA neurons in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Here, we show that such authentic mDA NPs can be efficiently isolated from differentiated ES cells (ESCs) using a FACS method combining two markers, Otx2 and Corin. Purified Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells coexpressed other mDA NP markers, including FoxA2, Lmx1b, and Glast. Using optimized culture conditions, these mDA NPs continuously proliferated up to 4 wk with almost 1,000-fold expansion without significant changes in their phenotype. Furthermore, upon differentiation, Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells efficiently generated mDA neurons, as evidenced by coexpression of mDA neuronal markers (e.g., TH, Pitx3, Nurr1, and Lmx1b) and physiological functions (e.g., efficient DA secretion and uptake). Notably, these mDA NPs differentiated into a relatively homogenous DA population with few serotonergic neurons. When transplanted into PD model animals, aphakia mice, and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, mDA NPs differentiated into mDA neurons in vivo and generated well-integrated DA grafts, resulting in significant improvement in motor dysfunctions without tumor formation. Furthermore, grafted Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells exhibited significant migratory function in the host striatum, reaching >3.3 mm length in the entire striatum. We propose that functional and expandable mDA NPs can be efficiently isolated by this unique strategy and will serve as useful tools in regenerative medicine, bioassay, and drug screening.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

Abnormalities in stress reactivity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) function may be involved in the mechanistic connection between stress and the initiation, development, and/or maintenance of alcohol dependence. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occurs with alcohol dependence and is characterized by HPA axis abnormalities. This study investigated the relationship between subjective and neuroendocrine stress reactivity to the cold pressor task (CPT) and prospective alcohol use among individuals with alcohol dependence, with and without comorbid PTSD.	Participants were 63 individuals with (a) alcohol dependence only (n=35) or (b) comorbid alcohol dependence and PTSD (n=28). Participants completed the CPT, a widely used physical laboratory stressor. Subjective stress, craving, adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), and cortisol were measured before, immediately after, and at 5, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the CPT. Alcohol use during 1 month following testing was also assessed.	For the alcohol-only group, change in craving immediately following the CPT and craving during the 120-minute recovery phase were predictive of follow-up alcohol use. For the alcohol/PTSD group, change in craving was not predictive of follow-up use. Baseline drinking was, however, predictive of followup alcohol use for the alcohol/PTSD group. For the alcohol-only group, a blunted ACTH response coupled with a higher change in craving following the CPT was associated with significantly greater frequency and intensity of drinking during the follow-up phase.	These preliminary findings demonstrate significant differences between the alcohol-only and the alcohol/PTSD group in predictors of relapse. For the alcohol-only group, reactivity to an acute laboratory stressor may be predictive of subsequent alcohol use. This was not true for the alcohol/PTSD group. Although preliminary, the findings may help shed light on the mechanistic relationship between stress reactivity and increased risk for alcohol relapse and dependence in individuals with and without other Axis I comorbidity.",Remaining

These problems can lead to cascading effects on children's overall development. However, few studies have identified evidence-based interventions for this population.	A 6-year-old boy with bilateral HL presented to the clinic with significant behavioral challenges. These challenges (e.g., fatigued quickly, poor attention, and hyperactivity) were affecting the reliability of audiological testing to determine cochlear implant candidacy. Thus, the child was referred for Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) to address these behavioral challenges.	PCIT is an evidence-based intervention that has been shown to significantly improve externalizing behavior problems. This study describes how the Child-Directed Interaction phase of PCIT was tailored for a child with bilateral HL. The goal of the intervention was to reduce externalizing behaviors in order to reliably complete a cochlear implant evaluation. Post-intervention, significant improvements were noted in behavior, including a decrease in disruptive behavior to normal levels. This led to completion of previously unsuccessful audiological testing and determination of cochlear implant candidacy.	This study illustrates how PCIT was successfully tailored to one child with an HL. This is critical as children with HL are at risk for behavior problems, and effective interventions for disruptive behaviors in children with HL may lead to significant improvements in medical and psychosocial outcomes for children with HL and their families.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

The NO-precursor L-arginine has been shown to counteract CBF decreases early after trauma, but microcirculatory and more long-term effects on CBF of L-arginine have not been investigated. In an attempt to analyze effects of L-arginine on the microcirculation in the traumatized brain, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of L-arginine compared to vehicle (0.9% saline) following a standardized controlled cortical-impact brain trauma in mice. Cerebral blood flow (autoradiography [(14)C]-iodoantipyrine), number of perfused capillaries (FITC-dextran fluorescence technique), brain water content (wet vs. dry weight) and the blood to brain transfer constant K(i) for [(51)Cr]-EDTA were analyzed in the injured and the contralateral cortex. Cortical blood flow in the injured cortex was 0.43+/-0.3 mL/g/min and 0.81+/-0.3 mL/g/min 3 h after trauma in the vehicle and L-arginine groups, respectively (p<0.05), and no treatment effect was seen 24 h after trauma. The number of perfused capillaries decreased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. K(i) increased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. Brain water content was lower in the L-arginine group than in the vehicle group 3 h after trauma and there was no difference between the groups 24 h after trauma. We conclude that L-arginine reduces brain edema formation and improves cortical blood flow in the early phase after a brain trauma, whereas no circulatory effects can be seen after prolonged treatment.",Animal-drug-intervention

The gene responsible for MEN 1 syndrome was recently identified and cloned. Low rates of MEN 1 gene mutations and deletions have been reported in sporadic pituitary adenomas. To elucidate the role of the MEN 1 gene in the pathogenesis of MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors, we examined pituitary adenomas from 11 MEN 1 patients for the presence of 11q13 allelic loss. Ten of the 11 pituitary tumors were informative by PCR-based loss of heterozygosity analysis. Using a combination of family pedigree analysis and restriction analysis directed at the mutated allele in 8 of the 10 informative cases, it was demonstrated in all 8 cases that it is the wild-type allele that undergoes deletion. All 11 tumors, 4 of which were growth hormone secreting, were additionally analyzed for mutation in the Gs alpha subunit (gsp) gene. None of the tumors (0 of 11 tumors) revealed a gsp gene mutation. Therefore, genetic alterations of the MEN 1 gene seem to play a dominant role in MEN 1-associated pituitary tumorigenesis, whereas gsp gene mutations do not seem to be a frequent event in either growth hormone-secreting or other types of MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors. These results suggest that MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors develop via genetic pathways that differ from those of most sporadic pituitary tumors.",Remaining

Lumbar MRI revealed spinal canal stenosis at the L3/L4-L5/S1 intervertebral levels due to disk herniations and ossification of the yellow ligaments. We examined cerebellar stimulation in order to determine whether the ataxia was due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or peripheral nervous system. Conditioning electrical stimulation over the cerebellum did not change the size of motor potentials evoked by magnetic cortical stimulation in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Her clinical course was good, and the limb and truncal ataxia became very mild about 4 months after the onset, although there was little change in the decreased deep sensations. The cerebellar stimulation in the second study was normal.

There is strong evidence supporting prompt decompressive craniectomy after large hemispheric ischemic stroke as a means to reduce mortality. Nevertheless, functional outcomes can vary significantly. Clinical trials have traditionally judged these outcomes by a priori dichotomization without taking into account individual patient and caregiver preferences. If these are not incorporated into shared decision-making, there are significant risks in both directions, i.e. producing outcomes that may be judged as unacceptable to survivors, or not offering life-saving treatments to patients that according to their own values could be beneficial. In the absence of decision aids, we explore insights from decision theory and propose an expected utility-inspired approach as a supplementary navigating tool in the decision-making process. Four patient case scenarios are discussed as a demonstration of using individualized rankings of outcome preferences, and deriving expected utilities for interventions such as decompressive craniectomy versus medical therapy. The ultimate aim of the suggested approach is to assure that patient values are elicited and incorporated, and possible range and nature of outcomes are discussed, and by attempting to connect best available means to patient individualized ends.",Non-systematic-review

As sleep needs remain remarkably stable, adolescent sleep phase delay causes chronic sleep depriva- tion and subsequently daytime fatigue or even excessive daytime sleepiness, and also metabolic disturbances, neurocognitive problems associated with decreased school perfor- mance, as well as mood disorders. Whereas genetic and biological factors have been investigated by a number of studies, research on social, cognitive-behavioural or psychological factors is still limited to date.

The variation from non-suppressor to suppressor (which yielded in 60% of this sample) can be explained by the clinical improvement, but not the inverse change. In this paper, different possibilities on this change are analyzed, the most probable being the direct effect of the carbidopa in eminentia media. The carbidopa is administered because it is an inhibitor of the aminoacid decarboxylase, and since it does not cross the hematoencephalic barrier, it permits a better use of the 5-HTp.

Alteration of several molecular mechanisms has been correlated with the progression of AD. In recent years, dysregulation of proteostasis-associated pathways has emerged as a potential risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. This review investigated the ubiquitin-proteasome system, lysosome-associated degradation, endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation, and the formation of advanced glycation end products. These pathways involved in proteostasis have been reported to be altered in AD, suggesting that their study may be critical for identifying new biomarkers and target molecules for AD.",Non-systematic-review
1584,24225435,The Israel journal of psychiatry and related sciences,Elaboration on posttraumatic stress disorder diagnostic criteria: a factor analytic study of PTSD exposure to war or terror.,"In societies facing prolonged exposure to war and terror, empirical research provides mixed support for the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters groupings identified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR) as re-experiencing the event, avoidance and emotional numbing, and hyperarousal.	This study examines the validity of the PTSD symptom clusters in elements of Israeli society exposed to man-made trauma. Survivors (N=2,198) of seven different war and terror-related traumas were assessed using a DSM-IV-TR based PTSD inventory. Four confirmatory factor analytic models were compared.	The most acceptable model was a correlated model consisting of four factors of re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal. DSM-IV-TR avoidance empirically split into active avoidance and emotional numbing. These results corroborate knowledge and suggest that in Israel, where stressors are ongoing, the PTSD symptom clusters may be reformulated in DSM-5 to consist of re-experiencing, active avoidance, emotional numbing and hyperarousal.",Remaining

1586,19222703,Journal of neurochemistry,In vitro glutaminase regulation and mechanisms of glutamate generation in HIV-1-infected macrophage.,"Mononuclear phagocyte (MP, macrophages and microglia) dysfunction plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD) through the production and release of soluble neurotoxic factors including glutamate. Glutamate production is greatly increased following HIV-1 infection of cultured MP, a process dependent upon the glutamate-generating enzyme glutaminase. Glutaminase inhibition was previously found to significantly decrease macrophage-mediated neurotoxicity. Potential mechanisms of glutaminase-mediated excitotoxicity including enzyme up-regulation, increased enzyme activity and glutaminase localization were investigated in this report. RNA and protein analysis of HIV-infected human primary macrophage revealed up-regulation of the glutaminase isoform GAC, yet identified no changes in the kidney-type glutaminase isoform over the course of infection. Glutaminase is a mitochondrial protein, but was found to be released into the cytosol and extracellular space following infection. This released enzyme is capable of rapidly converting the abundant extracellular amino acid glutamine into excitotoxic levels of glutamate in an energetically favorable process. These findings support glutaminase as a potential component of the HAD pathogenic process and identify a possible therapeutic avenue for the treatment of neuroinflammatory states such as HAD.",In-vitro-study

The aim of the study was to determine normal values and to assess the accuracy of CCA flow as a predictor of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. One hundred one people who did not have disease were studied; the overall mean flow rate was 395 +/- 79 ml/min (mean +/- S.D.). There was no significant correlation with age, height, or body surface area but there was with body weight (p less than 0.05). A statistically significant difference was evident between men (424 +/- 88 ml/min) and women (371 +/- 62 ml/min) (p less than 0.001). The intrasessional variation (S.D./mean) was 13% and the intersessional variation, 16%. No significant difference was seen between the sides. Ninety-two patients who had carotid angiography were studied and the flow rates compared with the degree of ICA stenosis on each side. The flow rate for mild ICA stenosis (1% to 39%) was 404 +/- 109 ml/min, for moderate stenoses (40% to 69%), 390 +/- 91 ml/min, and for severe stenoses (70% to 99%), 351 +/- 109 ml/min. There was a significant difference in flows only between mild and severe grades of stenosis of the ICA (p less than 0.01). With unilateral stenosis, comparison of flow values in the normal and affected sides showed the greatest discriminatory power when the absolute difference of flow values was taken (p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Remaining

Recent reports clarified that NSE exists not only in neurons but also in neuroendocrine cells, thrombocytes and lymphocytes. Besides normal neuronal tissues, high serum levels of NSE were noticed in the patients with neuroblastomas, small cell carcinomas of the lung, and malignant gliomas, etc. In order to clarify the usefulness of NSE as a marker for intracranial neoplasms or an indicator for prognosis of the patients with intra-cranial tumors, we studied serum, CSF and intratumoral fluid levels of NSE in 62 patients with intra-cranial tumors by radioimmunoassay. Serum level of NSE in healthy adults ranged from 4.1 to 8.9 ng/ml (5.6 +/- 1.38 ng/ml, n = 15) and that of CSF ranged from 4.9 to 7.3 ng/ml (means 6.1 ng/ml, n = 3). Serum samples from patients with malignant gliomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors contained abnormally high level of NSE, of which mean value were 22.3 ng/ml and 16.1 ng/ml, respectively. However, serum samples from patients with low grade gliomas and other intracranial tumors arising from non-neuroectodermal tissues were within normal range. In 9 patients, not only serum levels but CSF levels and/or intratumoral cyst levels of NSE were examined at the same time. Except one meningioma case, CSF levels of NSE were higher (4.9-55.3 ng/ml, mean: 19.3 ng/ml) than that of serum levels (2.3-17.3 ng/ml, mean: 12.7 ng/ml).

1589,19432386,Dialogues in clinical neuroscience,Multiple rare variants in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders.,"Recent studies in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) support an important role for multiple rare variants in these conditions. This is a clinically important finding, as, with the demonstration that a significant proportion of ASDs are the result of rare, etiological genetic variants, it becomes possible to make use of genetic testing to supplement behavioral analyses for an earlier diagnosis. As it appears that earlier interventions in ASDs will produce better outcomes, the development of genetic testing to augment behaviorally based evaluations in ASDs holds promise for improved treatment. Furthermore, these rare variants involve synaptic and neuronal genes that implicate specific pathways, cells, and subcellular compartments in ASDs, which in turn will suggest novel therapeutic approaches in ASDs. Of particular recent interest are the synaptic cell adhesion and associated molecules, including neurexin 1, neuroligin 3 and 4, and SHANK3, which implicate glutamatergic synapse abnormalities in ASDs. In the current review we will overview the evidence for a genetic etiology for ASDs, and summarize recent genetic findings in these disorders.	Los estudios recientes en los trastornos del espectro autista (TEA) refuerzan el importante papel que tienen múltiples variantes raras en estos cuadros. Este es un hallazgo clínicamente importante, ya que con la demostración de que un porcentaje significativo de TEA son el resultado de una etiología de varían-tes genéticas raras, puede llegar a ser posible el empleo de pruebas genéticas como complemento al análisis de la conducta para un diagnóstico más precoz. Ya que se ha observado que las intervenciones más precoces en los TEA generan mejores evoluciones, el desarrollo de pruebas genéticas complementarías a las evaluaciones basadas en la conducta en los TEA promete un mejor tratamiento. Además estas variantes raras comprenden genes sinápticos y neuronales que incluyen vías específicas, células y compartimentos subcelulares en los TEA, lo que a la vez sugiere nuevas aproximaciones terapéuticas en los TEA, Recientemente ha tenido un especial interés la adhesión celular sináptica y las moléculas asociadas, que incluyen la neurexína 1, las neurolígínas 3 y 4, y SHANK3 lo que se traduce en alteraciones de la sínapsís glutamatérgíca en los TEA, En este artículo se revisa la evidencia de la etiología genética para los TEA y se resumen los hallazgos genéticos recientes en estos trastornos.	Les études récentes plaident en faveur de l'existence de nombreux variants rares dans les troubles du spectre autistique (TSA), Ce résultat est cliniquement important car si une proportion significative de TSA provient de variants génétiques étiologiques rares, il devient possible d'utiliser des tests génétiques pour éviter les analyses comportementales pour effectuer un diagnostic plus précoce.

1590,17565028,Chest,Sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes.,"The latest edition of The International Classification of Sleep Disorders: Diagnostic and Coding Manual subsumes a broad range of disorders under the heading 'Sleep Related Hypoventilation/Hypoxemic Syndromes.' Some are quite common, such as COPD with worsening gas exchange during sleep; while some are exceedingly rare, such as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. All share the attribute of abnormal gas exchange that worsens, or may only be present, during sleep. The sleep state, the sleeping posture, and the circadian rhythm driving sleep all may affect respiration by altering control of breathing and/or pulmonary mechanics. These changes are largely inconsequential in the normal individual but interact with respiratory, neurologic, or neuromuscular disease to manifest as the sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes. In addition to optimal treatment of the underlying disorder (when known and when possible), treatment usually involves nocturnal ventilatory support that is now most commonly provided by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.",Non-systematic-review
1591,10725856,International journal of cancer,Comparison of three treatment options for single brain metastasis from lung cancer.,"Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and the combination of both treatment methods were used for the management of single brain metastasis from lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to compare these three different treatment options in terms of local response, survival, and quality of life. From June 1995 to July 1998, 70 lung cancer patients with new diagnosed single brain metastasis were treated with either WBRT alone (n = 29), or SRS alone (n = 23), or the combination of both methods (n = 18). Multiple endpoints, including survival, freedom from local progression (FFLP), freedom from new brain metastasis (FFNBM), local control, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and causes of death, were measured from the date of treatment completion and compared using univariate and multivariate analyses. For patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, the median survivals were 5.7, 9.3, and 10.6 months, the median FFLP were 4.0, 6.9, and 8.6 months, the median FFNBM were 4.1, 6.7, and 8.6 months, and the local response rates were 55.6, 87.0, and 88.9%, respectively. Four of the 29 patients treated with WBRT-alone continued with progression of disease. The post treatment KPS showed improvement in 41.4, 82.6, and 88.9% of patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, respectively. The progression of new and/or recurred metastatic brain tumor as the cause of death accounted for 51.7%, 50. 0%, and 28.3% of the patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that the significant differences among the three treatment arms were observed based on all of the above mentioned endpoints. However, the comparison between SRS-alone and SRS+WBRT groups indicated that adding WBRT only improves FFNBM (P = 0.0392). Cox regression analyses revealed no significant difference in both of the KPS (P = 0.1082) and causes of death (P = 0.081) among the three arms. Both SRS alone and SRS+WBRT seem better in prolonging life and improving quality of life than WBRT alone for patients with single brain metastasis from lung cancer. But the combined therapy did not show significant advantage over SRS alone in improving survival, enhancing local control, and quality of life except for a more favorable FFNBM. Further investigation via a randomized trial is needed to access the value of adding WBRT to SRS in the management of this group of patients. Int. J. Cancer (Radiat. Oncol.

General section,Plasma and CSF tryptophan in cancer anorexia.,"Eighteen untreated cancer patients and ten sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers were studied. In all patients eating behavior was investigated by means of a specific questionnaire from which the presence of anorexia and anorexia-related symptoms was assessed. To investigate the role of tryptophan in cancer anorexia, fasting plasma and CSF levels of tryptophan and other neutral amino acids were assayed in patients and controls. Cancer patients showed abnormally high plasma free tryptophan levels. In case of patients with cancer anorexia a significant rise of the ratio in plasma between free and tryptophan/large neutral amino acids, competing with tryptophan for its brain entry, was observed. This increase was correlated to a consistent rise of CSF tryptophan levels suggesting a specific role of the serotoninergic system in the pathogenesis of cancer anorexia.",Remaining

Ethanol dependence increases the maximum responses to NA and carbachol whereas responsiveness to barium remains unaltered. The concentration-effect curve to calcium was shifted to the left (3.0-fold at the EC50 level). It is concluded that in vas deferens isolated from ethanol-dependent mice the increased responsiveness to NA, carbachol and calcium is a consequence of an enhanced calcium entry through voltage-independent calcium channels, as it has been reported for brain tissue.",Animal-drug-intervention
1594,7775177,Headache,Is abdominal pain a feature of adult migraine?,"Recurrent abdominal pain in children, frequently diagnosed as 'abdominal migraine,' is thought to evolve into more typical migraine headache during the teens and twenties. If this transformation occurred, we would expect some adult migraineurs to retain abdominal pain; but we could not recall this symptom being mentioned by patients. However, without direct questioning the absence cannot be assumed. We, therefore, asked 100 migraineurs about abdominal symptoms during migraine attacks: only one experienced unexplained abdominal pain. We conclude that abdominal pain is not a feature in adult migraineurs, leading us to support the notions that: (1) recurrent abdominal pain of childhood has a number of causes; (2) abdominal migraine may be an incorrect attribution and is liable to be over diagnosed; (3) abdominal migraine requires more precise definition; (4) the transition from childhood abdominal migraine to adult migraine needs precise prospective study.",Remaining

C3H/HeJ mice primed with V-LSGPC developed neither circulating antibodies nor CD8+ cytotoxic T cells specific for LCMV, yet they resisted a normally lethal LCMV challenge. Spleen cells from such mice gave a proliferative response to LCMV in vitro that was inhibitable by anti-CD4 antibody. Synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted T-cell sites common to the envelope glycoprotein precursor (GP-C) of LV and that of LCMV were used to map the specificity of the proliferative response to an epitope located between amino acids 403 and 417 of LV GP-C. Several CD4+ T-cell clones specific for the 403-417 peptide were isolated and found to produce gamma interferon in response to both the peptide and LCMV. One of these clones, C9, was selected for further study. C9 lysed I-AK-bearing target cells, and when adoptively transferred to C3H/HeJ mice, it was capable of mediating both a peptide-specific delayed hypersensitivity reaction and resistance to lethal LCMV challenge. These collective findings demonstrate, for the first time, that CD4+ T cells can play a major role in arenavirus-specific cross-protective immunity.",Animal-drug-intervention

Dysfunction of DRPs may result in neurodevelopmental abnormalities, which may be a factor in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The expression of one member of DRP-2 in humans has been reported to be decreased in the brains of people with schizophrenia. In addition, the DRP-2 gene (Dihydropyrimidinase-like 2; DPYSL2) is located on chromosome 8p21, a region that has been implicated in schizophrenia in genetic linkage studies.	We investigated a genetic association between five polymorphisms of the DRP-2 gene and schizophrenia in the Japanese population.	The *2236T>C polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) exhibited significant differences with respect to the distribution of the genotype and allele in patients compared with control subjects. The frequency of the *2236C allele was significantly higher in control subjects than patients with schizophrenia (p =.0097) and paranoid-type schizophrenia (p =.0083).	Our results suggest that the *2236C allele in the 3'UTR of the DRP-2 gene, or an unknown mutation in linkage disequilibrium with this allele, may reduce the susceptibility to schizophrenia, especially the paranoid subtype.",Remaining

1598,19491314,Schizophrenia bulletin,Disengagement from mental health treatment among individuals with schizophrenia and strategies for facilitating connections to care: a review of the literature.,"Disengagement from mental health services can lead to devastating consequences for individuals with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses who require ongoing treatment. We review the extent and correlates of dropping out of mental health treatment for individuals with schizophrenia and suggest strategies for facilitating treatment engagement. Although rates vary across studies, reviews of the literature suggest that up to one-third of individuals with serious mental illnesses who have had some contact with the mental health service system disengage from care. Younger age, male gender, ethnic minority background, and low social functioning have been consistently associated with disengagement from mental health treatment. Individuals with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders, as well as those with early-onset psychosis, are at particularly high risk of treatment dropout. Engagement strategies should specifically target these high-risk groups, as well as high-risk periods, including following an emergency room or hospital admission and the initial period of treatment. Interventions to enhance engagement in mental health treatment range from low-intensity interventions, such as appointment reminders, to high-intensity interventions, such as assertive community treatment. Disengagement from treatment may reflect the consumer's perspective that treatment is not necessary, is not meeting their needs, or is not being provided in a collaborative manner. An emerging literature on patient-centered care and shared decision making in psychiatry provides suggestive evidence that efforts to enhance client-centered communication and promote individuals' active involvement in mental health treatment decisions can also improve engagement in treatment.",Non-systematic-review

We conducted a meta-analysis of studies on expression and cellular distribution of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) in IE patients to evaluate the contribution of this protein to AED resistance. In addition, we summarize experiments examining MRP1 expression and substrates in animal models of IE.	The literature search based on pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as quality assessment, data extraction and statistical analyses were conducted concurrently by two independent researchers. We identified nine high-quality studies (Jadad score ≥3) published between 2000 and 2014 on the expression and cellular distribution of MRP1 in IE patients. A fixed effect model was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Forest and funnel plots were constructed to assess study heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively.	MRP1 expression was significantly higher in both astrocytes (OR = 17.04, 95% CI: 7.69-37.76, P < 0.00001) and neurons (OR = 22.13, 95% CI: 8.52-57.46, P < 0.00001) of IE patients compared to controls, while there was no significant difference in endothelial cell MRP1 expression (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.09-1.79, P = 0.48). Funnel plot symmetry indicated no substantial publication bias. Most relevant preclinical studies from 2000 to 2014 found higher MRP1 expression in IE model rodents. Furthermore, MRP1 overexpression reduced the extracellular concentration of AEDs in brain, while MRP1 inhibitors enhanced brain AED concentrations.	Pooled results strongly suggest that MRP1 is overexpressed in both neurons and astrocytes of IE patients. Inhibition of MRP1 may enhance AED efficacy by increasing local drug availability.",Human-systematic-review

Deteriorated level of consciousness and mortality after LPS administration significantly ameliorated following both acute and chronic treatment with naltrexone in cirrhotic rats. However, acute and chronic administration of L-NAME did not change HE scores in cirrhotic rats. The effects of acute but not chronic treatment of naltrexone on HE parameters were reversed by L-NAME. Plasma NOx concentrations elevated in BDL rats, which were decreased after acute and chronic treatment by naltrexone or L-NAME, significantly. We suggest both acute and chronic treatment with naltrexone improved LPS-induced HE. But, only acute treatment with naltrexone may affect through NO pathway.",Animal-drug-intervention

Behavioral changes are a central feature of HD and often cause considerable distress and difficulty to patients and their relatives. However, they have received little attention from research despite their prevalence and clinical significance.	One hundred thirty-four patients with HD were assessed using the Problem Behaviors Assessment for Huntington Disease (PBA-HD), an instrument for rating the presence, severity and frequency of behavioral abnormalities in HD.	The findings confirm that behavioral problems are common among patients with HD. The most common symptoms were loss of energy and initiative, poor perseverance and quality of work, impaired judgment, poor self-care and emotional blunting. Affective symptoms such as depression, anxiety and irritability occurred in around half the patients studied. Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) were rarely reported. Factor analysis distinguished three clusters of behavioral symptoms, which were interpreted respectively as reflecting Apathy, Depression and Irritability. The 'Apathy' factor was highly correlated with duration of illness, whereas no such relationship was observed for the 'Depression' and 'Irritability' factors.	The results suggest that certain behavioral changes are fundamental to the progression of HD, whereas others have a more complex relationship to the disease process. The findings have implications for the choice of behavioral measures used to evaluate efficacy of therapeutic interventions.",Remaining

The hazard ratios (HRs) for unprocessed red meat and processed meat and risk of total stroke comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles were, respectively, 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-1.21; P-trend=0.15) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.64-1.32; P-trend=0.82) in men and 1.21 (95% CI 0.79-1.85; P-trend=0.10) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.51-1.27; P-trend=0.17) in women. The HRs for unprocessed red meat and processed meat and risk of ischaemic stroke were, respectively, 0.80 (95% CI 0.51-1.25; P-trend=0.51) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.57-1.29; P-trend=0.77) in men and 1.24 (95% CI 0.74-2.05; P-trend=0.13) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.47-1.42; P-trend=0.31) in women.

Patients move in and out of hospital systems quickly, and the severity of patients' illnesses during their hospital stay makes the experience chaotic and intense. This paper offers a model for understanding psychotic patients' experiences on an inpatient unit, and for effectively working with them in this setting. I have drawn on a parallel in film, that of 'The Madness of King George,' to help illustrate the concept of the hospitalized schizophrenic patient as imprisoned royalty. Through this metaphor, I explore the process of defensive breakdown and repair in psychosis, as it occurs in the hospital setting. I examine the relationships between patients, clinicians, and aspects of the hospital, and review some of the common dilemmas in this type of treatment.",Non-systematic-review
1607,27040285,Acta neuropathologica,Risk stratification of childhood medulloblastoma in the molecular era: the current consensus.,"Historical risk stratification criteria for medulloblastoma rely primarily on clinicopathological variables pertaining to age, presence of metastases, extent of resection, histological subtypes and in some instances individual genetic aberrations such as MYC and MYCN amplification. In 2010, an international panel of experts established consensus defining four main subgroups of medulloblastoma (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4) delineated by transcriptional profiling. This has led to the current generation of biomarker-driven clinical trials assigning WNT tumors to a favorable prognosis group in addition to clinicopathological criteria including MYC and MYCN gene amplifications. However, outcome prediction of non-WNT subgroups is a challenge due to inconsistent survival reports. In 2015, a consensus conference was convened in Heidelberg with the objective to further refine the risk stratification in the context of subgroups and agree on a definition of risk groups of non-infant, childhood medulloblastoma (ages 3-17). Published and unpublished data over the past 5 years were reviewed, and a consensus was reached regarding the level of evidence for currently available biomarkers. The following risk groups were defined based on current survival rates: low risk (>90 % survival), average (standard) risk (75-90 % survival), high risk (50-75 % survival) and very high risk (<50 % survival) disease. The WNT subgroup and non-metastatic Group 4 tumors with whole chromosome 11 loss or whole chromosome 17 gain were recognized as low-risk tumors that may qualify for reduced therapy. High-risk strata were defined as patients with metastatic SHH or Group 4 tumors, or MYCN-amplified SHH medulloblastomas. Very high-risk patients are Group 3 with metastases or SHH with TP53 mutation. In addition, a number of consensus points were reached that should be standardized across future clinical trials. Although we anticipate new data will emerge from currently ongoing and recently completed clinical trials, this consensus can serve as an outline for prioritization of certain molecular subsets of tumors to define and validate risk groups as a basis for future clinical trials.",Non-systematic-review
1608,27314344,International journal of molecular sciences,Roles of PTEN with DNA Repair in Parkinson's Disease.,"Oxidative stress is considered to play key roles in aging and pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, which could bring DNA damage by cells. The DNA damage may lead to the cell apoptosis, which could contribute to the degeneration of neuronal tissues. Recent evidence suggests that PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) may be involved in the pathophysiology of the neurodegenerative disorders. Since PTEN expression appears to be one dominant determinant of the neuronal cell death, PTEN should be a potential molecular target of novel therapeutic strategies against Parkinson's disease. In addition, defects in DNA damage response and DNA repair are often associated with modulation of hormone signaling pathways. Especially, many observations imply a role for estrogen in a regulation of the DNA repair action. In the present review, we have attempted to summarize the function of DNA repair molecules at a viewpoint of the PTEN signaling pathway and the hormone related functional modulation of cells, providing a broad interpretation on the molecular mechanisms for treatment of Parkinson's disease. Particular attention will be paid to the mechanisms proposed to explain the health effects of food ingredients against Parkinson's disease related to reduce oxidative stress for an efficient therapeutic intervention.",Non-systematic-review

Clients referred from resettlement agencies via the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to a community clinic in the United States (N = 278) were interviewed with structured, translated questionnaires. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses determined the associations of sociodemographic, pre-, and post-migration risk factors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and global functioning.	Regression data indicate that length of time between arrival in US and clinical services was significantly associated with PTSD and depression; participants receiving services after 1 year of resettlement were more likely to experience PTSD (adjusted OR = 3.29) and depression (adjusted OR = 4.50) than participants receiving services within 1 year. Anxiety was predicted by female gender (adjusted OR = 3.43), age over 40 years (adjusted OR = 3.12), Muslim religion (adjusted OR = 2.64), and receiving medical services (AOR 3.1). Severely impaired global functioning was associated with female gender (adjusted OR = 2.75) and unstable housing status (adjusted OR = 2.21).	Findings highlight the importance of examining post-migration variables such as length of time in country prior to receiving services in addition to pre-migration torture history upon relocated torture survivors. Clinicians and policy-makers should be aware of the importance of early mental health screening and intervention on reducing the psychiatric burden associated with torture and forced relocation.",Remaining
1610,8084630,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,Presentation and diagnosis of small acoustic tumors.,"With the recent advent of magnetic resonance imaging and auditory brain stem response, it is now possible to diagnose acoustic tumors while they are still quite small. As a result, it is becoming obvious that the clinical presentation of these smaller lesions can be somewhat variant to what is considered typical for an acoustic neuroma. Likewise, although the sensitivity of auditory brain stem response for larger tumors is believed to be quite good, the sensitivity for smaller tumors has recently been questioned, particularly when the patient is first seen early in the course of the disease with only mild otologic complications. To assess auditory brain stem response results as well as clinical and audiologic presentations, we conducted a retrospective study of patients treated for small acoustic tumors (less than 1 cm). Of the 70 patients included in the study, auditory brain stem response was abnormal in 65 (93%), on the basis of wave V latency prolongation and interaural latency differences. This would indicate that auditory brain stem response is a valid screening test for acoustic tumors, even in early stages of development. The clinical presentation of patients with small acoustic tumors was similar to that reported for acoustic tumors in general, but with vertigo occurring more frequently in patients with smaller tumors. Several atypical patterns of hearing loss were also noted.",Remaining

1612,19682673,Cognition,Visual perspective taking impairment in children with autistic spectrum disorder.,"Evidence from typical development and neuroimaging studies suggests that level 2 visual perspective taking - the knowledge that different people may see the same thing differently at the same time - is a mentalising task. Thus, we would expect children with autism, who fail typical mentalising tasks like false belief, to perform poorly on level 2 visual perspective taking as well. However, prior data on this issue are inconclusive. We re-examined this question, testing a group of 23 young autistic children, aged around 8years with a verbal mental age of around 4years and three groups of typical children (n=60) ranging in age from 4 to 8years on a level 2 visual perspective task and a closely matched mental rotation task. The results demonstrate that autistic children have difficulty with visual perspective taking compared to a task requiring mental rotation, relative to typical children. Furthermore, performance on the level 2 visual perspective taking task correlated with theory of mind performance. These findings resolve discrepancies in previous studies of visual perspective taking in autism, and demonstrate that level 2 visual perspective taking is a mentalising task.",Remaining

A prospective, observational feasibility study was carried out.	Intensive Care Unit of a third level hospital.	Consecutive recording was made of the adults diagnosed with brain death based on clinical criteria following admission to the Intensive Care Unit in the period from January to December 2017.	The procedure was performed at the patient bedside with the intravenous administration of technetium 99 metastable hexamethylpropylene amine oxime. The absence of perfusion in the cerebral hemispheres and brainstem was described as a pattern consistent with BD. The diagnosis was correlated to the transcranial Doppler and / or electroencephalographic findings.	A total of 66.1% of the patients were men with an average age of 60 years [IQR: 51-72]. The most frequent causes resulting in BD were hemorrhagic stroke (48.2%, n=27), followed by traumatic brain injury (30.4%, n=17), ischemic stroke (10.7%, n=6) and post-cardiac arrest anoxic encephalopathy (7.1%, n=4). A clinical diagnosis of BD was made in all cases, and the portable gamma-camera confirmed the diagnosis in 100% of the patients with a pattern characterized by the absence of brain perfusion. In addition, the results were compared with the transcranial Doppler findings in 46 patients, confirming the presence of diastolic reverberation and / or systolic peaks. The electroencephalographic tracing was obtained in 10 cases, with the appearance of electrical silence, due to the absence of an acoustic window in the transcranial Doppler study.

In this study the effect of high-dose, long-term alcohol exposure on the pancreas was investigated in 32 consecutive alcoholics admitted to a unit to treat the problems of withdrawal after a long period of heavy drinking. None of the alcoholics complained of abdominal symptoms. The signs of clinical acute pancreatitis (pain, increased serum C-reactive protein concentration or blood white cell count) were not observed in any of the alcoholics. A significant increase in serum total amylase, pancreatic isoamylase and lipase activities developed by the second day after termination of alcohol intake. These enzyme activities remained significantly increased for one week after cessation of drinking. Seven alcoholics had signs of chronic pancreatitis at ultrasonography (pancreatic calcification, pseudocyst). These results suggest that heavy alcohol intake over the long term may frequently induce subclinical pancreatic injury.",Remaining
1615,32594193,Experimental brain research,Dopamine boosts intention and action awareness in Parkinson's disease.,"Dopaminergic deficiency in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with underactivation of the supplementary motor area and a reduction of voluntary actions. In these patients, awareness of intention to act has been shown to be delayed. However, delayed awareness of intention to act has also been shown in patients with hyperdopaminergic states and an excess of unwilled movements, as in Tourette's, and in patients with functional movement disorders. Hence, the role of dopamine in the awareness of intention and action remains unclear. 36 PD patients were tested ON and OFF dopaminergic medication and compared with 35 healthy age-matched controls. In addition, 17 PD patients with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) were tested ON medication and ON and OFF stimulation. Participants judged either the moment a self-generated action was performed, or the moment the urge to perform the action was felt, using the 'Libet method'. Temporal judgments of intention and action awareness were comparable between unmedicated PD patients and controls. Dopaminergic medication boosted anticipatory awareness of both intentions and actions in PD patients, relative to an unmedicated condition. The difference between ON/OFF DBS was not statistically reliable. Functional improvement of motor ability in PD through dopaminergic supplementation leads to earlier awareness of both intention, and of voluntary action.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Data were pooled from 9 short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD randomly assigned to desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d, 100 mg/d, or placebo. A mixed-effects model for repeated-measures analysis of change from baseline score was used to determine the time point at which desvenlafaxine treatment groups separated from placebo on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and psychosocial outcomes. The association between early improvement and week 8 outcomes was examined using logistic regression analyses. Time to remission for patients with early improvement versus without early improvement was assessed using Kaplan-Meier techniques. Comparisons between groups were performed with log-rank tests.	In the intent-to-treat population (N = 4279 patients: desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d, n = 1714; desvenlafaxine 100 mg/d, n = 870; placebo, n = 1695), a statistically significant improvement on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was observed with desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d at week 1 (P = 0.0129) and with desvenlafaxine 100 mg/d at week 2 (P = 0.0002) versus placebo. Early improvement was a significant predictor of later remission. Treatment assignment, baseline depression scale scores, and race were significantly associated with probability of early improvement. On several measures of depressive symptoms and function, desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d and 100 mg/d separated from placebo as early as week 1 and no later than week 4 in patients with MDD.	These findings suggest that clinicians may be able to use depression rating scale scores early in treatment as a guide to inform treatment optimization.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention

In a 16-week follow-up, SR-VF daily dose could be modified on the basis of the therapeutic response and of the side effect profile. Symptomatological modifications were explored by means of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). SR-VF was well tolerated and only 2 patients interrupted the treatment before 24 weeks; the mean final dose +/- SD was 135.5 +/- 71.8 mg (range 75-225); in 26 (81.2%) patients, a statistically significant response was observed in depressive symptomatology within the first 8 weeks. The mean total score of HAM-D showed a significant reduction during the first 8 weeks of treatment, while the mean total score of HAM-A did not present a significant reduction until week 24. In patients with MD, a statistically significant response was observed after the first 8 weeks, while the reduction of the anxiety scores required more time and, in some cases, did not appear at all. Conversely, in patients with GAD and dysthymia, anxious and depressive symptomatology improved simultaneously. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that the improvement of depression is negatively related to a high score of CGI anxiety severity, and the improvement of anxiety is related to the presence of dysthymia and, to a lesser extent, to a short duration of the illness. Our data confirm the effectiveness and tolerability of SR-VF in mixed anxiety-depressive states. The differential response suggests a pathophysiologic and clinical distinction between GAD with comorbid MD or dysthymia.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

We prepared monovalent, divalent, and trivalent 6-sulfo-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (6S-GlcNAc) immobilized substrates. The morphology and secondary structure of Abeta (1-42) aggregates on the substrates were investigated by dynamic-mode AFM and FTIR-RAS. Abeta (1-42) interactions with multivalent sugars were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance, and the cytotoxicity of Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Morphological images showed, interestingly, that Abeta (1-42) aggregates had a tendency to form globules rather than fibrils as the valency of 6S-GlcNAc on the substrate was increased. The SPR measurements indicated that this morphological change of Abeta (1-42) was related to the change of binding mode, and the binding mode was dependent on the multivalency of the sugar. Globular Abeta (1-42) was more toxic than fibrillar Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells. These results suggested that the multivalency of sugars for the amyloidosis of Abeta (1-42) was significant in its morphology and aggregation effects at the surface of the cell membrane mimic.",In-vitro-study
1619,31075661,Gait & posture,Comparable walking gait performance during executive and non-executive cognitive dual-tasks in chronic stroke: A pilot study.,"Falls are a serious problem among stroke survivors due to subsequent injuries, recovery setbacks, dependence, and mortality. A growing body of dual-task (DT) studies suggests a role of executive functions in gait control and falls, particularly in subacute stroke. However, few studies have compared distinct executive and non-executive tasks, nor their effects on chronic stroke gait.	The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare the effects of distinct working memory (2-back) and inhibition (Stroop) tasks on walking gait performance in chronic stroke survivors.	A pilot sample of chronic stroke survivors (n = 11, 8 males, mean age = 70.91, 6-12months post-stroke event) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 13, 4 male; mean age = 68.46) were tested. Gait performance (speed, stride time, stride time variability, stride length and stride length variability) was measured using 2 wireless inertial measurement sensors under 4 walking conditions: 1) preferred walking (single-task: ST), 2) walking with a 2-back DT, 3) walking with a Stroop DT, and 4) walking with a non-executive motor response DT. The secondary tasks were also carried out in both ST (seated) and DT conditions, to examine bidirectional effects.	While the stroke survivor sample had a slower gait speed across conditions and tasks, there were no significant differences between the groups [F(1, 22) = 1.13, p =.299, η[2]p =  .049] on the spatial or temporal gait characteristics recorded: gait performance was maintained during executive and non-executive DTs. In addition, we did not find a significant effect of group on cognitive task performance (all p > .052). However, we observed a cost in accuracy on the 2-back DT for both groups, suggesting resource overlap and greater cognitive load (all t > 19.72, all p <  .001).	Our gait data contradict previous studies evidencing impaired gait post-stroke, suggesting functional recovery in this chronic stroke sample.",Remaining

Role conflict as a workplace stressor may contribute to instances of bullying from a passive perspective, which may lead to PTSD symptomology in victims. What remains less explored is if role conflict has a direct relationship to PTSD symptomology and how personality traits such as neuroticism and workplace factors such as managerial competencies may moderate the stress brought on by role conflict. Hence the present study seeks to examine this gap in the literature. This study utilizes a between-subjects, cross-sectional design with 159 participants, 39.6% male and 60.4% female. Most participants (60%) were Italian workers of a large social cooperative organization. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the measurement model was valid and had an adequate model fit. Results from two separate moderated mediation analyses found a positive, full mediation between the independent variable of role conflict, the mediator of exposure to bullying, and the dependent variable of PTSD symptomology. Furthermore, in this study, neuroticism strengthened the indirect effect while managerial competencies weakened it. The results highlight the importance of training competent managers and providing resources for more vulnerable employees to moderate employee work stress and its negative outcomes.",Remaining

Clinical evaluations allowed for AD classification and assessment of global cognition and five cognitive domains. NSAIDs were identified by direct medication inspection at baseline and follow-up evaluations. Neuropathologic data were available on 328 deceased participants. AD pathology was summarized as a global measure and as measures of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. We used Cox proportional hazards models and mixed models for incident AD and cognitive decline, respectively, and logistic and linear regression for pathologic outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, and education.	Overall, we found no apparent relation of NSAIDs to incident AD (n = 209 cases), change in cognition, or AD pathology. The hazard ratio of incident AD was 1.19 (95% CI 0.87-1.62) comparing those using NSAIDs with those not using NSAIDs at baseline, and 0.84 (95% CI 0.63-1.11) for specific use of aspirin. Findings were similar in analyses in which we considered NSAID use during follow-up. NSAIDs were not related to change in cognition (all p values > 0.14).

Given the relatively recent inclusion of the LPE specifier in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fundamental information is still unknown about LPE, such as how common the different domains are, how much they overlap with one another, whether they predict unique variance from each other, and the potential for the LPE specifier as a transdiagnostic facet of externalizing problems. Caregivers (n = 1,50) of children (Mage = 8.42, SD = 2.31) completed a questionnaire assessing individual LPE domains and measures of externalizing symptoms. Results showed that LPE specifier domains were highly related but separable. All LPEs were uniquely associated with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), CD, and overall impairment after controlling for other LPE items, child sex, and ADHD symptoms. Being unconcerned about performance, emotionally manipulative, and having shallow/deficient affect were uniquely associated with ADHD while controlling for ODD and CD symptomatology. Our findings fit with the historical conceptualization of LPE as a unidimensional construct and contributes to the growing evidence of the potential utility of assessing LPE across externalizing disorders in children.

Questionnaires were completed by a representative sample of 1103 university students in Seoul. Lifetime sexually transmitted disease risk behavior was categorized as none, only one, and multiple sexual experiences with prostitutes, whereas risk according to partner mix was classified as no sexual experience with prostitutes, sexual experience with prostitutes only, and with both prostitutes and girlfriends. The proportional odds model was applied to the data.	A total of 25.8% of the university students had visited prostitutes--17.6% visited twice or more, and 12.9% had sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends. Heavier alcohol consumption was significantly related to multiple visits to prostitutes (odds ratio = 1.71) and to sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends (odds ratio = 2.30).	In this first systematic study of the association between alcohol consumption and sexual experiences among Korean male university students, alcohol use was associated with risky sexual behaviors, and with first and most recent sexual experience with prostitutes, supporting our hypotheses.	In Asia, where men frequently have sex with prostitutes, there is a direct and statistically significant dose-response relationship between frequency of sex with prostitutes and HIV-1 seroprevalence.

The primary outcome measure was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days.	Out of 651 records, 402 patients were included. CE was found in 318 patients (79%). Thirty-five patients developed ICH on follow-up imaging. Fourteen ICHs were symptomatic. Stroke progression occurred in 59 patients. Multivariable regression showed a significant association between decreasing CE-ASPECTS and the mRS at 90 days (adjusted (a)cOR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.18), NIHSS at 24-48 h (aβ: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.29-0.84), stroke progression (aOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.26) and ICH (aOR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06-1.39), but not symptomatic ICH (aOR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.95-1.38). Iodine concentration was significantly associated with the mRS (acOR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.06-1.32), NIHSS (aβ: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.30-1.06), ICH (aOR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.81) and symptomatic ICH (aOR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38), but not stroke progression (aOR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.86-1.15). Results of the analyses with relative iodine concentration were similar and did not improve prediction.	CE-ASPECTS and iodine concentration are both associated with short- and long-term stroke outcomes. CE-ASPECTS is likely a better predictor for stroke progression.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
1628,37271291,Journal of affective disorders,Effectiveness of a transdiagnostic computerized self-applied program targeting children with emotional problems: A randomized controlled trial.,"Super Skills for Life (SSL) is an eight-session transdiagnostic program based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), aimed at the indicated prevention of childhood emotional problems, which has been implemented with positive short- and long-term results. The present study aimed to examine the effects of a self-applied computerized program based on SSL that maintains the same objectives and contents as the face-to-face program.	In this randomized controlled study, 75 children (49.3 % female) aged 8-12 years (Mage = 9.45, SD = 1.31), selected for exhibiting emotional symptoms, were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n = 35) or the waiting list control (WLC) group (n = 40). Pre- and post-intervention data were collected through self-reports and the report of parents who completed parallel versions of the same measures of emotional and behavioral problems.	Overall, compared to the WLC group, the intervention group showed positive effects on targeted emotional symptomatology in the short term. Based on parents' reports, a significant reduction was found in outcomes such as anxiety, depression, emotional symptoms, and internalizing problems, while self-reported results were similar except for anxiety. In addition, a positive impact was found on symptoms related to other types of difficulties (e.g., externalizing problems and general difficulties measured).	Small sample size, non-inclusion of follow-up assessment and other informants (e.g., teachers).	In conclusion, this research provides novel and promising data on the self-applied computerized adapted version of the SSL program, within a multi-informant approach, suggesting that it may be a useful tool for the indicated prevention of childhood emotional problems.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention
1629,3625187,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,Antidepressant blood levels in Southeast Asians. Clinical and cultural implications.,"After long-term treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), the TCA blood levels of 41 depressed Southeast Asian patients were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. No detectable medicine level was found in 25 (61%) of the patients and a therapeutic level by American standards was found in only six (15%), indicating a high incidence of noncompliance. A Cambodian subgroup, however, was significantly more compliant than either the Vietnamese or Mein patients. After patient education and a discussion of problems and benefits of medicine, compliance improved with Vietnamese and Cambodians but not with the Mien. Cultural and educational factors influence compliance with medicine and responsiveness to education. Because the Cambodians also suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder, it is probable that the presence of this illness increased compliance. Preliminary data among these patients indicate that Asians probably need the same dose of imipramine as Americans to achieve a 'therapeutic' level. Reports that Asians need lower doses of TCA medicine are limited by the high noncompliance rates with Asians. These high rates probably reflect cultural beliefs about illness and medication usage. It is valuable to perform TCA blood levels on Asian patients for whom antidepressants have been prescribed to monitor compliance and to lead into a discussion of benefits and side effects of the medicine. Evidence of noncompliance can lead to a productive doctor-patient discussion about beliefs and effects of the medication.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

1631,20052730,Cancer,Should extrapulmonary small cell cancer be managed like small cell lung cancer?,"The aim of this study was to determine if extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (EPSCC) should be managed using protocols similar to those for small cell lung cancer (SCLC).	Treatment strategies, survival, patterns of failure, and prognostic factors for patients with EPSCC were analyzed retrospectively at a large cancer center. SCLC was excluded by thoracic computed tomography (75%) or chest radiography (25%).	Of 120 eligible patients, 70% had limited disease (LD). Treatment modalities included chemotherapy (n = 82; 68%), radiotherapy (RT) (n = 80; 67%), and surgery (n = 41, 34%). The median survival for patients with LD and extensive disease was 1.4 years and 0.7 years, respectively. Gynecologic (n = 31) and gastrointestinal (n = 28) were the most common primary tumor sites. Gynecologic and head and neck primary tumor sites had better 1-year survival than other sites (P = .019 and 0.005, respectively). Brain metastasis was the site of first distant failure in 4.1% of patients versus 35% for soft tissue metastases. The lifetime risk of brain metastasis was 13%. Definitive RT (P = .004), LD (P = .028), and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) (P = .022) were found to be positive prognostic factors and weight loss (P < .001) was a negative prognostic factor on multivariate analysis.	Patients with EPSCC usually experienced short survival, often with early distant metastasis. Although PCI was associated with improved overall survival, brain metastasis was less frequent than in patients with SCLC, and therefore the potential benefit of PCI was less than in patients with SCLC. Definitive chemoradiotherapy was associated with better outcomes and should be delivered whenever feasible.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

1633,28645717,Vaccine,Surveillance of pneumococcal colonization and invasive pneumococcal disease reveals shift in prevalent carriage serotypes in Massachusetts' children to relatively low invasiveness.,"Following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), overall nasopharyngeal colonization rates have not changed significantly, however a dramatic and sustained decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children was observed in every setting where the PCVs were implemented. We aimed to describe the differences in invasive disease potential of serotypes that are common colonizers in pre- and post-vaccine eras in order to provide further insight in our understanding of dynamic epidemiology of pneumococcal diseases.	Using data from surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage and enhanced surveillance for IPD, a serotype specific 'invasive capacity (IC)' was computed by dividing the incidence of IPD due to serotype x by the carriage prevalence of that same serotype in children <7years of age in Massachusetts. We have evaluated the serotype specific invasive capacity in two periods; pre-PCV13 (2001/02, 2003/04, 2006/07, 2008/09) and post-PCV13 (2010/11 and 2013/14), and by age groups; <24monthsvs. ≥24months.	An approximate 50-fold variation in the point estimate was observed between the serotypes having the highest (7F, 38, 19A, 3, 33F) and the lowest (6C, 35B, 21, 11A, 23B and 23A) computed serotype specific invasive disease potential. In the post-PCV13 era (6C, 35B, 11A, 23B and 23A), 5 of the 7 most common serotypes colonizing the nasopharynx were serotypes with the lowest invasive capacity. Serotype specific invasive capacity trended down in older children for majority of the serotypes, and serotypes 3, 10A and 19A had significantly lower invasive capacity in children older than 24months of age compared to younger children.	Invasive capacity differs among serotypes and likely by age. Point estimates of IC for most of the common serotypes colonizing children in Massachusetts in post-PCV13 era were low and likely explain the continued reduction in IPD from the pre-PCV era in the absence of specific protection against these serotypes.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Evidence to date is mixed and impeded by inadequate methodology. This study examined the extent to which fear activation and reduction within and across exposures predicted treatment outcomes for social anxiety disorder within a paradigm suitable for their measurement.	Sixty-eight adults with social anxiety disorder and fear of public speaking completed seven exposure sessions, each consisting of seven speeches conducted in virtual reality. Exposures were identical in duration, task requirements, and virtual public speaking situation. Fear was measured with skin conductance and subjective distress ratings. At baseline and post-treatment, participants completed a public speaking behavioral approach test with a panel of confederate judges; subjective fear was measured. A standardized questionnaire of anxiety symptoms was administered at baseline, post-treatment, and one-month follow-up.	No indices of within- or between-session fear reduction, measured by subjective distress and skin conductance response, predicted treatment outcome. One measure of fear activation was associated with outcomes such that less activation predicted greater symptom reduction; remaining indices did not predict outcomes.	Data were collected in the context of a randomized controlled trial of scopolamine; drug group was included in analytic models to account for drug influence. VR exposures elicited mild levels of distress that may underestimate levels of distress in clinical settings.	Findings failed to support fear activation or reduction within or across exposure sessions as significant predictors of treatment outcome for social anxiety.

There is uncertainty about the prognostic value of EEG background activity after hypothermia was introduced.	Searches were made on Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to March 1, 2018. Pooled sensitivities and specificities were calculated to assess the diagnostic power of burst suppression, low voltage, and flat trace background activities in the prediction of an adverse neurological outcome in the follow-up period in hypothermia-treated neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. I[2] was used to assess heterogeneity, and meta-regression was done to explore the source of heterogeneity.	Eighteen studies with 940 neonates were included. Pooled sensitivities and specificities in predicting the combination of death and neurodevelopmental impairment were burst suppression (sensitivity 0.87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 0.93], specificity 0.60 [95% CI 0.44 to 0.74]), low voltage (sensitivity 0.84 [0.75 to 0.90], specificity 0.80 [0.58 to 0.92]), and flat trace (sensitivity 0.85 [0.75 to 0.92], specificity 0.94 [0.77 to 0.99]). Subgroup analysis revealed the sensitivities of background patterns obtained after 24 hours of life were higher than those within age 24 hours, whereas the specificities were just the reverse. Flat trace performed best on sensitivity 0.93 (0.60 to 0.99) and specificity 0.90 (0.64 to 0.98) in predicting death. Burst suppression demonstrated the highest sensitivity 0.87 (0.58 to 0.97) and flat trace performed best on specificity 0.85 (0.60 to 0.96) in predicting neurodevelopmental impairment.	EEG background activity is predictive of long-term neurological outcome in hypothermia-treated neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

Annual Conference,Towards a method to study neurorobotic control in a rat model of spinal cord injury.,"Neurorobotic control of prosthetic devices may bea viable therapeutic intervention that provides spinal cord injury patients with the ability to use the neuronal activity of populations of single neurons to control an external device (i.e.cursor on a computer screen or robotic arm). However, we are limited by our understanding of how spinal cord injury alters the ability of these neurons to convey information about the intention to move. Therefore, there is a need to develop animal models that 1) describe how population of single neurons encode information about different behavioral tasks (skilled vs.unskilled), 2) determine how this encoding is modulated by spinal cord injury and 3) perform neurorobotic control after spinal cord injury. To address the first question, we developed a rat model of spinal cord transection to evaluate the effects of the injury on the neuronal activity related to hindlimb activity. The model consists of training the rat to press a pedal with its hindlimbs. This paper describes the method that defines both the magnitude and latency of a neuron's activity in terms of its Peri-Event Histogram relative to the animal's movements during the task. The method provides a means by which changes in neural activation can be correlated with changes in behavior.",Animal-other
1637,12854756,Journal of neurosurgery,Neuroprotective activity of tamoxifen in permanent focal ischemia.,"The authors have previously shown that tamoxifen is effective in protecting brain tissue from ischemic injury in a rat model of reversible focal ischemia. In this study the authors tested whether similar protective effects are found in a rat model of permanent focal ischemia (permanent middle cerebral artery [MCA] occlusion).	Tamoxifen (20 mg/kg) was given either before or at 1, 3, or 6 hours after permanent MCA occlusion in rats, with sustaining doses given every 12 hours thereafter. The median infarct volume measured after 72 hours was 113 mm3 for the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) groups, compared with 31 mm3 for pretreatment, and 14, 27, and 98 mm3 for treatment beginning at 1, 3, and 6 hours, respectively, after permanent MCA occlusion. The infarct reductions in the pretreated and 1- and 3-hour post-MCA occlusion treatment groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). At 3 hours after permanent MCA occlusion, tamoxifen also significantly reduced the infarct size at a lower dose of 5 mg/kg but not at 1 mg/kg; the same sustaining doses of 5 and 1 mg/kg were given every 12 hours.	Tamoxifen is as effective in a permanent model of focal ischemia as it is in the reversible model, and the therapeutic window of 3 hours after initiation of ischemia is identical. This effectiveness is likely due to several properties of the drug, including its known ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Because tamoxifen has been administered safely in humans for treatment of gliomas at similarly high doses to those used in this study, it may be clinically useful as a treatment for ischemic stroke.",Animal-drug-intervention

Post-traumatic stress disorder among rescue workers operating in Greece during the European refugee crisis.,"During the European refugee crisis, numerous Greek and international rescue workers are operating in Lesvos, offering search, rescue, and first aid services. Exposure to stressful life events while engaging in this rescue work can result in developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The study aimed to assess the prevalence of PTSD and explore potential differences between different categories of rescuers.	A cross-sectional study was conducted among 217 rescue workers. Participants were grouped according to affiliation: 'Greek Professionals Rescuers/GPR', 'International Professionals Rescuers/IPR' and 'Volunteer Rescuers/VR'. The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) was utilized. All tests were two-tailed (a = 0.05). Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and multivariate logistic regression were performed.	Overall probable PTSD prevalence found was 17.1%. Rates varied significantly per rescuer's category; 23.1% in GPR, 11.8% in IPR, and 14.6% in VR (p = 0.02). GPR demonstrated the highest risk compared to IPR and VR (p < 0.001). Females had approximately two times higher risk. Other significant risk factors included marital status, age, and number of children. Lack of previous experience, longer operation period, longer shift hours, and handling dead refugees and dead children were also considered major risk factors.	Rescue workers providing substantial aid to the refugees and migrants at Lesvos experience significant psychological distress. The present findings indicate the urgent need for targeted interventions. Further studies are needed to address long-term effects of the refugee crisis on rescuers, and explore effective measures to prevent PTSD.",Remaining

The intervention group performed exercises specifically designed to improve auditory processing speed and accuracy for 100 min/d, 5 d/wk for 6 weeks; the control group performed more passive computer activities (reading, listening, visuospatial game) for similar amounts of time. Subjects had a mean age of 74 years and 60% were men; 77% successfully completed training. On our primary outcome, Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status total scores improved 0.36 standard deviations (SD) in the intervention group (P=0.097) compared with 0.03 SD in the control group (P=0.88) for a nonsignificant difference between the groups of 0.33 SD (P=0.26). On 12 secondary outcome measures, most differences between the groups were not statistically significant. However, we observed a pattern in which effect sizes for verbal learning and memory measures tended to favor the intervention group whereas effect sizes for language and visuospatial function measures tended to favor the control group, which raises the possibility that these training programs may have domain-specific effects. We conclude that intensive, computer-based mental activity is feasible in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and that larger trials are warranted.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Although systemic and local factors in combination with genetic abnormality have been considered in its etiopathogenesis, OPLL remains a poorly understood pathology. Surgical management of OPLL and the choice of the most appropriate treatment are still controversial issues. Here the authors report a series of OPLL-affected patients treated by 'only-fixation' technique.	Between June 2012 and June 2019, 52 patients having OPLL were treated by a surgical strategy involving only spinal fixation without any form of bone or soft tissue decompression. Facetal fixation for both the atlantoaxial and subaxial spine formed the basis of the surgical treatment. Clinical parameters, analysis of video recordings before and after surgery, and patient self-assessment were included in the analysis of outcome.	During the mean follow-up period there was an immediate postoperative and progressive recovery in symptoms in 51 patients. Of 14 patients who were wheelchair bound before surgery, 12 walked independently on follow-up assessment of 6 months. All patients had successful arthrodesis in the surgically treated segments. There were no infective- or implant-related complications.	Decision making in the surgical management of cervical OPLL is still controversial. The concept of spinal instability has been shown to be a nodal point in the pathogenesis of OPLL, and 'only-spinal fixation' can be considered a rationale for an appropriate surgical treatment.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Data from DATASUS (the Brazilian Unified Health Computerized System) with free access in the web were collected regarding the number of beds, the development of new community centers, the number of mental health professionals, and costs involved from 1995 to 2005.	In ten years, the number of psychiatric beds decreased 41% (5.4 to 3.2 per 10,000 inhabitants) while community services have increased nine-fold (0.004 to 0.037 per 10,000 inhabitants). Psychologists and social workers have accounted for three and two-fold, respectively, as much hirings as psychiatrists. Psychiatric admissions accounted for 95.5% of the budget in 1995 and 49% in 2005, and the expenses with community services and medication have increased 15% each. As a whole, the expenses in mental health decreased by 26.7% (2.66 to 1.95 US$ per capita).	There has been a clear switch from hospital to community psychiatric care in Brazil, where the system can now provide a diversity of treatments and free access to psychotropics. However, the coverage of community services is precarious, and the reform was not accompanied by an increased public investment in mental health. The psychiatric reform is not a strategy for reducing costs; it necessarily implies increasing investments if countries decide to have a better care of those more disadvantaged.",Remaining

The majority of treatment for depression occurs in primary care, but effective care remains elusive. Clinical decision making and comparative studies of real-world antidepressant effectiveness are limited by the absence of clinical measures of severity of illness and suicidality.	The Distributed Ambulatory Research in Therapeutics Network (DARTNet) was engaged to systematically collect data using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at the point of care. We used electronic health records (EHRs) and the PHQ-9 to capture, describe, and compare data on both baseline severity of illness and suicidality and response and suicidality after diagnosis for depressed patients in participating DARTNet practices.	EHR data were obtained for 81,028 episodes of depression (61,464 patients) from 14 clinical organizations. Over 9 months, data for 4900 PHQ-9s were collected from 2969 patients in DARTNet practices (this included 1892 PHQ-9s for 1019 adults and adolescents who had at least one depression diagnosis). Only 8.3% of episodes identified in our depression cohort had severity of illness information available in the EHR. For these episodes, considerable variation existed in both severity of illness (32.05% with no depression, 26.89% with minimal, 19.54% with mild, 12.04% with moderate, and 9.47% with severe depression) and suicidality (69.43% with a score of 0, 22.58% with a score of 1, 4.97% with a score of 2, and 3.02% with a score of 3 on item 9 of the PHQ-9). Patients with an EHR diagnosis of depression and a PHQ-9 (n = 1019) had similar severity but slightly higher suicidality levels compared with all patients for which PHQ-9 data were available. The PHQ-9 showed higher sensitivity for identifying depression response and emergent (after diagnosis) severity and suicidality; 25% to 30% of subjects had some degree of suicidal thought at some point in time according to the PHQ-9.	This study demonstrated the value of adding PHQ-9 data and prescription fulfillment data to EHRs to improve diagnosis and management of depression in primary care and to enable more robust comparative effectiveness research on antidepressants.",Remaining

The first, postmodernism, stresses the development of experimental ethnographic texts that inscribe the voice of the transformed Other. Noting the weaknesses of the postmodern 'solution,' this paper proposes community-centered research as a more appropriate response to contemporary social realities. In this approach, the anthropologist seeks collaboration with the Other in the struggle for self-determination. Illustration is provided with the case study of anthropologists employed in a Puerto Rican community based organization (CBO), with specific reference to the emergence and development of the substance abuse prevention and treatment work of this CBO. While noting the difficulties of this role, the paper argues that scholarly activism, a model adopted from the Third World, is well suited to the postmodern world.",Remaining

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 159 patients included in the cluster analysis who were ≥60 years and who underwent four-month follow-up. The first cluster contained 50 patients, the second cluster contained 74 patients, and the third cluster contained 35 patients. Clinical parameters were identified from electronic health records and patient questionnaires. Laboratory tests, anthropometric measurements, the number of chronic diseases, the number of prescribed medications were recorded. Frailty was determined using the five criteria of Fried's phenotype -model. Levels of anxiety and depression were recorded using the Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score assessed cognitive impairment. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of frailty and pre-frailty. RESULTS Three overlapping clusters of phenotypes predicted frailty, and included obesity (n=50), multimorbidity with mental impairment (n=74), and decline in renal function with cognitive impairment (n=35). The predictors of outcome included increasing age, number of chronic diseases, inflammation, anemia, anxiety, and cognitive impairment, and reduced muscle mass. CONCLUSIONS In patients ≥60 years in a primary healthcare setting, multimorbidity predictors of pre-frailty and frailty included a decline in cognitive function and renal function.",Remaining

1653,21860044,Schizophrenia bulletin,Negative symptoms and social cognition: identifying targets for psychological interventions.,"How to improve treatment for negative symptoms is a continuing topic of debate. Suggestions have been made to advance psychological understanding of negative symptoms by focusing on the social cognitive processes involved in symptom formation and maintenance.	Following the recommendations by the National Institute of Mental Health workshop on social cognition in schizophrenia, this study investigated associations between negative symptoms and various aspects of social cognition including Theory of Mind (ToM), attribution, empathy, self-esteem, and interpersonal self-concepts in 75 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 75 healthy controls.	Negative symptoms were significantly associated with difficulties in ToM, less readiness to be empathic, lower self-esteem, less self-serving bias, negative self-concepts related to interpersonal abilities, and dysfunctional acceptance beliefs. Different aspects of social cognition were mildly to moderately correlated and interacted in their impact on negative symptoms: Difficulties in ToM were associated with negative symptoms in persons with low but not in persons with medium or high levels of self-esteem. Taken together, the social cognition variables and their hypothesized interaction explained 39% of the variance in negative symptoms after controlling for neurocognition and depression.	The results highlight the relevance of self-concepts related to social abilities, dysfunctional beliefs, and global self-worth alone and in interaction with ToM deficits for negative symptoms and thereby provide a helpful basis for advancing psychosocial interventions.",Remaining
1654,17630257,Schizophrenia research,Prospective memory in schizophrenia: primary or secondary impairment?,"Although a number of studies have now shown that schizophrenia is associated with impaired memory for future intentions (prospective memory), the degree and nature of the impairment remains to be clarified, as does the degree to which this impairment is secondary to deficits in other aspects of cognition. In the present study thirty participants with schizophrenia were compared with demographically matched controls on Virtual Week, a measure that closely represents the types of prospective memory tasks that actually occur in everyday life, and provides an opportunity to investigate the different sorts of prospective memory failures that occur. Participants with schizophrenia were significantly and comparably impaired on Virtual Week, irrespective of the specific prospective memory task demands. Importantly, after controlling for general cognitive functioning, executive functioning and retrospective memory, although the absolute magnitude of the deficit was reduced, significant impairment remained. These results suggest that individuals with schizophrenia experience generalized difficulties with prospective memory, and that whilst other cognitive deficits contribute to these difficulties, there is something unique to prospective remembering that is additionally disrupted in schizophrenia.",Remaining

Several types of stem cells have been investigated to ensure the safety and efficacy in clinical trials.Cryopreserved umbilical cord blood (UCB) mononuclear cells (MNCs) obtained from healthy donors have a more stabilized quality, thereby ensuring a successful therapy. A phase I study was conducted on patients aged 45-80 years who sustained acute ischemic stroke. An UCB unit was obtained from a public cord blood bank based on ABO/Rh blood type, HLA matching score (6/6), and cell dose (total MNC count of 0.5-5 × 10[7] cells/kg). In addition, to facilitate blood brain barrier penetration of UCB, 4 doses of 100 mL mannitol was administered intravenously after 30 min after UCB transplantation and every 4 h thereafter. The primary outcomes were the number of disease (GVHD) within 100 days after transfusion. The secondary outcomes were changes in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel index, and Berg Balance Scale scores. A 46-year-old male patient with identical ABO/Rh blood type, HLA matching score of 6/6, and MNC count of 2.63 × 10[8] cells/kg was enrolled. The patient did not present with serious AEs or GVHD during the 12-month study period. The patient's NIHSS score decreased from 9 to 1. Moreover, the Berg Balance Scale score increased from 0 to 48 and the Barthel index score from 0 to 90.

A sample of 1074 German teachers participated in this study. Two samples of the general population (N = 824 and N = 792) were used as comparison groups. Work distress was assessed with the Effort-Reward-Imbalance questionnaire, and mental health problems were measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Teachers reported more effort-reward imbalance (M = 0.64) compared with the general population (M = 0.57), and they perceived more mental health problems (GHQ: M = 12.1) than the comparison group (M = 9.5). School type was not associated with work stress and mental health. Teachers with leading functions perceived high degrees of effort and reward, resulting in a moderate effort-reward ratio and no heightened mental health problems. Teachers working full time reported more effort than teachers working part time, but the reward mean values of both groups were similar. This results in a somewhat unfavourable effort-reward ratio of teachers working full time. Moreover, teachers working full time reported more mental health problems. The results support the appropriateness of the effort-reward conception, applied to the profession of teachers.

These tumors, defined as G34R/V-mutant gliomas, are histologically heterogenous, with microscopic features of either HGG or embryonal tumors (primitve neuroectodermal tumor-like features). To assess the value of immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect G34R/V-mutated cases, we tested anti-histone G34V (clone 329E5) and anti-histone G34R (clone RM240) antibodies in a series of 28 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples. A total of 28 cases of hemispheric, IDH-wt HGG mainly affecting children and young adults were evaluated by IHC and by sequencing. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 17 years (0.1 to 26 y). By IHC, 10 of the 28 cases showed nuclear positivity for G34R and 3 of the 28 cases for G34V. Molecular analysis of G34R/V-mutation status was successful in 24 of the 28 cases. Mutation at glycine 34 of the H3F3A gene was identified in 9 of the 24 tumors (37%) by direct sequencing, revealing 7 of 9 positive case by sequencing and 2 of 9 false negative cases by IHC. Two of 15 negative case by sequencing demonstrated a false positivity by IHC. In total, in 4 (16.6%) of 24 cases, IHC and mutational results were discordant: 2 tumors were negative by IHC (false negative) but harbored G34R mutation by sequencing, and 2 cases were positive by IHC (false positive by IHC) but wild type by sequencing. Moreover, most mutated cases showed loss of ATRX expression and/or p53 expression. The positivity by IHC with specific antibody tested is not highly predictive for presence of G34R/V mutation, but confirmation by sequencing is mandatory; G34R/V mutations should be suspected in all hemispheric tumor IDH1/2 wild type, showing loss of OLIG2 and ATRX and/or p53 expression.",Remaining

It is suggested that the way in which the event is appraised determines the extent to which posttraumatic stress symptoms will be experienced. Therefore, a strong relationship between trauma appraisals and symptoms of PTSD might be expected. However, this relationship is not as firmly established in the child and adolescent literature. A systematic literature review of this relationship returned 467 publications, of which 11 met full eligibility criteria. A random effects meta-analysis revealed a large effect size for the relationship between appraisals and PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents, r = .63, 95% CI [.58, .68], Z = 17.32, p < .001, with significant heterogeneity present. A sensitivity analysis suggested that this relationship was not contingent on 1 specific measure of appraisals. Results were consistent with the cognitive behavioral theory of PTSD, demonstrating that appraisals of trauma are strongly related to posttraumatic stress in children and adolescents. However, this relationship was not observed in a sample of 4- to 6-year-olds, indicating that further research is required to explicate cognitive processing of trauma in very young children.",Human-systematic-review

However, overexpression of these TfRs on the GBM cell surface can also help to avoid restrictions of GBM cells to deliver chemotherapeutic agents within the tumor. Therefore, targeting of TfR-mediated delivery could counteract drug delivery issues in GBM and create a delivery system that could cross the BBB effectively to utilize ligand-conjugated drug complexes through receptor-mediated transcytosis. Hence, approach towards successful delivery of antitumor agents to the gliomas has been making possible through targeting these overexpressed TfRs within the CNS and glioma cells.

Our understanding of molecular mechanisms ensuring iron homeostasis at both cellular and systemic levels has dramatically increased over the past 15 years. However, despite major advances in this field, homeostatic regulation of iron in the central nervous system (CNS) requires elucidation. It is unclear how iron moves in the CNS and how its transfer to the CNS across the blood-brain and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers, which separate the CNS from the systemic circulation, is regulated. Increasing evidence indicates the role of iron dysregulation in neuronal cell death observed in neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective cortical czynand spinal motor neuron dysfunction that results from a complex interplay among various pathogenic factors including oxidative stress. The latter is known to strongly affect cellular iron balance, creating a vicious circle to exacerbate oxidative injury. The role of iron in the pathogenesis of ALS is confirmed by therapeutic effects of iron chelation in ALS mouse models. These models are of great importance for deciphering molecular mechanisms of iron accumulation in neurons. Most of them consist of transgenic rodents overexpressing the mutated human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Mutations in the SOD1 gene constitute one of the most common genetic causes of the inherited form of ALS. However, it should be considered that overexpression of the SOD1 gene usually leads to increased SOD1 enzymatic activity, a condition which does not occur in human pathology and which may itself change the expression of iron metabolism genes.",Non-systematic-review

MET levels were predicted from Actigraph counts using a published equation and compared with Cosmed measures. Predicted METs for each of the 56 activity bouts (14 participants x 4 bouts) were classified (light, moderate, vigorous, or very vigorous intensity) and compared with Cosmed-based classifications.	Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that walking condition intensities were significantly different (P < 0.05) and the Actigraph detected the differences. Overall correlation between measured and predicted METs was positive, moderate, and significant (r = 0.74). Mean predicted METs were not significantly different from measured for CP and BP, but for FP walking, predicted METs were significantly less than measured (P < 0.05).

Actigraph counts provide a valid index of activity across the intensities investigated in this study. For light to moderate activity, Actigraph-based estimates of METs are acceptable for group-level analysis and are a valid means of classifying activity intensity.

A prediction model could potentially support such treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to develop and internally validate a model for aneurysm rupture based on hemodynamic and geometric parameters, aneurysm location, and patient gender and age.	Cross-sectional data from 1061 patients were used for image-based computational fluid dynamics and shape characterization of 1631 aneurysms for training an aneurysm rupture probability model using logistic group Lasso regression. The model's discrimination and calibration were internally validated based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic and calibration plots.

An adverse hemodynamic environment characterized by a higher maximum oscillatory shear index, higher kinetic energy and smaller low shear area as well as a more complex aneurysm shape, male gender and younger age were associated with an increased rupture risk. The corresponding AUC of the model was 0.86 (95% CI [0.85, 0.86], after correction for optimism 0.84).

1678,2441955,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,Effects of sleep loss on delta (0.3-3 Hz) EEG and eye movement density: new observations and hypotheses.,"One night's sleep loss in young adults increased delta (0.3-3 Hz) EEG only in the first non-REM period of recovery sleep. The delta increase was limited to frequencies 0.3-4 Hz; within this range, the effects on wave form periods and amplitudes differed by frequency band. These results illustrate the value of computer analysis applied to the physiological units of sleep (the successive non-REM and REM periods of each sleep cycle). The finding that all of the delta increase occurred in the first sleep cycle appears inconsistent with the exponential decline of delta across cycles predicted by 'recovery' models of sleep. The fact that wave periods and amplitudes are differentially affected by sleep loss indicates that it is premature to adopt any single wave form characteristic (e.g., power spectral density) to index delta sleep. Our data also confirm a recent report that eye movement density decreases after sleep loss; we hypothesize that this change results from greater depth of sleep; an inverse relation of depth of sleep to eye movement density provides a coherent explanation for a range of otherwise disparate observations. Lastly, we propose a new hypothesis to account for the presence of eye movement during REM sleep.",Remaining

1681,10470554,Infectious disease clinics of North America,Pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis.,"Bacterial meningitis is fatal in 5% to 40% of patients and causes neurologic sequelae in up to 30% of survivors. Much has been learned recently about the mechanisms that lead to brain injury during meningitis. Once bacteria have gained access to the central nervous system, their multiplication triggers a complex host response consisting of humoral and cellular immune mediators, reactive oxygen intermediates, matrix-metalloproteinases, and other host-derived factors. Alterations of the cerebral vasculature, with disruption of the blood brain barrier and global and focal ischemia, ultimately lead to functional and structural brain damage. This article reviews current concepts of the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis and emphasizes possible therapeutic strategies to prevent its harmful consequences.",Non-systematic-review

1683,31155874,Zhen ci yan jiu = Acupuncture research,[Development of research on mechanisms of electroacupuncture intervention underlying improvement of cerebral ischemia rats in recent five years].,"In the present paper, we summarized the relevant research literature on the underlying mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) intervention in improving cerebral ischemia (CI) in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rats in recent 5 years from preconditioning and regular intervention. Outcomes showed that both EA preconditioning and regular intervention could relieve CI by reducing toxicity of excitatory amino acids (glutamate, aspartate) and TLR4/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascade reaction to relieve inflammatory injury. Moreover, EA preconditioning also could suppress the expression of pro-apoptosis genes and proteins to relieve apoptosis, regulate activation of microglia, and down-regulate the expression of blood brain barrier integrity-related matrix metalloprotein 9. Regular EA intervention also could promote angiogenesis to increase supply of blood and oxygen, facilitate regeneration, proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells via triggering activation of Notch and Shh signaling pathways, and promote the secretion of neurotrophin by up-regulating the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor /Trk A receptor, and promote expression of axon growth and synaptic remodeling-related factor (Ephrin B2/Eph B2) and sr-GTPase activating protein 1 and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42, axon growth and orientated down-stream molecules). However, up to now, the conclusion is still fragmentary and one-sided, and can not explain the specific mechanism of electroacupuncture in MCAO rats, needing further in-depth study.",Non-systematic-review

Up till now there is no specific documentation tool for the outpatient care of depressive disorders. Within the project 'Comprehensive Quality Management in Out-patient Care' a documentation tool for primary care as well as for psychiatric care of depressive patients has been developed, which embraces the principal diagnostic and therapeutic measures. This documentation tool consisting of an instrument for the physician to record the first consultation, a second instrument to record the following consultations as well as a patient questionnaire has been implemented and evaluated in primary care and psychiatric practices. The evaluation results demonstrate that the documentation tool is able to assess guideline-oriented treatment measures.

A 53-year-old man presented with a 1.5-year history of gait unsteadiness and vertigo and a few-week history of headache, emesis, and neurogenic dysphagia. A brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large, heterogeneously contrast enhancing mass located within the fourth ventricle, compressing the brainstem and causing supratentorial ventricle enlargement. A suboccipital craniotomy and a telovelar approach were performed to resect the tumor. The ventricular system was repermeabilized at the end of the operation.	A postoperative magnetic resonance imaging confirmed complete tumor removal. There was an initial worsening of the preoperative deficits, which progressively improved. The tumor was classified as a fourth ventricle schwannoma. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence during the 6 years of follow-up. At present, the patient is ambulatory and reports an intermittent diplopia on conjugated gaze.	This case report intends to reveal the eighth case of a fourth ventricle schwannoma since 1957. Schwannomas of the fourth ventricle are infrequent but should be accounted in the differential diagnosis of space-occupying lesions in this location. Gross total resection might be the definite treatment of these tumors if deemed possible.",Human-case-report

Twenty children (median age 90 months) receiving lamotrigine as add-on therapy for mean 26.7 (19.1) months, were followed for a median period of 7.9 (6-10) months. Follow-up was done every two weeks. The most common seizures types were either generalized tonic-clonic (6, 30%) or myoclonic (8, 40%). The average dose used was 3.86 mg/kg/day (with concomitant valproate). Good response (>50% reduction) or complete seizure control was seen in 72% patients. Side effects were seen in 27.5% patients and were mild in more than half of these. Lamotrigine was stopped in two patients due to adverse reactions, which resolved on stopping the drug.

1689,35793342,PloS one,Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of physical exercise and melatonin supplement on treating sleep disturbance in children with autism spectrum disorders.,"Previous study showed that both melatonin supplement and physical exercise intervention could improve sleep quality in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with the increase in endogenous melatonin level. However, none of the studies have directly compared the effectiveness between the two interventions on treating sleep disturbance in children with ASD. Without direct comparison, we do not know which intervention is better. Thus, we designed a study to compare which intervention is more effective to treat sleep disturbance in children with ASD and to examine whether the combination of the two could be the most efficacious. We present a protocol for conducting a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of physical exercise and melatonin supplement on treating sleep disturbance in children with ASD.	The proposed study will be a four-group randomised control trial (RCT) design, with equal allocation of participants to the three intervention groups and one control group.	All eligible participants will be randomly allocated to a morning jogging group, a melatonin supplement group, a combination group and a control group. Changes in sleep quality will be monitored through actigraphic assessment and parental sleep logs. Melatonin levels represented by 6-sulfoxymelatonin will be measured from the participants' 24-h and the first morning void urinary samples. All the assessments will be carried out before the intervention (T1), in the mid of the study (5 weeks after the commencement of the study) (T2) and after the 10-week intervention (T3). Level of statistical significance will be set at 5% (i.e. p < .05). The results of this trial will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journal.	The findings will provide evidence to determine whether physical exercise or melatonin supplement or the combination of interventions is the most effective to treat sleep disturbance in children with ASD.",Clinical-study-protocol

We therefore explored the possibility that serum aminotransferase concentrations are as closely related to large artery disease as insulin resistance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	Carotid artery plaque (ultrasonography), insulin resistance and liver enzymes (prior to methotrexate (MTX) were determined in 77 consecutive patients with RA (43 with and 34 without MTX).	Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were associated with insulin resistance in univariate analysis (R = 0.54, p < 0.0001 and R = 0.36, p = 0.001, respectively) and after adjustment for age, gender and waist circumference (partial R = 0.43, p = 0.0001 and partial R = 0.37, p = 0.001, respectively). ALT and AST concentrations were higher in patients with plaque as compared to in those without plaque (ALT (u/l): 27 2223242526272829303132 versus 20 181920212223, p = 0.02; AST (u/l): 25 2122232425262728 versus 20 19202122, p = 0.02). The odds ratios [95% CI] for plaque were 1.92 [1.14-3.24] (p = 0.01), 1.93 [1.17-3.16] (p = 0.009) and 1.82 [1.13-2.93] (p = 0.01) for 1 SD increase in ALT (~10 u/l) and AST (approximately 6 u/l) concentrations and in logarithmically transformed homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (~0.2 uU.mmol/ml.l), respectively. After adjustment for the potentially confounding characteristics of age, sex, hypertension and hypothyroidism in logistic regression models, ALT (p = 0.049) and AST concentrations (p = 0.027) remained associated with plaque whereas the HOMA-IR did not (p = 0.08). AST concentrations (p = 0.049) were associated with plaque independent of insulin resistance whereas the HOMA-IR (p = 0.1) was not associated with plaque independent of AST concentrations.	Within currently recommended reference ranges, serum aminotransferase concentrations may be strongly associated with insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in patients with RA. The measurement of aminotransferase concentrations could be a useful tool in cardiovascular risk stratification in patients with RA.",Remaining

1693,33054545,Journal of neurotrauma,Predicting the Individual Treatment Effect of Neurosurgery for Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury in the Low-Resource Setting: A Machine Learning Approach in Uganda.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In these low-resource settings, effective triage of patients with TBI-including the decision of whether or not to perform neurosurgery-is critical in optimizing patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. Machine learning may allow for effective predictions of patient outcomes both with and without surgery. Data from patients with TBI was collected prospectively at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, from 2016 to 2019. One linear and six non-linear machine learning models were designed to predict good versus poor outcome near hospital discharge and internally validated using nested five-fold cross-validation. The 13 predictors included clinical variables easily acquired on admission and whether or not the patient received surgery. Using an elastic-net regularized logistic regression model (GLMnet), with predictions calibrated using Platt scaling, the probability of poor outcome was calculated for each patient both with and without surgery (with the difference quantifying the 'individual treatment effect,' ITE). Relative ITE represents the percent reduction in chance of poor outcome, equaling this ITE divided by the probability of poor outcome with no surgery. Ultimately, 1766 patients were included. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) ranged from 83.1% (single C5.0 ruleset) to 88.5% (random forest), with the GLMnet at 87.5%. The two variables promoting good outcomes in the GLMnet model were high Glasgow Coma Scale score and receiving surgery. For the subgroup not receiving surgery, the median relative ITE was 42.9% (interquartile range [IQR], 32.7% to 53.5%); similarly, in those receiving surgery, it was 43.2% (IQR, 32.9% to 54.3%). We provide the first machine learning-based model to predict TBI outcomes with and without surgery in LMICs, thus enabling more effective surgical decision making in the resource-limited setting. Predicted ITE similarity between surgical and non-surgical groups suggests that, currently, patients are not being chosen optimally for neurosurgical intervention.

Three hundred and five elderly patients were randomly allocated to either control (161) or treatment (144) with 5000 units calcium heparin subcutaneously 8-hourly for two weeks. A reduction in deep-vein thrombosis rate from 72.7% in the control group to 22.2% in treatment patients was achieved. In patients who died (84), post-mortem examination to look for pulmonary emboli was performed in 71. Comparison between treated and untreated patients showed significantly fewer deaths and pulmonary emboli in the treated group. Most of the beneficial effect on mortality was seen in patients with lighter strokes. When patients with pulmonary emboli at post-mortem were excluded, there was no significant difference in the death rate in treatment (17) and control (14) groups. At post-mortem, 9.9% of the strokes were haemorrhagic (4 in the treatment and 3 in the control group). Low-dose calcium heparin given subcutaneously following acute stroke reduced the number of deep-vein thromboses, pulmonary emboli and deaths without increasing the number of haemorrhagic strokes in this study.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention
1695,29052307,Developmental science,Instrumental learning and cognitive flexibility processes are impaired in children exposed to early life stress.,"Children who experience severe early life stress show persistent deficits in many aspects of cognitive and social adaptation. Early stress might be associated with these broad changes in functioning because it impairs general learning mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we examined whether individuals who experienced abusive caregiving in childhood had difficulties with instrumental learning and/or cognitive flexibility as adolescents. Fifty-three 14-17-year-old adolescents (31 exposed to high levels of childhood stress, 22 control) completed an fMRI task that required them to first learn associations in the environment and then update those pairings. Adolescents with histories of early life stress eventually learned to pair stimuli with both positive and negative outcomes, but did so more slowly than their peers. Furthermore, these stress-exposed adolescents showed markedly impaired cognitive flexibility; they were less able than their peers to update those pairings when the contingencies changed. These learning problems were reflected in abnormal activity in learning- and attention-related brain circuitry. Both altered patterns of learning and neural activation were associated with the severity of lifetime stress that the adolescents had experienced. Taken together, the results of this experiment suggest that basic learning processes are impaired in adolescents exposed to early life stress. These general learning mechanisms may help explain the emergence of social problems observed in these individuals.",Remaining

Preoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) studies of 38 patients with pathologically proven intracranial HPC (n = 12) and angiomatous (n = 13) or anaplastic meningioma (n = 13) were retrospectively reviewed. ADC values were measured in the tumor parenchyma and peritumoral edema, and used to obtain normalized ADC (NADC) ratios (ADC of tumor/ADC of normal white matter).	Mean ADC values were significantly different between HPC and anaplastic meningioma (1.17 ± 0.30 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s and 0.75 ± 0.11 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively). Mean NADC ratios were also significantly lower in the malignant cases (0.95 ± 0.13) compared with the benign HPCs (1.53 ± 0.39; P < 0.05). Mean ADC values and NADC ratios did not differ significantly between angiomatous meningioma and HPC (P > 0.05), whereas mean ADC values and NADC ratios were lower for anaplastic meningioma than for either angiomatous meningioma or HPC (P < 0.05).

We present a combination treatment paradigm, which temporally affects different aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology, specifically Aβ-toxicity and neurogenesis. At early stages of AD-like pathology, in TgCRND8 mice, we found that combating Aβ pathology with scyllo-inositol ameliorated deficits in neurogenesis. Older TgCRND8 mice with established amyloid load had decreased progenitor cell proliferation and survival compared to non-transgenic mice, regardless of scyllo-inositol treatment. The prolonged exposure to Aβ-pathology leads to deficits in the neurogenic niche, thus targeting Aβ alone is insufficient to rescue neurogenesis. To support the neurogenic niche, we combined scyllo-inositol treatment with leteprinim potassium (neotrofin), the latter of which stimulates neurotrophin expression. We show that the combination treatment of scyllo-inositol and neotrofin enhances neuronal survival and differentiation. We propose this proof of concept combination therapy of targeting Aβ-pathology and neurotrophin deficits as a potential treatment for AD.",Animal-drug-intervention

However, the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown since plasmatic cholesterol is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that cognitive impairments triggered by hypercholesterolemia during aging may be related to brain oxidative stress and altered brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. We also performed a neuropathological investigation in order to analyze whether the cognitive impairments may be associated with stroke-related features. To address these questions we used three- and fourteen-month-old low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (LDLr-/-). The current findings provide new evidence that aged LDLr-/- mice, exposed to over three-fold cholesterol levels from early life, show working, spatial reference, and procedural memory impairments, without alterations in motor function. Antioxidant imbalance and oxidative damage were evidenced by a marked increase in lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels) and glutathione metabolism (increase in glutathione levels, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase activities) together with a significant increase in the AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex of aged hypercholesterolemic LDLr-/- mice. Notably, hypercholesterolemia was not related to brain infarcts and neurodegeneration in mice, independent of their age. These observations provide new evidence that hypercholesterolemia during aging triggers cognitive impairments on different types of learning and memory, accompanied by antioxidant imbalance, oxidative damage, and alterations of cholinergic signaling in brain areas associated with learning and memory processes, particularly in the prefrontal cortex.",Animal-other

Immunofluorescent labeling showed positive expression of A2B5 in OPCs and Olig2 in OLs, suggesting the successful separation of OPCs and OLs. Three Fyn siRNAs (si-Fyn) and Fyn siRNA negative control (NC) were transfected into OLs. Western blot showed that among three si-Fyn groups, si-Fyn3 caused the lowest Fyn expression, so si-Fyn3 was chosen for following experiment. Cells were divided into four groups: Control, Model, NC and si-Fyn. In the Model group, cells were cultured in Mg-free extracellular fluid for 3 h. The morphology of control cells was normal. However, the migration of neurons, the aggregation of cell bodies and the 'grid-like' changes of neural networks were observed in the model cells. OLs apoptosis in various groups was assessed by flow cytometry. Expression of Fyn, ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in OLs of various groups was evaluated by western blot.

1705,19394958,Journal of psychiatric research,"Reduced neuronal expression of insulin-degrading enzyme in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients with haloperidol-treated, chronic schizophrenia.","Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a neutral thiol metalloprotease, which cleaves insulin with high specificity. Additionally, IDE hydrolyzes Abeta, glucagon, IGF I and II, and beta-endorphin. We studied the expression of IDE protein in postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia and controls because: (1) the gene encoding IDE is located on chromosome 10q23-q25, a gene locus linked to schizophrenia; (2) insulin resistance with brain insulin receptor deficits/receptor dysfunction was reported in schizophrenia; (3) the enzyme cleaves IGF-I and IGF-II which are implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease; and (4) brain gamma-endorphin levels, liberated from beta-endorphin exclusively by IDE, have been reported to be altered in schizophrenia. We counted the number of IDE immunoreactive neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, and the basal nucleus of Meynert of 14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 matched control cases. Patients had long-term haloperidol treatment. In addition, relative concentrations of IDE protein in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were estimated by Western blot analysis. There was a significantly reduced number of IDE expressing neurons and IDE protein content in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia compared with controls, but not in other brain areas investigated. Results of our studies on the influence of haloperidol on IDE mRNA expression in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, as well as the effect of long-term treatment with haloperidol on the number of IDE immunoreactive neurons in rat brain, indicate that haloperidol per se, is not responsible for the decreased neuronal expression of the enzyme in schizophrenics. Haloperidol however, might exert some effect on IDE, through changes of the expression levels of its substrates IGF-I and II, insulin and beta-endorphin. Reduced cortical IDE expression might be part of the disturbed insulin signaling cascades found in schizophrenia. Furthermore, it might contribute to the altered metabolism of certain neuropeptides (IGF-I and IGF-II, beta-endorphin), in schizophrenia.",Remaining
1706,22939118,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts among former users of finasteride with persistent sexual side effects.,"Finasteride, a commonly prescribed medication for male pattern hair loss, has recently been associated with persistent sexual side effects. In addition, depression has recently been added to the product labeling of Propecia (finasteride 1 mg). Finasteride reduces the levels of several neuroactive steroids linked to sexual function and depression. This study assesses depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts in former users of finasteride who developed persistent sexual side effects despite the discontinuation of finasteride.	In 2010-2011, former users of finasteride (n = 61) with persistent sexual side effects for ≥ 3 months were administered standardized interviews that gathered demographic information, medical and psychiatric histories, and information on medication use, sexual function, and alcohol consumption. All former users were otherwise healthy men with no baseline sexual dysfunction, chronic medical conditions, current or past psychiatric conditions, or use of oral prescription medications before or during finasteride use. A control group of men (n = 29), recruited from the community, had male pattern hair loss but had never used finasteride and denied any history of psychiatric conditions or use of psychiatric medications. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of depressive symptoms and the prevalence of suicidal thoughts as determined by the Beck depression inventory II (BDI-II); all subjects self-administered this questionnaire at the time of the interview or up to 10 months later.	Rates of depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥ 14) were significantly higher in the former finasteride users (75%; 46/61) as compared to the controls (10%; 3/29) (P < .0001). Moderate or severe depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥ 20) were present in 64% (39/61) of the finasteride group and 0% of the controls. Suicidal thoughts were present in 44% (27/61) of the former finasteride users and in 3% (1/29) of the controls (P < .0001).	Clinicians and potential users of finasteride should be aware of the potential risk of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts. The preliminary findings of this study warrant further research with controlled studies.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
1707,3865248,Psychiatry research,Sleep and circadian rhythms in affective patients isolated from external time cues.,"Sleep electroencephalographic activity, circadian rhythms in motor activity and rectal temperature, and clinical state were monitored longitudinally in four affectively ill patients (two depressed, one manic, and one rapidly cycling between depression and mania) who lived in isolation from external time cues (zeitgebers) for 3 to 4 weeks. In these conditions it was possible to observe the intrinsic or free-running behavior of circadian pacemakers and thereby to test several hypotheses about the role of sleep and circadian rhythms in the pathogenesis of depression. No hypothesis was consistently supported by the results. We found that the intrinsic rhythm of a circadian pacemaker appeared to free-run with an abnormally fast frequency in one patient. No patient remained stably depressed during temporal isolation. Our experience suggests that this type of study can be carried out safely with appropriate precautions. Temporal isolation is a means to test decisively predictions of several chronobiological hypotheses about affective illness and should be applied to additional patients.",Remaining

Our aim was to investigate the relationships between IR, inflammation, oxidative stress and stroke severity in acute ischemic stroke patients.	We examined the relationships between inflammation, oxidative stress and stroke severity in 75 acute stroke patients with and without IR. Serum levels of oxidative stress markers (nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH)) were measured as well as the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10).	The levels of IL-10 (13.7±19.11 vs 51.20±89.32 pg/ml, p<0.00) in IR group were significantly reduced. Patients with IR had higher levels of NO (30.26±17.63 vs 22.57±14.5 µmol/L, p=0.04) and IL6 (27.44±57.13 vs 8.68±11.8 pg/ml, p<0.00) and higher NIHSS scores (11.40±5.35 vs 8.81±5.76, p=0.04) when compared with noninsulin resistant group. IL-10 was found negatively correlated with HOMA. Additionally, the parameters with positive correlations with HOMA were NIHSS, IL-6 and NO.	Inflammation and oxidative stress are more evident in acute stoke patients with insulin resistance which may cause worse stroke severity. Our data also suggest that IL-10 as an antiinflammatory cytokine can be much lower in insulin resistance in acute phase of ischemic stroke. However it can be elevated as an adaptive mechanism in metabolic syndrome as a chronic condition.",Remaining
1709,21410485,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",The Hispanic Americans Baseline Alcohol Survey (HABLAS): is the 'prevention paradox' applicable to alcohol problems across Hispanic national groups?,"The 'prevention paradox,' a notion that most alcohol-related problems are generated by nonheavy drinkers, has significant relevance to public health policy and prevention efforts. The extent of the paradox has driven debate over the type of balance that should be struck between alcohol policies targeting a select group of high-risk drinkers versus more global approaches that target the population at-large. This paper examines the notion that most alcohol problems among 4 Hispanic national groups in the United States are attributable to moderate drinkers.	A general population survey employing a multistage cluster sample design, with face-to-face interviews in respondents' homes was conducted in 5 metropolitan areas of the United States. Study participants included a total of 2,773 current drinkers 18 years and older. Alcohol consumed in the past year (bottom 90% vs. top 10%), binge drinking (binge vs. no binge), and a 4-way grouping defined by volume and binge criteria were used. Alcohol-related harms included 14 social and dependence problems.	Drinkers at the bottom 90% of the distribution are responsible for 56 to 73% of all social problems, and for 55 to 73% of all dependence-related problems reported, depending on Hispanic national group. Binge drinkers are responsible for the majority of the social problems (53 to 75%) and dependence-related problems (59 to 73%), also depending on Hispanic national group. Binge drinkers at the bottom 90% of the distribution are responsible for a larger proportion of all social and dependence-related problems reported than those at the top 10% of the volume distribution. Cuban Americans are an exception.	The prevention paradox holds when using volume-based risk groupings and disappears when using a binge-drinking risk grouping. Binge drinkers who drink moderately on an average account for more harms than those who drink heavily across all groups, with exception of Cuban Americans.",Remaining

This requirement places a premium on spontaneous recovery and neuroplastic adaptation to rehabilitation by the lesioned hemisphere. Motor skill learning is frequently cited as a requirement for neuroplasticity. Studies examining the links between training, motor learning, neuroplasticity, and improvements in hand motor function are indicated.	This case study describes a patient with slow recovering hand and finger movement (Total Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer examination score = 25/66, Wrist and Hand items = 2/24 on poststroke day 37) following a stroke. The patient received an intensive eight-session intervention utilizing simulated activities that focused on the recovery of finger extension, finger individuation, and pinch-grasp force modulation.	Over the eight sessions, the patient demonstrated improvements on untrained transfer tasks, which suggest that motor learning had occurred, as well a dramatic increase in hand function and corresponding expansion of the cortical motor map area representing several key muscles of the paretic hand. Recovery of hand function and motor map expansion continued after discharge through the three-month retention testing.	This case study describes a neuroplasticity based intervention for UE hemiparesis and a model for examining the relationship between training, motor skill acquisition, neuroplasticity, and motor function changes. Implications for rehabilitation Intensive hand and finger rehabilitation activities can be added to an in-patient rehabilitation program for persons with subacute stroke. Targeted training of the thumb may have an impact on activity level function in persons with upper extremity hemiparesis. Untrained transfer tasks can be utilized to confirm that training tasks have elicited motor learning. Changes in cortical motor maps can be used to document changes in brain function which can be used to evaluate changes in motor behavior persons with subacute stroke.",Human-case-report

Developing countries, most of which are undergoing epidemiological transition and greying of population, currently contain more than half of the world's population of elderly, a proportion that would reach 75% by 2020. Apart from reports from China, there is little or no information on the dementias of the elderly in developing countries. Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for two-thirds of dementia of the elderly in Caucasian population, is under-documented and believed to be rare in black Africans. But black Americans who are of black African lineage commonly suffer from Alzheimer's disease. A recent autopsy survey of the brains of elderly Nigerians showed absence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the pathognomonic histologic lesions of Alzheimer's disease and ageing found in 25% to 80% of normal undemented elderly Caucasians and Japanese. In a community-based door-to-door survey of a population of 9000, including 932 elderly Nigerians, no subject with dementia as defined by DSM-IIIR was found, although there was significant decline of cognition with age, female sex and less than 6 years of formal education.

Cerebral vessels are nearly adult size by 5 years of age but the technical feasibility of achieving recanalization in younger and smaller children with current endovascular tools remains unclear.	To systematically review the literature on mechanical thrombectomy for stroke in children less than 5 years of age.	Mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke has been reported in 11 children under the age of 5 years (range 9 months to 4 years). The mean time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 12 hours (range 4-50 hours). Complete recanalization was achieved in 7/12 (58%) vessels attempted, and partial recanalization in 4/12 (33%). Two procedure related complications were reported, with small vessel size felt to be contributory to basilar vasospasm in one case. Favorable neurological outcomes were reported in 7 cases (64%).	Our review of the literature demonstrates that mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke may be feasible in carefully selected infants and young children less than 5 years of age using currently available devices. Efficacy in promoting better neurologic outcomes remains unproven, and other questions persist, including whether complications such as vasospasm occur more frequently in young children compared with adults. Further study is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of pediatric mechanical thrombectomy. These data suggest that young children should not be excluded from future studies or clinical treatment on the basis of age alone.",Human-systematic-review

In this review we aim to give an overview of postoperative symptoms and look at factors influencing therapeutic choices and surgical techniques.	A wide range of physical and psychological factors contribute to the symptoms of disease. Patients suffer from impaired quality of life, depression, anxiety and chronic and acute pain. Validated questionnaires have been used to assess patient response. Surgical excision of endometriosis improves dyspareunia and the quality of sex life of patients. It is superior in outcomes to medical therapy in achieving increased pregnancy rates. Catastrophizing and biopsychosocial variables are implicated in the severity of pain experienced in patients with endometriosis. Patients with endometriosis score lower on quality of life assessments and the addition of psychosomatic therapy to medical treatments has shown to improve the emotional status of patients with improved treatment outcomes.	Despite its prevalence, there is no optimal treatment for endometriosis; recurrence of disease is a common problem.

1715,2173558,The Biochemical journal,Thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor occupancy determines the fraction of the responsive pool of inositol lipids hydrolysed in rat pituitary tumour cells.,"We report that there are distinct thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-responsive and -unresponsive pools of inositol (Ins) lipids in rat pituitary tumour (GH3) cells, and present evidence that the size of the responsive pool is determined by the number of activated TRH-receptor complexes. By use of an experimental protocol in which cycling of [3H]Ins is inhibited and resynthesis occurs with unlabelled Ins only, we were able to measure specifically the effects of TRH on the hydrolysis of the Ins lipids present before stimulation. A maximally effective dose of TRH (1 microM) caused a time-dependent decrease in 3H-labelled Ins lipids that attained a steady-state value of 42 +/- 1% of the initial level between 1.5 and 2 h. After 2 h, even though there was no further decrease in 3H-labelled Ins lipids, and no increase in [3H]Ins or [3H]Ins phosphates, turnover of Ins lipids, as assessed as incorporation of [32P]Pi into PtdIns, continued at a rate similar to that in cells incubated without LiCl or unlabelled Ins. These data indicate that Ins lipid turnover was not desensitized during prolonged TRH stimulation. Depletion of lipid 3H radioactivity by TRH occurred at higher TRH doses on addition of the competitive antagonist chlordiazepoxide. Addition of 1 microM-TRH after 3 h of stimulation by a sub-maximal (0.3 nM) TRH dose caused a further decrease in 3H radioactivity to the minimum level (40% of initial value). We propose that the TRH-responsive pool of Ins lipids in GH3 cells is composed of the complement of Ins lipids that are within functional proximity of activated TRH-receptor complexes.",Animal-other
1716,26169474,Ageing research reviews,"Autobiographical memory decline in Alzheimer's disease, a theoretical and clinical overview.","Autobiographical memory, or memory for personal experiences, allows individuals to define themselves and construct a meaningful life story. Decline of this ability, as observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), results in an impaired sense of self and identity. In our model (AMAD: Autobiographical Memory in Alzheimer's Disease), we present a critical review of theories and findings regarding cognitive and neuroanatomical underpinnings of autobiographical memory and its decline in AD and highlight studies on its clinical rehabilitation. We propose that autobiographical recall in AD is mainly characterized by loss of associated episodic information, which leads to de-contextualization of autobiographical memories and a shift from reliving past events to a general sense of familiarity. This decline refers to retrograde, but also anterograde amnesia that affects newly acquired memories besides remote ones. One consequence of autobiographical memory decline in AD is decreased access to memories that shape self-consciousness, self-knowledge, and self-images, leading to a diminished sense of self and identity. The link between autobiographical decline and compromised sense of self in AD can also manifest itself as low correspondence and coherence between past memories and current goals and beliefs. By linking cognitive, neuroanatomical, and clinical aspects of autobiographical decline in AD, our review provides a theoretical foundation, which may lead to better rehabilitation strategies.",Non-systematic-review

Appropriate selection of donor and recipient nerves and surgical timing affect functional outcomes. Although the gold standard of nerve selection is intraoperative nerve stimulation, preoperative electrodiagnostic (EDX) evaluation may help guide surgical planning. Currently there is no standardized preoperative EDX protocol. This study reviews the EDX workup preceding PNT surgery in cervical SCI and proposes an informed EDX protocol to assist with surgical planning. The PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework was used to formulate relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and identify published cases of PNT in cervical SCI in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Emcare databases in the last 10 years. The EDX techniques evaluating putative donor nerves, recipient nerve branches, time sensitivity of nerve transfer and other electrophysiological parameters were summarized to guide creation of a preoperative EDX protocol. Needle electromyography (EMG) was the most commonly used EDX technique to identify healthy donor nerves. Although needle EMG has also been used on recipient nerves, compound muscle action potential amplitudes may provide a more accurate determination of recipient nerve health and time sensitivity for nerve transfer. Although there has been progress in presurgical EDX evaluation, EMG and nerve conduction study approaches are variable, and each has limitations in their utility for preoperative planning. There is need for standardization in the EDX evaluation preceding PNT surgery to assist with donor and recipient nerve selection, surgical timing and to optimize outcomes. Based on results of this review, herein we propose the PreSCIse (PRotocol for Electrodiagnosis in SCI Surgery of the upper Extremity) preoperative EDX panel to achieve said goals through an interdisciplinary and patient-centered approach.",Non-systematic-review

Of 500 sequential specimens screened for cannabinoids by enzyme multiplied immunoassay EMIT, 63 (13%) were initially positive and 58 (12%) were confirmed positive (92%). It was observed that geographic location and race did not correlate with cannabinoid prevalence. Cannabinoid use was observed to be strongly age related, with peak use by the 21- to 25-year-old age group where 22% of the cases were positive. Use of cannabinoids was also closely linked to homicides, which represented nearly half of the positive cases but only 13% of the total cases. When comparing manner of death, the greatest percent of confirmed positives was seen in homicide (26%) and drug-related (17%) deaths. The incidence of cannabinoid use was found to be more than 3 times as great in drug-related (17%) as compared to natural deaths (5%). The percent of cannabinoid-positive cases from vehicle-related accidents was low (6%) and that from nonvehicle-related accidents somewhat higher (10%). Other drugs appeared in cannabinoid-positive cases. Most prevalent was ethanol N = 18, followed by morphine (from heroin, N = 11), quinine N = 11, and cocaine N = 11. Phencyclidine (PCP) occurred twice and several other drugs were reported only once. Of the 25 homicide cases screened for drugs, 64% were positive for some drug including ethyl alcohol.

This article reviews the evidence supporting pharmacotherapy of aggression in youth, with a primary focus on impulsive aggression (the primary indication for this intervention). Relevant diagnostic considerations and consensus guidelines are discussed.	Articles examining the role of medications in the treatment of aggression in youth with pathological aggression were identified using PubMed and MEDLINE® databases over the past 15 years (2000-2015); selected articles published prior to 2000 and deemed to be of high relevance were searched and also included. Search terms included: Aggression, aggressive, disruptive behavior, conduct, youth, children, and adolescents. Cited references were also searched for relevant articles.	There are a number of evidence-based medication treatments for aggression, which are generally best considered in the context of differential diagnosis and ongoing evidence-based psychosocial interventions. Impulsive aggression is generally considered the type of aggression most amenable to medication, but other aggression subtypes may also possibly respond to treatment. Medication classes with positive evidence include the psychostimulants and α-2 agonists (in the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and/or disruptive behavior disorders), mood stabilizing agents, and atypical antipsychotics. Published guidelines recommend systematic and adequate trials of medications in sequential order, to optimize response and minimize polypharmacy. Guidelines for safety monitoring are available for many of the medications used for aggression in youth, and are also discussed.	Aggression in children carries a high risk of poor outcomes, and, therefore, a better understanding of treatment options is a high priority. The available literature points to the importance of identifying the underlying disorder, when possible, and using this information to guide treatment selection.

Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of these epidemiological studies and possible neuroimmunological mechanisms.	Initial concerns of a 13-fold increased relative risk of narcolepsy were raised by the Scandinavian health protection agencies in 2010. Subsequent retrospective studies support these findings in Canada, France, Ireland, England and Denmark. The cases are predominantly young children who present with severe and rapid onset of cataplexy as well as narcolepsy often within a few weeks of vaccination. The proposed mechanism for postvaccination narcolepsy is one in which an environmental trigger causes or enhances an antibody-mediated autoimmune response in patients with a preexisting genetic susceptibility. However, there have not yet been any reports of specific autoimmunity, either antibody or T-cell-mediated.	There is a strong association between narcolepsy and H1N1 vaccination. However, whether this reflects a true increase in affected individuals or a hastening of disease onset in individuals who would otherwise have developed narcolepsy later will become clear in the coming years. The pathological explanation of this association and narcolepsy is likely to be autoimmune, although supportive evidence is lacking.Video abstract available: See the Video Supplementary Digital Content 1 (http://links.lww.com/COPM/A9).",Non-systematic-review

1727,16319418,Journal of lipid research,Increased sphingomyelin content impairs HDL biogenesis and maturation in human Niemann-Pick disease type B.,"We previously reported that human Niemann-Pick Disease type B (NPD-B) is associated with low HDL. In this study, we investigated the pathophysiology of this HDL deficiency by examining both HDL samples from NPD-B patients and nascent high density lipoprotein (LpA-I) generated by incubation of lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) with NPD-B fibroblasts. Interestingly, both LpA-I and HDL isolated from patient plasma had a significant increase in sphingomyelin (SM) mass (approximately 50-100%). Analysis of LCAT kinetics parameters (V(max) and K(m)) revealed that either LpA-I or plasma HDL from NPD-B, as well as reconstituted HDL enriched with SM, exhibited severely decreased LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification. Importantly, we documented that SM enrichment of NPD-B LpA-I was not attributable to increased cellular mass transfer of SM or unesterified cholesterol to lipid-free apoA-I. Finally, we obtained evidence that the conditioned medium from HUVEC, THP-1, and normal fibroblasts, but not NPD-B fibroblasts, contained active secretory sphingomyelinase (S-SMase) that mediated the hydrolysis of [(3)H]SM-labeled LpA-I and HDL(3). Furthermore, expression of mutant SMase (DeltaR608) in CHO cells revealed that DeltaR608 was synthesized normally but had defective secretion and activity. Our data suggest that defective S-SMase in NPD leads to SM enrichment of HDL that impairs LCAT-mediated nascent HDL maturation and contributes to HDL deficiency. Thus, S-SMase and LCAT may act in concert and play a crucial role in the biogenesis and maturation of nascent HDL particles.",Remaining
1728,20309621,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,The heavy burden of psychiatric comorbidity in youth with autism spectrum disorders: a large comparative study of a psychiatrically referred population.,The objective of the study was to systematically examine patterns of psychiatric comorbidity in referred youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) including autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Consecutively referred children and adolescents to a pediatric psychopharmacology program were assessed with structured diagnostic interview and measures of psychosocial functioning. Comparisons were made between those youth satisfying diagnostic criteria for ASD and age and sex matched youth without ASD referred to the same clinical program. 9.3% (217/2323) of the referred youth (age range: 3-17 years) met DSM-III-R criteria for ASD. ASD youth suffered from significantly higher number of comorbid disorders than comparisons (6.4 ± 2.7 vs. 5.2 ± 2.9; p < 0.001). Ninety-five percent of the youth with ASD had three or more comorbid psychiatric disorders and 74% had five or more comorbid disorders. ASD youth were also more functionally impaired and required extra-assistance in school and therapeutic interventions at higher rates than age and sex matched non-ASD referred youth. Youth with ASD have high levels of psychiatric comorbidity and dysfunction comparable to the referred population of youth without ASD. These findings emphasize the heavy burden of psychiatric comorbidity afflicting youth with ASD and may be important targets for intervention.,Remaining
1729,3119161,Brain research bulletin,Bidirectional effects of beta-carbolines in reflex epilepsy.,"Derivatives of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, ZK 91296, ZK 93423 and ZK 95962 have potent anticonvulsant activity against sound-induced seizures in audiogenic DBA/2 mice and against photically-induced seizures in the baboon, Papio papio. The convulsant beta-carbolines, DMCM and beta-CCM, have proconvulsant and convulsant activity in the same animal models. DMCM and beta-CCM are similar in potency as convulsants in DBA/2 mice (ED50 value for DMCM: 1.3 mg/kg; ED50 value for beta-CCM; 0.8 mg/kg), but differ with respect to their profiles for protection by anticonvulsant drugs. The anticonvulsant potencies of diazepam and clobazam are similar against both types of beta-carboline-induced seizures, whereas quazepam protects better against beta-CCM seizures (4 fold elevation in ED50 value at 1 mg/kg quazepam IP) than against DMCM seizures (1.7 fold elevation in ED50 value), supporting a preferential action of beta-CCM on BZ1 receptors. Valproate (400 mg/kg) and gamma-vinyl-GABA (1.5 g/kg) protect better against beta-CCM seizures (9.5 and 5.9 fold elevations in ED50 values respectively) than against DMCM seizures (1.8 and 2.7 fold elevations in ED50 values respectively). The excitatory amino acid antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, has significant anticonvulsant activity against DMCM seizures. The elevated regional GABA levels in brains of DBA/2 mice observed during beta-CCM seizures are eliminated by the pretreatment with Ro 15-1788, which also blocks the seizure activity.",Animal-drug-intervention

The relationship of tau phosphorylation to calcium-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) dysregulation was analyzed in aging rhesus macaque dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and rat primary cortical neurons using biochemistry and immuno-electron microscopy. The influence of calcium leak from ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on neuronal firing and cognitive performance was examined in aged macaques.	Aged monkeys naturally develop hyperphosphorylated tau, including AD biomarkers (AT8 (pS202/pT205) and pT217) and early tau pathology markers (pS214 and pS356) that correlated with evidence of increased calcium leak (pS2808-RyR2). Calcium also regulated early tau phosphorylation in vitro. Age-related reductions in the calcium-binding protein, calbindin, and in phosphodiesterase PDE4D were seen within dlPFC pyramidal cell dendrites. Blocking RyRs with S107 improved neuronal firing and cognitive performance in aged macaques.

The data were collected through open-ended interviews (n = 49), observation and personal field diary, and analyzed by qualitative content analysis. The findings showed that baridi, emotional coldness, was a slowly progressing condition. It started with mild symptoms, such as feeling cold, tired and sick. Later, it influenced the sufferer's physical, mental, social, sexual, and economical well being. Treatment of baridi was based on identification of the cause, asking for forgiveness and sharing a ritual confirming family unity. Prevention of baridi required respect of the elderly and familial norms.

1733,33027183,Current opinion in psychiatry,Functional neuroimaging biomarkers of resilience in major depressive disorder.,"In this review we provide an overview of definitions and determinants of resilience in the context of neuroimaging research in major depressive disorder (MDD). We summarize emerging literature on functional neuroimaging biomarkers of resilience in MDD and discuss their clinical relevance and implications for future research.	Resilience in MDD is characterized by dissociable profiles of activation and functional connectivity within brain networks involved in cognitive control, emotion regulation, and reward processing. Increased activation of frontal cortical brain regions implicated in cognitive appraisal and emotion regulation is a common characteristic of resilient individuals at high risk for MDD and of individuals with MDD with a favorable illness course. Furthermore, significant associations between fronto-striato-limbic functional connectivity and both positively interpreted stressful life events in resilient high-risk individuals and a favorable response to first-line treatments in depressed individuals suggest that neuro-compensatory changes and experience-dependent plasticity underlie resilience in MDD.	Emerging research has identified functional neuroimaging biomarkers of resilience in MDD. A continued focus on identifying neurobiological underpinnings of resilience, in the context of dynamic environmental and developmental influences, will advance our understanding of resilience and improve approaches to prevention and treatment of MDD.",Non-systematic-review

She was diagnosed as having NIDDM one year ago and was treated with diet and glibenclamide (1.25 mg/day) for 6 months. However, she stopped her medical treatment one month ago and then polydipsia and general fatigue were manifested. She was admitted to a hospital five days ago at which time hyperglycemia (405 mg/dl) and anemia (Hb8.0g/dl) were detected. She was transferred to our hospital for control of blood glucose and further examination of bitemporal hemianopsia. She showed typical acromegalic features including enlargement of the nose, lips and tongue, increased heel pad and acral growth. Conscious disturbance was cured by the infusion of saline and the administration of insulin. Endoscopy revealed an active gastric ulcer (A1). Endocrine data disclosed increased GH levels in plasma and urine, whereas plasma IGF-1 levels were low. Plasma GH paradoxically increased following the administration of TRH. A water deprivation test showed an impaired increase in urinary osmolarity, indicating partial central diabetes insipidus (DI). MRI with Gd-contrast revealed a macroadenoma which progressed toward suprasella. She was diagnosed as having acromegaly, partial DI and probable hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic diabetic pre-coma. Polyuria (5-101/day) due to partial DI was controlled by the administration of DDAVP (10 micrograms/day). The constant subcutaneous administration of octreotide (240 micrograms/day) resulted in normal plasma GH levels and a marked shrinkage of the pituitary tumor. The pituitary tumor was finally removed by the transsphenoidal approach following treatment with octreotide for 4 months. HE staining of the pituitary tumor showed atrophic and acidophilic cells surrounded by hyaloid connective tissue. After the surgery, plasma GH levels were normalized and complications were cured. In conclusion, this is a very rare case of acromegaly associated with diabetic pre-coma and partial DI, and effectively treated with constant subcutaneous infusion of octreotide.",Human-case-report

We investigated seven cases of genetically confirmed MJD longitudinally by magnetic resonance imaging with observation periods of 4.5-10.6 years. Measurement of the midsagittal areas of infratentorial structures disclosed progressive atrophy of the pontine base and cerebellum, which correlated significantly with age, whilst midbrain and pontine tegmentum showed atrophy with no significant progression, suggesting it was better identified as 'small size' and might have mostly been completed before the initial symptoms. Such differences between regions in atrophy progression must be caused by a difference in the neuropathological course.",Remaining

Narrative interviews were conducted with 10 attendees of a phlebotomy service within an acute Trust in the south-west of England. The participants had hepatitis C infection and poor venous access due to current or former drug use. Interview audiotapes were analyzed, and the themes - conflict, emotional responses, the patient as expert, and offering solutions - were identified. In the context of this study, we discuss the difficulties associated with phlebotomy, which might explain why individuals with hepatitis C infection and venous damage disengage from health services and are less likely to undertake antiviral treatment. This research adds to the literature on phlebotomy for vulnerable groups, and recommends hepatitis C virus clinics within drug agencies, the need to review training and policy, and the development of 'phlebotomy passports' to enable continuity of care between services.",Remaining

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can directly or indirectly affect synaptic reconstruction. mir-132, mir-134, and mir-138 are the leading miRNAs that can be effective on some neurological functions through its effects on synaptic plasticity in the relevant brain areas. In our study, it was aimed to determine the levels of miRNAs in the hippocampus and frontal lobe of rats exposed to different environmental conditions after the experimental SAH.	SAH was created using the cisterna magna double blood-injection method. Brain tissues were collected at different times after the last blood injection. Rats were grouped according to the different environmental conditions in which they were kept. Expression levels of miRNAs were performed by qPCR and ultrastructural changes in samples were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).	After SAH, miR-132, miR-134, and miR-138 expressions in the frontal lobes of rats increased in impoverished environment on the 7th day and in the enriched environment on the 14th day. It was observed that the myelin and microtubule structures in the axons that were disrupted after SAH were more organized and stable in the enriched environment.	After SAH, different environmental conditions may affect the miRNA levels associated with synaptic plasticity and microtubule organization in the frontal lobe, and this might have some effects especially on cognitive and motor functions related to this brain area.",Animal-non-drug-intervention

Median survival of these patients has ranged from 1 month with no therapy, to 2 months with steroid, and from 3 to 6 months with brain radiation therapy of the whole brain. A more recent study comparing radiation therapy alone with surgery plus radiation, has shown good results in the combined surgery and radiation therapy group. But surgical excision is usually limited to patients with a surgically accessible solitary metastasis. And therapeutic options are limited once the tumor recurs locally after whole brain irradiation. Interstitial irradiation allows the delivery of a high dose of localized irradiation in the area of tumor recurrence with minimal risk of radiation damage to the surrounding brain tissue. But brachytherapy for brain metastasis has been performed in few cases. We reported two patients with unresectable metastatic brain tumors who were successfully treated with iridium-192 interstitial brachytherapy, and we discuss the strategy of the treatment. Case 1: A 78 year-old-man underwent a total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Five months after surgery, he developed right hemiparesis. CT scan revealed a left occipital tumor with massive brain edema and a tiny nodule of tumor in the left thalamic region.

1747,9130303,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",Correlation between hippocampal neuronal damage and spatial learning deficit due to global ischemia.,"Global cerebral ischemia leads to selective neuronal damage in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus and in the striatum. This ischemia leads to a deficit in spatial learning and memory in the water maze. The results of earlier studies that have examined the relationship between neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze were not clear-cut. It has been observed that neuroprotection reduces both the deficit in the water maze and the neuronal damage. The present study therefore approached the relationship between the neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze by pharmacological means. Global cerebral ischemia was induced in male Wistar rats by four-vessel occlusion for 20 min. Ischemic rats were then treated with the noncompetitive non-NMDA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 (30 mg/kg), the radical scavenger LY 231617 (20 mg/kg), the inhibitor of protein kinase C staurosporine (0.1 mg/kg), or solvent. Treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial learning by limiting the increase in swim distance due to ischemia. In addition, LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial memory as demonstrated by minimizing the ischemia-induced reduction in time spent in the quadrant of the former platform position during the probe trial. Staurosporine had no influence on the ischemia-induced behavioural changes. Histological examination revealed neuronal damage in the hippocampus and in the striatum in all of the ischemic rats. However, treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the hippocampal damage. Correlation analysis demonstrated a correlation between hippocampal damage and total swim distance (r = 0.88, P < 0.001). No correlation was found between hippocampal damage and quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.24, p > 0.1). No correlation was observed between striatal damage and either total swim distance of the escape trials (r = 0.28. p > 0.1) or quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.08, p > 0.6).

Six additional symptomatic VTE occurred between Day 10 and Day 90, leading to a 3.5% incidence at Day 90 (95% CI, 2.0%-5.6%). The main factors associated with VTE were age, bed rest, and diagnosis of dementia. The incidence of VTE in patients aged 75 or over with a diagnosis of dementia reached 8.2% at Day 10 and 12.5% at Day 90.	The incidence of VTE in psychiatric units appeared low.

The case material embodied those psychiatric problems known to be common in medical populations, namely depression, delirium, dementia, and 'psychogenic' pain. The standardized simulations were punctuated by standardized 'open' questions with followup probes. A panel of experienced clinicians developed rating criteria for each question such that responses could be categorized ad 'good,' 'adequate,' 'inadequate,' or 'poor,' in terms of 'what an internist needs to know.' Blind raters of the exam achieved an interrater reliability of 0.08. The results indicate major deficits in the knowledge needed for assessment and treatment of these common problems. Only 16% of answers were 'good,' where as 42% were 'inadequate' or 'poor'. For example, 88% of the doctors could not name three factors that help distinguish organic from 'functional' psychosis, and 88% could not list three side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants. The doctors' level of experience was not correlated with test scores, either overall or question by question. These results, together with measures of attitude and skill, have been used to develop a needs-based liaison psychiatry curriculum and to evaluate the effectiveness of that curriculum.",Remaining
1751,33498908,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Brain Asymmetry Detection and Machine Learning Classification for Diagnosis of Early Dementia.,"Early identification of degenerative processes in the human brain is considered essential for providing proper care and treatment. This may involve detecting structural and functional cerebral changes such as changes in the degree of asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres. Changes can be detected by computational algorithms and used for the early diagnosis of dementia and its stages (amnestic early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), Alzheimer's Disease (AD)), and can help to monitor the progress of the disease. In this vein, the paper proposes a data processing pipeline that can be implemented on commodity hardware. It uses features of brain asymmetries, extracted from MRI of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, for the analysis of structural changes, and machine learning classification of the pathology. The experiments provide promising results, distinguishing between subjects with normal cognition (NC) and patients with early or progressive dementia. Supervised machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks tested are reaching an accuracy of 92.5% and 75.0% for NC vs. EMCI, and 93.0% and 90.5% for NC vs. AD, respectively. The proposed pipeline offers a promising low-cost alternative for the classification of dementia and can be potentially useful to other brain degenerative disorders that are accompanied by changes in the brain asymmetries.",Remaining

Initial BRV doses ranged between 50mg and 400mg (median 100mg), titrated to a daily dose of 100 to 400mg (median 200mg). There was a cessation of SE in the first 24h of BRV in three patients (27%). While taking BRV, no serious side effects were seen.	Based on these cases and previous data from animal experiments, BRV may prove useful in SE treatment, and trials would be warranted to examine BRV's efficacy in treating SE and how this efficacy might be influenced by co-administration with levetiracetam.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention
1754,10211470,Annals of neurology,Hippocampal or neocortical lesions on magnetic resonance imaging do not necessarily indicate site of ictal onsets in partial epilepsy.,"Advances in neuroimaging techniques, particularly high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have proved invaluable in identifying structural brain lesions in patients with epilepsy. The assumption that such focal lesions invariably predict the site of seizure origin may not be correct, however. We report a series of 20 adults with medically intractable partial epilepsy, where high-resolution brain MRI disclosed a unilateral, focal, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion as the only abnormality in each case; nevertheless, based on electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, ictal onsets arose from a completely different location than that of the MRI lesion. All patients underwent epilepsy surgery, with the operations based on ictal EEG findings, and all were followed at least 2 years after the resection. After the most recent follow-up examination, 50% (10/20) of the patients were completely seizure-free, 35% (7/20) had at least a 75% reduction in the number of seizures, and 15% (3/20) had less than a 75% reduction in the number of seizures. We conclude that the identification of a focal, structural, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion on brain MRI is not always indicative of the site of seizure origin in partial epilepsy. Furthermore, in cases of discordance between MRI and EEG data, a good outcome after epilepsy surgery is possible if EEG ictal onsets are definitive.",Remaining

The present study reviewed the records of 100 male and female cocaine abusers admitted to a private substance abuse treatment program between 1987 and 1989. Patterns of cocaine use and levels of impairment were found to be similar for men and women, with male cocaine abusers more likely to abuse additional substances. Male cocaine abusers were employed more frequently than women and held higher status jobs despite equivalent levels of education. Female cocaine abusers were more likely to be diagnosed with concurrent psychiatric disorders and were more likely to report family histories of substance abuse. Both groups produced elevations on MMPI scales indicating depression, anxiety, paranoid features, and acting-out tendencies. These data suggest that while male and female cocaine abusers show similarities on some measures, there are significant gender differences that may have implications for both research and treatment.",Remaining

Mutations in mitochon drial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear genome or both have been reported in mitochondrial diseases suggesting common pathophysiological pathways. Considering the clinical heterogeneity of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) phenotype including focal neurological deficits, it is important to look beyond mitochondrial gene mutation.	The clinical, histopathological, biochemical analysis for OXPHOS enzyme activity, and electron microscopic, and neuroimaging analysis was performed to diagnose 11 patients with MELAS syndrome with a multisystem presentation. In addition, whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole mitochondrial genome sequencing were performed to identify nuclear and mitochondrial mutations.	Analysis of whole mtDNA sequence identified classical pathogenic mutation m.3243A > G in seven out of 11 patients. Exome sequencing identified pathogenic mutation in several nuclear genes associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes, epilepsy, seizure and cardiomyopathy (POLG, DGUOK, SUCLG2, TRNT1, LOXHD1, KCNQ1, KCNQ2, NEUROD1, MYH7) that may contribute to classical mitochondrial disease phenotype alone or in combination with m.3243A > G mutation.	Individuals with MELAS exhibit clinical phenotypes with varying degree of severity affecting multiple systems including auditory, visual, cardiovascular, endocrine, and nervous system. This is the first report to show that nuclear genetic factors influence the clinical outcomes/manifestations of MELAS subjects alone or in combination with m.3243A > G mutation.",Remaining

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) combined with auditory feedback for trunk control on UE function and activities of daily living among subacute stroke patients with moderate impairment.	Twenty participants with hemiparesis were randomly assigned to either the mCIMT combined with auditory feedback group (n = 10) or the control group (n = 10). The mCIMT combined with auditory feedback group received the mCIMT protocol training at the same time as the auditory feedback for control of the compensatory movement of the trunk. The control group only received the mCIMT protocol. Each group underwent 20 (1 hour/day) intervention sessions (5 days/week for 4 weeks).	The mCIMT combined with auditory feedback group exhibited greater changes in the Action Research Arm Test (P = .027; 95% CI .429-6.171), Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity (P = .034; 95% CI .360-8.039), modified Barthel Index (P = .003; 95% CI 3.465-14.536), and amount of use of motor activity log (P = .009; 95% CI .078-.476) compared to the control group. There were no significant differences in the quality of movement (P = .054, 95% CI -.005 to .457) and modified Ashworth Scale (P = .288; 95% CI -.583 to .183) grades between the 2 groups.	These findings suggest that mCIMT combined with auditory feedback for trunk control is more helpful in improving the UE function than mCIMT alone in subacute stroke patients with moderate impairment.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention

SAH and cerebral lymphatic blockage (CLB) models in adult New Zealand rabbits were used. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from experimental animals 5 d after modeling and was added into cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The neurons were randomly divided into blank control, normal CSF, SAH, and SAH+CLB groups. At different points of time, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was detected by colorimetric method. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of neurons. Expressions of Bax and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) were determined by immunohistochemical staining. LDH leakage detection revealed that, compared with blank control group, CSF from normal rabbit did not damage the neurons, whereas the leakage of LDH increased in SAH group and SAH+CLB group. The increasing effect was more obvious in SAH+CLB group than that in SAH group. Normal CSF did not induce the apoptosis of neurons, whereas neuron apoptosis was found in SAH group and the apoptosis was even more severe in SAH+CLB group. Bax and Hsp70 protein expressions were found in both SAH and SAH+CLB groups. Expression of Bax protein in SAH+CLB group was stronger than that in SAH group in a time-dependent manner. At 0.5 h and 1 h, the expression of Hsp70 protein in SAH+CLB group was stronger than that in SAH group, whereas the expression became weaker at 2 h and 4 h. These results suggest that blockage of cerebral lymphatic drainage pathway deteriorates the damage of neurons treated with CSF from SAH, indicating this pathway may act as an endogenous protective role in SAH.",In-vitro-study

Psychiatrists continue to grapple with the full ramifications of the condition, even though interest specifically in pathological lying seems to have waned in recent times. The impact of pathological lying deserves critical attention from forensic psychiatrists because of the implications that untruths have in a legal context. In this article, the authors review the considerable vagueness and confusion that has surrounded this concept and examine the extent to which a person can control lying behavior and the related question of whether pathological liars have responsibility for their actions.

1761,26450593,"The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",Epigenetic Basis of Mental Illness.,"Psychiatric disorders are complex multifactorial illnesses involving chronic alterations in neural circuit structure and function as well as likely abnormalities in glial cells. While genetic factors are important in the etiology of most mental disorders, the relatively high rates of discordance among identical twins, particularly for depression and other stress-related syndromes, clearly indicate the importance of additional mechanisms. Environmental factors such as stress are known to play a role in the onset of these illnesses. Exposure to such environmental insults induces stable changes in gene expression, neural circuit function, and ultimately behavior, and these maladaptations appear distinct between developmental versus adult exposures. Increasing evidence indicates that these sustained abnormalities are maintained by epigenetic modifications in specific brain regions. Indeed, transcriptional dysregulation and the aberrant epigenetic regulation that underlies this dysregulation is a unifying theme in psychiatric disorders. Here, we provide a progress report of epigenetic studies of the three major psychiatric syndromes, depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We review the literature derived from animal models of these disorders as well as from studies of postmortem brain tissue from human patients. While epigenetic studies of mental illness remain at early stages, understanding how environmental factors recruit the epigenetic machinery within specific brain regions to cause lasting changes in disease susceptibility and pathophysiology is revealing new insight into the etiology and treatment of these conditions.",Non-systematic-review

This pilot study is aimed at obtaining preliminary data of the effects of two different exercise programs on gait parameters in people with PD by means of a biomechanical three-dimensional motion analysis. Twenty-five individuals with idiopathic PD participated either in a land-based (LB) or in a LB plus water-based (LWB) exercise program for 16 weeks. The efficacy of both exercise programs was quantified by means of a biomechanical gait analysis from which spatiotemporal and sagittal plane kinetic (gait speed, stride length, cadence, stride time, simple support time, double support time) and kinematic (angles of the hip, knee, and ankle joints) variables were recorded. Once the intervention ended, significant changes were observed in stride length and single/double support time variables in all the patients. The intergroup analysis revealed the existence of significant differences only in the gait Speed and hip Angle parameters. Few significant improvements in the amplitude of lower limb joints were found. These results suggest that land-based and land-plus-water-based exercise programs can be considered as a useful physical rehabilitation alternative, both equally capable of improving gait impairment on Parkinson's disease.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

To address this issue, we performed a genome-wide association study among 6345 apparently healthy women in which we evaluated 336,108 SNPs as potential determinants of plasma CRP concentration. Overall, seven loci that associate with plasma CRP at levels achieving genome-wide statistical significance were found (range of p values for lead SNPs within the seven loci: 1.9 x 10(-)(8) to 6.2 x 10(-)(28)). Two of these loci (GCKR and HNF1A) are suspected or known to be associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, one is a gene-desert region on 12q23.2, and the remaining four loci are in or near the leptin receptor protein gene, the apolipoprotein E gene, the interleukin-6 receptor protein gene, or the CRP gene itself. The protein products of six of these seven loci are directly involved in metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, beta cell function, weight homeostasis, and/or premature atherothrombosis. Thus, common variation in several genes involved in metabolic and inflammatory regulation have significant effects on CRP levels, consistent with CRP's identification as a useful biomarker of risk for incident vascular disease and diabetes.",Remaining

The formula is based on 4 descriptive factors which characterize the lesion severity and potential outcome on the subject. The factors are, type of lesion, intensity of lesion, location and time of lesion duration before therapy is applied (TILT). A relative value is assigned to each TILT factor and the sum of these values determines the severity of the injury or traumindex. The relative benefit of specific therapy can then be assessed quickly and objectively by applying its effect on TILT. Three examples picked at random from the literature, illustrate application of TILT comparing 'claimed' and 'apparent' benefit of specific treatments.

MSA is a degenerative neurological condition that includes olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Shy-Drager syndrome and striatonigral degeneration. The usual predominant features of MSA are cerebellar ataxia, autonomic dysfunction and Parkinsonism. Stridor is present in over one third of patients and has been reported previously as a presenting symptom in MSA: however previously reported patients have always gone on to develop other neurological symptoms. The usual investigations of bilateral abductor vocal fold paralysis caused by MSA will not reveal the pathological process and we believe that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the medulla and brain stem and autonomic function tests are probably the investigations of choice. It is a worthwhile exercise attempting to identify MSA as the cause of stridor as the prognosis is good in the medium term if appropriate support is offered.",Human-case-report

In this study, we examined the gene expression profile in neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) with or without HUCB treatment and identified signaling pathways (Akt/MAPK) important in eliciting HUCB-mediated neuroprotective responses. Gene chip microarray analysis was performed using RNA samples extracted from the neuronal cell cultures from four experimental groups: normoxia, normoxia+HUCB, OGD, and OGD+HUCB. Both quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were carried out to verify the microarray results. Using the Genomatix software program, promoter regions of selected genes were compared to reveal common transcription factor-binding sites and, subsequently, signal transduction pathways. Under OGD condition, HUCB cells significantly reduced neuronal loss from 68% to 44% [one-way ANOVA, F(3, 16)=11, p=0.0003]. Microarray analysis identified mRNA expression of Prdx5, Vcam1, CCL20, Alcam, and Pax6 as being significantly altered by HUCB cell treatment. Inhibition of the Akt pathway significantly abolished the neuroprotective effect of HUCB cells [one-way ANOVA, F(3, 11)=8.663, p=0.0031]. Our observations show that HUCB neuroprotection is dependent on the activation of the Akt signaling pathway that increases transcription of the Prdx5 gene. We concluded that HUCB cell therapy would be a promising treatment for stroke and other forms of brain injury by modifying acute gene expression to promote neural cell protection.",In-vitro-study

Rapid onset of behavioral and neurochemical alterations after discontinuation of alprazolam.,"Discontinuation of chronic treatment with alprazolam may cause a characteristic clinical syndrome. To assess the basis of this syndrome, mice were treated with alprazolam, 2 mg/kg, for 7 days, a regimen associated with the development of tolerance and downregulation of receptors. Effects on motor activity and the binding and function of GABA receptors were evaluated 1, 2, 4 and 7 days after discontinuation. Motor activity was similar to controls 1 day after cessation of alprazolam, increased from days 2 to 4 after-alprazolam, and returned to control values by 7 days. The binding of benzodiazepines in vivo and in vitro was increased in the cortex 2 and 4 days after alprazolam and in the hypothalamus at 4 days after alprazolam. Binding returned to control values in all areas by 7 days. Binding at the chloride channel, using [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, was not significantly altered after discontinuation.

1773,36203173,BMC medical ethics,Flaws in advance directives that request withdrawing assisted feeding in late-stage dementia may cause premature or prolonged dying.,"The terminal illness of late-stage (advanced) Alzheimer's and related dementias is progressively cruel, burdensome, and can last years if caregivers assist oral feeding and hydrating. Options to avoid prolonged dying are limited since advanced dementia patients cannot qualify for Medical Aid in Dying. Physicians and judges can insist on clear and convincing evidence that the patient wants to die-which many advance directives cannot provide. Proxies/agents' substituted judgment may not be concordant with patients' requests. While advance directives can be patients' last resort to attain a peaceful and timely dying consistent with their lifelong values, success depends on their being effective and acceptable. A single flaw can provide opponents justification to refuse the directive's requests to cease assisted feeding.	This article considers 24 common advance directive flaws in four categories. Process flaws focus on how patients express their end-of-life wishes. Content flaws reflect drafters' selection of conditions and interventions, and how they are described. Inherent flaws can make advance directives unacceptable to authorities concerned about premature dying. Strategies are needed to compel physicians to write needed orders and to prevent third parties from sabotaging these orders after they are  implemented. The article includes excerpts from 'dementia-specific' directives or supplements that exemplify each flaw-mostly from the US and Europe. No directive critiqued here included an effective strategy to resolve this long-debated bioethical conflict: the past directive requests 'Cease assisted feeding' but the incapacitated patient apparently expresses the desire to 'Continue assisted feeding.' Some opponents to the controversial request, cease assisted feeding, use this conflict as a conceptual wedge to practice hard paternalism. This article proposes a protocol to prevent this conflict from emerging. These strategies may prevent authorities from requiring patients to fulfill authorities' additional clinical criteria as a prerequisite to honor the requests in patients directives.	This critique of flaws may serve as a guide to drafting and to selecting effective and acceptable advance directives for dementia. It also poses several bioethical and clinical questions to those in authority: Does your paternalistic refusal to honor patients' wishes respect their self-determination? Protect vulnerable patients from harm? Force patients to endure prolonged suffering? Violate the principles of bioethics? Violate the very foundation of patient-centered care?",Non-systematic-review

A new enzyme immunoassay test (Pharmacia Meningitis EIA-Test) was evaluated as a potential rapid diagnostic method for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae (HI) type b, Neisseria meningitidis (MC) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNC). The test was found to have good sensitivity (0.86) and specificity (0.95) in the inter-epidemic period; and to be adaptable to the field work in The Sudan during the 1988 MC epidemic. During inter-epidemic (endemic) situations in The Sudan, greater than 90% of childhood ABM was caused by one of the three organisms, HI type b, MC and PNC. HI accounted for 57% of the cases. The peak incidence (76%) of HI cases was in infants (less than 12 months) similar to the situation in other African countries. The overall case fatality ratio was 18.6%. Prospective follow-up of survivors for 3-4 years revealed that an additional 43% either died or had permanent neurological complications, the most prevalent and persistent of which was sensorineural hearing loss recorded in 22% of long term survivors. Post-meningitic children were found to have significantly lower intelligence quotients (92.3 +/- 13.9) than their sibling controls (100.7 +/- 10.2, P = 0.029). Features of the large serogroup A sulphonamide resistant MC epidemic (February-August 1988) in Khartoum are described. An estimated annual incidence of 1,679/100,000 was recorded at the peak of the epidemic. The highest attack rate was in young children less than 5 years, as in many other African countries; nevertheless, a high morbidity was observed in adults (31% of the cases greater than or equal to 20 years). The clinical features, mortality (6.3%) and short term sequelae in Sudanese children were generally within the framework described for MC disease elsewhere. Detailed analysis of MC isolates from Sudan and Sweden by characterizing their electrophoretic enzyme types, DNA restriction endonuclease pattern and outer membrane proteins, revealed that serogroup A MC clone III-1 was responsible of The Sudan epidemic in 1988 and has been the dominant serogroup A organism in Sweden since 1973. The Sudanese strains isolated prior to the epidemic (1985) were clone IV-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Remaining

Their common complaints are examined as core symbolic elements in culturally patterned complexes of meanings focused around personal trauma, stressful life events, personal and social reactions, expectations about treatment, and the course of illness. Many of these women report themselves to be 'nervous,' to be 'sick from nerves,' or to have had an 'ataque de nervios.' 'Nervousness' is the base symbolic domain in Puerto Rico of what psychiatry labels 'anxiety disorder,' although it is also a common complaint of many disorders.

In the past decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to biomarker discovery for early diagnosis and treatment of AD. Herein, this study aims to quantify clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in blood samples from AD patients and evaluate these two proteins as potential biomarkers in AD diagnosis. In-house synthesized 5-plex isotopic N,N-dimethyl leucine (iDiLeu) tags were used to label target peptide standards at different concentrations to construct standard curves. Our study revealed that the levels of CLU and APOE exhibited clear differences in male vs. female AD groups but not in male vs. female non-AD groups. In contrast, the levels of serum CLU and APOE did not show statistically significant differences in the AD groups and non-AD groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) with CLU and APOE showed some separation between the AD and non-AD participants. Significance: Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for sex-related pathways, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: As blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis are cost-effective and introduce less invasiveness, discovery and validation of biomarkers in the blood samples of AD patients have become a hot topic in Alzheimer's and dementia research. Thus far, amyloid β (Aβ), total-tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in blood show great accuracy and specificity in diagnosis of AD. However, the underlying mechanism of AD pathology remains to be elusive and complex. Besides these well studied proteins, many other proteins, such as clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) have also been found to be related to AD development. It has been implicated that these two proteins are involved in Aβ clearance and deposition. In this study, we measure the absolute concentrations of these two proteins in blood and shed some light on the potential roles of CLU and APOE in AD pathology. Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for specific pathways between different genders, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD.",Remaining

Using the database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service from 2002 to 2015, we examined 76,043 subjects (≥60 years old) free of PD, dementia, and stroke at baseline. The dose of statin use was classified into the following four 6-month categories (<180, 180-365, 365-540, and ≥540 days) for each 2-year interval. The incidence of PD was identified by the prescription records for any anti-PD medication with a diagnosis of PD.	During 10 years of follow-up, 1,427 PD cases occurred. Statin 'ever use' was significantly associated with a high risk of PD incidence (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.28; 95% confidence interval = 1.12-1.46) when compared with statin nonuse. In terms of a dose-response relationship, although a duration of statin use <365 days was associated with a higher risk of PD, the duration of statin use ≥365 days was not significantly associated with an increased risk of PD.	Statin use was associated with an elevated PD risk of PD, but long-term and adherent statin use was not significantly associated with elevated PD risk. However, there was no evidence of benefit with any statin treatment related to PD risk. Our study suggests that there is a complex relationship among cholesterol level, statin use, and PD risk that warrants further studies. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Study the clinical progression of a late-stage PD (LSPD) population over one year follow-up.	50 LSPD patients (Schwab and England ADL Scale <50 or Hoehn Yahr Stage >3 in MED ON) underwent an extensive clinical assessment at baseline and after one year and an acute levodopa test at baseline.	Mean age of LSPD patients (female 46%) was 77.5 ± 5.9 years and mean disease duration was 15.5 ± 6.5 years. At baseline, 76% had levodopa-induced motor complications (MC), usually non-troublesome, 68% were demented, 54% had psychosis and 68% depression. Caregiver distress was high. l-dopa responsiveness was mild (18% ± 12 of improvement on MDS-UPDRS-III). After one-year, 20% of the patients were dead, institutionalized or HY 5. MDS-UPDRS-motor mean score worsened 7.2 ± 10.3 points although there was heterogeneity between patients, and there was a global worsening of non-motor symptoms, mostly in cognition/mood, urinary and gastrointestinal domains. Nevertheless, MC improved despite similar levodopa equivalent dose. Functional independence and quality of life worsened. Dysphagia severity at baseline predicted a poor outcome (death, institutionalization or HY 5) (Hazard ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.12-4.4; p = 0.01), whereas magnitude of l-dopa response of LSPD patients did not.	LSPD patients still present a significant, although heterogeneous, motor and non-motor progression over 1 year. Dysphagia severity predicts the occurrence of additional disease severity milestones and its management must be prioritized.",Remaining
1780,6891758,Neurotoxicology,Neurotoxicity of methylmercury in the pigeon.,"Pigeons repeatedly exposed to sublethal doses of methylmercury (5-10 mg Hg/kg/wk, po, for 34-77 days) exhibited marked behavioral changes that were accompanied by only minor evidence of neuropathologic changes at the light microscopic level. Accuracy and rate of pecking for grain declined while food intake remained unchanged. Methylmercury produced permanent changes in posture and in motor coordination. The regional distribution of methylmercury within the nervous system was poorly correlated with the distribution of pathologic changes. Overt behavioral signs appeared after the brain accumulated more than about 12 to 16 ppm Hg. Data with pigeons support earlier evidence that the dose-response function for methylmercury is modulated by dose rate and duration of exposure, since the pattern of blood and tissue distribution of Hg is established in advance of the appearance of signs. The pigeon is more sensitive to methylmercury than are mice and rats, but less sensitive than primates.",Animal-other
1781,35617623,Journal of patient safety,Lessons Learned in Implementing a Chronic Opioid Therapy Management System.,"Opioid misuse has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in the United States, and safer opioid use represents an important challenge in the primary care setting. This article describes a research collaborative of health service researchers, systems engineers, and clinicians seeking to improve processes for safer chronic opioid therapy management in an academic primary care center. We present implementation results and lessons learned along with an intervention toolkit that others may consider using within their organization.	Using iterative improvement lifecycles and systems engineering principles, we developed a risk-based workflow model for patients on chronic opioids. Two key safe opioid use process metrics-percent of patients with recent opioid treatment agreements and urine drug tests-were identified, and processes to improve these measures were designed, tested, and implemented. Focus groups were conducted after the conclusion of implementation, with barriers and lessons learned identified via thematic analysis.	Initial surveys revealed a lack of knowledge regarding resources available to patients and prescribers in the primary care clinic. In addition, 18 clinicians (69%) reported largely 'inheriting' (rather than initiating) their chronic opioid therapy patients. We tracked 68 patients over a 4-year period. Although process measures improved, full adherence was not achieved for the entire population. Barriers included team structure, the evolving opioid environment, and surveillance challenges, along with disruptions resulting from the 2019 novel coronavirus.	Safe primary care opioid prescribing requires ongoing monitoring and management in a complex environment. The application of a risk-based approach is possible but requires adaptability and redundancies to be reliable.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Patients' views have seldom been considered in the construction of measures addressing satisfaction with inpatient facilities in psychiatry. The Views on Inpatient Care - VOICE - is a first service-user generated outcome measure relying solely on their perceptions of acute care, representing a valuable indicator of service users' perceived quality of care. The present study aimed to contribute to the validation of the Portuguese version of VOICE.	The questionnaire was translated into Portuguese and applied to a sample of eighty-five female inpatients of a psychiatric institution. Data analysis focused on assessing reliability and exploring the impact of demographic and clinical variables on participants' satisfaction.	Internal consistency of the questionnaire was high (α = 0.87). Participants' age and marital status were associated with differences in scores, with older patients and patients who were married or involved in a close relationship presenting higher satisfaction levels.	The questionnaire demonstrated good internal consistency and acceptability, as well as construct validity. Further studies should expand the analysis of the psychometric properties of this measure e.g., test-retest reliability.	The Portuguese version of VOICE is a promising tool to assess service users' perceptions of inpatient psychiatric care in Portugal.	Introdução: A satisfação com os serviços de saúde é uma medida importante da qualidade dos cuidados formais prestados. Os doentes raramente têm sido envolvidos na construção de instrumentos para avaliar a satisfação com estruturas de internamento psiquiátrico. A medida Views on Inpatient Care (VOICE) recorre, pela primeira vez, às perceções dos próprios doentes sobre um internamento em cuidados agudos, apresentando-se como um indicador valioso da qualidade dos cuidados tal como percebida pelos utentes. O presente estudo visou contribuir para a validação da versão portuguesa desta medida. Material e Métodos: O questionário foi traduzido e adaptado para português, e aplicado a uma amostra de 85 mulheres admitidas num serviço de internamento psiquiátrico. A análise focou-se na consistência interna da medida e no impacto das variáveis demográficas e clínicas nos níveis de satisfação. Resultados: A consistência interna foi elevada (α = 0,87). Encontrámos associações entre a idade e o estado civil e as pontuações obtidas: doentes mais velhos e doentes casados, ou vivendo maritalmente, apresentaram níveis mais elevados de satisfação. Discussão: O questionário apresentou boa consistência interna e aceitabilidade entre os participantes, bem como validade de constructo. As propriedades psicométricas da escala deverão ser exploradas em vertentes adicionais, como a fiabilidade teste-reteste.

This study aims to compare SBIs, deep white matter lesions (DWMLs), and periventricular white matter lesions (PWMLs) in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres to internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, and investigate their association with stenosis grade in patients with asymptomatic ≥ 50% unilateral extracranial ICA stenosis. Patients without previous history of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack who had ≥ 50% stenosis in unilateral ICA on carotid color Doppler ultrasound were enrolled in the study. Patient demographics, vascular risk factors and ICA stenosis grades; number, location, and size of SBIs, DWMLs, and PWMLs in ICA territory were evaluated in both hemispheres using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Of the 69 patients, 53 had 50-69% (76.8%) and 16 had ≥ 70% (23.2%) unilateral ICA stenosis. There was no statistically significant difference in SBIs between ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres to ≥ 50% ICA stenosis. Comparison of ICA stenoses as 50-69% and ≥ 70% revealed a greater number of patients with SBI in ipsilateral hemisphere to ≥ 70% stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.025). The number of SBIs was also higher in ipsilateral hemisphere to ≥ 70% stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.022). While DWMLs and PWMLs did not differ between hemispheres, frequency of Fazekas grade 1 DWMLs was lower in ipsilateral hemisphere to either 50-69% or ≥ 70% ICA stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.035 and p = 0.025, respectively). Results of the present study indicate that stenosis grade may be relevant in the association between asymptomatic carotid stenosis and SBIs, and ≥ 70% stenosis may pose a risk of SBI development.",Remaining

Identify a useful system to obtain a reliable remote monitoring of glucose and the most important vital parameters in the acromegalic subjects.	Sixteen acromegalic patients (from 30 to 73 years old) were enrolled. We provided health monitor devices to the patients for continuous acquisition of physiological signals including twelve-lead electrocardiography (EKG) and nocturnal SpO2. At the same time, we applied on the same patients the blinded continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS).	The lowest saturation peaks at night (<80%) were achieved in patients with a known diagnosis of OSAS. A positive correlation was demonstrated between the lowest oxygen saturation values and the CGM peaks (pV <0,0001) and between the average values of oxygen saturation and CGM (pV<0,0003). Patients with a previous diagnosis of OSAS, obtained by polysomnography, showed on the multiparametric monitor recordings superimposable to their known condition. Instead we noticed a discordance in the two EKG recording: the wireless mode showed an irregular rhythm in 5/16 patients, which was not confirmed by the recording mode with cables.	The health monitor device associated with CGM may be a new useful and versatile tool for fragile patients who can self-manage remote monitoring, and for physicians who can obtain real-time information for the clinical and therapeutic management of patients. It is also a useful tool for the follow-up of patients with OSAS. Moreover, once the interference of the OSAS is excluded, the CGM allows us to obtain a more reliable and accurate diagnosis of DM.",Remaining

We retrospectively reviewed 1653 plasma samples from 709 patients (aged 6 months to 16 years) and compared the concentration-to-dose ratio (CD ratio) of LTG among different AED regimens. The median CD ratio of patients receiving LTG monotherapy was 1.25 μg/mL/mg/kg. In patients receiving LTG plus VPA, the CD ratio was increased by about 140%. The CD ratio was elevated from a low VPA concentration (<40 μg/mL) and the increase was VPA concentration-dependent. In contrast, the median CD ratio of patients treated with LTG plus the inducers phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine was 0.42, 0.63, and 0.66, respectively, and phenytoin significantly reduced the CD ratio in comparison with phenobarbital or carbamazepine (p < 0.001). Pediatric patients of all ages beyond infancy showed similar susceptibility to VPA or inducers, but infants had higher CD ratios compared with the other age groups. Among other AEDs, topiramate, ethosuximide, and rufinamide reduced the CD ratio. These findings should be useful for estimating interactions between LTG and concomitant AEDs.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

While currently untreatable, comprehensive data could help identify appropriate endpoints assessing meaningful improvements in clinical trials. Herein are reported the results from the FREESIAS study assessing the feasibility and utility of in-clinic and at-home measures of key AS symptoms.	Fifty-five individuals with AS (aged < 5 years: n = 16, 5-12 years: n = 27, ≥ 18 years: n = 12; deletion genotype: n = 40, nondeletion genotype: n = 15) and 20 typically developing children (aged 1-12 years) were enrolled across six USA sites. Several clinical outcome assessments and digital health technologies were tested, together with overnight 19-lead electroencephalography (EEG) and additional polysomnography (PSG) sensors. Participants were assessed at baseline (Clinic Visit 1), 12 months later (Clinic Visit 2), and during intermittent home visits.	The participants achieved high completion rates for the clinical outcome assessments (adherence: 89-100% [Clinic Visit 1]; 76-91% [Clinic Visit 2]) and varied feasibility of and adherence to digital health technologies. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted participants' uptake of and/or adherence to some measures. It also potentially impacted the at-home PSG/EEG recordings, which were otherwise feasible. Participants achieved Bayley-III results comparable to the available natural history data, showing similar scores between individuals aged ≥ 18 and 5-12 years. Also, participants without a deletion generally scored higher on most clinical outcome assessments than participants with a deletion. Furthermore, the observed AS EEG phenotype of excess delta-band power was consistent with prior reports.	Although feasible clinical outcome assessments and digital health technologies are reported herein, further improved assessments of meaningful AS change are needed. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, remote assessments facilitated high adherence levels and the results suggested that at-home PSG/EEG might be a feasible alternative to the in-clinic EEG assessments. Taken altogether, the combination of in-clinic/at-home clinical outcome assessments, digital health technologies, and PSG/EEG may improve protocol adherence, reduce patient burden, and optimize study outcomes in AS and other rare disease populations.",Remaining

Although most studies have focused on the pathology of the injured brain, we have noted that the liver plays an important role in TBI. Using two mouse models of TBI, we found that the enzymatic activity of hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) was rapidly decreased and then returned to normal levels following TBI, whereas such changes were not observed in the kidney, heart, spleen, or lung. Interestingly, genetic downregulation of hepatic Ephx2 (which encodes sEH) ameliorates TBI-induced neurological deficits and promotes neurological function recovery, whereas overexpression of hepatic sEH exacerbates TBI-associated neurological impairments. Furthermore, hepatic sEH ablation was found to promote the generation of A2 phenotype astrocytes and facilitate the production of various neuroprotective factors associated with astrocytes following TBI. We also observed an inverted V-shaped alteration in the plasma levels of four EET (epoxyeicosatrienoic acid) isoforms (5,6-, 8,9-,11,12-, and 14,15-EET) following TBI which were negatively correlated with hepatic sEH activity. However, hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally regulates the plasma levels of 14,15-EET, which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, we found that the application of 14,15-EET mimicked the neuroprotective effect of hepatic sEH ablation, while 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid blocked this effect, indicating that the increased plasma levels of 14,15-EET mediated the neuroprotective effect observed after hepatic sEH ablation. These results highlight the neuroprotective role of the liver in TBI and suggest that targeting hepatic EET signaling could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating TBI.",Animal-drug-intervention

These organizations assert that the method of testing bioequivalence is flawed, and that indiscriminate switching among preparations could lead to serious instances of undertreatment and overtreatment of hypothyroid patients. In this review we first list common indications for thyroid hormone administration, distinguishing its use as replacement therapy in hypothyroidism from its use to suppress thyrotropin (TSH) secretion in cases of thyroid cancer, nodules, and goiter. The dangers associated with changing to a preparation with different bioavailability are summarized, noting the particular danger of giving a more active preparation to a patient receiving TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine. However, these dangers are part of a larger problem: there are data showing that large numbers of patients are already receiving an improper dosage of levothyroxine, as judged from measurements of serum TSH. The recent history of FDA actions concerning levothyroxine bioequivalence and the arguments of those in disagreement are summarized. The immediate response to these problems should be better education of both patients and physicians. It is also recommended that there be further discussion of the problems in determining bioequivalence, and that consideration be given to more accurate and clinically relevant methods. Such methods should include assessment of the changes in TSH induced by each preparation in athyrotic patients.",Non-systematic-review

Patient survey-based analysis.	One hundred seventy-one patients (age range 34-86 yrs) who self-reported memory or other cognitive problems associated with statin therapy while participating in a previous statin effects study.	Patients completed a survey assessing statin-associated, cognitive-specific adverse drug reaction (ADR) characteristics, relation of the ADR to specific statin and dose (or potency), and time course of symptom onset and recovery. Visual analog scales were used to assess the effect of the cognitive ADRs on seven quality-of-life domains. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. To target cognitive ADRs with a probable or definite causal relationship to statins, the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale was used: 128 patients (75%) experienced cognitive ADRs determined to be probably or definitely related to statin therapy. Of 143 patients (84%) who reported stopping statin therapy, 128 (90%) reported improvement in cognitive problems, sometimes within days of statin discontinuation (median time to first-noted recovery 2.5 wks). Of interest, in some patients, a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's disease reportedly was reversed. Nineteen patients whose symptoms improved or resolved after they discontinued statin therapy and who underwent rechallenge with a statin exhibited cognitive problems again (multiple times in some). Within this vulnerable group, a powerful relationship was observed between potency of the statin and fraction of trials with that agent resulting in cognitive ADRs (p<0.00001). Quality of life was significantly adversely affected for each of the seven assessed domains (all p<0.00000001).	Findings from the survey suggest that cognitive problems associated with statin therapy have variable onset and recovery courses, a clear relation to statin potency, and significant negative impact on quality-of-life.

Clinicians may also question service users' ability to make considered decisions about their treatment when in crisis. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to investigate crisis treatment preferences of a sample of community-dwelling adults with borderline personality disorder.	Participants were 41 adults with borderline personality disorder who had created joint crisis plans during a randomized controlled trial. Data from all 41 joint crisis plans were analyzed iteratively via a thematic analysis framework.	Participants gave clear statements in their crisis plans relating to the desire to recover from the crisis and to improve their social functioning. Key themes included the desire to be treated with dignity and respect and to receive emotional and practical support from clinicians. Many participants spoke of the importance of connecting with others during periods of crisis, but several reported a clear desire to be left alone during a future crisis. Other themes concerned preferences for specific treatment refusals during crises, including particular types of psychotropic medication and involuntary treatment.	The variation of participants' preferences underscores the importance of developing individually tailored crisis plans for people with borderline personality disorder. The need to be treated with dignity and respect and to be given autonomy in decision making--also identified in global surveys of people with severe mental illness--is important to people with borderline personality disorder. Key messages for clinicians, service users, and policy makers, in addition to staff training issues, are discussed.",Remaining
1795,18812492,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,Chronic benzodiazepine administration potentiates high voltage-activated calcium currents in hippocampal CA1 neurons.,"Signs of physical dependence as a consequence of long-term drug use and a moderate abuse liability limit benzodiazepine clinical usefulness. Growing evidence suggests a role for voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) regulation in mediating a range of chronic drug effects from drug withdrawal phenomena to dependence on a variety of drugs of abuse. High voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents were measured in whole-cell recordings from acutely isolated hippocampal CA1 neurons after a 1-week flurazepam (FZP) treatment that results in withdrawal-anxiety. An approximately 1.8-fold increase in Ca(2+) current density was detected immediately after and up to 2 days but not 3 or 4 days after drug withdrawal. Current density was unchanged after acute desalkyl-FZP treatment. A significant negative shift of the half-maximal potential of activation of HVA currents was also observed but steady-state inactivation remained unchanged. FZP and diazepam showed use- and concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca(2+) currents in hippocampal cultured cells following depolarizing trains (FZP, IC(50) = 1.8 microM; diazepam, IC(50) = 36 microM), pointing to an additional mechanism by which benzodiazepines modulate HVA Ca(2+) channels. Systemic preinjection of nimodipine (10 mg/kg), an L-type (L)-VGCC antagonist, prevented the benzodiazepine-induced increase in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxasole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current in CA1 neurons 2 days after FZP withdrawal, suggesting that AMPAR potentiation, previously linked to withdrawal-anxiety may require enhanced L-VGCC-mediated Ca(2+) influx. Taken together with prior work, these findings suggest that enhanced Ca(2+) entry through HVA Ca(2+) channels may contribute to hippocampal AMPAR plasticity and serve as a potential mechanism underlying benzodiazepine physical dependence.",In-vitro-study
1796,2420691,Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,[Aphasia in children].,"The acquired aphasia in children is a rarely seen speech and language disorders. Disturbances develop after the child has already achieved the capacity for language comprehension and verbal expression. Brain trauma is most often the cause. The clinical picture of the disorder varies over different age groups and, in contrast to adults, shows no consistent typology. In most of the cases there exists a disturbance of speech production; problems with writing and comprehension are seen less often (although comprehension of language is primarily affected in the Landau-Kleffner syndrome). Only once and a while logorrhoea and jargon can be diagnosed. Besides the speech and language disorders cognitive, motor und emotional problems may appear. Therefore, several diagnostic levels have to be considered (e.g. clinical neurology, neuropsychology, psychophysiology, psychopathology). Course and prognosis of the acquired aphasia in childhood (30% longterm difficulties) depend on several factors like etiology and extension of the lesion, the development of the functional hemispheric dominance for language and the initial recovery velocity after the symptoms appeared. The plasticity of the child's brain is a source for compensating mechanisms which might be triggered by three aspects of therapeutic activities which should be used synchronously: speech and language training, principles of psychotherapy and social medicine and treatment of additional disorders.",Non-systematic-review

Early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), West syndrome, late infantile epileptic encephalopathy, and Lennox-Gastaut are four epilepsy syndromes.

These epilepsies share several important characteristics: diverse causes; severe and frequent seizures; diffusely abnormal background activity on electroencephalograms that is often profound; medical intractability; and severe consequences for a normal development. Ohtahara proposed that these epilepsies exist on an electroclinical spectrum and that the clinical and electroencephalogram features are dependent on the maturation of the nervous system. One can now add Late Infantile Epileptogenic Encephalopathy (LIEE) or epilepsy with late-onset of epileptic spasms.

This study was designed to examine the discriminative validity of Interaction Anxiousness Scale (IAS) and Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS) for the screening of SAD through the compared and combined analysis. Firstly, 421 Chinese undergraduates were screened by the IAS and BSPS. Secondly, in the follow-up stage, 248 students were interviewed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used, and the related psychometric characters were checked.	The results indicated that the ROC in these two scales demonstrated discrimination is in satisfactory level (range: 0.7-0.8). However, the highest agreement (92.17%) was identified when a cut-off point of 50 measured by the IAS and a cut-off point of 34 by the BSPS were combined, also with higher PPV, SENS, SPEC and OA than that reached when BSPS was used individually, as well as PPV, SPEC and OA in IAS.	The findings indicate that the combination of these two scales is valid as the general screening instrument for SAD in maximizing the discriminative validity.",Remaining

Whether that assumption is valid, and how it might impact assessment of PTSS, is unknown.	Survivors in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort study completed an assessment of PTSS without cancer orientation, global psychological functioning, perceived stress, and cancer-related anxiety.	Participants (n = 2969; Mage = 32.5 ± 8.5 years, 24.1 years since diagnosis, 49.1% female) obtained a mean score on the PTSD Checklist of 27.7, which is comparable to a normative population. Using established cutoffs, 11.8% obtained scores in the at-risk range. Multivariable modeling indicated that psychological factors [global distress (p < 0.0001), perceived stress (p = 0.001), cancer-related anxiety (p < 0.0001)] and demographic variables [female gender (p < 0.0001), survivors with less than a college education (p = 0.002)] were risk factors for increased PTSS. Only 14.5% identified a cancer-related traumatic event, and there was no difference in PTSS scores between those who identified cancer vs. non-cancer events as most stressful (28.4 ± 12.6 vs. 28.5 ± 12.7, p = 0.93).	One in eight adult long-term survivors of childhood cancer had PTSS above the cutoff, though subgroups (e.g., females and those with lower education) report more distress symptoms. Most adult survivors do not identify cancer as their most stressful event.	Screening for distress in survivorship clinics should not assume that distress is directly related to the survivor's cancer experience.",Non-systematic-review
1801,8033937,European neurology,Saccade and smooth-pursuit impairment after cerebral hemispheric lesions.,"A number of cortical and subcortical areas are involved in the control of saccades and smooth pursuit, and lesions affecting these areas result in various ocular motor syndromes. Most of these syndromes are relatively subtle and have to be ascertained using recordings, because other brain areas may largely take over the function of a damaged area. Anterior cortical, posterior cortical, large and bilateral cortical, subcortical and degenerative cerebral lesions are successively reviewed. In the anterior part of the cerebral hemisphere, the frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), i.e. area 46 of Brodmann, control eye movements. The FEF appears to be principally involved in the control of intentional saccades, in particular those made with a retinotopic reference system, and in smooth pursuit. The SEF could control saccades made with a spatiotopic reference system, and sequences of saccades (requiring a temporal working memory). The PFC could control the inhibition of unwanted reflexive saccades, and be involved in spatial memory used for programming all types of memory-guided saccades. In the posterior part of the cerebral hemisphere, the parietal eye field (PEF) is involved in the triggering of reflexive visually guided saccades, and the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas in smooth pursuit. Acute and large unilateral lesions usually result in transitory ipsilateral conjugate eye deviation. Bilateral lesions affecting both the FEF and the PEF result in severe saccade and smooth-pursuit paresis, whereas bilateral posterior temporoparietal lesions result in Balint's syndrome, consisting of both eye movement and visual-attention abnormalities. Subcortical lesions also result in various eye movement abnormalities, which have been little documented to date. Lastly, degenerative cerebral diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration result in more or less severe eye movement disturbances. Eye movement recordings may contribute to early differential diagnosis of some of these degenerative diseases.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of dietary supplementation with different selenium (Se) compounds on the dynamics of brain metastasis development in a novel mouse model. Mice were fed experimental diets enriched (1 mg/kg) with sodium selenite (Se-S), seleno-1-methionine (Se-Meth), a yeast-derived organic form of selenium (Se-Yeast), or a control diet (Se < 0.05 mg/kg) for 20 wk. At the end of the feeding period, animals were injected with luciferase-tagged K1735 (K1735-Luc) melanoma cells into the brain vasculature. The development of brain metastatic tumors was monitored for 2 wk following injection. Mice bearing brain metastatic tumors and fed Se-Yeast- or Se-S-enriched diets displayed a higher survival rate compared with other experimental and control groups. Importantly, Se-Yeast supplementation decreased the growth of brain metastatic tumors as determined by the measurement of the intensity of the bioluminescent signal emitted by K1735-Luc cells upon reaction with luciferin. Different chemical forms of Se have distinct effects on the development of brain metastases. Organic Se in the form of Se-Yeast may be a valuable agent in suppression of brain metastatic disease.",Animal-drug-intervention

A multicenter prospective study was conducted on otherwise healthy newborns born at ≥35 weeks of gestation and hospitalized for only NNJ in 50 collaborator neonatal intensive care units across Turkey over a 1-year period. Patients were analyzed for their demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment options, and complications.	Of the 5,620 patients enrolled, 361 (6.4%) had a bilirubin level ≥25 mg/dL on admission and 13 (0.23%) developed acute bilirubin encephalopathy. The leading cause of hospital admission was hemolytic jaundice, followed by dehydration related to a lack of proper feeding. Although all infants received phototherapy, 302 infants (5.4%) received intravenous immunoglobulin in addition to phototherapy and 132 (2.3%) required exchange transfusion. The infants who received exchange transfusion were more likely to experience hemolytic causes (60.6% vs. 28.1%) and a longer duration of phototherapy (58.5 ± 31.7 vs. 29.4 ± 18.8 h) compared to infants who were not transfused (p < 0.001). The incidence of short-term complications among discharged patients during follow-up was 8.5%; rehospitalization was the most frequent (58%), followed by jaundice for more than 2 weeks (39%), neurological abnormality (0.35%), and hearing loss (0.2%).	Severe NNJ and bilirubin encephalopathy are still problems in Turkey.

Blood DNA from 80 control individuals and 118 age-matched Parkinson's disease patients were analyzed for NQO2 gene promoter polymorphisms. The results revealed three allelic variants, designated I-29, I-16, and D. These results were confirmed in fibroblast cell lines. In patients with Parkinson's disease, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the D allele, but there was no difference in the frequency of the alleles in familial compared to sporadic Parkinson's disease. The D and I-16 promoters direct higher NQO2 gene expression that results in higher enzyme activity. Overexpression of NQO2 in the catecholaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species when exposed to exogenous dopamine. The results suggest that the association of the D promoter with Parkinson's disease may be due to an increase in expression of the NQO2 gene.",Remaining

However, few studies have examined this topic in youth. Thus, we aimed to examine the association of lithium and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), the first-line antimanic medications for youth with BD, with neurocognition in a relatively large sample of youth with BD. Methods: Participants included 91 youth with BD-I, -II, or -Not Otherwise Specified, aged 13-20 years (n = 14 current lithium use, n = 51 current SGA use). We examined four tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery: Intra/Extra Dimensional Set-Shifting Task (IED), Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP), Stockings of Cambridge Test (SOC), and Affective Go/No-Go (AGN). Within-sample Z-scores were computed, and a global neurocognitive composite score and g factor derived from these tests comprised the primary outcomes. Multivariable analyses controlled for age, sex, and IQ. Results: Current lithium use was significantly associated with poorer cognitive flexibility/set-shifting (IED). After further controlling for lifetime comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and current depression symptoms in sensitivity analyses, the lithium finding was no longer significant. Current SGA use was significantly associated with greater affective processing bias (AGN). No significant findings survived correction for multiple comparisons. All other cognitive outcomes were not significantly associated with current lithium use, current SGA use, or total number of current medications. Conclusions: Treatment with lithium or SGAs was associated with minimal neurocognitive impairments, with small effect sizes in primary multivariable analyses. This study adds to the limited body of literature examining medication use in relation to neurocognition in youth with BD. While the current study cannot rule out associations of smaller effect size, present findings suggest that leading mood-stabilizing medications are not associated with frank neurocognitive impairments in youth with BD.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

However, few studies were performed on the impairments of frontal lobe low-grade gliomas (LGG) after tumor resection using small-world network features.	To detect differences in the whole brain topology among LGG patients before and after operation, a combined study of neurocognitive assessment and graph theoretical network analysis of fMRI data was performed. We collected resting-state fMRI data of 12 carefully selected frontal lobe LGG patients before and after operation. We calculated the topological properties of brain functional networks in the 12 LGG, and compared with 12 healthy controls (HCs). We also applied Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a subset of patients (n = 12, including before and after operation groups) and HCs (n = 12). The resulting functional connectivity matrices were constructed for all 12 patients, and binary network analysis was performed. In the range of 0.05 ≤ Kcos t ≤ 0.35, the functional networks in preoperative LGG and postoperative one both fitted the definition of small-worldness. We proposed Knet = 0.20 as small-world network interval, and the results showed that the topological properties were found to be disrupted in the two LGG groups, meanwhile the global efficiency increased and the local efficiency decreased. Lnet in the two LGG groups both were longer than HCs. Cnet in the LGG groups were smaller than HCs. Compared with the Hcs, MoCA in the two LGG groups were lower than HCs with significant difference, and the disturbed networks in the LGG were negatively related to worse MoCA scores.

To explore people with swallowing disorders post-stroke experiences of and acceptability regarding the bolus modification treatment of thickened liquids.	A qualitative, descriptive study exploring the experiences of individuals given TL after their stroke. A purposive sample of 14 adults was obtained with data collection and generation through the medium of individual semi-structured interviews. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.	Three overarching themes of 'uncertainty', 'an unpleasant experience' and 'a trade-off' were identified. These themes highlight that participants disliked TL and this dislike may have impacted clinically in terms of adherence, hydration and quality of life. Lack of sensory appeal was important in framing patient dislike. Participants' involvement in and understanding of reasons for prescription of TL was poor leading to uncertainty regarding the treatment. Notwithstanding, some participants felt it was necessary for their stroke recovery.	TL can be considered a burdensome treatment from multiple perspectives including product palatability, treatment uncertainty and treatment adherence issues.

Although the six most predominant bacterial groups/genera/species covered on average 71.3% of total intestinal bacteria, our analysis was not comprehensive compared to metagenome analysis or 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.	In PD, the number of Lactobacillus was higher, while the sum of analyzed bacteria, Clostridium coccoides group, and Bacteroides fragilis group were lower than controls. Additionally, the sum of putative hydrogen-producing bacteria was lower in PD. A linear regression model to predict disease durations demonstrated that C. coccoides group and Lactobacillus gasseri subgroup had the largest negative and positive coefficients, respectively. As a linear regression model to predict stool frequencies showed that these bacteria were not associated with constipation, changes in these bacteria were unlikely to represent worsening of constipation in the course of progression of PD. In PD, the serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein levels were lower than controls, while the levels of serum diamine oxidase, a marker for intestinal mucosal integrity, remained unchanged in PD.	The permeability to LPS is likely to be increased without compromising the integrity of intestinal mucosa in PD.

A 3D-fast asymmetric spin echo MR imaging sequence and the region-growing method were used to extract the CSF space from MR images. Ventricular volume (VV) and intracranial CSF volume (ICV) were measured and the VV/ICV ratio was calculated in each case. In NPH patients, the CSF volume was measured again after shunting.	The mean VV and VV/ICV ratio in the NPH group (91.1 mL and 45.2%, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those in the NV group (26.5 mL and 13.7%) and in the CVD group (44.5 mL and 17.8%). On the other hand, mean ICV values were not significantly different among the three groups. The VV was markedly decreased postoperatively (mean -40.7%), whereas the ICV was unchanged, resulting in a marked reduction in the VV/ICV ratio (mean -39.3%).	These results suggest that patients with NPH have a unique intracranial CSF distribution, with an enlarged VV and a slightly increased ICV, resulting in a high VV/ICV ratio. Shunting led to dramatic improvement in our patients. It is likely that CSF measurement can provide valuable information in the management of patients with NPH.",Remaining

Six patients (26%) showed low ASA activity (< 27.5 nmol/mL/h which is the lowest value observed in 29 normal controls); five of them had clinical history of delusions of grandeur, auditive hallucinations, multiple hospitalizations, low response to neuroleptics, and abnormal evoked potentials. It is probable that the schizophrenic symptoms in these patients may be due to the enzyme deficiency. We conclude that the assay is useful in clinical practice as it may help to identify cases of MLD in patients with suspected schizophrenia.",Remaining
1822,31118320,Studies in health technology and informatics,Information Adapted Machine Learning Models for Prediction in Clinical Workflow.,"In a database of electronic health records, the amount of available information varies widely between patients. In a real-time prediction scenario, a machine learning model may receive limited information for some patients.	Our aim was to evaluate the influence of missing data on real-time prediction of delirium, and detect changes in prediction performance when training separate models for patients with missing data.	We compared a model trained specifically on data with missing values to the currently implemented model predicting delirium. Also, we simulated five test data sets with different amount of missing data and compared the prediction results to the prediction on complete data set when using the same model.	For patients with missing laboratory and nursing assessment data, a model trained especially for this scenario performed significantly better than the implemented model. The combination of procedure data and demographic data achieved the closest results to a prediction with a complete data set.	An ongoing evaluation of real-time prediction is indispensable. Additional models adapted to the information available might improve prediction performance.",Remaining

A retrospective analysis was performed of 20 patients who underwent laryngotracheal separation (LTS) or the tracheal flap method (TFM) between 2003 and 2012 at Gunma Children's Medical Center.	All patients were bedridden and fed either through a naso-gastric or naso-esophageal tube or via a gastric fistula. Of the 20 participants, 60% underwent surgical treatment before 3 years of age. The incidence of aspiration pneumonia decreased after surgery, and 8 of 10 patients, who were previously hospitalized for a long duration, were discharged. The most frequent complications observed were granulation around the tracheostomy stoma and endotracheal granuloma. Two patients presented with a tracheal fistula.	LTS and TFM can be used as treatment modalities for patients with intractable aspiration along with SMID and NMD.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether fluoxetine attenuates early brain injury (EBI) after SAH. We demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg per day) significantly attenuated brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, microglial activation, and neuronal apoptosis in EBI after experimental SAH, as evidenced by the reduction of brain water content and Evans blue dye extravasation, prevention of disruption of the tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1, claudin-5, and occludin, a decrease of cells staining positive for Iba-1, ED-1, and TUNEL and a decline in IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, 3-nitrotyrosine, and 8-OHDG levels. Moreover, fluoxetine significantly improved the neurological deficits of EBI and long-term sensorimotor behavioral deficits following SAH in a rat model. These results indicated that fluoxetine has a neuroprotective effect after experimental SAH.",Animal-drug-intervention

NTD is associated with impaired folate metabolism. We investigated whether schizophrenia is also linked with a dysfunctional folate metabolism. In addition to the prevalence of the 677C-->T mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, we compared plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations of 35 schizophrenic patients with those of 104 unrelated controls. Schizophrenic patients had significantly lower plasma folate concentrations after adjustment for Hcy levels, and elevated RBC folate levels compared to controls. Vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and Hcy levels did not differ from control values. Plasma folate levels below the 10th percentile of controls were associated with an approximate 4-7-fold (before and after adjustment of folate levels for Hcy, respectively) risk of having schizophrenia. In addition, a significant dose-response relation between plasma folate concentrations and risk for schizophrenia suggested a protective effect by high plasma folate concentrations. Elevated Hcy levels and, in line with this finding, homozygosity for the 677C-->T mutation in the MTHFR gene were not associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia. Evidence is presented suggesting that folate metabolism is disturbed in schizophrenic patients, independently of Hcy.",Remaining

Factor analysis was carried out on NPI subscales, leading to three syndromes: 'mood', 'psychotic' and 'frontal'. Patients with the 'psychotic' syndrome were older, had older age at dementia onset, had poorer cognition, were more often males, and had faster rate of dementia progression.

A culture and education fair battery of cognitive tests was developed and validated for population based studies in low- and middle-income countries including India by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group.	We explored the machine learning methods based on the 10/66 battery of cognitive tests for the diagnosis of dementia based in a birth cohort study in South India.	The data sets for 466 men and women for this study were obtained from the on-going Mysore Studies of Natal effect of Health and Ageing (MYNAH), in south India. The data sets included: demographics, performance on the 10/66 cognitive function tests, the 10/66 diagnosis of mental disorders and population based normative data for the 10/66 battery of cognitive function tests. Diagnosis of dementia from the rule based approach was compared against the 10/66 diagnosis of dementia.

Of 466 subjects, 27 had 10/66 diagnosis of dementia, 19 of whom were correctly identified as having dementia by Jrip classification with 100% accuracy.	This pilot exploratory study indicates that machine learning methods can help identify community dwelling older adults with 10/66 criterion diagnosis of dementia with good accuracy in a LMIC setting such as India.

A total of 29 paraphilic men who underwent a comprehensive psychiatric, medical, and legal evaluation and were eligible for treatment with MPA were followed naturalistically while receiving concurrent MPA and group therapy. The principal outcome measures were data obtained from a weekly self-reported psychosexual inventory that quantified five dimensions of deviant and nondeviant sexual activities and testosterone levels that were drawn pretreatment and after three and six months of MPA. Self-reported data were analyzed by nonparametric methods. Because MPA's effectiveness is evident early in treatment, we report on data from the first six months. Subjects reported a differential rate of suppression of sexual activities, a median of up to two weeks for deviant and 2 to 10 weeks for nondeviant behaviors (p < or = .01 for each of the five dimensions). Testosterone levels suppressed to less than 0.5 ng per milliliter for all but two subjects at three months and for all at six months. Recidivism was reported for one subject. Except for one subject who developed pulmonary emboli, no major medical problems were encountered. MPA safely and effectively reduced sex drive, controlled deviant sexual impulses and behavior, and lowered the testosterone levels of these paraphilic men during the first six months of treatment. However, the relative rapidity and completeness of the response raises questions regarding possible distortions in self-reported sexual activities. This should alert the practicing clinician to consider the use of collateral sources of information in interpreting treatment outcome for patients with paraphilic behaviors. Also, longer follow-up periods are required for monitoring treatment efficacy.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",Increased corpus cavernosum smooth muscle tone associated with partial bladder outlet obstruction is mediated via Rho-kinase.,"Numerous studies have now demonstrated that lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are associated with erectile dysfunction (ED) in men independent of age or general health. Because one-third of men over the age of 50 will develop LUTS and a recent study showed ED in 62% of patients presenting for LUTS, the importance of determining the mechanistic link between these two pathologies is clear. Using a rabbit model of partial bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO), a primary cause of LUTS, we have identified an increased basal corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM) tone associated with an elevated level of smooth muscle myosin (SMM) phosphorylation in PBOO compared with sham-operated control rabbits (sham). Results from in vitro kinase and phosphatase assays using purified smooth muscle myosin showed increased kinase and decreased phosphatase activities in cellular extracts from corpora cavernosa isolated from PBOO compared with sham rabbits. Increased Rho-kinase expression in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits was suggested by the observations that Rho-kinase inhibitors attenuated the increased kinase activity and were less effective in relaxing CCSM strips from PBOO vs. sham rabbits. This hypothesis was then confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, which demonstrated increased expression of both isoforms of Rho-kinase (ROKalpha and ROKbeta). Increased SMM basal phosphorylation (necessary for SM contraction) in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits, mediated via an increase in Rho-kinase expression/activity, would be expected to make the CCSM more difficult to relax (necessary for erection), which suggests that the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway as being involved in the mechanism for LUTS-associated ED.",Animal-other

Half the rats in each group were fed on normal diet and the remainder had copper added to the drinking water. Rats subjected to PPVO developed large portasystemic shunts. Over a 3-month period, none of the groups showed an increase in serum copper concentrations, or copper oxidase levels. Liver and kidney copper concentrations were similarly increased in copper supplemented sham-operated and PPVO rats, but brain copper content in both groups was similar to the unsupplemented controls. In neither unsupplemented nor copper supplemented rats subjected to PPVO, was the organ distribution of copper different from sham-operated controls. This study suggests that portasystemic shunting does not alter the organ distribution, or tissue concentration of copper.",Animal-other

However, a patient himself/herself may be left out from sensitive conversations such as end-of-life (EOL) care discussions. The objectives of this study were to investigate patients' participation rate in the discussion of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) / Do-Not-Attempt-Resuscitation (DNAR) order, and in the discussion that the patient is at his/her EOL stage (EOL disclosure), and to explore their associated factors.	This is a retrospective chart review study. The participants were all the patients who were hospitalized and died in a university-affiliated teaching hospital (tertiary medical facility) in central Tokyo, Japan during the period from April 2018 to March 2019. The following patients were excluded: (1) cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival; (2) stillbirth; (3) under 18 years old at the time of death; and (4) refusal by their bereaved family. Presence or absence of CPR/DNAR discussion and EOL disclosure, patients' involvement in those discussions, and their associated factors were investigated.	CPR/DNAR discussions were observed in 336 out of the 358 patients (93.9%). However, 224 of these discussions were carried out without a patient (patient participation rate 33.3%). Male gender (odds ratio (OR) = 2.37 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-4.25]), living alone (OR = 2.51 [1.34-4.71]), and 1 year or more from the date of diagnosis (OR = 1.78 [1.03-3.10]) were associated with higher patient's participation in CPR/DNAR discussions.

In turn, patients with MCI and the controls had higher levels of Glu than in patients with AD. The differences were significant in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test model corrected for age. In the post hoc analysis, the most remarkable differences were seen between patients with AD and the rest (patients with MCI and the controls). In AD, the levels of Glu and NAA are decreased in comparison with MCI and normality, which reflects loss of neurons.",Remaining

Specifically, we assayed glioma-associated stem cells (GASC) that are patient-derived and representative of the glioma microenvironment.	By next-generation sequencing, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of GASC derived from patients who underwent anaplastic transformation either within 48 months (GASC-BAD) or ≥7 years (GASC-GOOD) after surgery. Gene set enrichment and pathway enrichment analyses were applied. The prognostic role of a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signature derived from GASC-BAD was tested in 530 newly diagnosed diffuse LGG patients comprised within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The prognostic value of the GASC upstream regulator p65 NF-κB was assessed, by univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, in a single center case study, including 146 grade II LGGs.	The key elements differentiating the transcriptome of GASC isolated from LGG with different prognoses were mostly related to hallmarks of cancer (eg, inflammatory/immune process, NF-κB activation). Consistently, the NF-κB signature extrapolated from the GASC study was prognostic in the dataset of TCGA. Finally, the nuclear expression of the NF-kB-p65 protein, assessed using an inexpensive immunohistochemical method, was an independent predictor of both overall survival and malignant progression-free survival in 146 grade II LGGs.	This study demonstrates for the first time the independent prognostic role of NF-kB activation in LGG and outlines the role of patient-based stem cell models as a tool for precision medicine approaches.",Remaining

Most studies have focused on anterior circulation strokes; therefore, little is known regarding the optimal anesthesia type for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes.	To compare clinical and angiographic outcomes between monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and general anesthesia (GA) in patients presenting with vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes.	Retrospective, matched, case-control study of consecutive vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes treated with endovascular therapy at 2 academic institutions. The study took place between September 2005 and September 2015 at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and between September 2010 and September 2015 at the Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia. Patients requiring emergent intubation prior to endovascular therapy were excluded. The remaining patients were categorized into (1) MAC and (2) elective intubation for the procedure (elective GA). Patients who converted from MAC to GA during the procedure were included in the MAC group. The 2 groups were matched for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and glucose levels. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared.	The primary outcome measure was the shift in the degree of disability among the 2 groups as measured by the modified Rankin scale at 90 days.	A total of 215 patients underwent endovascular therapy for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes during the study period. Thirty-nine patients were excluded owing to emergent pre-endovascular therapy intubation. Sixty-three patients had MAC (36%) and 113 patients had GA (64%). The conversion rate from MAC to GA was 13% (n = 8). After matching, 61 pairs of patients (n = 122) underwent primary analysis. The 2 groups were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. Median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 60-75 years) in the MAC group vs 67 years (interquartile range, 55.5-78.5 years) in the GA group (P = .83). Fifty-four percent of the patients in the MAC group were men vs 41% in the GA group (P = .44). When compared with the elective GA group, patients who underwent the procedure with MAC had similar rates of successful reperfusion, good clinical outcomes, hemorrhagic complications, and mortality. The modality of anesthesia was not associated with any significant changes in the modified Rankin scale score distribution (MAC: OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.80-2.90; P = .19).	In endovascular therapy for acute posterior circulation stroke, MAC is feasible and appears to be as safe and effective as GA.

Thus, hypoxia imaging would be a valuable tool for pre-therapeutic assessment of tumor malignancy. However, there is no standard validated technique for clinical application available yet. Therefore, we performed a study in 12 patients with high-grade glioma, where we directly compared the two currently most promising techniques, namely the MR-based relative oxygen extraction fraction (MR-rOEF) and the PET hypoxia marker H-1-(3-[[18] F]-fluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)-2-nitroimidazole ([[18] F]-FMISO). MR-rOEF was determined from separate measurements of T2 , T2 * and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) employing a multi-parametric approach for quantification of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect. With respect to [[18] F]-FMISO-PET, besides the commonly used late uptake between 120 and 130 min ([[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min), we also analyzed the hypoxia specific uptake rate [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , as obtained by pharmacokinetic modeling of dynamic uptake data. Since pharmacokinetic modeling of partially acquired dynamic [[18] F]-FMISO data was sensitive to a low signal-to-noise-ratio, analysis was restricted to high-uptake tumor regions. Individual spatial analyses of deoxygenation and hypoxia-related parameter maps revealed that high MR-rOEF values clustered in (edematous) peritumoral tissue, while areas with high [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min concentrated in and around active tumor with disrupted blood-brain barrier, i.e. contrast enhancement in T1 -weighted MRI. Volume-of-interest-based correlations between MR-rOEF and [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min as well as [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , and voxel-wise analyses in individual patients, yielded limited correlations, supporting the notion that [[18] F]-FMISO uptake, even after 2 h, might still be influenced by perfusion while [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 was severely hampered by noise. According to these results, vascular deoxygenation, as measured by MR-rOEF, and severe tissue hypoxia, as measured by [[18] F]-FMISO, show a poor spatial correspondence. Overall, the two methods appear to rather provide complementary than redundant information about high-grade glioma biology.",Remaining

However, because of the lack of comprehensive data on the spontaneous background neuropathology of the C57BL/6J strain, discriminating between naturally occurring changes and lesions caused by experimental mutations can be challenging. In this context, this study aims at defining the spectrum and frequency of spontaneous brain changes in a large cohort of C57BL/6J mice and their association with specific biological variables, including age and sex. Brains from 203 experimentally naive and clinically unremarkable C57BL/6J mice were collected and analyzed by means of histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Mice ranged in age from 3 to 110 weeks with 89 females, 111 males, and 3 unknowns. Sixteen different spontaneous lesion categories were described in this cohort. Age-related neurodegenerative and/or neuroinflammatory findings represented the most common pathologic changes and included (1) Hirano-like inclusions in the thalamic neurons, (2) neuroaxonal dystrophy in the medulla oblongata, (3) periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular deposits in the neuropil of the hippocampus, and (4) progressive neuroinflammation characterized by microgliosis and astrogliosis. Neoplastic conditions, developmental abnormalities, and circulatory disorders were rarely observed incidental findings. In conclusion, this study describes spontaneous age-related brain lesions of the C57BL/6J mouse and provides a reference for evaluating and interpreting the neuropathological phenotype in genetically engineered mouse models developed and maintained on this congenic background.",Animal-other

In step 2 (intervention search), needs assessment information guided the search for an evidence-based intervention suitable for adaptation to athletes. In steps 3 and 4 (intervention development), the identified intervention was adapted and feedback sought from athletes and sport professionals. In steps 5 and 6 (implementation and evaluation), a feasibility study was conducted with athletes (n = 35; females: n = 27; Mage  = 27.1).	The review highlighted poor evidence for the acceptability and relative efficacy of existing interventions, which were all delivered face-to-face in groups. Interview/focus group data suggested a need for more accessible intervention formats (e.g., self-help). One non-athlete self-help intervention was determined suitable for adaptation to athletes, and adaptations were made. Initial feedback suggested the adapted intervention was relevant within sport settings. The feasibility study revealed that the intervention (MOPED-A: Motivational and Psycho-Educational Self-Help Programme for Athletes with Mild Eating Disorder Symptoms) can be feasibly implemented, is acceptable to athletes and shows potential for reducing ED symptoms.	IMA is a useful framework for developing participant-centered and evidence-based interventions. The findings and approach taken provide a framework for other researchers and clinicians in developing similar interventions in the ED domain.	The novel self-help intervention described in this article was developed using intervention mapping and provides promise as a tool for reducing eating disorder symptoms in athletes. We describe how adopting and systematically following a health intervention development approach, such as intervention mapping, can ensure that eating disorder interventions are participant-centered, contextually relevant, and evidence-based, which in turn could help to maximize their reach and effectiveness.",Human-systematic-review
1843,3206055,Sleep,The effect of total sleep deprivation on plasma melatonin and cortisol in healthy human volunteers.,"Twelve healthy volunteers were included in this study. Baseline curves for melatonin and cortisol were obtained after one night of adaptation to laboratory conditions. From 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., blood samples were drawn every hour. On the third night, the subjects were kept awake at the sleep unit. Curves for the two hormones were then obtained after 36 h of total sleep deprivation (SD). The levels of these hormones were evaluated by calculating the area under the curve at each hour in both situations (basal and after sleep deprivation). It was found that the melatonin levels were increased after sleep deprivation, whereas the cortisol levels remained the same. These results suggest a mechanism by which a reset of abnormal rhythms can occur in depression.",Remaining
1844,26474818,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",Genetic variation in FADS genes is associated with maternal long-chain PUFA status but not with cognitive development of infants in a high fish-eating observational study.,"Long-chain n-6 and n-3 PUFA (LC-PUFA), arachidonic acid (AA) (20:4n-6) and DHA (22:6n-3), are critical for optimal brain development. These fatty acids can be consumed directly from the diet, or synthesized endogenously from precursor PUFA by Δ-5 (encoded by FADS1) and Δ-6 desaturases (encoded by FADS2). The aim of this study was to determine the potential importance of maternal genetic variability in FADS1 and FADS2 genes to maternal LC-PUFA status and infant neurodevelopment in populations with high fish intakes. The Nutrition Cohorts 1 (NC1) and 2 (NC2) are longitudinal observational mother-child cohorts in the Republic of Seychelles. Maternal serum LC-PUFA was measured at 28 weeks gestation and genotyping for rs174537 (FADS1), rs174561 (FADS1), rs3834458 (FADS1-FADS2) and rs174575 (FADS2) was performed in both cohorts. The children completed the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II) at 30 months in NC1 and at 20 months in NC2. Complete data were available for 221 and 1310 mothers from NC1 and NC2 respectively. With increasing number of rs3834458 minor alleles, maternal concentrations of AA were significantly decreased (NC1 p=0.004; NC2 p<0.001) and precursor:product ratios for linoleic acid (LA) (18:2n-6)-to-AA (NC1 p<0.001; NC2 p<0.001) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) (18:3n-3)-to-DHA were increased (NC2 p=0.028). There were no significant associations between maternal FADS genotype and BSID-II scores in either cohort. A trend for improved PDI was found among infants born to mothers with the minor rs3834458 allele.In these high fish-eating cohorts, genetic variability in FADS genes was associated with maternal AA status measured in serum and a subtle association of the FADS genotype was found with neurodevelopment.",Remaining
1845,17241214,Epilepsia,Photosensitive benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy.,"To describe the electroclinical features of subjects who presented with a photosensitive benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (PBMEI).	The patients were selected from a group of epileptic subjects with seizure onset in infancy or early childhood. Inclusion criteria were the presence of photic-induced myoclonic seizures and a favorable outcome. Cases with less than 24 month follow up were excluded from the analysis.	Eight patients were identified (4 males, 4 females). Personal history was uneventful. All of them had familial antecedents of epilepsy. Psychomotor development was normal in 6 cases, both before and after seizure onset. One patient showed a mild mental retardation and a further patient showed some behavioral disturbances. Neuroradiological investigations, when performed (5 cases), gave normal results. The clinical manifestations were typical and could vary from upward movements of the eyes to myoclonic jerks of the head and shoulders, isolated or briefly repetitive, never causing a fall. Age of onset was between 11 months and 3 years and 2 months. Characteristically, the seizures were always triggered by photic stimulation. Non photo-induced spontaneous myoclonic attacks were reported in 2 cases during the follow-up. Other types of seizures were present at follow-up in 2 cases. The outcome was favorable, even if, usually, seizure control required high AED plasma levels. Since the clinical symptoms were not recognized early, some patients were treated only many years after the onset of symptoms.	Among BMEI patients, our cases constitute a subgroup in which myoclonic jerks were always triggered by photostimulation, in particular at onset of their epilepsy.",Remaining
1846,31926295,Neurobiology of disease,Defining molecular identity and fates of CNS-border associated macrophages after ischemic stroke in rodents and humans.,"Central nervous system (CNS)-border associated macrophages (BAMs) maintain their steady-state population during adulthood and are not replaced by circulating monocytes under physiological conditions. Their roles in CNS integrity and functions under pathological conditions remain largely unknown. Until recently, BAMs and microglia could not be unequivocally distinguished due to expression of common macrophage markers. We investigated the transcriptional profiles of immunosorted BAMs from rat sham-operated and ischemic brains using RNA sequencing. We found that BAMs express the distinct transcriptional signature than microglia and infiltrating macrophages. The enrichment of functional groups associated with the cell cycle in CD163[+] cells isolated 3 days after the ischemic injury indicates the proliferative capacity of these cells. The increased number of CD163[+] cells 3 days post-ischemia was corroborated by flow cytometry and detecting the increased number of CD163[+] cells positive for a proliferation marker Ki67 at perivascular spaces. CD163[+] cells in the ischemic brains up-regulated many inflammatory genes and parenchymal CD163+ cells expressed iNOS, which indicates acquisition of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. In mice, BAMs typically express CD206 and we found a subset of these cells expressing CD169. Chimeric mice generated by transplanting bone marrow of donor Cx3cr1[gfp]CCR2[rfp] mice to wild type hosts showed an increased number of CX3CR1[+]CD169[+] perivascular macrophages 3 days post-ischemia. Furthermore, these cells accumulated in the brain parenchyma and we detected replacement of perivascular macrophages by peripheral monocytic cells in the sub-acute phase of stroke. In line with the animal results, post-mortem brain samples from human ischemic stroke cases showed time-dependent accumulation of CD163[+] cells in the ischemic parenchyma. Our findings indicate a unique transcriptional signature of BAMs, their local proliferation and migration of inflammatory BAMs to the brain parenchyma after stroke in animal models and humans.",Animal-other

Research on homelessness and smoking to date has been concentrated predominantly in the US and Australia. This study aimed to describe smoking and quitting behaviour in homeless adult smokers in Great Britain. Data on perceptions of, and willingness to try, e-cigarettes were also gathered.	Cross sectional survey of 283 adult smokers accessing homeless support services in Kent, the Midlands, London and Edinburgh. Participants answered a four-part survey: i) demographics; ii) current smoking behaviour and dependence (including the Fagerström Test of Cigarette Dependence [FTCD]); iii) previous quit attempts; and iv) e-cigarettes perceptions.	High levels of cigarette dependence were observed (FTCD: M = 7.78, sd ± 0.98). Although desire to quit was high, most had made fewer than 5 quit attempts and 90% of these lasted less than 24 h. 91.5% reported that others around them also smoked. Previous quit methods used included cold turkey (29.7%), NRT (24.7%), varenicline (22.3%) and bupropion (14.5%). 34% were willing or able to spend £20 or more for an e-cigarette and 82% had tried one in the past although 54% reported that they preferred smoking.	We observed high nicotine dependence, few long-term quit attempts, strong desire to quit and amenability to both traditional cessation methods and e-cigarettes. Community embedded and non-routine approaches to cessation may be promising avenues promoting engagement with the homeless community. Likely barriers to uptake include low affordability, preference for cigarettes and high numbers of smoking acquaintances.",Remaining
1848,21110803,Current medicinal chemistry,Targeting the Nogo receptor complex in diseases of the central nervous system.,"After injury to the central nervous system intrinsic factors such as myelin associated inhibitory factors inhibit cellular and axonal regeneration resulting in permanent disability. Three of these factors (Nogo-A, oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, myelin-associated glycoprotein) bind to a common receptor: the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1). NgR1 is expressed mainly on neurons and is usually associated in a trimolecular complex. The second member of the complex, LINGO-1, is often connected to NgR1 function and is further found to function independently as a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation. The third member of the NgR complex is either the p75 neurotrophin receptor, TROY, or an as yet unidentified co-receptor. Targeting of factors contained in this complex has been described to lead to the promotion of neurite outgrowth, oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation and inhibition of cell death. In the current review, we aim to describe the mechanisms of action of the chemical and biological compounds used in targeting NgR1 and LINGO-1. This will be achieved using three examples: blocking of ligand binding to NgR1 in treatment of spinal cord injury, antibody-mediated inhibition of LINGO-1 to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation in multiple sclerosis, and the use of soluble NgR1 to sequester Abeta peptide in the periphery in Alzheimer's disease.",Non-systematic-review

We report on the predictors of post-stroke major depressive disorder (MDD) in Nigeria using standardized assessment methods.	Using a case-control design, we consecutively recruited 260 participants. Among them were 130 stroke survivors attending rehabilitation. Along with historical details, an exploration for MDD meeting criteria in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was carried out using a semi-structured interview. Cognition was assessed using both the Mini Mental State Examination and the modified Indiana University Token test, while disability was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale. Associations were explored using univariate and multivariate analyses.	The diagnosis of MDD was more frequently present in the stroke survivors (41.5%, p < 0.001). It was strongly associated with female gender (p < 0.001, O.R = 3.77, 95% C.I = 1.78-8.00), disability (p = 0.001, O.R = 3.27, 95% C.I = 1.57-6.83), and cognitive dysfunction (p < 0.001, O.R = 5.28, 95% C.I = 2.25-12.41). Female gender (p = 0.037, O.R = 2.65, 95% C.I = 1.06-6.62) and cognitive dysfunction (P = 0.03, O.R = 4.58, 95% C.I = 1.68-12.46) were independent predictors of post-stroke MDD.	Post stroke MDD is common in Nigerian survivors attending rehabilitation. The high rates reported in this population may be the result of factors affecting the efficient management of stroke in developing countries.",Remaining

In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of CBT4CBT as a virtual stand-alone treatment, delivered with minimal clinical monitoring, and clinician-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with treatment as usual in a heterogeneous sample of treatment-seeking outpatients with substance use disorders.	This was a randomized clinical trial in which 137 individuals who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for current substance abuse or dependence were randomly assigned to receive treatment as usual, weekly individual CBT, or CBT4CBT with brief weekly monitoring.	Rates of treatment exposure differed by group, with the best retention in the CBT4CBT group and the poorest in the individual CBT group. Participants who received CBT or CBT4CBT reduced their frequency of substance use significantly more than those who received treatment as usual. Six-month follow-up outcomes indicated continuing benefit of CBT4CBT (plus monitoring) over treatment as usual, but not for clinician-delivered CBT over treatment as usual. Analysis of secondary outcomes indicated that participants in the CBT4CBT group demonstrated the best learning of cognitive and behavioral concepts, as well as the highest satisfaction with treatment.	This first trial of computerized CBT as a virtual stand-alone intervention delivered in a clinical setting to a diverse sample of patients with current substance use disorders indicated that it was safe, effective, and durable relative to standard treatment approaches and was well-liked by participants. Clinician-delivered individual CBT, while efficacious within the treatment period, was unexpectedly associated with a higher dropout rate and lower effects at follow-up.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention

The aim of this study was to investigate whether sex affected cortical thinning in the disease progression of AD.	We prospectively recruited 36 patients with early-stage AD and 14 people with normal cognition. All subjects were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, Year 1, Year 3, and Year 5.

Women with AD showed more rapid cortical thinning in the left dorsolateral frontal cortex, left superior temporal gyrus, bilateral temporo-parietal association cortices, bilateral anterior cingulate gyri, bilateral medial frontal cortices, and bilateral occipital cortices over 5 years than men with AD, even though there was no difference in cortical thickness at baseline. In contrast, there were no regions of significantly more rapid atrophy in men with AD.	Our findings suggest that women deteriorate faster than men in the progression of AD.",Remaining

Costs associated with RxO abuse were grouped into healthcare, criminal justice, and workplace categories. Costs were estimated by either (1) a quantity method that multiplies the number of RxO abusers derived from various national surveys by the estimated per abuser cost, or (2) an apportionment method that starts with overall (ie, prescription and nonprescription) drug abuse costs for a cost component (eg, police protection) and apportions the share of costs based on the prevalence of RxO abuse relative to overall drug abuse. Medical costs in excess of those for otherwise similar nonabusers were based on an analysis of a large administrative claims database for an employed population using multivariate regression methods.	A lower bound estimate of the costs of RxO abuse in the United States was 8.6 billion dollars in 2001 (or 9.5 billion dollars in 2005 dollars). Of this amount, 2.6 billion dollarswere healthcare costs, 1.4 billion dollars were criminal justice costs, and 4.6 billion dollars were workplace costs.	The costs of RxO abuse represent a substantial economic burden. Rising trends of RxO abuse suggest an escalating economic and public health burden in coming years in the United States, and potentially, elsewhere.",Remaining

1856,11905606,The Lancet. Oncology,The seed and soil hypothesis: vascularisation and brain metastases.,"The development of a relevant mouse model for the establishment and growth of brain metastases is essential for study of the biology and therapy of brain metastasis. Injection of human tumour cells into the internal carotid artery of syngeneic or nude mice produces experimental metastases in specific regions of the brain; these are not due to patterns of initial cell arrest, motility, or invasiveness, but rather to the ability of metastatic tumour cells to grow. Whether the progressive growth of brain metastases depends on neovascularisation is not clear. Immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses show that the density of blood vessels within experimental metastases in the brains of nude mice, or within brain metastases derived from human lung cancer, is lower than in the adjacent, tumour-free brain parenchyma. However, blood vessels associated with brain metastases are dilated and contain many dividing endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis also reveals that tumour cells located less than 100 microm from a blood vessel are viable, whereas more distant tumour cells undergo apoptosis. The blood-brain barrier is intact in and around experimental brain metastases smaller than 0.25 mm in diameter, but is leaky in larger metastases. Nevertheless, the lesions are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The way in which the brain microenvironment influences the biological behaviour of tumour cells is a subject of intense investigation.",Non-systematic-review

We sought to evaluate the safety of tPA use without coagulation results and its impact on prognosis. In our stroke registry, tPA was delivered with coagulation results from December 2015 to April 2016 and without coagulation results from May 2016 to December 2016. Differences of demographics, clinical characteristic, and prognosis between these two groups were analyzed. In addition, logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors for DNT of over 60 min. A total of 201 stroke patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, 81 patients received tPA with coagulation results and 120 patients without coagulation results. Only one (0.8%) patient with abnormal coagulation results met the exclusion criteria of tPA use in patients without coagulation results. The difference of DNT between groups with (mean, 61.7 min) and without (mean, 41.9 min) coagulation results was significant (P = 0.00). The group without coagulation results had a higher rate of favorable 90-day outcome (74.2 vs 70.4%) and lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage/nonintracranial hemorrhage (4.9 and 22.2% vs 1.7 and 19.2%) than the group with coagulation results did; these differences were not statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, only tPA use with coagulation results was the predictor for DNT of over 60 min (P = 0.0030, OR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.28-4.65). The present study suggests that tPA could be delivered safely without coagulation results in patients without suspected coagulopathy, and avoiding coagulation tests reduces significantly the DNT interval.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

However, both share as major genetic risk factor a C9orf72 locus intronic hexanucleotide expansion. The pathogenic pathways associated with the expansion-dependent neuronal toxicity are still poorly understood. Recent efforts to identify common threads of neuronal dysfunction have pointed towards deficits of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis and loss of nucleolar integrity, a condition known as nucleolar stress that is an emerging shared feature among neurodegenerative diseases. Intriguingly, the C9orf72 mutation in ALS-FTD interferes with the function of the nucleolus by transcripts and dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced by the hexanucleotide expansion. Experimental discrepancies have given rise to different hypotheses with regard to the connection of C9orf72 and nucleolar activity. In this review, we present and discuss emerging concepts concerning the impact of C9orf72 expansion on nucleolar biology. Moreover, we discuss the 'nucleolar stress hypothesis,' according to which nucleolar malfunction accompanies, exacerbates, or potentially triggers a degenerative phenotype. Upcoming awareness of the involvement of nucleolar stress in C9orf72 ALS-FTD could shed light into its pathogenesis, enabling potential treatment options aimed at shielding an 'Achilles' heel' of neurons.",Non-systematic-review
1859,27628239,Scientific reports,α-Synuclein is a Novel Microtubule Dynamase.,"α-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein associated to Parkinson's disease, which is unstructured when free in the cytoplasm and adopts α helical conformation when bound to vesicles. After decades of intense studies, α-Synuclein physiology is still difficult to clear up due to its interaction with multiple partners and its involvement in a pletora of neuronal functions. Here, we looked at the remarkably neglected interplay between α-Synuclein and microtubules, which potentially impacts on synaptic functionality. In order to identify the mechanisms underlying these actions, we investigated the interaction between purified α-Synuclein and tubulin. We demonstrated that α-Synuclein binds to microtubules and tubulin α2β2 tetramer; the latter interaction inducing the formation of helical segment(s) in the α-Synuclein polypeptide. This structural change seems to enable α-Synuclein to promote microtubule nucleation and to enhance microtubule growth rate and catastrophe frequency, both in vitro and in cell. We also showed that Parkinson's disease-linked α-Synuclein variants do not undergo tubulin-induced folding and cause tubulin aggregation rather than polymerization. Our data enable us to propose α-Synuclein as a novel, foldable, microtubule-dynamase, which influences microtubule organisation through its binding to tubulin and its regulating effects on microtubule nucleation and dynamics.",In-vitro-study

Mitochondria and the phenomenon of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), which marks the point of no return in cell death cascades, have special value in this regard. It is important that the vulnerability to MPT-inducing factors is increased with aging. Simultaneously, a decrease in the calcium retention capacity of mitochondria is developed, which leads to the disturbance of the functional activity of neurons.	The systematic investigations and web content related to the importance of MPT as the target for the search of neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing drugs, especially with multitargeted action, are reviewed.	Here, we have highlighted some experimental data that determines the importance of mitochondria for the search of neuroprotective drugs, and drugs with multitargeted action. We have also discussed a number of new compounds with similar properties. Being MPT inhibitors/modulators, virtually all the compounds described in this review have the ability to exhibit a neuroprotective effect, interact with some other targets, providing coupled beneficial therapeutic effects such as cognitive stimulation, anti-seizure, and antidepressant actions.	Inhibitors of MPT, which increases calcium retention capacity of mitochondria, are considered as promising neuroprotective drugs able not only to halt the neurodegenerative cascade, but also to increase the functional activity of neurons.",Non-systematic-review

The studies assessed similar approaches to interim OAT but were compared to three different control conditions. Four studies reported on treatment retention at 4 months or less with no significant differences between interim OAT and waiting list or standard OAT. Two studies reported treatment retention at 12 months with no differences between interim OAT and standard OAT. Two trials assessed access to standard OAT and showed significant differences between interim OAT and waiting list for standard OAT. We rated the quality of evidence for these outcomes as moderate due to the impact of risk of bias. Data on quality of life or satisfaction with treatment was suboptimal.	Interim OAT is likely more effective than a waiting list for standard OAT in access to treatment, and it is probably as effective as standard OAT regarding treatment retention.

In experiments on rodents, hypothermia in the postischemic period that is introduced up to several hours after reperfusion and is maintained for one day followed by a slow rewarming, significantly protects hippocampal neurons against damage. The mode of action of hypothermia is apparently non-specific and multi-focal in widely progressing cascade reactions in ischemic cells; namely, suppressing: (1) glutamate surge followed by; (2) intraneuronal calcium mobilization; (3) sustained activation of glutamate receptors; (4) dysfunction of blood brain barrier; (5) proliferation of microglial cells; and (6) production of superoxide anions and nitric oxide. In addition, mild hypothermia modulates processes in ischemic condition at the level of cell nucleus, such as the binding of transcription factor AP-1 to DNA, and ameliorates the depression of protein synthesis. This non-specific and widely affecting manner might explain why hypothermia is superior to any medicine developed. Recent clinical trials of mild hypothermia in various individual institutions have revealed significantly beneficial outcomes in some cases, along with an accumulation of practical knowledge of techniques and treatments.

Amino acid composition and sequence analyses of purified FA2 revealed identity to the amino acid sequence of the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human type I procollagen. Gel filtration of AF as well as purified FA2 demonstrated two molecular forms of FA2, which during gel filtration were elucidated corresponding to MW of approximately 100 kDa and 30 kDa. The molecular forms were referred to as the high molecular component (FA2-HM) and low molecular component (FA2-LM), respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis (reducing and nonreducing conditions) showed a MW of 27 kDa for both FA2-HM and FA2-LM. Mass spectrometry analysis however revealed a MW of 14.343 +/- 3Da. Proteins with collagenous domains often reveal aberrant behaviour both in gel filtration and SDS-PAGE and this phenomenon may account for the apparent higher MW of FA2 observed using these techniques compared to mass spectrometry and amino acid composition/sequence analyses. A polyclonal, monospecific rabbit antibody raised against FA2 was used in immunohistochemical localization studies. Due to the obvious association of FA2 to the BM structure in adult and fetal skin, it was initially referred to as a BM associated component. However, FA2 was immunologically distinct from the well established BM components and moreover, the diffuse distribution of FA2 along the BM differed from linear localization of BM components (e.g. collagen type IV and laminin). The identification of FA2 as the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human procollagen type I has the implication that in the immunohistochemical investigations the anti-FA2 may not distinguish between the free propeptide and procollagen type I. In the papillary dermal region of human adult skin type I collagen are arranged in loose fibrils to which the aminoterminal propeptide is still attached. Anti-FA2 may recognize epitopes in the type I procollagen present in this region, giving rise to the diffuse FA2 distribution along the BM. However, whether FA2 also appear as a free component in this region is unknown. In fetal skin where collagen is vividly layed down in the mesenchymal compartment staining with anti-FA2 revealed a diffuse mesenchymal distribution. Demonstration of FA2 within the cytoplasm of proliferating fibroblasts and diffusely in granulation tissue during wound healing suggest that FA2 was involved in the reparative processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",In-vitro-study
1867,20433479,The International journal of psycho-analysis,Murder on the mind: tyranical power and other points along the perverse spectrum.,"This paper illustrates the breadth and depth of the spectrum of perversion and perversity as currently represented in the psychoanalytic literature, raises questions about recent tendencies to include a host of diverse-seeming phenomena under the same conceptual umbrella, and strives to demonstrate what these phenomena have in common that justifies lumping them together under the same rubric. One end of this spectrum is represented by the employment of simple fetishes introduced into a sexual scene in order to promote sexual arousal. Moving along the continuum, one encounters increasing complex behavioral patterns including the enactment of scripts that actualize one's perverse fantasies, including the assumption of complementary roles (e.g. sadomasochism) that equally serve the needs, and represent the desires, of both parties involved. A unique clinical entity, 'perverse modes of relatedness,' lies on the extreme end of the spectrum, representing the reification of the relationship as it becomes little more than a vehicle to take possession and control one's object for the gratification of one's sole needs and desires. What each of these phenomena share in common is both the insertion of a thing or condition - ranging from a simple fetishistic object to an elaborate style of relating that reduces the other into pawn played upon the pervert's chessboard, between the two 'relating' objects as well as a less than honest relationship with reality.",Non-systematic-review

Brief pulse and ultra-brief pulse currents replaced sinusoidal currents. Electrode placements were varied, energy dosing was altered, and electricity was replaced by magnetic currents.	The published experiences and archival records of seizures induced by camphor, pentylenetetrazol, and flurothyl are reviewed and compared with the changes induced by electricity.	The clinical efficacy of chemically induced seizures is equal to that of electrical inductions. Seizure durations are longer, and impairment of cognition and memory is less. Electroconvulsive therapy replaced chemical treatments for ease of use, not for greater efficacy or safety.	The brain seizure, not the method of induction, is the essential element in the efficacy of convulsive therapy. Seizure induction with chemicals avoids the direct effects of electricity on brain functions with lesser effects on cognition. Reexamination of chemical inductions of seizures as replacements for electricity is encouraged.",Non-systematic-review

1870,6625984,Archives of neurology,Language in the nondominant right hemisphere.,"Language function was evaluated in the right nondominant hemisphere in three patients undergoing cortical resection for intractable seizures. Three linguistic tests were given during electrical stimulation of the cortex. They represented three different levels of language complexity from lowest to highest as follows: task 1, object naming; task 2, sentence completion; and task 3, responsive naming. The greatest number of linguistic errors occurred with sentence completion. No linguistic errors were made on the most complex task. Wada's test in the right nondominant hemisphere did not impair function, whereas in the left dominant hemisphere it did. To make these seemingly incompatible observations acceptable, we speculate that there is a right nondominant language system that is anatomically and functionally tied to the left dominant system. Under normal conditions it is passively involved and its integrity is not essential to the function of the left dominant language system.",Remaining

A prospective, controlled study was performed in ten eyes of five rabbits with anatomically normal eyes. These eyes were divided into two groups according to the amount of slanted recession. In right eyes, slanted superior recti (SR) muscle recession was performed with 6 mm of nasal margin and 2 mm of temporal margin (4-mm slanting group), and in fellow eyes, slanted SR muscle recession was performed with 6 mm and 4 mm, respectively (2-mm slanting group). We measured both margins of superior recti from insertion, and calculated the amount of anterior creeping movement of both margins at 30, 60, and 90 postoperative days, and also compared the change of slanting degree of the SR muscle between the two groups.	Slanting degrees showed a gradual decrease in all rabbit eyes. In the 4-mm slanting group, each margin of anterior movement was 2.4.mm (nasal) and 0.9 mm (temporal) and slanting degrees decreased in 50 -7 5%. In the 2-mm slanting group, the margins of anterior movement were 2.9 mm and 1.8 mm respectively, and slanting degrees decreased in 25 ∼ 50%. The amount of slanting degree showed a greater decrease in the 4-mm group than in the 2-mm group at postoperative 3 months (p = 0.045).	Both margins of extraocular muscle in slanted recession showed anterior movement at postoperative 3 months; therefore, the effectiveness of slanted recession might be decreased postoperatively.",Animal-non-drug-intervention
1872,32623925,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",Genetically Predicted Blood Pressure Across the Lifespan: Differential Effects of Mean and Pulse Pressure on Stroke Risk.,"Hypertension is the leading risk factor for stroke. Yet, it remains unknown whether blood pressure pulsatility (pulse pressure [PP]) causally affects stroke risk independently of the steady pressure component (mean arterial pressure [MAP]). It is further unknown how the effects of MAP and PP on stroke risk vary with age and stroke cause. Using data from UK Biobank (N=408 228; 38-71 years), we selected genetic variants as instruments for MAP and PP at age ≤55 and >55 years and across age deciles. We applied multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses to explore associations with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and their subtypes. Higher genetically predicted MAP was associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage across the examined age spectrum. Independent of MAP, higher genetically predicted PP only at age >55 years was further associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio per-SD-increment, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.13-1.34]). Among subtypes, the effect of genetically predicted MAP on large artery stroke was attenuated, whereas the effect of genetically predicted PP was augmented with increasing age. Genetically predicted MAP, but not PP, was associated with small vessel stroke and deep intracerebral hemorrhage homogeneously across age deciles. Neither genetically predicted MAP nor PP were associated with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Beyond an effect of high MAP at any age on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, our results support an independent causal effect of high PP at older ages on large artery stroke. This finding warrants further investigation for the development of stroke preventive strategies targeting pulsatility in later life.",Remaining

We investigated this issue using cell lines from Friedreich's ataxia patients, homozygous for a GAA-repeat expansion in intron 1 of the Frataxin gene. By interphase, FISH we found that in comparison to the normal Frataxin sequence the replication of expanded alleles is slowed or delayed. According to molecular combing, origins never fired within the normal Frataxin allele. In contrast, in mutant alleles dormant origins are recruited within the gene, causing a switch of the prevalent fork direction through the expanded repeat. Furthermore, a global modification of the replication profile, involving origin choice and a differential distribution of unidirectional forks, was observed in the surrounding 850 kb region. These data provide a wide-view of the interplay of events occurring during replication of genes carrying an expanded repeat.",In-vitro-study

The main reason for pharmacological treatment of FASD children is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and methylphenidate (MPH) is the drug of choice. The aim of the study was to assess whether children born of hPAE with ADHD, with or without morphological FASD, differ in terms of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene polymorphisms, and if genetic predisposition affects response and safety of MPH treatment. The polymorphisms of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) were analyzed in DNA samples. A borderline significance was found for the correlation between MPH side effects and the G allele of COMT (rs4680) (p = 0.04994) in all ADHD children. No effect of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) polymorphisms and the treatment efficacy was observed. The analyzed DRD2 and COMT gene polymorphisms seem to play no role in MPH efficacy in ADHD children with hPAE, while low-activity COMT (Met158) variant carriers may be more intolerant to MPH. The MPH treatment is effective in ADHD independent of FASD, although the ADHD-FASD variant requires higher doses to be successful.

However, little is known about the long-term quality and consistency of the sqEEG signal, which is the objective of this study.	The largest multicenter cohort of sqEEG was analyzed, including 14 patients with epilepsy and 12 healthy subjects, implanted with a sqEEG device (24/7 EEG[™] SubQ), and recorded from 23 to 230 days (median 42 days), with a median data capture rate of 75% (17.9 hours/day). Median power spectral density plots of each subject were examined for physiological peaks, including at diurnal and nocturnal periods. Long-term temporal trends in signal impedance and power spectral features were investigated with subject-specific linear regression models and group-level linear mixed-effects models.	sqEEG spectrograms showed an approximate 1/f power distribution. Diurnal peaks in the alpha range (8-13Hz) and nocturnal peaks in the sigma range (12-16Hz) were seen in the majority of subjects. Signal impedances remained low, and frequency band powers were highly stable throughout the recording periods.	The spectral characteristics of minimally invasive, ultra long-term sqEEG are similar to scalp EEG, whereas the signal is highly stationary.

First, we found that the specific ethanol sensitivity hypothesis is not supported by the relevant literature. Second, we found that much of the ambiguity with respect to this hypothesis concerns just pentobarbital. Consequently, the major intent of this paper was to further explore what effect pentobarbital had on these two mouse lines. Additionally, we examined the effects of barbital and ethanol. Our results for each of these compounds clearly indicate that when these mouse lines can be differentiated by particular doses the long-sleep animals always displayed greater narcotic reactions. In this inquiry only one sex was employed, and testing was always initiated at the same time of day. It is our contention that many of the equivocal findings that have been reported concerning pentobarbital are due to combining data from both sexes, circadian rhythmicity, and similar procedural variables.",Animal-other

Histone acetylation has been shown to be a key process in sevoflurane-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities. Here, we investigated whether histone acetylation regulates the interaction between autophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome in models of sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Aged C57BL/6 J mice and cultured primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 2 h. Hippocampal tissue samples and hippocampal neurons were harvested. The processes of histone acetylation and autophagy and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome were observed using western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in both the mouse hippocampus and primary neurons. Concomitantly, sevoflurane upregulated components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and IL-1β) by promoting autophagic degradation in the aging brain. Cognitive deficits and inadequate autophagy induced by sevoflurane were reversed and NLRP3 inflammasome activation was inhibited by SAHA. Treatment with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, eliminated the neuroprotective effects of SAHA on improving cognition in mice, activating autophagy and downregulating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Based on these results, histone acetylation activates autophagy plays an important role in inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome to protect the host from excessive neuroinflammation and sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction in the aging brain.",Animal-drug-intervention

Cognition was assessed using extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Structural measures included brain and lesion volumes, using MRI. Results show SL increases in MS patients in theta, lower alpha and beta bands, with decreases in the upper alpha band. Graph analysis revealed a more regular topology in the lower alpha band in patients, indicated by an increased path length (λ) and clustering coefficient (γ). Attention and working memory domains were impaired, with decreased brain volumes. A stepwise linear regression model using clinical, MRI and MEG parameters as predictors revealed that only increases in lower alpha band γ predicted impaired cognition. Cognitive impairments and related altered connectivity patterns were found to be especially predominant in male patients. These results show specific functional changes in MS as measured with MEG. Only changes in network topology were related to poorer cognitive outcome. This indicates the value of graph analysis beyond traditional structural and functional measures, with possible implications for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes in MS.",Remaining
1892,27638306,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Possible role of mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease.,"Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder that affects the striatum and cortex of patients. HD patients develop progressive motor dysfunction and psychiatric disturbances with gradual dementia. HD is caused by a pathological expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene that codifies for a protein called huntingtin (Htt), which principal function is not completely understood. Accumulative evidence shows that this pathological expansion modifies Htt function affecting different neuronal targets, including mitochondrial function which is an important factor that contributes to HD. Interestingly, several groups have shown mitochondrial disturbances including calcium handling defects, depolarization, decrease of mitochondrial transport, ATP reduction, and increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cellular and murine HD models. Systematic analysis of this evidence indicates that a mitochondrial structure, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), could be responsible for these changes that affect mitochondria. The mPTP plays an important role in apoptosis and neurodegeneration. It has also been reported to have some physiological functions in heart development and synaptic communication. In HD, the presence of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) activates this mechanism producing a significant compromise of mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetics. Considering these findings this review explores the evidence that suggests the important role of mPTP in the mitochondrial impairment induced by mHtt, which leads to calcium derangement and contributes to neuronal dysfunction in HD.",Non-systematic-review

Glycemic control and counseling affect were also studied.	A retrospective chart review of patients seen between 2013 and 2015 was performed. Five hundred and thirty adolescents with type 1 (T1DM) or 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to identify depressive symptoms. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured when the PHQ-9 was given, and at 1 year. Patients with increased depression risk were referred for counseling and comparisons were made between those who did and did not attend.	Females with T2DM, but not males, had increased depression compared to T1DM. Females had increased depression compared to males in T1DM (p = 0.046) and a near significant increase in T2DM (p = 0.069). In T1DM, but not T2DM, HbA1c levels were increased in high and moderate, compared to low, risk depression risk groups (p = 0.007). Follow-up HbA1c was unchanged 1 year later and there were no differences between those involved in counseling and those who refused to attend. Sex and type of diabetes had no effect on response to counseling.	These results demonstrate increased depression in adolescents with T2DM compared to T1DM and in females compared to controls. Glycemic control did not change in adolescents who reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression and received counseling intervention compared to adolescents who declined counseling.",Remaining

We examined 194 in-patients at 8 psychosomatic clinics upon admission and discharge by interview and psychometric testing. Being on sick leave before admission proved to be an indicator for higher global symptom distress as well as a higher severity of anxiety symptoms. Treatment duration was longer for the sick leave group than for the patients that had not been on sick leave, but each group experienced the same degree of change in pre-and-post treatment symptoms. We conclude that sick leave before admission does give information about illness severity and need of treatment in patients with anxiety disorders.",Remaining

We implemented a two-locus linkage analysis model where a gene 1 genotype increases the risk of a broad phenotype and a gene 2 genotype modifies the expression of gene 1 by conferring susceptibility to a specific phenotype.	Compared to a single-locus analysis within the broad phenotype, the proposed approach had greater power to detect the modifier gene 2 (0.96 vs. 0.54 under a simulation scenario including heterogeneity).

1898,22082429,Headache,Insights into the mechanism of onabotulinumtoxinA in chronic migraine.,"OnabotulinumtoxinA has recently been approved by regulatory agencies in the UK and United States for treatment of chronic migraine based on data generated from the PREEMPT studies. As such, onabotulinumtoxinA is the only prophylactic therapy specifically approved for chronic migraine. Most headache clinicians would agree that acute episodic migraine and chronic migraine differ in their pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and response to pharmacological as well as nonpharmacological therapies. Of the 7 botulinum neurotoxin serotypes, botulinum neurotoxin type A (onabotulinumtoxinA) has been the most thoroughly investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. Based on preclinical studies, onabotulinumtoxinA is known to inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from both motor and sensory neurons by preventing vesicle fusion to the cell membrane. In addition to the well-documented myorelaxant effects of this neurotoxin, onabotulinumtoxinA can exert a direct analgesic effect that likely involves inhibition of primary and secondary nociceptive neurons. The inhibitory effects of onabotulinumtoxinA are also likely to involve suppressing the activity of myogenic trigger points and decreasing the persistent nociceptive barrage that promotes and maintains central sensitization. This article describes possible mechanisms to explain how onabotulinumtoxinA functions as a therapy for chronic migraine and considers why treatment with the neurotoxin is not effective in some chronic migraineurs.",Non-systematic-review

Behavioral, psychological, and physiologic measures of the impact of sleep restriction were compared between groups at baseline, during sleep restriction, and following recovery sleep.	Two sleep research laboratories.	Thirty-eight healthy adults; 9 men and 10 women (mean age: 26.0 +/- 6.1 years) in the placebo group and 8 men and 11 women (mean age: 26.7 +/- 8.1 years) in the tiagabine 8 mg group	Both experimental groups underwent 4 nights of sleep restriction. Each group received either tiagabine 8 mg or placebo on all sleep-restriction nights, and both groups received placebo on baseline and recovery nights.	Polysomnography documented a SWS-enhancing effect of tiagabine. The placebo group displayed the predicted deficits due to sleep restriction on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Compared with placebo, the tiagabine group did not demonstrate impairment in sustained attention on the Psychomotor Vigilance Test, performed better on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, reported more restorative sleep, and had less of an increase in afternoon-evening salivary free cortisol.

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a reasonable alternative for inoperable or high-risk lesions requiring treatment. Few series evaluate overall results that include data from both modalities as they more often focus on their treatment method of choice. In this study, we evaluated our AVM database of 129 patients seen over the past eight years at our institution: 73 were treated with microsurgery (57%) while 37 (29%) were treated with SRS. We reviewed angiographic obliteration rates, complication rates, and outcome data, excluding seven patients treated with SRS as they did not have at least two years of angiographic follow-up. Patients undergoing microsurgery had smaller AVM (mean 2.2 cm compared to 3.5 cm for SRS), a smaller proportion of eloquent AVM (53% compared to 83% for SRS), a greater proportion of AVM with superficial drainage only (75% compared to 40% for SRS), and more grade 1 and 2 AVM (78% compared to 17% for SRS). The overall obliteration rate was 80%: 92% for microsurgery and 50% for SRS. The latter increased to 92% for AVM <3 cm, but the obliteration rate was 18% for those AVM >3 cm. Transient complications, including post-SRS hemorrhage, were seen in 11% of patients overall (8% after microsurgery, 17% after SRS). At follow-up, 53% of patients had improved, 37% remained the same, 7% had become worse and 3% had died. As a result of post-SRS hemorrhage, a greater proportion of patients was worse or had died after SRS (20%) compared to those who had been treated with microsurgery (5%).",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention

Glioma development is also associated with alteration in the activities and expression of cell cycle regulators, and miRNAs are emerging as important regulators of cell cycle progression. Here, we show that miR-25 is overexpressed in 91% of examined human glioma tissues and 4 out of 6 human glioma cell lines. MiR-25 increases cell proliferation in two independent glioma cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-25 was found to reduce CDKN1C protein levels by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Notably, ablation of endogenous miR-25 rescued CDKN1C expression and significantly decreased glioma cell proliferation by facilitating normal cell cycle progression. Our clinical investigation found CDKN1C and miR-25 levels were inversely correlated. Lastly, downregulation of CDKN1 by siRNA blocked the activity of miR-25 on promoting glioma cell proliferation. Overall, our results for the first time show an oncogenic role of miR-25 in human glioma by targeting CDKN1C and that miR-25 could potentially be a therapeutic target for glioma intervention.",In-vitro-study

The current study aimed to describe khat dependence, use patterns, and khatrelated health problems in Australian migrant communities.	A 48-item questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 52 participants from African migrant communities who self-reported using khat in four Australian state capital cities between April 1 and June 1, 2012. Associations between Severity of Dependence Scale for khat use (SDS-khat) screening status, use patterns, and khat-related psychological and physical health problems were assessed using multivariate loglinked Poisson regression controlling for potential sociodemographic confounders.	Overall, 44.2% (n = 23) of the study participants screened positive on the SDS-khat, indicating probable khat dependence. Screening positive for khat dependence was associated with increased risk for khat use frequency in the last 30 days (adjusted prevalence risk ratio [APRR] = 2.26, 95% CI [1.23, 4.15], p = .009), experiencing three or more psychological health problems (APRR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.04, 3.36], p = .037), and experiencing two or more physical health problems (APRR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.13, 3.27], p = .016) after using khat.	Screening positive on the SDS-khat is associated with increased recent khat use frequency and elevated physical and psychological health problems, providing preliminary evidence that probable khat use dependence may be associated with an increased risk of harm in Australia. Furthermore, these preliminary results support the potential utility of the SDS-khat to healthcare providers to identify those at risk for khatrelated harms. Further investigation into the relationship between khat dependence, use patterns, and related health outcomes is warranted.",Remaining
1906,34050644,Journal of analytical toxicology,Increasing Prevalence of Ketamine in Drivers in New York City Including the Identification of 2-Fluoro-Deschloroketamine.,"Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used in veterinary and human medicine since the 1970s. Its clinical use has expanded to control of seizures, by pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS), and is finding new purpose as an analgesic alternative and antidepressant. Ketamine brings hope for effective management of chronic pain in the absence of opioids and decreasing suicidal ideations; however, its persistence as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic properties remains. In the wake of expanding medicinal purposes, the diversity of New York City's population was explored to better understand its misuse. This retrospective study looks at the prevalence of ketamine in driver fatalities over a period of 18 years (2003-2020) and cases involving suspected driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) over a period of 6 years (2015-2020). Ketamine was identified in 6 driver fatalities and in 47 DUID cases. None of the driver fatalities were suspected of ketamine misuse, due to administration either in hospital or by EMS. In the DUID cases, an increasing trend was observed over the 6-year study period with 100% (n = 47) of the cases confirmed as non-hospital/non-EMS administered ketamine. Of the DUID cases, 94% were male with the majority between the age of 21 and 39 years (85%) and were predominantly Hispanic (36%) and Asian (34%). Blood concentrations of ketamine ranged from 27 to >2000 ng/mL with polydrug use prevalent. The most common drug classes detected in addition to ketamine were cannabinoids (38%), ethanol (32%), benzodiazepines (26%), cocaine (19%) and amphetamines/3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (15%). In 2019, 2-fluoro-deschloroketamine was identified in two cases for the first time. Despite its increased acceptance for mental health disorders, ketamine's persistence and misuse as a recreational drug remains and should continue to be monitored by relevant toxicological, clinical and law enforcement communities along with emerging illicit ketamine analogs.",Remaining

Those complaints refer to the core symptoms of the ADHD. However, the diagnosis of ADHD is delicate to establish and subject to several controversies regarding its etiopathological origins and, therefore, its treatment. In practice, those situations include very different cases and it seems obvious that this is a polyfactorial disorder, no single factor alone being sufficient to account for all the difficulties experienced by the children. It would therefore be simplistic to consider the ADHD as issued only from a neurobiological disorder and to consider a drug treatment, only.

1908,22757585,IET systems biology,Dynamic modelling of protein and oxidative metabolisms simulates the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.,"Research into Parkinson's disease (PD) is difficult and time consuming. It is a complex condition that develops over many decades in the human brain. For such apparently intractable diseases, mathematical models can offer an additional means of investigation. As a contribution to this process, the authors have developed an ordinary differential equation model of the most important cellular processes that have been associated with PD. The model describes the following processes: (i) cellular generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species; (ii) the possible damage and removal of the protein -synuclein and, (iii) feedback interactions between damaged α-synuclein and reactive oxygen species. Simulation results show that the Parkinsonian condition, with elevated oxidative stress and misfolded α-synuclein accumulation, can be induced in the model by known PD risk factors such as ageing, exposure to toxins and genetic defects. The significant outcome of the paper is the demonstration that it is possible to reproduce in silico the multi-factorial interactions that characterise the pathogenesis of PD. As such, the model provides a systematic explanation of the variability and heterogeneity of PD and provides the basis for computational studies of further facets of this complex multi-factorial condition.

The ability to look beyond the lumen using highly developed vessel wall imaging methods to identify plaque vulnerable to disruption has prompted an active debate as to whether a paradigm shift is needed to move away from relying on measurements of luminal stenosis for gauging the risk of ischemic injury. Further evaluation in randomized clinical trials will help to better define the exact role of plaque imaging in clinical decision-making.

The mechanisms underlying this association have not been fully defined.	The aim of the study was to determine whether increasing hydrocortisone (or equivalent) to 30 mg/d in ACTH-deficient patients increased cardiovascular risk and whether a reduction in insulin sensitivity and attenuation of insulin's hemodynamic effects was responsible for this effect.	We conducted an open interventional study between 2011 and 2013.	The study was performed in the Endocrine Research Unit, Repatriation General Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.	Seventeen ACTH-deficient subjects taking hydrocortisone (≤20 mg/d) for at least 6 months were studied.	Subjects were studied before and after a 7-day increase in hydrocortisone to 30 mg/d.	The primary outcome was the change in pulse wave velocity, both fasting and after a 75-g oral glucose load.	Fasting and post-glucose load pulse wave velocities were not significantly different on the higher glucocorticoid dose. Fasting augmentation index (24.9 ± 2.7 vs 22.6 ± 2.6%; P = .04) and reactive hyperemia index (2.3 ± 0.2 vs 2.0 ± 0.2; P = 0.04) were lower on the higher glucocorticoid dose, with no significant difference in the post-glucose load changes in these variables. There were no significant changes in insulin sensitivity or secretion on the higher glucocorticoid dose.	Endothelial dysfunction may contribute to the increased cardiovascular mortality associated with higher glucocorticoid doses. This may be a direct glucocorticoid effect, not mediated by insulin resistance. ACTH-deficient patients should thus be prescribed the lowest safe glucocorticoid replacement dose.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

1912,10749516,Clinical pharmacokinetics,Is there a role for therapeutic drug monitoring of new anticonvulsants?,"Despite the fact that all new anticonvulsants have undergone extensive pharmacokinetic scrutiny prior to their introduction to the market, the opportunity to perform good prospective studies on their concentration-effect relationship has been largely missed, in some cases deliberately because therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is considered unfavourable for the marketing of a new drug. However, there are reasons to believe that TDM may play a useful role in maximising the therapeutic potential of new anticonvulsants. In fact, these drugs have a narrow therapeutic index, careful individualisation of dosage to optimise response is required, and inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic variability may translate into differences in dosage requirements. The wide interindividual variability in the serum concentrations at which therapeutic and toxic effects of these drugs are observed does not necessarily imply that TDM cannot be useful: indeed, a marked pharmacodynamic variability has also been reported for all the currently monitored older anticonvulsants. The new anticonvulsants which, based on their properties, are particularly attractive candidates for TDM include lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, zonisamide and felbamate. However, in the absence on sound information on the target concentration ranges of these drugs, the routine concentration monitoring of these drugs cannot be recommended. Despite this, serial measurements of serum drug concentrations may be useful in selected patients, especially those suspected of poor compliance and those in whom pharmacokinetic changes caused by disease or administration of concomitant medication are anticipated. Even in the presence of marked interindividual pharmacodynamic variability, it is often possible to empirically determine the concentration at which each patient exhibits the best response, and apply that information in subsequent management. Prospective studies, using preferably a randomised concentration-controlled design, are necessary to better characterise concentration-effect relationships for these agents.",Non-systematic-review
1913,14713669,Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,The social course of drug injection and sexual activity among YMSM and other high-risk youth: an agenda for future research.,"The cumulative epidemiologic literature indicates that many injecting drug users (IDUs) initiate injection as a mode of drug administration during late adolescence or early adulthood. Recent studies have shown that IDUs are often exposed to viral infections relatively early in the course of injection, highlighting the importance of understanding this initiation process for both epidemiology and prevention. Epidemiologic evidence similarly suggests that at least some youth populations, most notably young men who have sex with men (YMSM), are at substantial risk for exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) from early sexual activity. Despite the importance of this issue for both epidemiology and prevention, however, surprisingly little information is available on the social course of injection initiation, including the individual, social, or ecological factors that might mitigate or exacerbate transmission risks within the critical phase of early injection drug use. Similarly, we know little about the ways that YMSM and other high-risk youth understand risk, the kinds of exchanges and relationships in which they participate in the context of initiating sexual activity, or how drug use is operant in these exchanges and early sexual experiences. In this article, we explore key dimensions of the early initiation of injection and sexual risk, and discuss how a social network approach might be instrumental in understanding the social course of drug injection and sexual activities among youth and young adult populations.",Non-systematic-review

The first type, already well-known, occurred in 8 of the 10 rats. This type was seen both during sleep and wakefulness and was accompanied by behavioural concomitants, reminiscent of human petit-mal epilepsy. A mean of 18 discharges/h was found. The second type, a novel one with a differential shape, occurred in 7 rats with a mean number of 14 discharges/h. In contrast to the first one, this spike-wave complex was not accompanied by behavioural correlates and was almost exclusively present during wakefulness. Four reasons make this strain of rats attractive as an additional animal model for epileptogenic activity: the occurrence of two types of spike-wave complexes, the high percentage of animals showing these phenomena, the genetic constitution of these rats and the fact that they are commercially available.",Animal-other

Data were from approximately 1200 adults from 465 families assessed as part of a large family and genetic study of OCD. The association of three parenting factors, for fathers and mothers, with offspring OCD status were examined; analyses were stratified by parental OCD status and family loading for OCD (multiplex versus sporadic).	Three factors were derived by principal components factor analysis of the PBI (maternal and paternal care, overprotection and control). Maternal overprotection was associated with OCD in offspring with familial OCD (familial cases) but only if neither parent was affected with OCD, which suggests independent but additive environmental and genetic risk (OR = 5.9, 95% CI 1.2, 29.9, p = 0.031). Paternal care was a protective factor in those not at high genetic risk (sporadic cases) (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 0.8, p = 0.027). Maternal overprotection was also associated with offspring OCD in sporadic families (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3, 6.6, p = 0.012). The finding that parental overprotection and care were not associated with offspring OCD when at least one parent had OCD addressed directly the hypothesis of maternal or paternal OCD adversely impacting parenting.	This study provides evidence that aspects of parenting may contribute to the development of OCD among offspring. Prospective studies of children at risk for OCD are needed to explore the direction of causality.",Remaining

Therefore, maintaining the quality of life (QoL) of caregivers is an integral part of dementia care.	To explore the relationship between the QoL of people with dementia and their caregivers in Indonesia.	This is a cross-sectional study using binary correlations to analyze the relationship between people with dementia and caregivers' QoL. Conducted in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, the subjects were 42 people diagnosed with dementia according to the PPDGJ-III (adapted from the ICD 10) and 42 primary caregivers with at least 6 hours duration of caregiving per day. The QoL of people with dementia was measured by EuroQol-5D and VAS EQ-5D, while severity of dementia was measured by MMSE. Caregivers underwent an interview using WHO Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) and NPI.	Most caregivers were women, aged 40-70 years old. The study found caregivers' QoL environmental domain strongly correlated with people with dementia's QoL (r = 0.839). Severity of dementia had a strong correlation with caregivers' QoL physical domain (r = 0.946). Age, duration of caregiving per day, period of care provided by caregivers, and caregiver's distress had a strong correlation with caregiver QoL for specific domains.	There was a strong correlation between people with dementia's QoL and caregiver QoL, so in managing dementia, clinicians should consider caregivers' wellbeing as an essential part significantly affecting the quality of elderly care improvement.",Remaining

Totally 81 patients with severe IVH in our hospital from November 2017 to March 2019 were divided into the intervention group (38 cases who received neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation combined with intraventricular lavage) and the control group (40 cases who received trepanation drainage). The perioperative condition, hematoma clearance rate, Glasgow coma score (GCS), hematoma recurrence rate, and prognosis were observed and compared between the two groups after treatment.	The operative time, time of cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and intracranial infection rate in the intervention group elicited superior results to those in the control group (p < .05). The clearance rate of hematoma in the intervention group was higher than that in the control group at 6 hr, 1, 3, and 7 days postoperatively (p < .05). The postoperative 3- and 7-day GCS scores in the intervention group were higher than those in the control group, and the recurrence rate of hematoma in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < .05), and the good/excellent rate of ADL in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p < .05).

In clinical practice self-reports can be used to screen to enhance recognition. We therefore present a systematic review of the screening properties for the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32).	A systematic literature search was conducted to identify all relevant studies looking at the screening properties of the HCL-32 in adults.	Out of 196 papers 21 papers reported data on 22 independent samples. We narratively reviewed these studies. Weighted estimated Sensitivity was 80% regardless of whether a BD diagnosis was compared to unipolar depression or any other non-bipolar diagnosis. Specificity indicated that the HCL-32 was better when comparing BD to unipolar depression (65.3%) than to any other diagnostic category (57.3%). Fewer studies provided estimates for predictive powers, leading to less reliable overall estimates for these indicators.	Despite some limitations, using the HCL-32 as a first screening in patients seeking help for depression can be recommended, but should never be used on its own for diagnosing. Future research should examine whether screening properties can be improved by developing an algorithm incorporating the negative consequences reported for different areas in the HCL-32.",Human-systematic-review

Yet this information is essential for the management of sleep bruxism and to plan appropriate dental treatment. The objective of this study was to clinically test a device that could be used to record bruxism events in a home environment. Pressure sensors were developed for use under the surface of an occlusal splint, and circuitry was designed to facilitate the recording and wireless transmission of the pressure sensor signal to a computer. Controlled mandibular movements were carried out in vivo to simulate bruxism and non-bruxism patterns. These patterns of force application were graphically presented to two examiners who were asked to identify the type of activity represented by the force curves. Examiners were largely able to distinguish bruxism from non-bruxism activity; the sensitivity ranged from 80% to 100% and the specificity from 75% to 100%. Using sensors in an occlusal splint, it is possible to recognise the typical tooth contact patterns seen in sleep bruxism. Such a device may be useful for monitoring sleep bruxism over an extended period at home.",Remaining

Le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques,Helping Families Cope with the Severe Stress of Dravet Syndrome.,"A child with Dravet syndrome shakes family life to the core. Dravet syndrome usually has three phases: (1) up to 1-1½ years: with episodes of febrile status epilepticus but normal development; (2) age 1½ to ~6-10 years: with frequent seizures of varying types, developmental stagnation, behavioural and sleep problems; (3) after ~10 years: improvement in seizures, deteriorating gait, intellectual disability but some developmental gains. Complete seizure control is rare-simply prescribing medication is inadequate to help families. Based on structured interviews with 24 families and confirmed by more informal discussions with other families, we suggest strategies for coping with this catastrophe. A child with Dravet syndrome usually means that one parent cannot work-financial pressures should be anticipated. In Stage 1, the approach to status should include a written protocol. An indwelling catheter for rapid venous access may be helpful. In Stage 2, assistance finding qualified babysitters is required, and the extended family needs encouragement to help. Appropriate equipment, rescue medication and protocols should travel with the child. Siblings may benefit from a system of one parent 'on call.' An internet support group provides an invaluable lifeline. In Stage 3, family isolation may be extreme-respite care and personal time for parents are important. Death from status, accidents and SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) occurs in 15%. Fear of SUDEP needs to be addressed. Moving from paediatric to adult care is frightening; an epilepsy transition clinic is useful.

We investigated previously established clinical predictors of TESI and combined these with several polymorphisms of candidate genes in patients with major depressive disorder. Common polymorphisms involved in the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) and 2 (TPH2), serotonin transporter, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated in a naturalistic inpatient study of the German research network on depression. We compared patients showing TESI with non-TESI suicidal patients and with non-suicidal patients using univariate tests to detect relevant factors, which were further tested in logistic regression and CART (Classification and Regression Trees) analyses. Of the 269 patients, TESI occurred in 22 patients (17 female), 117 patients were defined as non-TESI suicidal patients, and 130 patients were classified as non-suicidal. When comparing cases with both control groups we found the TPH2 rs1386494 (C/T) polymorphism to be moderately associated with TESI (Univariate tests: TESI vs. non-suicidality: p=0.005; adjusted: p=0.09; TESI vs. non-TESI suicidal patients: p=0.0024; adjusted: p=0.086). This polymorphism remained the only significant genetic factor in addition to clinical predictors in logistic regression and CART analyses. CART analyses suggested interactions with several clinical predictors. Haplotype analyses further supported a contribution of this polymorphism in TESI. The TPH2 rs1386494 (C/T) polymorphism might contribute to the genetic background of TESI. This polymorphism has been previously associated with committed suicide and major depressive disorder.

Clinical,Brain activation during self- and other-reflection in bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis: Comparison to schizophrenia.,"Reflecting on the self and on others activates specific brain areas and contributes to metacognition and social cognition. The aim of the current study is to investigate brain activation during self- and other-reflection in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In addition, we examined whether potential abnormal brain activation in BD patients could distinguish BD from patients with schizophrenia (SZ).	During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 17 BD patients, 17 SZ patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs) performed a self-reflection task. The task consisted of sentences divided into three conditions: self-reflection, other-reflection and semantic control.	BD patients showed less activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) extending to the precuneus during other-reflection compared to HCs (p = 0.028 FWE corrected on cluster-level within the regions of interest). In SZ patients, the level of activation in this area was in between BD patients and HCs, with no significant differences between patients with SZ and BD. There were no group differences in brain activation during self-reflection. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the PCC/precuneus activation during other-reflection and cognitive insight in SZ patients, but not in BD patients.	BD patients showed less activation in the PCC/precuneus during other-reflection. This may support an account of impaired integration of emotion and memory (evaluation of past and current other-related information) in BD patients. Correlation differences of the PCC/precuneus activation with the cognitive insight in patients with BD and SZ might reflect an important difference between these disorders, which may help to further explore potentially distinguishing markers.",Remaining
1928,33691710,Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,Comment: difference between assessment of upper limb movement and upper limb associated reactions during walking.,"While walking, people swing their arms in a specific pattern. This specific arm swing pattern during walking has shown to have a beneficial effect on gait as it reduces walking energy cost and optimizes balance. In several patient populations the arm movements can be directly affected (e.g. in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI)), which in turn has a negative effect on their gait pattern, balance and energy cost of walking.	In December 2019, Kahn et al. published a paper in JNER concerning the quantification of upper limb associated reactions (ARs) during walking in people with ABI. ARs are defined as 'an effort-dependent phenomenon causing an involuntary increase in upper limb muscle tone, with awkward and uncomfortable postures'. These upper limb ARs appear often in patients with ABI and can have an important effect on their gait. The authors calculated kinematic measures using three-dimensional gait analysis relating to range of motion, variability and mean position over the gait cycle for the different upper limb joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist) during self-selected steady-state walking. Based on differences they found between an ABI cohort and healthy control cohort, the authors concluded that they were able to quantify ARs during walking in this population. This calculation, however, is not specific for upper limb ARs. In fact, the authors calculated general measures of arm posture (e.g. mean position over the gait cycle) or arm movement (e.g. range of motion and variability) during gait. Previous research has already indicated that other factors than ARs can influence the posture or movement of the arm during gait in patients with brain injury, such as voluntary compensations for gait instability and contractures or spasticity of upper arm muscles. Yet, it is not possible to disentangle the different causes of the altered arm posture during steady-state walking based on the proposed measures.	The kinematic arm measures proposed by Kahn et al. (J Neuroeng Rehabil 16(1):160, 2019) are not a direct measure of ARs, but provide a quantification of overall deviation of arm posture or movement during gait. Depending on the specific study design these measures may provide insights in ARs.",Non-systematic-review

1931,15351342,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Effects of epilepsy surgery on psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities in children and adolescents.,"When considering surgery in children, it is important to think about the potential effect on psychiatric and behavioral outcome. A growing body of evidence suggests that the type of epilepsy (benign or catastrophic) and the age of the patient affect developmental outcome. In younger children with catastrophic epilepsy, the primary goal of therapy is not only to control seizures, but also to offer the child the opportunity for the best possible development. In older children with partial seizures, the therapeutic goal is to control seizures, which may allow a more normal life and improve behavior. Epilepsy surgery generally appears to have a positive effect on behavior and development in many younger children with catastrophic epilepsy. Psychiatric and behavioral outcomes in older children with complex partial epilepsy are less clear; many patients improve, but there does appear to be a small risk of developing new psychiatric or behavioral disorders postoperatively.",Non-systematic-review

Results of a laboratory study taken 7 days after the onset of chorea showed elevated antistreptolysin O titer, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Other laboratory data, throat culture, echocardiography, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalography did not reveal any abnormalities. Five days after treatment with haloperidol and penicillin, the chorea began to improve slowly, and completely resolved in 2 months.	Three serial SPECT images and semiquantitative analysis of cerebral perfusion were obtained. Cerebral perfusion in the striatum and thalamus was markedly increased bilaterally during the stage of active chorea and then returned nearly to its baseline level during the convalescent phase. These cerebral perfusion patterns were concordant with semiquantitative analysis.

Further complications included one patient with haematoma and sustained scrotal pain, one patient with meatal stenosis, and four patients with infections not related to the implant. In total, 30 EDITS questionnaires were administered and 26 (87%) were completed. Twenty-two patients (85%) reported being satisfied with the implant and two (8%) were dissatisfied. Twenty-four patients (92%) would recommend a penile implant to someone with a similar medical condition. Eighteen patients (72%) believed that their partner was satisfied with the implant. Nineteen patients (76%) felt that the process of achieving an erection with the implant was natural.

Using an ischemic rodent model, the authors sought to determine (a) if estrogen replacement increases postischemic platelet reactivity, (b) if changes in estrogen status alter intraplatelet endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) synthesis, and (c) if estrogen-mediated effects on platelets alter cerebral blood flow during reperfusion. Intact (I), ovariectomized (OVX), and OVX + 17 beta-estradiol (E50) rats were subjected to 30 min of forebrain ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. Using the platelet activation marker P-selectin, postischemic platelet reactivity was quantified by flow cytometry. In a separate cohort (I, OVX, E50), the authors quantified platelet eNOS by Western blot. Another cohort (OVX, E50) was subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, and cerebral blood flow was determined using the iodoantipyrine technique. Collagen-stimulated platelet P-selectin expression was increased in the OVX rats at 60 min of reperfusion, and this effect was reversed by estrogen treatment. No differences in platelet eNOS expression were detected among groups. Cerebral blood flow at 60 min reperfusion was comparable between the OVX and the E50 rats. The authors conclude that during reper-fusion, estrogen deficiency increases postischemic platelet sensitivity to stimuli in estrogen-deficient rats. Estrogen treatment mitigates effects of estrogen loss on platelets, but this early effect is apparently not caused by intraplatelet eNOS depression. Neither estrogen deficiency nor estrogen treatment changes early postischemic regional brain blood flow. In this rodent global cerebral ischemic model, physiologic doses of estrogen are not deleterious to platelet reactivity and may initially reduce postischemic platelet reactivity.",Animal-drug-intervention

Non-linear minimum L(1)-norm CCD reconstruction (with current sources restricted to the individual cortical surface and a realistic boundary element method (BEM) head model) was used to localize and to study the propagation of interictal epileptiform EEG activity in 13 pre-surgical patients with TLE.	In all but one patient with mesial temporal lesions, an initial activation maximum corresponding to the ascending part of averaged sharp waves was found in the ipsilateral anterior basolateral temporal lobe, mostly extending up to the affected mesial structures whose resection rendered the patients seizure-free. In all 3 patients with lateral temporal lesions, the activation was initially confined to temporal neocortex immediately adjacent to the epileptogenic lesion. Towards the peak of sharp waves, two patients showed a propagation of interictal activity to anterior and posterior and partly contralateral temporal regions.

The long-term goal was to enhance the respective school's programs to enable preventative approaches to lessen negative and risk seeking behaviours amongst pupils with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders. The research results demonstrate statistically significant success of the applied program in two measured variables. Firstly, learning success (p < 0.05), and secondly a decrease in truancy and disciplinary misdemeanours (p < 0.05). Both of which were observed in participants with behavioural problems. The program was not as successful for participants with behavioural disorders, but not without some effect. Although the program can be generally described as achieving a medium level of success, the fact that there was a lack of progressive worsening in participant's behaviour is a substantial bi-product of the program. The mentors involved in the program made it extremely clear by their feedback that, MYMP positively enhanced their formal Pedagogy training, through hands-on practise that they otherwise would not have received through their academic programs. They were provided with vital exposure to a preventative program and managed to gain insight into the possibilities of introducing early intervention and prevention into Croatian schools.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
1940,7732774,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,Somatosensory evoked potentials in cerebral ischemia of rabbits.,"Twenty-one rabbits were used in the ischemic group and six in the control group. Cerebral ischemia of variable degree was induced by Fe particle injection method. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were compared when the CBF levels decreased to their minimum. The latency of the SEPs increased along with the decrease of the CBF when it was lower than 20 ml/100 g/min (68% of the pre-ischemic control level). This may be related to the ischemic change of the white matter. The amplitude showed diphasic changes. When the CBF decreased below 20 ml/100 g/min, the amplitude increased; when the CBF was lower than 11 ml/100 g/min (38% of the pre-ischemic level), it decreased. These results indicate that the functions of the cerebral cortex might be excited in mild ischemia, and be suppressed in severe ischemia.",Animal-other
1941,28230791,International journal of molecular sciences,"The Temporal Pattern, Flux, and Function of Autophagy in Spinal Cord Injury.","Previous studies have indicated that autophagy plays a critical role in spinal cord injury (SCI), including traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) and ischemia-reperfusion spinal cord injury (IRSCI). However, while the understanding of mechanisms underlying autophagy in SCI has progressed, there remain several controversial points: (1) temporal pattern results of autophagic activation after SCI are not consistent across studies; (2) effect of accumulation of autophagosomes due to the blockade or enhancement of autophagic flux is uncertain; (3) overall effect of enhanced autophagy remains undefined, with both beneficial and detrimental outcomes reported in SCI literature. In this review, the temporal pattern of autophagic activation, autophagic flux, autophagic cell death, relationship between autophagy and apoptosis, and pharmacological intervention of autophagy in TSCI (contusion injury, compression injury and hemisection injury) and IRSCI are discussed. Types of SCI and severity appear to contribute to differences in outcomes regarding temporal pattern, flux, and function of autophagy. With future development of specific strategies on autophagy intervention, autophagy may play an important role in improving functional recovery in patients with SCI.",Non-systematic-review

Despite significant overlap of symptoms between posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders, the latter has received less attention. Given that dysregulated fear levels characterize anxiety disorders, examining the neural correlates of fear and extinction learning may shed light on the pathogenesis of underlying anxiety disorders.	To investigate the psychophysiological and neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction recall in anxiety disorders and to document how these features differ as a function of multiple diagnoses or anxiety severity.	This investigation was a cross-sectional, case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study at an academic medical center. Participants were healthy controls and individuals with at least 1 of the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder. The study dates were between March 2013 and May 2015.	Two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm.	Skin conductance responses, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses, trait anxiety scores from the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Form, and functional connectivity.	This study included 21 healthy controls (10 women) and 61 individuals with anxiety disorders (36 women). P values reported for the neuroimaging results are all familywise error corrected. Skin conductance responses during extinction recall did not differ between individuals with anxiety disorders and healthy controls (ηp2 = 0.001, P = .79), where ηp2 is partial eta squared. The anxiety group had lower activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction recall (ηp2 = 0.178, P = .02). A similar hypoactive pattern was found during early conditioning (ηp2 = 0.106, P = .009). The vmPFC hypoactivation was associated with anxiety symptom severity (r = -0.420, P = .01 for conditioning and r = -0.464, P = .004 for extinction recall) and the number of co-occuring anxiety disorders diagnosed (ηp2 = 0.137, P = .009 for conditioning and ηp2 = 0.227, P = .004 for extinction recall). Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the fear network connectivity differed between healthy controls and the anxiety group during fear learning (ηp2 range between 0.088 and 0.176 and P range between 0.02 and 0.003) and extinction recall (ηp2 range between 0.111 and 0.235 and P range between 0.02 and 0.002).	Despite no skin conductance response group differences during extinction recall, brain activation patterns between anxious and healthy individuals differed. These findings encourage future studies to examine the conditions longitudinally and in the context of treatment trials to improve and guide therapeutics via advanced neurobiological understanding of each disorder.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
1945,8733222,Psychological medicine,Causal attributions about common somatic sensations among frequent general practice attenders.,"The causal attributions that people make about bodily symptoms or sensations are likely to influence their decisions whether or not to consult a doctor. Previous research has supported the model that people tend initially to look for external or environmental explanations for bodily sensations (normalizing attributions) and only if this process fails do they search for attributions internal to themselves (somatic or psychological attributions). This study tested two hypotheses about frequent general practice attenders: (1) compared with others, they are more likely to make somatic attributions and less likely to make normalizing ones; and (2) given a bodily symptom together with a somatic explanation, frequent attenders will have greater difficulty than others in finding reasons why the given (pathological) explanation is untrue. The frequent attenders' group had themselves initiated an average of 12 general practice visits in the 12 months before assessment, while a control group of infrequent attenders had not made appointments to see their general practitioner for an average of 24 months. The results provide partial support for the hypotheses. Frequent attenders generated significantly fewer normalizing explanations for a series of common bodily sensations than the comparison group, although the two groups did not differ in their somatic attributions. Given a common bodily sensation and an accompanying pathological explanation, the frequent attenders were less able than the control group to generate reasons why the given explanation might be untrue. Some associations were found between these measures and anxiety.",Remaining
1946,12707046,The American journal of pathology,Microtubule reduction in Alzheimer's disease and aging is independent of tau filament formation.,"Biochemical studies show that phosphorylated tau, like that found in paired helical filaments (PHFs), does not promote microtubule assembly leading to the view that PHF formation leads to microtubule deficiency in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, although this issue is one of the most important aspects to further understanding the cell biology of AD, no quantitative examination of microtubule diminution in AD and its relationship with PHFs has been performed. To examine this issue directly, we undertook a morphometric study of brain biopsy specimens from AD and control cases. Ultrastructural analysis of neurons was performed to compare the microtubule assembly state in neurons of diseased and control cases and to examine the effect of PHF accumulation. We found that both number and total length of microtubules were significantly and selectively reduced in pyramidal neurons from AD in comparison to control cases (P = 0.000004) but that this decrement in microtubule density was surprisingly unrelated to PHFs (P = 0.8). Further, we found a significant age-dependent decrease in microtubule density with aging in the control cases (P = 0.016). These findings suggest that reduction in microtubule assembly is not dependent on tau abnormalities of AD and aging.",Remaining

1949,35036927,Nature aging,Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Preserves Neuron Survival and Cognition in Alzheimer's Disease Models.,"Amyloid-induced neurodegeneration plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, we show that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) haploinsufficiency decreases BDNF and increases amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor in murine brain. Moreover, prior to disease onset, the TERT locus sustains accumulation of repressive epigenetic marks in murine and human AD neurons, implicating TERT repression in amyloid-induced neurodegeneration. To test the impact of sustained TERT expression on AD pathobiology, AD mouse models were engineered to maintain physiological levels of TERT in adult neurons, resulting in reduced Aβ accumulation, improved spine morphology, and preserved cognitive function. Mechanistically, integrated profiling revealed that TERT interacts with β-catenin and RNA polymerase II at gene promoters and upregulates gene networks governing synaptic signaling and learning processes. These TERT-directed transcriptional activities do not require its catalytic activity nor telomerase RNA. These findings provide genetic proof-of-concept for somatic TERT gene activation therapy in attenuating AD progression including cognitive decline.",Animal-other

The present series included 39 children (3-17 years of age) who underwent GKS for cerebral AVMs between January 2002 and February 2008. Twenty-five patients presented with hemorrhages. The median AVM volume was 1.5 cm³, and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy. All patients continued to have follow-up for more than 24 months with serial magnetic resonance images (MRIs)/angiograms. Current school performance has been evaluated using a telephone survey answered by the patients' parents.	Follow-up angiograms, available in 34 patients, confirmed complete obliteration in 16 patients. Serial MRIs indicated obliteration of the nidus in one of five patients without angiography. The diffuse nidus structure and low marginal dose were significantly associated with incomplete obliteration. Twelve patients underwent a second GKS, and subsequent angiographies, available in six patients, demonstrated complete obliteration in two of them. Complications included new-onset seizures (n = 1), apraxia (n = 1), and temporal horn entrapment requiring a shunt operation (n = 1). School performance declined in 14 out of 32 patients. Both the AVM volume and modified AVM score were found to be reliable predictors of school performance.	The results of the present study substantiate the diffuse and other atypical features of pediatric AVMs as major determinants of treatment failure following GKS. Considering the apparent declination of school performance, future prospective studies would be required to investigate the possible late-effects of GKS on neuropsychological function.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
1951,27480581,Critical reviews in biomedical engineering,Current Concepts in Sports-Related Concussion.,"Traumatic brain injury, specifically concussion, is prevalent in contact sports. In the United States (US) each year, 170 million adults participate in physical recreational activities, and 38 million children and adolescents participate in organized sports. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that in this group ~1.6 to 3.8 million concussions occur annually. Recent class-action lawsuits in the US filed by professional athletes against their respective leagues allege negligence in protecting them from concussions, and this has contributed to the attention received in the popular media. In response, concussion-related publications have increased exponentially during the past several years. Recent studies have challenged earlier assumptions that the effects of concussion are transient. Stronger links between concussion and neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease-like conditions, depression, and heightened risk for suicide are being elucidated. In this article, we explore the current knowledge on concussion, including pathophysiology, management, and long-term effects. We conclude that more evidence-based results regarding guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and return to play (RTP) are needed and should be the focus of future investigations. Attributing the etiology of certain neurodegenerative conditions to a history of concussion has been suggested in the current literature, but additional quantitative data regarding the pathophysiology and causality are needed as well. Bioengineers can have an important role in measuring the dynamic forces encountered during head impacts and their effects on the brain. These results can be effective in designing better helmets as well as improved playing surfaces to reduce the impact of such injuries. At this time, we believe that groups of people with heightened risk for concussion should be followed closely during longer periods of time and compared to matched controls. Such long-term studies are urgently needed to develop appropriate guidelines for safety and protect our young and adult athletes in the future.",Non-systematic-review

Results were as follows. 1) Significant differences were not observed between the lead-exposed rats and the controls regarding the developmental landmarks in both the Wistar rats and THA rats. Body weight of the exposed rats, however, were significantly less than that of the controls of the two rat strains. 2) Low rate of avoidance, slow acquisition of learning and large individual variabilities were exhibited in both the controls and the exposed rats of the Wistar strain throughout the test sessions. No significant difference was indicated between the controls and the exposed rats of the Wistar strain. In the control THA rats, avoidance learning was acquired rapidly, and a high level and very small individual variabilities of avoidance were demonstrated during the latter sessions of the test. Meanwhile, in the exposed THA rats, slow learning acquisition and large individual variabilities were displayed. It is thought that the learning impairment appearing in the THA exposed rats was induced primarily by lead.",Animal-other

It is performed in a shopping setting where there are items to be bought and information to be obtained. The execution time for the whole task was higher in patients with OCD compared to controls, suggesting that patients with OCD need more time in planning than controls. The same difference was found in the partial errors during the task. Furthermore, the mean rank for and for interpretation failures is higher for controls, while the values of divided attention and the of self correction seems to be lower in controls. We think that obsessive patients tend to work with greater diligence and observance of rules than controls. In conclusion, these results provide initial support for the feasibility of VMET as assessment tool of executive functions. Specifically, the significant correlation found between the VMET and the neuropsychological battery support the ecological validity of VMET as an instrument for the evaluation of executive functions in patients with OCD.",Remaining
1954,19884429,The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume,Thromboprophylaxis in patients with acute spinal injuries: an evidence-based analysis.,"The increased risk for venous thromboembolic events following spinal trauma is well established. The purpose of the present study was to examine the literature in order to determine the optimum thromboprophylaxis regimen for patients with acute spinal injuries with or without spinal cord injury.	EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched from the earliest available date to April 2008 for clinical trials comparing different methods of thromboprophylaxis in adult patients following acute spinal injuries (with or without spinal cord injury). Outcome measures included the prevalences of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treatment-related adverse events.	The search yielded 489 studies, but only twenty-one of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis was significantly lower in patients without spinal cord injury as compared with patients with spinal cord injury (odds ratio = 6.0; 95% confidence interval = 2.9 to 12.7). Patients with an acute spinal cord injury who were receiving oral anticoagulants had significantly fewer episodes of pulmonary embolism (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.01 to 0.63) than those who were not receiving oral anticoagulants (either untreated controls or patients managed with low-molecular-weight heparin). The start of thromboprophylaxis within the first two weeks after the injury resulted in significantly fewer deep-vein-thrombosis events than delayed initiation did (odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1 to 0.4). With regard to heparin-based pharmacoprophylaxis in patients with spinal trauma, low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduced the rates of deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding episodes in comparison with the findings in patients who received unfractionated heparin, with odds ratios of 2.6 (95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 5.6) and 7.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 58.4) for deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding, respectively.	The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis following a spine injury is higher among patients who have a spinal cord injury than among those who do not have a spinal cord injury. Therefore, thromboprophylaxis in these patients should start as early as possible once it is deemed safe in terms of potential bleeding complications. Within this population, low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis, with fewer bleeding complications, than unfractionated heparin is. The use of vitamin K antagonists appeared to be effective for the prevention of pulmonary embolism.",Human-systematic-review

These pharmacogenetics findings have been reported from independent cohorts of patients mostly treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressant, and mirtazapine. Tianeptine, an atypical antidepressant, recently identified as a mu opioid receptor agonist, which prevents and reverses the stress induced by glucocorticoids, has been investigated in this present pharmacogenetics study. More than 3200 Caucasian outpatients with a major depressive episode (MDE) from real-life settings were herein analyzed for clinical response to tianeptine, a treatment initiated from 79.5% of the subjects, during 6-8 weeks follow-up, assessing polymorphisms targeting four genes involved in the HPA axis (NR3C1, FKPB5, CRHR1, and AVPR1B). We found a significant association (p < 0.001) between CRHR1 gene variants rs878886 and rs16940665, or haplotype rs878886*C-rs16940665*T, and tianeptine antidepressant response and remission according to the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Analyses, including a structural equation model with simple mediation, suggest a moderate effect of sociodemographic characteristics and depressive disorder features on treatment response in individuals carrying the antidepressant responder allele rs8788861 (allele C). These findings suggest direct pharmacological consequences of CRHR1 polymorphisms in the antidepressant tianeptine response and remission, in MDE patients. This study replicates the association of the CRHR1 gene, involved in the HPA axis, with (1) a specificity attributed to treatment response, (2) a lower risk of chance finding, and in (3) an ecological situation.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention

Isotonitazene powder and purity determination was performed on the sample collected in the first death scene by NMR, HRMS, GC-FTIR, ATR-FTIR and GC-MS. Isotonitazene purity was determined by GC-MS analysis and proton NMR, and was defined to be above 95 % and 98 %, respectively.

The isotonitazene median concentration in femoral whole blood was 1.20ng/mL. Isotonitazene concentration in hair was similar or even lower compared to that seen in fentanyl abusers. Isotonitazene distribution in tissues converges in the brain, lungs and heart, respectively. Surprisingly, isotonitazene concentration in liver is the lowest measured for all tissues and fluids analyzed. Based on circumstantial evidence, autopsy findings and the results of the toxicological analysis, the medical examiner concluded that the cause of all three deaths was an acute intoxication with isotonitazene.

The present study investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of YC‑1 in cultured neurons exposed to glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity and in an animal model of stroke. In a cortical neuronal culture model, YC‑1 demonstrated neurotoxicity at a concentration >100 µM, and YC‑1 (10‑30 µM) achieved potent cytoprotection against glutamate‑induced neuronal damage. Additionally, YC‑1 (30 µM) effectively attenuated the increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Delayed treatment of YC‑1 (30 µM) also protected against glutamate‑induced neuronal damage and cell swelling in cultured neurons, though only at 4 h post‑treatment. In addition, immediate treatment of YC‑1 (30 µM) following the exposure of cortical neurons to glutamate (300 µM) produced a marked reduction in intracellular pH. Delayed treatment of YC‑1 (25 mg/kg) protected against ischemic brain damage in vivo, though only when administered at 3 h post‑insult. Thus, YC‑1 exhibited neuroprotection against glutamate-induced neuronal damage and in mice subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia. This neuroprotection may be mediated via its ability to limit the glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity. However, the neuroprotective therapeutic window of YC‑1 is only at 3 h in vivo and 4 h in vitro, which may, at least in part, be attributed to its ability to reduce the intracellular pH in the early phase of ischemic stroke. Although YC‑1 provided the potential for clinical therapy, the treatment time point must be carefully evaluated following ischemia.",Animal-drug-intervention
1961,32149692,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,Quantitative Assessment of Upper-Limb Motor Function for Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Based on Motor Synergy Analysis and Multi-Modality Fusion.,"Functional assessment is an essential part of rehabilitation protocols after stroke. Conventionally, the assessment process relies heavily on clinical experience and lacks quantitative analysis. In order to objectively quantify the upper-limb motor impairments in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis, this study proposes a novel assessment approach based on motor synergy quantification and multi-modality fusion. Fifteen post-stroke hemiparetic patients and fifteen age-matched healthy persons participated in this study. During different goal-directed tasks, kinematic data and surface electromyography(sEMG) signals were synchronously collected from these participants, and then motor features extracted from each modal data could be fed into the respective local classifiers. In addition, kinematic synergies and muscle synergies were quantified by principal component analysis (PCA) and k weighted angular similarity (k WAS) algorithm to provide in-depth analysis of the coactivated features responsible for observable movement impairments. By integrating the outputs of local classifiers and the quantification results of motor synergies, ensemble classifiers can be created to generate quantitative assessment for different modalities separately. In order to further exploit the complementarity between the evaluation results at kinematic and muscular levels, a multi-modal fusion scheme was developed to comprehensively analyze the upper-limb motor function and generate a probability-based function score. Under the proposed assessment framework, three types of machine learning methods were employed to search the optimal performance of each classifier. Experimental results demonstrated that the classification accuracy was respectively improved by 4.86% and 2.78% when the analysis of kinematic and muscle synergies was embedded in the assessment system, and could be further enhanced to 96.06% by fusing the characteristics derived from different modalities. Furthermore, the assessment result of multi-modality fusion framework exhibited a significant correlation with the score of standard clinical tests (R = - 0.87, P = 1.98e - 5). These promising results show the feasibility of applying the proposed method to clinical assessments for post-stroke hemiparetic patients.",Remaining

The latter feature is noted to be identical to the alien hand sign as described in the left arm of commissurotomized patients and patients with callosal neoplasm or infarction.

1966,6106665,Journal of the neurological sciences,Regional tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase concentrations in the brains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis-infected mice.,"The neurotransmitter biosynthesis enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase were investigated in selected brain areas of Nya : NYLAR mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. Statistically significant alterations in the concentrations of both enzymes occurred in the olfactory, caudate, and neocortical regions at 5 days postinfection. No such alterations occurred in mice given cytoxan (150 mg/kg) 3 days postinfection and examined 5 days postinfection. At 10 days postinfection, however, the cytoxan-treated animals had significantly altered enzyme concentrations in the olfactory region, though not in the caudate or neocortex. This alteration appeared to be transitory, since it was not found in cytoxan-treated animals 60 days postinfection. A possible explanation is that virus production or interference in a brain region cycles over a period of hours or days. Still undetermined is whether these neurochemical changes are a primary effect of the virus or a secondary effect due to the immune response. It is noteworthy that cytoxan caused a marked increase in the enzyme activities studied in most of the brain areas.",Animal-other

Of the later, 13 had severe obstructions of the extracranial portion of the carotid artery, four had obstruction of the intracranial portion, and five had severe aortic valve insufficiency (AI), with more than 60% regurgitation in all cases. Measurements could be performed within an accuracy of about +/- 20% under clinical conditions and revealed perfusion values of 5 to 8 ml per second (300 to 480 ml per minute) in healthy persons. Of the patients, values less than 3 ml per second (180 ml per minute) were detected in nine, between 3 and 5 mm per second (180 to 300 ml per minute) in four, and normal values in another four, while significant backflow was observed only in patients with severe AI. Consecutive blood flow profiles were recorded every 4 msec; these demonstratedthat, for a period lasting from 40 msec to 280 msec after the initial systolic peak, blood flow decelerated more rapidly in the central portion of the vessel lumen than near the wall. This situation was present in all healthy persons and in most patients with pathological flow. In patients with AI, flow reinversion from reverse to normal began near the vessel wall, while in the middle third of the vessel lumen, blood was still flowing backward. These phenomena seem to be in agreement with the theoretical and experimental findings of Wormersly, Müller, and others. The AI patients who underwent artificial valve implantation were studied ten days after operation and showed no or little backflow in the common carotid artery at that time.",Remaining

It has been proposed that patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have larger motor units (MUs) than normals by MU number estimation and macro electromyography techniques. In this study, an experimental setup for scanning electromyography was built to investigate electrophysiologic cross-sections of the MU territories in 9 patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, 3 patients with spinal muscular atrophy, and 10 healthy volunteers. Scanning electromyography was performed on the biceps brachii muscle. For each MU, three-dimensional maps of the MU territories were plotted. The length of MU cross-section and the maximum amplitude of each MU were measured from these maps and compared among the three groups of subjects. Like spinal muscular atrophy patients, patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy had significantly larger MU territories than normal controls.",Remaining
1969,33863723,Science advances,"Netrin-1 receptor UNC5C cleavage by active δ-secretase enhances neurodegeneration, promoting Alzheimer's disease pathologies.","Netrin-1, a family member of laminin-related secreted proteins, mediates axon guidance and cell migration during neural development. T835M mutation in netrin receptor UNC5C predisposes to the late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases neuronal cell death. However, it remains unclear how this receptor is molecularly regulated in AD. Here, we show that δ-secretase selectively cleaves UNC5C and escalates its proapoptotic activity, facilitating neurodegeneration in AD. Netrin deficiency activates δ-secretase that specifically cuts UNC5C at N467 and N547 residues and enhances subsequent caspase-3 activation, additively augmenting neuronal cell death. Blockade of δ-secretase cleavage of UNC5C diminishes T835M mutant's proapoptotic activity. Viral expression of δ-secretase-truncated UNC5C fragments into APP/PS1 mice strongly accelerates AD pathologies, impairing learning and memory. Conversely, deletion of UNC5C from netrin-1-depleted mice attenuates AD pathologies and rescues cognitive disorders. Hence, δ-secretase truncates UNC5C and elevates its neurotoxicity, contributing to AD pathogenesis.",Animal-other

The interference of xanthone derivatives with acetylcholinesterase and other molecular targets and cellular mechanisms associated with AD have been recently systematically reported. Therefore, we report xanthones with anticholinesterase, monoamine oxidase and amyloid β aggregation inhibitory activities as well as antioxidant properties, emphasizing xanthone derivatives with dual/multitarget activity as potential agents to treat AD. We also propose the structural features for these activities that may guide the design of new, more effective xanthone derivatives. [Formula: see text].",Non-systematic-review

Challenge by a narcotic antagonist produced no signs of physical dependence. Dependence was not seen after long-term morphine infusions into the ventral tegmentum but was seen after similar infusions into the periventricular gray region. Thus a major rewarding property of morphine is independent of the drug's ability to produce physical dependence. These data challenge models of drug addiction that propose physical dependence as necessary for the rewarding effects of opioids.,Animal-drug-intervention

Their levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease, but data concerning cerebrovascular disease are lacking. The objective of our study was to investigate the role of adrenal sex steroids in a female population suffering an acute stroke. We addressed the question of whether their levels are associated with disease severity and prognosis. A 2-year cohort study was performed in 2 tertiary hospitals, where we prospectively studied 302 consecutive postmenopausal female patients hospitalized for an acute stroke. Neurological severity on admission was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; and handicap 1 month after stroke, with the modified Rankin Scale. Δ4-androstenedione levels were positively and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was inversely associated with stroke severity (r = 0.142, P = .014 and r = -0.153, P = .008, respectively), and both parameters remained as significant determinants even after entering other confounders in the multivariate model (r = 0.118, P = .039 and r = -0.150, P = .011, respectively). Levels of Δ4-androstenedione were significantly associated with 1-month mortality in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals: 1.540 [1.107-2.138)], P = .010). Δ4-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were associated with poor outcome in the univariate analysis, that is, combined severe handicap (modified Rankin Scale ≥4) and death, 1 month poststroke, although this was not significant in the multivariate analysis. Adrenal sex steroids, and especially Δ4-androstenedione, are significantly associated with stroke severity on admission and short-term prognosis among female stroke subjects.

In 2005, 47 laboratory-confirmed and probable clinical cases of SLEV infection were reported in Córdoba, Argentina. Although the causes of 2005 outbreak remain unknown, they might be related not only to virological factors, but also to ecological and environmental conditions. We hypothesized that one of the factors for SLE reemergence in Córdoba, Argentina, was the introduction of a new SLEV genotype (SLEV genotype III), with no previous activity in the area. In order to evaluate this hypothesis we carried out a molecular characterization of SLEV detections from mosquitoes collected between 2001 and 2004 in Córdoba city. A total of 315 mosquito pools (11,002 individuals) including 12 mosquitoes species were analyzed. Overall, 20 pools (8 mosquitoes species) were positive for SLEV. During this study, genotypes II, V and VII were detected. No mosquito pool infected with genotype III was detected before the 2005 outbreak. Genotype V was found every year and in the 8 sampled sites. Genotypes II and VII showed limited temporal and spatial activities. We cannot dismiss the association of genotype II and V as etiological agents during the outbreak. However, the silent circulation of other SLEV strains in Córdoba city before the 2005 outbreak suggests that the introduction of genotype III was an important factor associated to this event. Not mutually exclusive, other factors such as changes in avian hosts and mosquitoes vectors communities, driven by climatic and environmental modifications, should also be taken into consideration in further studies.",Remaining
1974,23176747,European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Dysregulated 5-HT(2A) receptor binding in postmortem frontal cortex of schizophrenic subjects.,"Previous postmortem and neuroimaging studies have repeatedly suggested alterations in serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor (5-HT(2A)R) binding associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. These studies were performed with ligands, such as ketanserin, altanserin and LSD, that may bind with high-affinity to different structural or functional conformations of the 5-HT(2A)R. Interpretation of results may also be confounded by chronic antipsychotic treatment and suicidal behavior in the schizophrenia group. We quantified 5-HT(2A)R density by radioligand binding assays in postmortem prefrontal cortex of antipsychotic-free (n=29) and antipsychotic-treated (n=16) schizophrenics, suicide victims with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=13), and individually matched controls. [[3]H]Ketanserin binding, and its displacement by altanserin or the LSD-like agonist DOI, was assayed. Results indicate that the number of [[3]H]ketanserin binding sites to the 5-HT(2A)R was increased in antipsychotic-free (128 ± 11%), but not in antipsychotic-treated (92 ± 12%), schizophrenic subjects. In suicide victims, [[3]H]ketanserin binding did not differ as compared to controls. Aging correlated negatively with [[3]H]ketanserin binding in schizophrenia, suicide victims and controls. The fraction of high-affinity sites of DOI displacing [[3]H]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT(2A)R was increased in antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects. Functional uncoupling of heterotrimeric G proteins led to increased fraction of high-affinity sites of altanserin displacing [[3]H]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT(2A)R in schizophrenic subjects, but not in controls. Together, these results suggest that the active conformation of the 5-HT(2A)R is up-regulated in prefrontal cortex of antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects, and may provide a pharmacological explanation for discordant findings previously obtained.",Remaining

Children's affect dysregulation at 24 and 36 months was defined in the context of mother-child interactions in semistructured play and toy cleanup. Dyads were classified as dysregulated at each age based on high negative affect. Affect dysregulation was associated with less maternal sensitivity and stimulation, more maternal depressive symptoms, and lower family income over the first 36 months of life. Children with early negative mood, lower Bayley Mental Development Index scores and insecure-avoidant (15 months) or insecure-resistant attachment classifications (36 months) were more likely to be in an affect-dysregulated group. Controlling for family and child variables, affect-dysregulated children had more problematic cognitive, social, and behavioral outcomes at 54 months, kindergarten, and first grade. The findings are discussed in terms of the early role played by parents in assisting children with affect regulation, the reciprocal nature of parent-child interactions, and the contribution of affect regulation to children's later cognitive, social, and behavioral competence.",Remaining

Seven patients with refractory chronic cluster headache underwent high spatial and angular resolution diffusion MRI preoperatively. MRI-guided and MRI-verified electrode implantation was performed unilaterally in 5 patients and bilaterally in 2. Volumes of tissue activation were generated around active lead contacts with a finite-element model. Twelve months after surgery, voxel-based morphometry was used to identify voxels associated with higher reduction in headache load. Probabilistic tractography was used to identify the brain connectivity of the activation volumes in responders, defined as patients with a reduction of ≥30% in headache load.	There was no surgical morbidity. Average follow-up was 34 ± 14 months. Patients showed reductions of 76 ± 33% in headache load, 46 ± 41% in attack severity, 58 ± 41% in headache frequency, and 51 ± 46% in attack duration at the last follow-up. Six patients responded to treatment. Greatest reduction in headache load was associated with activation in an area cantered at 6 mm lateral, 2 mm posterior, and 1 mm inferior to the midcommissural point of the third ventricle. Average responders' activation volume lay on the trigeminohypothalamic tract, connecting the trigeminal system and other brainstem nuclei associated with nociception and pain modulation with the hypothalamus, and the prefrontal and mesial temporal areas.	We identify the optimal stimulation site and structural connectivity of the deep brain stimulation target for cluster headache, explicating possible mechanisms of action and disease pathophysiology.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention
1978,22851280,"Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I alter hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission in young and old rats.,"In rats, as in humans, normal aging is characterized by a decline in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as in glutamatergic function. Both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels have been reported to decrease with age, and treatment with either GH or IGF-I can ameliorate age-related cognitive decline. Interestingly, acute GH and IGF-I treatments enhance glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus of juvenile animals. However, whether this enhancement also occurs in old rats, when cognitive impairment is ameliorated by GH and IGF-I (des-IGF-I), remains to be determined. To address this issue, we used an in vitro CA1 hippocampal slice preparation and extracellular recording techniques to study the effects of acute application of GH and IGF-I on compound field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), as well as AMPA- and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs, in young adult (10 months) and old (28 months) rats. The results indicated that both GH and IGF-I increased compound-, AMPA-, and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs to a similar extent in slices from both age groups and that this augmentation was likely mediated via a postsynaptic mechanism. Initial characterization of the signaling cascades underlying these effects revealed that the GH-induced enhancement was not mediated by the JAK2 signaling element in either young adult or old rats but that the IGF-I-induced enhancement involved a PI3K-mediated mechanism in old, but not young adults. The present findings are consistent with a role for a GH- or IGF-I-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission in mitigating age-related cognitive impairment in old rats.",Animal-drug-intervention

It was found that 75% of the HD patients had pathologically slow saccades. This number rose to 87% if other oculomotor deficits were included. Thus a small, but definite number of HD patients had normal eye movements. This included patients with disease durations of more than 14 years. A comparison with the results of clinical and evoked potential studies on these patients showed that they were clinically only mildly affected but did not form a different group of HD patients. Subjects at risk had statistically (P less than 0.01) slower horizontal saccades (average 427 deg/sec) than the controls (455 deg/sec). For 11% of the subjects at risk horizontal saccade velocity was pathological and altogether 22% had some oculomotor deficits. Subjects with pathological slow horizontal saccades also had a high incidence (64%) of pathological evoked potentials. Thus, subjects with pathological slow horizontal saccades can be considered to have a high risk of developing the clinical symptoms of HD.",Remaining

Moreover, approximately 23 percent of Americans over age 85 reside in long-term care facilities, and institutionalization is an important risk factor for disordered sleep and for sedative hypnotic prescription.

1983,23265360,Medical hypotheses,Angiotensin receptor blockers for bipolar disorder.,"Studies have suggested that the brain renin angiotensin system (RAS) regulates cerebral flow, autonomic and hormonal systems, stress, innate immune response and behavior, being implicated in several brain disorders such as major depression, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R) is distributed in brain regions responsible for the control of stress response through peripheral and central sympathetic hyperactivation as well as in the hypothalamic paraventricular region, areas known for the release of several neurotransmitters related to inflammatory response facilitation. This relationship leads to the assumption that AT1R might be the receptor most related to the central deleterious actions of angiotensin II. New evidences from clinical studies have shown a possible role for RAS in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BD), a multifactorial disorder with acknowledged presence of neuronal damage via oxidative stress in brain areas such as hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum. Given the studies highlighting AT1R activation as a central pro-inflammatory pathway and, conversely, the involvement of inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of BD; this paper hypothesizes the use of AT1R antagonists for BD management and prevention of its neuroprogression, due to their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.",Non-systematic-review

Serum from 9 of 19 patients with the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and from 2 of 6 patients with the familial form caused a reduction in the proportion of sprouting terminal axons, as compared with that found in muscles treated with serum from controls or diabetic patients. Immunoglobulin from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, when tested on immunoblots, recognized a 56-kilodalton protein secreted by denervated rat diaphragm muscle; rabbit antiserum raised against this protein also suppressed terminal axonal sprouting. Thus, we have detected an antibody in the serum of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that inhibits sprouting of neurons and subsequent reinnervation of skeletal muscle. Whether this antibody is of primary pathogenic importance or represents a secondary response to neuromuscular destruction is not known. In either case, serum from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may provide reagents for studies of the trophic communications between muscle and motor neurons.",In-vitro-study

Our goal was to compare serum BDNF levels in inpatients with alcohol or crack cocaine use disorders during the early withdrawal period, and to evaluate the association with substance-related outcomes. We performed a follow-up study with 101 men under detoxification treatment (drug preference: alcohol [n = 37] and crack cocaine [n = 64]). Blood samples were collected on the 1st and 15th days of hospitalization to measure serum BDNF levels. Serum BDNF levels increased during the early stage of withdrawal (28.2 ± 10.0 vs. 32.6 ± 13.3, p < 0.001), similarly in individuals with alcohol and crack cocaine use. In the alcohol group, BDNF levels on the 15th day of hospitalization were negatively correlated with age (r = -0.394, p = 0.023). Delta BDNF levels were also negatively correlated with BDNF on the 1st day of hospitalization (p = 0.011). No significant correlation was found regarding substance-related outcomes. This is the first study to compare BDNF levels in alcohol and crack cocaine users undergoing similar treatment conditions. These findings could be related to clinical improvement after abstinence or even to drug withdrawal itself, decreasing neuronal injury. Furthermore, age may be a crucial factor, hindering the recovery of neuroplasticity in alcohol users.",Remaining

Parents indicated in a free response format that 'immaturity' and 'small size' were the reasons for retention. The present follow-up study obtained academic achievement data on 47 of the 56 short children from the Holmes et al.

Results indicated that despite repeating a year in the primary grades, the group of retained children were still functioning 6 months below grade expectation, compared to grade appropriate achievement in the never-retained group. Parents and teachers were both accurate in their perceptions of children's academic achievement. Behavioural ratings by teachers indicated more adjustment difficulties for retained children, while parent ratings of behaviour showed a similar high level of problems for short children regardless of retention status. Although both groups of children possessed average intellectual abilities, the retained children obtained lower IQ scores than the never retained children.

An improved automated iterative-self-organizing-data-analysis-algorithm (ISODATA) was developed to dynamically track ischemic tissue fate on a pixel-by-pixel basis during the acute phase. ISODATA-resolved clusters were overlaid on the CBF-ADC scatterplots and image spaces. Tissue volume ADC, and CBF of each ISODATA cluster were derived. In contrast to the single-cluster normal left hemisphere (ADC = 0.74 +/- 0.02 x 10(-3) mm2/s, CBF = 1.36 +/- 0.22 mL g(-1)min(-1), mean +/- SD, n = 8), the right ischemic hemisphere exhibited three ISODATA clusters, namely: 'normal' (normal ADC and CBF), 'ischemic core' (low CBF and ADC), and at-risk 'perfusion-diffusion mismatch' (low CBF but normal ADC). At 180 minutes, the mismatch disappeared in five rats (Group I, 180-minute 'core' lesion volume = 255 +/- 62 mm3 and 24-hour infarct volume = 253 +/- 55 mm3, P > 0.05), while a substantial mismatch persisted in three rats (Group II, 180-minute CBF-abnormal volume = 198 +/- 7 mm3 and 24-hour infarct volume 148 +/- 18 mm3, P < 0.05). The CBF (0.3 +/- 0.09 mL g(-1)min(-1)) of the 'persistent mismatch' (Group II, 0.3 +/- 0.09 mL g(-1)min(-1)) was above the CBF viability threshold (0.2 to 0.3 mL g(-1)min(-1)) throughout and its ADC (0.70 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) mm2/s) did not decrease as ischemia progressed. In contrast, the CBF (0.08 +/- 0.03 mL g(-1)min(-1)) of the analogous brain region in Group I was below the CBF viability threshold, and its ADC gradually decreased from 0.63 +/- 0.05 to 0.43 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) mm2/s (ADC viability threshold = 0.53 +/- 0.02 x 10(-3) mm2/s). The modified ISODATA analysis of the ADC and CBF tissue characteristics during the acute phase could provide a useful and unbiased means to characterize and predict tissue fates in ischemic brain injury and to monitor therapeutic intervention.",Animal-other
1989,15291713,The American journal of orthopsychiatry,Use of patient and hospital variables in interpreting patient satisfaction data for performance improvement purposes.,"Satisfaction scores of 349 patients being discharged from a state psychiatric hospital were examined in relation to available norms for the instrument used and selected patient and hospital variables. Mean item scores fell within the less-than-satisfied category on both total and factor scores. Regression analyses indicated minimal effects of patient attributes. Two hospital factors (restraint rate on patient's unit and accessibility of psychosocial groups) significantly predicted satisfaction, with the former having an unexpected positive relationship to satisfaction. Clinicians were able to use the survey data to improve care, but patients' tendency toward undifferentiated positive or negative responding hindered the prioritizing of change efforts.",Remaining
1990,33211254,Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,Effectiveness and Safety of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in an Asian Population with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Dialysis: A Population-Based Cohort Study and Meta-Analysis.,"Whether direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are more effective and safer than warfarin among Asian patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) undergoing dialysis remains unclear.	We first compared the risks of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (IS/SE) and major bleeding associated with DOACs compared with warfarin, in NVAF Asians undergoing dialysis using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (Aim 1). Next, we searched PubMed and Medline from January 1, 2010 until January 31, 2020, to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational real-world studies comparing DOACs with warfarin specifically focused on NVAF patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis (Aim 2). Finally, we tested the hypothesis whether AF patients undergoing dialysis treated with OACs (warfarin and DOACs) would be associated with lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes as compared to those without OACs using the Taiwan NHIRD (Aim 3).	From June 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, a total of 3237 and 9263 NVAF patients comorbid with ESRD receiving oral anticoagulant (OACs) (490 on DOAC, 2747 on warfarin) or no OACs, respectively, were enrolled. Propensity score matching was used to balance covariates across the study groups. For the comparison of DOAC vs. warfarin (Aim 1), DOACs had comparable risks of IS/SE and major bleeding to warfarin in our present cohort. From the original 85 results retrieved, nine studies (including our study) with a total of 6490 and 22,494 patients treated with DOACs and warfarin were included in the meta-analysis, respectively. There were 5343 (82%) and 20,337 (90%) patients treated with DOACs and warfarin undergoing dialysis, respectively. The pooled meta-analysis also indicated no difference of the effectiveness (HR:0.90; [95%CI:0.74-1.10]; P = 0.32) and safety outcomes (HR:0.75; [95%CI:0.54-1.05]; P = 0.09) between DOACs and warfarin (Aim 2). For the comparison of OAC (+) vs. OAC (-) (Aim 3), OAC-treatment was associated with a higher risk of IS/SE (hazard ratio (HR):1.54; [95% confidential interval (CI):1.29-1.84];P < 0.0001) and comparable risk of major bleeding compared to those without OAC treatment.	DOACs did not provide benefit over warfarin regarding effectiveness and safety in AF patients undergoing dialysis. The use of OAC was not associated with a lower risk of IS/SE in ESRD AF patients when compared to those without OAC use.",Human-systematic-review
1991,7565833,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,Cervical dystonia due to spinal cord ependymoma: involvement of cervical cord segments in the pathogenesis of dystonia.,"We report a patient with a progressive motor disorder dominated by pyramidal signs in all four extremities and cervical dystonia in the form of torticollis, who had imaging features of cervical cord tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Ependymoma was the final diagnosis by histology. Cervical dystonia presenting as a manifestation of an identified focal central nervous system (CNS) lesion is infrequent. We believe our patient to be the first adult example of cervical cord tumor giving rise to cervical dystonia. Adding this entity to the list of differential diagnosis of torticollis is considered, and its mechanisms are discussed.",Human-case-report
1992,8689350,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse in the uterine cervix.,"Extramedullary relapse outside the testes and CNS is rare in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We describe a case of a recurrence of ALL in the uterine cervix during hematopoietic remission.	Primary recurrence in the uterine cervix was diagnosed by cytology with immunochemistry 43 months after initial diagnosis. She was successfully treated with systemic chemotherapy, without hysterectomy or irradiation. She remains in second complete remission 54 months after relapse.	Immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against cell surface antigens made the cytologic diagnosis of leukemic relapse in the uterine cervix possible. Systemic chemotherapy is the first treatment of choice for ALL recurrence in the genital tract in a patient without poor prognostic factors in order to spare gonadal function and reproductive potential.",Human-case-report
1993,33771822,BMJ open,Predictors of controlled prescription drug non-medical and lifetime use among patients accessing public mental health services in Uganda: a cross-sectional study.,"We determined the prevalence of controlled prescription drug (CPD) non-medical and lifetime use and their predictors among patients at three public psychiatric clinics in Uganda to identify missed care opportunities, enhanced screening priorities, and drug control needs.	A cross-sectional survey of 1275 patients was performed from November to December 2018. Interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaires, desk review guide and urine drug assays were employed. Questionnaire recorded CPD non-medical and illicit drug use history from patients' files, CPD lifetime use and risk factors. Desk review guide recorded recently prescribed drugs in patients' files to corroborate with urine assays. Predictors were analysed by multivariate logistic regression.	From desk review, 145 (11.4%) patients had history of CPD non-medical use and 36 (2.8%) had used illicit drugs. Of 988 patients who provided urine, 166 (16.8%) self-medicated CPDs, particularly benzodiazepines while 12 (1.2%) used illicit drugs. Of those with drug-positive urine, 123 (69.1%) had no documented history of CPD non-medical and illicit drug use. Being an inpatient (OR=10.90, p<0.001) was independently associated with CPD non-medical use. Additionally, being an inpatient (OR=8.29, p<0.001) and tobacco consumption (OR=1.85, p=0.041) were associated with CPD non-medical and illicit drug use combined. Among participants, 119 (9.3%) reported CPD lifetime use, and this was independently associated with education level (OR=2.71, p<0.001) and history of treatment for substance abuse (OR=2.08, p=0.018).	CPD non-medical use is common among Uganda's psychiatric patients, and more prevalent than illicit drug use. Rapid diagnostic assays may be needed in psychiatric care in resource limited settings. It is necessary to assess how CPD non-medical use impacts mental care outcomes and patient safety. High risk groups like inpatients and tobacco consumers should be prioritised in psychiatric screening.",Remaining
1994,21550668,Journal of affective disorders,Cortical thickness and VBM-DARTEL in late-life depression.,"Numerous studies have revealed structural brain changes in late life depression, mainly in white matter or whole lobes with few focussing just on grey matter (GM). The objective was to investigate GM changes in older depressed and similar aged healthy subjects using two different methods, cortical thickness in frontal lobe structures and voxel-based morphometry (VBM).	Sixty eight subjects participated (30 healthy comparison subjects, 38 depressed) and underwent 3T T1 MR imaging as well as clinical and cognitive assessments. Frontal cortical thickness was measured using FreeSurfer while VBM was undertaken using the DARTEL algorithm in SPM8. Group differences in cortical thickness and GM volumes were assessed using ANCOVA. Effects of cortical thickness and VBM results on cognitive and depression variables were also investigated.	No significant differences in frontal lobe cortical thickness were observed between groups (F(1, 62) ≤ 2.7, p ≥ 0.1). In addition, no significant relationships of cortical thickness on cognitive and depression scores were identified (partial correlation |r'|=0.01-0.31, p ≥ 0.06). VBM showed that GM volumes were indistinguishable between groups but significant age effects were apparent, independent of diagnosis.	Results suggest that cortical GM changes in late life depression (LLD) are similar to healthy older subjects and appear to be related to age rather than cognitive or depressive symptoms. Changes to white matter and subcortical GM structures may be more relevant in explaining the underlying neurobiology of LLD.",Remaining
1995,25237937,Neurology India,Tale of two diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were independently described in clinical and pathological details more than a century ago. Recent breakthrough discoveries identifying common genes that are causal to either ALS or FTD or an overlapping ALS-FTD syndrome have dramatically transformed our view regarding their pathogenesis. Most recently, a massive hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion mutation in C9orf72 gene has been linked to the majority of familial ALS, FTD and mixed ALS-FTD cases. C9orf72 and other genes causal to ALS and FTD are consistently associated with the formation of cellular RNA inclusions and protein aggregates. This article summarizes the recently reported ALS-FTD-linked genes and the emerging common unifying mechanism in the pathogenesis of ALS-FTD spectrum disorders along with a comment on the potential new therapeutic targets in these hitherto incurable diseases.",Non-systematic-review
