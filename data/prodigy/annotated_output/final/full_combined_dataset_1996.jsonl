Disturbances develop after the child has already achieved the capacity for language comprehension and verbal expression. Brain trauma is most often the cause. The clinical picture of the disorder varies over different age groups and, in contrast to adults, shows no consistent typology. In most of the cases there exists a disturbance of speech production; problems with writing and comprehension are seen less often (although comprehension of language is primarily affected in the Landau-Kleffner syndrome). Only once and a while logorrhoea and jargon can be diagnosed. Besides the speech and language disorders cognitive, motor und emotional problems may appear. Therefore, several diagnostic levels have to be considered (e.g. clinical neurology, neuropsychology, psychophysiology, psychopathology). Course and prognosis of the acquired aphasia in childhood (30% longterm difficulties) depend on several factors like etiology and extension of the lesion, the development of the functional hemispheric dominance for language and the initial recovery velocity after the symptoms appeared. The plasticity of the child's brain is a source for compensating mechanisms which might be triggered by three aspects of therapeutic activities which should be used synchronously: speech and language training, principles of psychotherapy and social medicine and treatment of additional disorders.", "accepted_label": ["Non-systematic-review"]}

Early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), West syndrome, late infantile epileptic encephalopathy, and Lennox-Gastaut are four epilepsy syndromes. These epilepsies are also among the most severe with dire consequences including intractable seizures and severe cognitive dysfunction. These epilepsies share several important characteristics: diverse causes; severe and frequent seizures; diffusely abnormal background activity on electroencephalograms that is often profound; medical intractability; and severe consequences for a normal development. Ohtahara proposed that these epilepsies exist on an electroclinical spectrum and that the clinical and electroencephalogram features are dependent on the maturation of the nervous system. One can now add Late Infantile Epileptogenic Encephalopathy (LIEE) or epilepsy with late-onset of epileptic spasms. Recently, similar gene mutations have been found in several different epilepsy syndromes, reinforcing the notion that these epilepsies are not likely to be distinguished based on cause alone. Recognition and accurate classification of these severe epilepsies is important as the first step toward improving treatment and outcomes.", "accepted_label": ["Non-systematic-review"]}

Most of these syndromes are relatively subtle and have to be ascertained using recordings, because other brain areas may largely take over the function of a damaged area. Anterior cortical, posterior cortical, large and bilateral cortical, subcortical and degenerative cerebral lesions are successively reviewed. In the anterior part of the cerebral hemisphere, the frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), i.e. area 46 of Brodmann, control eye movements. The FEF appears to be principally involved in the control of intentional saccades, in particular those made with a retinotopic reference system, and in smooth pursuit. The SEF could control saccades made with a spatiotopic reference system, and sequences of saccades (requiring a temporal working memory). The PFC could control the inhibition of unwanted reflexive saccades, and be involved in spatial memory used for programming all types of memory-guided saccades. In the posterior part of the cerebral hemisphere, the parietal eye field (PEF) is involved in the triggering of reflexive visually guided saccades, and the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas in smooth pursuit. Acute and large unilateral lesions usually result in transitory ipsilateral conjugate eye deviation. Bilateral lesions affecting both the FEF and the PEF result in severe saccade and smooth-pursuit paresis, whereas bilateral posterior temporoparietal lesions result in Balint's syndrome, consisting of both eye movement and visual-attention abnormalities. Subcortical lesions also result in various eye movement abnormalities, which have been little documented to date. Lastly, degenerative cerebral diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration result in more or less severe eye movement disturbances. Eye movement recordings may contribute to early differential diagnosis of some of these degenerative diseases.", "accepted_label": []}

However, few studies have examined this topic in youth. Thus, we aimed to examine the association of lithium and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), the first-line antimanic medications for youth with BD, with neurocognition in a relatively large sample of youth with BD. Methods: Participants included 91 youth with BD-I, -II, or -Not Otherwise Specified, aged 13-20 years (n = 14 current lithium use, n = 51 current SGA use). We examined four tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery: Intra/Extra Dimensional Set-Shifting Task (IED), Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP), Stockings of Cambridge Test (SOC), and Affective Go/No-Go (AGN). Within-sample Z-scores were computed, and a global neurocognitive composite score and g factor derived from these tests comprised the primary outcomes. Multivariable analyses controlled for age, sex, and IQ. Results: Current lithium use was significantly associated with poorer cognitive flexibility/set-shifting (IED). After further controlling for lifetime comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and current depression symptoms in sensitivity analyses, the lithium finding was no longer significant. Current SGA use was significantly associated with greater affective processing bias (AGN). No significant findings survived correction for multiple comparisons. All other cognitive outcomes were not significantly associated with current lithium use, current SGA use, or total number of current medications. Conclusions: Treatment with lithium or SGAs was associated with minimal neurocognitive impairments, with small effect sizes in primary multivariable analyses.

While the current study cannot rule out associations of smaller effect size, present findings suggest that leading mood-stabilizing medications are not associated with frank neurocognitive impairments in youth with BD.", "accepted_label": ["Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"]}

Schizophrenic patients had significantly lower plasma folate concentrations after adjustment for Hcy levels, and elevated RBC folate levels compared to controls. Vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and Hcy levels did not differ from control values. Plasma folate levels below the 10th percentile of controls were associated with an approximate 4-7-fold (before and after adjustment of folate levels for Hcy, respectively) risk of having schizophrenia.

A total of 29 paraphilic men who underwent a comprehensive psychiatric, medical, and legal evaluation and were eligible for treatment with MPA were followed naturalistically while receiving concurrent MPA and group therapy. The principal outcome measures were data obtained from a weekly self-reported psychosexual inventory that quantified five dimensions of deviant and nondeviant sexual activities and testosterone levels that were drawn pretreatment and after three and six months of MPA. Self-reported data were analyzed by nonparametric methods. Because MPA's effectiveness is evident early in treatment, we report on data from the first six months. Subjects reported a differential rate of suppression of sexual activities, a median of up to two weeks for deviant and 2 to 10 weeks for nondeviant behaviors (p < or = .01 for each of the five dimensions).

MPA safely and effectively reduced sex drive, controlled deviant sexual impulses and behavior, and lowered the testosterone levels of these paraphilic men during the first six months of treatment. However, the relative rapidity and completeness of the response raises questions regarding possible distortions in self-reported sexual activities.

Because one-third of men over the age of 50 will develop LUTS and a recent study showed ED in 62% of patients presenting for LUTS, the importance of determining the mechanistic link between these two pathologies is clear. Using a rabbit model of partial bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO), a primary cause of LUTS, we have identified an increased basal corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM) tone associated with an elevated level of smooth muscle myosin (SMM) phosphorylation in PBOO compared with sham-operated control rabbits (sham). Results from in vitro kinase and phosphatase assays using purified smooth muscle myosin showed increased kinase and decreased phosphatase activities in cellular extracts from corpora cavernosa isolated from PBOO compared with sham rabbits. Increased Rho-kinase expression in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits was suggested by the observations that Rho-kinase inhibitors attenuated the increased kinase activity and were less effective in relaxing CCSM strips from PBOO vs. sham rabbits. This hypothesis was then confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, which demonstrated increased expression of both isoforms of Rho-kinase (ROKalpha and ROKbeta). Increased SMM basal phosphorylation (necessary for SM contraction) in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits, mediated via an increase in Rho-kinase expression/activity, would be expected to make the CCSM more difficult to relax (necessary for erection), which suggests that the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway as being involved in the mechanism for LUTS-associated ED.", "accepted_label": ["Animal-other"]}

Therefore, we performed a study in 12 patients with high-grade glioma, where we directly compared the two currently most promising techniques, namely the MR-based relative oxygen extraction fraction (MR-rOEF) and the PET hypoxia marker H-1-(3-[[18] F]-fluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)-2-nitroimidazole ([[18] F]-FMISO). MR-rOEF was determined from separate measurements of T2 , T2 * and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) employing a multi-parametric approach for quantification of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect. With respect to [[18] F]-FMISO-PET, besides the commonly used late uptake between 120 and 130 min ([[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min), we also analyzed the hypoxia specific uptake rate [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , as obtained by pharmacokinetic modeling of dynamic uptake data. Since pharmacokinetic modeling of partially acquired dynamic [[18] F]-FMISO data was sensitive to a low signal-to-noise-ratio, analysis was restricted to high-uptake tumor regions. Individual spatial analyses of deoxygenation and hypoxia-related parameter maps revealed that high MR-rOEF values clustered in (edematous) peritumoral tissue, while areas with high [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min concentrated in and around active tumor with disrupted blood-brain barrier, i.e. contrast enhancement in T1 -weighted MRI. Volume-of-interest-based correlations between MR-rOEF and [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min as well as [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , and voxel-wise analyses in individual patients, yielded limited correlations, supporting the notion that [[18] F]-FMISO uptake, even after 2 h, might still be influenced by perfusion while [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 was severely hampered by noise. According to these results, vascular deoxygenation, as measured by MR-rOEF, and severe tissue hypoxia, as measured by [[18] F]-FMISO, show a poor spatial correspondence. Overall, the two methods appear to rather provide complementary than redundant information about high-grade glioma biology.", "accepted_label": ["Remaining"]}

However, because of the lack of comprehensive data on the spontaneous background neuropathology of the C57BL/6J strain, discriminating between naturally occurring changes and lesions caused by experimental mutations can be challenging. In this context, this study aims at defining the spectrum and frequency of spontaneous brain changes in a large cohort of C57BL/6J mice and their association with specific biological variables, including age and sex. Brains from 203 experimentally naive and clinically unremarkable C57BL/6J mice were collected and analyzed by means of histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Mice ranged in age from 3 to 110 weeks with 89 females, 111 males, and 3 unknowns. Sixteen different spontaneous lesion categories were described in this cohort. Age-related neurodegenerative and/or neuroinflammatory findings represented the most common pathologic changes and included (1) Hirano-like inclusions in the thalamic neurons, (2) neuroaxonal dystrophy in the medulla oblongata, (3) periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular deposits in the neuropil of the hippocampus, and (4) progressive neuroinflammation characterized by microgliosis and astrogliosis. Neoplastic conditions, developmental abnormalities, and circulatory disorders were rarely observed incidental findings. In conclusion, this study describes spontaneous age-related brain lesions of the C57BL/6J mouse and provides a reference for evaluating and interpreting the neuropathological phenotype in genetically engineered mouse models developed and maintained on this congenic background.", "accepted_label": ["Animal-other"]}

Well-controlled laboratory studies have provided insights regarding the underlying mechanisms. Several large prospective studies suggest that these sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes. Obstructive sleep apnea, which combines sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia, is a major risk factor for insulin resistance and possibly diabetes. Whether glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients can be improved by treating sleep apnea remains controversial. Recently, sleep disturbances during pregnancy and their relationship to gestational diabetes and hyperglycemia have received considerable attention owing to potential adverse effects on maternal and fetal health. Additionally, evidence from animal models has identified disruption of the circadian system as a putative risk factor for adverse metabolic outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current state of knowledge linking sleep disturbances, circadian dysfunction, and glucose metabolism.

In step 2 (intervention search), needs assessment information guided the search for an evidence-based intervention suitable for adaptation to athletes. In steps 3 and 4 (intervention development), the identified intervention was adapted and feedback sought from athletes and sport professionals.

Their roles in CNS integrity and functions under pathological conditions remain largely unknown. Until recently, BAMs and microglia could not be unequivocally distinguished due to expression of common macrophage markers. We investigated the transcriptional profiles of immunosorted BAMs from rat sham-operated and ischemic brains using RNA sequencing. We found that BAMs express the distinct transcriptional signature than microglia and infiltrating macrophages. The enrichment of functional groups associated with the cell cycle in CD163[+] cells isolated 3 days after the ischemic injury indicates the proliferative capacity of these cells. The increased number of CD163[+] cells 3 days post-ischemia was corroborated by flow cytometry and detecting the increased number of CD163[+] cells positive for a proliferation marker Ki67 at perivascular spaces. CD163[+] cells in the ischemic brains up-regulated many inflammatory genes and parenchymal CD163+ cells expressed iNOS, which indicates acquisition of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. In mice, BAMs typically express CD206 and we found a subset of these cells expressing CD169. Chimeric mice generated by transplanting bone marrow of donor Cx3cr1[gfp]CCR2[rfp] mice to wild type hosts showed an increased number of CX3CR1[+]CD169[+] perivascular macrophages 3 days post-ischemia. Furthermore, these cells accumulated in the brain parenchyma and we detected replacement of perivascular macrophages by peripheral monocytic cells in the sub-acute phase of stroke. In line with the animal results, post-mortem brain samples from human ischemic stroke cases showed time-dependent accumulation of CD163[+] cells in the ischemic parenchyma.

Three of these factors (Nogo-A, oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, myelin-associated glycoprotein) bind to a common receptor: the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1). NgR1 is expressed mainly on neurons and is usually associated in a trimolecular complex. The second member of the complex, LINGO-1, is often connected to NgR1 function and is further found to function independently as a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation. The third member of the NgR complex is either the p75 neurotrophin receptor, TROY, or an as yet unidentified co-receptor. Targeting of factors contained in this complex has been described to lead to the promotion of neurite outgrowth, oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation and inhibition of cell death.

Whether the progressive growth of brain metastases depends on neovascularisation is not clear. Immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses show that the density of blood vessels within experimental metastases in the brains of nude mice, or within brain metastases derived from human lung cancer, is lower than in the adjacent, tumour-free brain parenchyma. However, blood vessels associated with brain metastases are dilated and contain many dividing endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis also reveals that tumour cells located less than 100 microm from a blood vessel are viable, whereas more distant tumour cells undergo apoptosis. The blood-brain barrier is intact in and around experimental brain metastases smaller than 0.25 mm in diameter, but is leaky in larger metastases.

However, both share as major genetic risk factor a C9orf72 locus intronic hexanucleotide expansion. The pathogenic pathways associated with the expansion-dependent neuronal toxicity are still poorly understood. Recent efforts to identify common threads of neuronal dysfunction have pointed towards deficits of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis and loss of nucleolar integrity, a condition known as nucleolar stress that is an emerging shared feature among neurodegenerative diseases. Intriguingly, the C9orf72 mutation in ALS-FTD interferes with the function of the nucleolus by transcripts and dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced by the hexanucleotide expansion. Experimental discrepancies have given rise to different hypotheses with regard to the connection of C9orf72 and nucleolar activity. In this review, we present and discuss emerging concepts concerning the impact of C9orf72 expansion on nucleolar biology. Moreover, we discuss the 'nucleolar stress hypothesis,' according to which nucleolar malfunction accompanies, exacerbates, or potentially triggers a degenerative phenotype. Upcoming awareness of the involvement of nucleolar stress in C9orf72 ALS-FTD could shed light into its pathogenesis, enabling potential treatment options aimed at shielding an 'Achilles' heel' of neurons.", "accepted_label": ["Non-systematic-review"]}

After decades of intense studies, \u03b1-Synuclein physiology is still difficult to clear up due to its interaction with multiple partners and its involvement in a pletora of neuronal functions. Here, we looked at the remarkably neglected interplay between \u03b1-Synuclein and microtubules, which potentially impacts on synaptic functionality. In order to identify the mechanisms underlying these actions, we investigated the interaction between purified \u03b1-Synuclein and tubulin. We demonstrated that \u03b1-Synuclein binds to microtubules and tubulin \u03b12\u03b22 tetramer; the latter interaction inducing the formation of helical segment(s) in the \u03b1-Synuclein polypeptide. This structural change seems to enable \u03b1-Synuclein to promote microtubule nucleation and to enhance microtubule growth rate and catastrophe frequency, both in vitro and in cell. We also showed that Parkinson's disease-linked \u03b1-Synuclein variants do not undergo tubulin-induced folding and cause tubulin aggregation rather than polymerization. Our data enable us to propose \u03b1-Synuclein as a novel, foldable, microtubule-dynamase, which influences microtubule organisation through its binding to tubulin and its regulating effects on microtubule nucleation and dynamics.", "accepted_label": ["In-vitro-study"]}

Mitochondria and the phenomenon of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), which marks the point of no return in cell death cascades, have special value in this regard. It is important that the vulnerability to MPT-inducing factors is increased with aging. Simultaneously, a decrease in the calcium retention capacity of mitochondria is developed, which leads to the disturbance of the functional activity of neurons.\tThe systematic investigations and web content related to the importance of MPT as the target for the search of neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing drugs, especially with multitargeted action, are reviewed.\tHere, we have highlighted some experimental data that determines the importance of mitochondria for the search of neuroprotective drugs, and drugs with multitargeted action.

In experiments on rodents, hypothermia in the postischemic period that is introduced up to several hours after reperfusion and is maintained for one day followed by a slow rewarming, significantly protects hippocampal neurons against damage. The mode of action of hypothermia is apparently non-specific and multi-focal in widely progressing cascade reactions in ischemic cells; namely, suppressing: (1) glutamate surge followed by; (2) intraneuronal calcium mobilization; (3) sustained activation of glutamate receptors; (4) dysfunction of blood brain barrier; (5) proliferation of microglial cells; and (6) production of superoxide anions and nitric oxide. In addition, mild hypothermia modulates processes in ischemic condition at the level of cell nucleus, such as the binding of transcription factor AP-1 to DNA, and ameliorates the depression of protein synthesis. This non-specific and widely affecting manner might explain why hypothermia is superior to any medicine developed. Recent clinical trials of mild hypothermia in various individual institutions have revealed significantly beneficial outcomes in some cases, along with an accumulation of practical knowledge of techniques and treatments.

Amino acid composition and sequence analyses of purified FA2 revealed identity to the amino acid sequence of the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human type I procollagen. Gel filtration of AF as well as purified FA2 demonstrated two molecular forms of FA2, which during gel filtration were elucidated corresponding to MW of approximately 100 kDa and 30 kDa. The molecular forms were referred to as the high molecular component (FA2-HM) and low molecular component (FA2-LM), respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis (reducing and nonreducing conditions) showed a MW of 27 kDa for both FA2-HM and FA2-LM. Mass spectrometry analysis however revealed a MW of 14.343 +/- 3Da. Proteins with collagenous domains often reveal aberrant behaviour both in gel filtration and SDS-PAGE and this phenomenon may account for the apparent higher MW of FA2 observed using these techniques compared to mass spectrometry and amino acid composition/sequence analyses. A polyclonal, monospecific rabbit antibody raised against FA2 was used in immunohistochemical localization studies. Due to the obvious association of FA2 to the BM structure in adult and fetal skin, it was initially referred to as a BM associated component. However, FA2 was immunologically distinct from the well established BM components and moreover, the diffuse distribution of FA2 along the BM differed from linear localization of BM components (e.g. collagen type IV and laminin). The identification of FA2 as the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human procollagen type I has the implication that in the immunohistochemical investigations the anti-FA2 may not distinguish between the free propeptide and procollagen type I. In the papillary dermal region of human adult skin type I collagen are arranged in loose fibrils to which the aminoterminal propeptide is still attached. Anti-FA2 may recognize epitopes in the type I procollagen present in this region, giving rise to the diffuse FA2 distribution along the BM. However, whether FA2 also appear as a free component in this region is unknown. In fetal skin where collagen is vividly layed down in the mesenchymal compartment staining with anti-FA2 revealed a diffuse mesenchymal distribution.

A unique clinical entity, 'perverse modes of relatedness,' lies on the extreme end of the spectrum, representing the reification of the relationship as it becomes little more than a vehicle to take possession and control one's object for the gratification of one's sole needs and desires.

Using data from UK Biobank (N=408 228; 38-71 years), we selected genetic variants as instruments for MAP and PP at age \u226455 and >55 years and across age deciles. We applied multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses to explore associations with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and their subtypes. Higher genetically predicted MAP was associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage across the examined age spectrum.

Although panic buying has a long history, there is a lack of literature to provide a psychological understanding of the phenomenon. During the early days of COVID-19 clients presented with fear and uncertainty. These negative emotions were, in part, a response to a real shortage of basic supplies. However, the panic response led to behaviors that, for some individuals, resulted in atypical buying patterns. From a therapeutic perspective, one can consider behavioral and psychodynamic explanations and interventions, and how this impacts the associated behaviors.

Histone acetylation has been shown to be a key process in sevoflurane-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities. Here, we investigated whether histone acetylation regulates the interaction between autophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome in models of sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Aged C57BL/6 J mice and cultured primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 2 h. Hippocampal tissue samples and hippocampal neurons were harvested. The processes of histone acetylation and autophagy and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome were observed using western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in both the mouse hippocampus and primary neurons. Concomitantly, sevoflurane upregulated components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and IL-1\u03b2) by promoting autophagic degradation in the aging brain. Cognitive deficits and inadequate autophagy induced by sevoflurane were reversed and NLRP3 inflammasome activation was inhibited by SAHA. Treatment with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, eliminated the neuroprotective effects of SAHA on improving cognition in mice, activating autophagy and downregulating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Based on these results, histone acetylation activates autophagy plays an important role in inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome to protect the host from excessive neuroinflammation and sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction in the aging brain.", "accepted_label": ["Animal-drug-intervention"]}

In this study we investigated functional connectivity changes in MS using resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Data from 34 MS patients and 28 age and gender-matched controls was assessed using synchronization likelihood (SL) as a measure of functional interaction strength between brain regions, and graph analysis to characterize topological patterns of connectivity changes. Cognition was assessed using extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Structural measures included brain and lesion volumes, using MRI. Results show SL increases in MS patients in theta, lower alpha and beta bands, with decreases in the upper alpha band. Graph analysis revealed a more regular topology in the lower alpha band in patients, indicated by an increased path length (\u03bb) and clustering coefficient (\u03b3). Attention and working memory domains were impaired, with decreased brain volumes. A stepwise linear regression model using clinical, MRI and MEG parameters as predictors revealed that only increases in lower alpha band \u03b3 predicted impaired cognition. Cognitive impairments and related altered connectivity patterns were found to be especially predominant in male patients. These results show specific functional changes in MS as measured with MEG.

HD patients develop progressive motor dysfunction and psychiatric disturbances with gradual dementia. HD is caused by a pathological expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene that codifies for a protein called huntingtin (Htt), which principal function is not completely understood. Accumulative evidence shows that this pathological expansion modifies Htt function affecting different neuronal targets, including mitochondrial function which is an important factor that contributes to HD. Interestingly, several groups have shown mitochondrial disturbances including calcium handling defects, depolarization, decrease of mitochondrial transport, ATP reduction, and increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cellular and murine HD models. Systematic analysis of this evidence indicates that a mitochondrial structure, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), could be responsible for these changes that affect mitochondria. The mPTP plays an important role in apoptosis and neurodegeneration. It has also been reported to have some physiological functions in heart development and synaptic communication. In HD, the presence of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) activates this mechanism producing a significant compromise of mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetics. Considering these findings this review explores the evidence that suggests the important role of mPTP in the mitochondrial impairment induced by mHtt, which leads to calcium derangement and contributes to neuronal dysfunction in HD.", "accepted_label": ["Non-systematic-review"]}

Of the 7 botulinum neurotoxin serotypes, botulinum neurotoxin type A (onabotulinumtoxinA) has been the most thoroughly investigated in preclinical and clinical studies.

In addition to the well-documented myorelaxant effects of this neurotoxin, onabotulinumtoxinA can exert a direct analgesic effect that likely involves inhibition of primary and secondary nociceptive neurons. The inhibitory effects of onabotulinumtoxinA are also likely to involve suppressing the activity of myogenic trigger points and decreasing the persistent nociceptive barrage that promotes and maintains central sensitization.

Associations between Severity of Dependence Scale for khat use (SDS-khat) screening status, use patterns, and khat-related psychological and physical health problems were assessed using multivariate loglinked Poisson regression controlling for potential sociodemographic confounders.\tOverall, 44.2% (n = 23) of the study participants screened positive on the SDS-khat, indicating probable khat dependence. Screening positive for khat dependence was associated with increased risk for khat use frequency in the last 30 days (adjusted prevalence risk ratio [APRR] = 2.26, 95% CI [1.23, 4.15], p = .009), experiencing three or more psychological health problems (APRR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.04, 3.36], p = .037), and experiencing two or more physical health problems (APRR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.13, 3.27], p = .016) after using khat.\tScreening positive on the SDS-khat is associated with increased recent khat use frequency and elevated physical and psychological health problems, providing preliminary evidence that probable khat use dependence may be associated with an increased risk of harm in Australia. Furthermore, these preliminary results support the potential utility of the SDS-khat to healthcare providers to identify those at risk for khatrelated harms.

Its clinical use has expanded to control of seizures, by pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS), and is finding new purpose as an analgesic alternative and antidepressant. Ketamine brings hope for effective management of chronic pain in the absence of opioids and decreasing suicidal ideations; however, its persistence as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic properties remains. In the wake of expanding medicinal purposes, the diversity of New York City's population was explored to better understand its misuse. This retrospective study looks at the prevalence of ketamine in driver fatalities over a period of 18 years (2003-2020) and cases involving suspected driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) over a period of 6 years (2015-2020). Ketamine was identified in 6 driver fatalities and in 47 DUID cases. None of the driver fatalities were suspected of ketamine misuse, due to administration either in hospital or by EMS. In the DUID cases, an increasing trend was observed over the 6-year study period with 100% (n = 47) of the cases confirmed as non-hospital/non-EMS administered ketamine. Of the DUID cases, 94% were male with the majority between the age of 21 and 39 years (85%) and were predominantly Hispanic (36%) and Asian (34%). Blood concentrations of ketamine ranged from 27 to >2000 ng/mL with polydrug use prevalent. The most common drug classes detected in addition to ketamine were cannabinoids (38%), ethanol (32%), benzodiazepines (26%), cocaine (19%) and amphetamines/3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (15%). In 2019, 2-fluoro-deschloroketamine was identified in two cases for the first time. Despite its increased acceptance for mental health disorders, ketamine's persistence and misuse as a recreational drug remains and should continue to be monitored by relevant toxicological, clinical and law enforcement communities along with emerging illicit ketamine analogs.", "accepted_label": ["Remaining"]}

In practice, those situations include very different cases and it seems obvious that this is a polyfactorial disorder, no single factor alone being sufficient to account for all the difficulties experienced by the children. It would therefore be simplistic to consider the ADHD as issued only from a neurobiological disorder and to consider a drug treatment, only.

It is a complex condition that develops over many decades in the human brain. For such apparently intractable diseases, mathematical models can offer an additional means of investigation. As a contribution to this process, the authors have developed an ordinary differential equation model of the most important cellular processes that have been associated with PD. The model describes the following processes: (i) cellular generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species; (ii) the possible damage and removal of the protein -synuclein and, (iii) feedback interactions between damaged \u03b1-synuclein and reactive oxygen species. Simulation results show that the Parkinsonian condition, with elevated oxidative stress and misfolded \u03b1-synuclein accumulation, can be induced in the model by known PD risk factors such as ageing, exposure to toxins and genetic defects. The significant outcome of the paper is the demonstration that it is possible to reproduce in silico the multi-factorial interactions that characterise the pathogenesis of PD. As such, the model provides a systematic explanation of the variability and heterogeneity of PD and provides the basis for computational studies of further facets of this complex multi-factorial condition.

The ability to look beyond the lumen using highly developed vessel wall imaging methods to identify plaque vulnerable to disruption has prompted an active debate as to whether a paradigm shift is needed to move away from relying on measurements of luminal stenosis for gauging the risk of ischemic injury. Further evaluation in randomized clinical trials will help to better define the exact role of plaque imaging in clinical decision-making.

However, there are reasons to believe that TDM may play a useful role in maximising the therapeutic potential of new anticonvulsants. In fact, these drugs have a narrow therapeutic index, careful individualisation of dosage to optimise response is required, and inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic variability may translate into differences in dosage requirements. The wide interindividual variability in the serum concentrations at which therapeutic and toxic effects of these drugs are observed does not necessarily imply that TDM cannot be useful: indeed, a marked pharmacodynamic variability has also been reported for all the currently monitored older anticonvulsants. The new anticonvulsants which, based on their properties, are particularly attractive candidates for TDM include lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, zonisamide and felbamate. However, in the absence on sound information on the target concentration ranges of these drugs, the routine concentration monitoring of these drugs cannot be recommended. Despite this, serial measurements of serum drug concentrations may be useful in selected patients, especially those suspected of poor compliance and those in whom pharmacokinetic changes caused by disease or administration of concomitant medication are anticipated. Even in the presence of marked interindividual pharmacodynamic variability, it is often possible to empirically determine the concentration at which each patient exhibits the best response, and apply that information in subsequent management. Prospective studies, using preferably a randomised concentration-controlled design, are necessary to better characterise concentration-effect relationships for these agents.", "accepted_label": ["Non-systematic-review"]}

Recent studies have shown that IDUs are often exposed to viral infections relatively early in the course of injection, highlighting the importance of understanding this initiation process for both epidemiology and prevention. Epidemiologic evidence similarly suggests that at least some youth populations, most notably young men who have sex with men (YMSM), are at substantial risk for exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) from early sexual activity. Despite the importance of this issue for both epidemiology and prevention, however, surprisingly little information is available on the social course of injection initiation, including the individual, social, or ecological factors that might mitigate or exacerbate transmission risks within the critical phase of early injection drug use. Similarly, we know little about the ways that YMSM and other high-risk youth understand risk, the kinds of exchanges and relationships in which they participate in the context of initiating sexual activity, or how drug use is operant in these exchanges and early sexual experiences.

Common polymorphisms involved in the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) and 2 (TPH2), serotonin transporter, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated in a naturalistic inpatient study of the German research network on depression. We compared patients showing TESI with non-TESI suicidal patients and with non-suicidal patients using univariate tests to detect relevant factors, which were further tested in logistic regression and CART (Classification and Regression Trees) analyses. Of the 269 patients, TESI occurred in 22 patients (17 female), 117 patients were defined as non-TESI suicidal patients, and 130 patients were classified as non-suicidal. When comparing cases with both control groups we found the TPH2 rs1386494 (C/T) polymorphism to be moderately associated with TESI (Univariate tests: TESI vs. non-suicidality: p=0.005; adjusted: p=0.09; TESI vs. non-TESI suicidal patients: p=0.0024; adjusted: p=0.086). This polymorphism remained the only significant genetic factor in addition to clinical predictors in logistic regression and CART analyses. CART analyses suggested interactions with several clinical predictors. Haplotype analyses further supported a contribution of this polymorphism in TESI. The TPH2 rs1386494 (C/T) polymorphism might contribute to the genetic background of TESI. This polymorphism has been previously associated with committed suicide and major depressive disorder. The small number of cases warrants replication in larger patient samples.

The aim of the current study is to investigate brain activation during self- and other-reflection in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In addition, we examined whether potential abnormal brain activation in BD patients could distinguish BD from patients with schizophrenia (SZ).\tDuring functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 17 BD patients, 17 SZ patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs) performed a self-reflection task. The task consisted of sentences divided into three conditions: self-reflection, other-reflection and semantic control.\tBD patients showed less activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) extending to the precuneus during other-reflection compared to HCs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028 FWE corrected on cluster-level within the regions of interest). In SZ patients, the level of activation in this area was in between BD patients and HCs, with no significant differences between patients with SZ and BD. There were no group differences in brain activation during self-reflection. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the PCC/precuneus activation during other-reflection and cognitive insight in SZ patients, but not in BD patients.\tBD patients showed less activation in the PCC/precuneus during other-reflection. This may support an account of impaired integration of emotion and memory (evaluation of past and current other-related information) in BD patients. Correlation differences of the PCC/precuneus activation with the cognitive insight in patients with BD and SZ might reflect an important difference between these disorders, which may help to further explore potentially distinguishing markers.", "accepted_label": ["Remaining"]}

This specific arm swing pattern during walking has shown to have a beneficial effect on gait as it reduces walking energy cost and optimizes balance. In several patient populations the arm movements can be directly affected (e.g. in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI)), which in turn has a negative effect on their gait pattern, balance and energy cost of walking.\tIn December 2019, Kahn et al. published a paper in JNER concerning the quantification of upper limb associated reactions (ARs) during walking in people with ABI. ARs are defined as 'an effort-dependent phenomenon causing an involuntary increase in upper limb muscle tone, with awkward and uncomfortable postures'. These upper limb ARs appear often in patients with ABI and can have an important effect on their gait. The authors calculated kinematic measures using three-dimensional gait analysis relating to range of motion, variability and mean position over the gait cycle for the different upper limb joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist) during self-selected steady-state walking. Based on differences they found between an ABI cohort and healthy control cohort, the authors concluded that they were able to quantify ARs during walking in this population. This calculation, however, is not specific for upper limb ARs. In fact, the authors calculated general measures of arm posture (e.g. mean position over the gait cycle) or arm movement (e.g. range of motion and variability) during gait. Previous research has already indicated that other factors than ARs can influence the posture or movement of the arm during gait in patients with brain injury, such as voluntary compensations for gait instability and contractures or spasticity of upper arm muscles. Yet, it is not possible to disentangle the different causes of the altered arm posture during steady-state walking based on the proposed measures.\tThe kinematic arm measures proposed by Kahn et al. (J Neuroeng Rehabil 16(1):160, 2019) are not a direct measure of ARs, but provide a quantification of overall deviation of arm posture or movement during gait. Depending on the specific study design these measures may provide insights in ARs.", "accepted_label": ["Non-systematic-review"]}

Using an ischemic rodent model, the authors sought to determine (a) if estrogen replacement increases postischemic platelet reactivity, (b) if changes in estrogen status alter intraplatelet endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) synthesis, and (c) if estrogen-mediated effects on platelets alter cerebral blood flow during reperfusion. Intact (I), ovariectomized (OVX), and OVX + 17 beta-estradiol (E50) rats were subjected to 30 min of forebrain ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. Using the platelet activation marker P-selectin, postischemic platelet reactivity was quantified by flow cytometry. In a separate cohort (I, OVX, E50), the authors quantified platelet eNOS by Western blot. Another cohort (OVX, E50) was subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, and cerebral blood flow was determined using the iodoantipyrine technique. Collagen-stimulated platelet P-selectin expression was increased in the OVX rats at 60 min of reperfusion, and this effect was reversed by estrogen treatment. No differences in platelet eNOS expression were detected among groups. Cerebral blood flow at 60 min reperfusion was comparable between the OVX and the E50 rats. The authors conclude that during reper-fusion, estrogen deficiency increases postischemic platelet sensitivity to stimuli in estrogen-deficient rats. Estrogen treatment mitigates effects of estrogen loss on platelets, but this early effect is apparently not caused by intraplatelet eNOS depression. Neither estrogen deficiency nor estrogen treatment changes early postischemic regional brain blood flow. In this rodent global cerebral ischemic model, physiologic doses of estrogen are not deleterious to platelet reactivity and may initially reduce postischemic platelet reactivity.", "accepted_label": ["Animal-drug-intervention"]}

The specimen group was made up of 141 pupils, approximately 20 pupils from each year level. The short-term goal was to influence positive change in participants demonstrating risk seeking behaviour. The long-term goal was to enhance the respective school's programs to enable preventative approaches to lessen negative and risk seeking behaviours amongst pupils with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders. The research results demonstrate statistically significant success of the applied program in two measured variables. Firstly, learning success (p < 0.05), and secondly a decrease in truancy and disciplinary misdemeanours (p < 0.05). Both of which were observed in participants with behavioural problems. The program was not as successful for participants with behavioural disorders, but not without some effect. Although the program can be generally described as achieving a medium level of success, the fact that there was a lack of progressive worsening in participant's behaviour is a substantial bi-product of the program. The mentors involved in the program made it extremely clear by their feedback that, MYMP positively enhanced their formal Pedagogy training, through hands-on practise that they otherwise would not have received through their academic programs.

Here, we show that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) haploinsufficiency decreases BDNF and increases amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) precursor in murine brain. Moreover, prior to disease onset, the TERT locus sustains accumulation of repressive epigenetic marks in murine and human AD neurons, implicating TERT repression in amyloid-induced neurodegeneration. To test the impact of sustained TERT expression on AD pathobiology, AD mouse models were engineered to maintain physiological levels of TERT in adult neurons, resulting in reduced A\u03b2 accumulation, improved spine morphology, and preserved cognitive function. Mechanistically, integrated profiling revealed that TERT interacts with \u03b2-catenin and RNA polymerase II at gene promoters and upregulates gene networks governing synaptic signaling and learning processes. These TERT-directed transcriptional activities do not require its catalytic activity nor telomerase RNA. These findings provide genetic proof-of-concept for somatic TERT gene activation therapy in attenuating AD progression including cognitive decline.", "accepted_label": ["Animal-other"]}

In the United States (US) each year, 170 million adults participate in physical recreational activities, and 38 million children and adolescents participate in organized sports. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that in this group ~1.6 to 3.8 million concussions occur annually. Recent class-action lawsuits in the US filed by professional athletes against their respective leagues allege negligence in protecting them from concussions, and this has contributed to the attention received in the popular media. In response, concussion-related publications have increased exponentially during the past several years. Recent studies have challenged earlier assumptions that the effects of concussion are transient. Stronger links between concussion and neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease-like conditions, depression, and heightened risk for suicide are being elucidated. In this article, we explore the current knowledge on concussion, including pathophysiology, management, and long-term effects. We conclude that more evidence-based results regarding guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and return to play (RTP) are needed and should be the focus of future investigations. Attributing the etiology of certain neurodegenerative conditions to a history of concussion has been suggested in the current literature, but additional quantitative data regarding the pathophysiology and causality are needed as well. Bioengineers can have an important role in measuring the dynamic forces encountered during head impacts and their effects on the brain. These results can be effective in designing better helmets as well as improved playing surfaces to reduce the impact of such injuries. At this time, we believe that groups of people with heightened risk for concussion should be followed closely during longer periods of time and compared to matched controls. Such long-term studies are urgently needed to develop appropriate guidelines for safety and protect our young and adult athletes in the future.", "accepted_label": ["Non-systematic-review"]}

The purpose of the present study was to examine the literature in order to determine the optimum thromboprophylaxis regimen for patients with acute spinal injuries with or without spinal cord injury.\tEMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched from the earliest available date to April 2008 for clinical trials comparing different methods of thromboprophylaxis in adult patients following acute spinal injuries (with or without spinal cord injury). Outcome measures included the prevalences of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treatment-related adverse events.\tThe search yielded 489 studies, but only twenty-one of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis was significantly lower in patients without spinal cord injury as compared with patients with spinal cord injury (odds ratio = 6.0; 95% confidence interval = 2.9 to 12.7). Patients with an acute spinal cord injury who were receiving oral anticoagulants had significantly fewer episodes of pulmonary embolism (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.01 to 0.63) than those who were not receiving oral anticoagulants (either untreated controls or patients managed with low-molecular-weight heparin). The start of thromboprophylaxis within the first two weeks after the injury resulted in significantly fewer deep-vein-thrombosis events than delayed initiation did (odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1 to 0.4). With regard to heparin-based pharmacoprophylaxis in patients with spinal trauma, low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduced the rates of deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding episodes in comparison with the findings in patients who received unfractionated heparin, with odds ratios of 2.6 (95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 5.6) and 7.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 58.4) for deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding, respectively.\tThe prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis following a spine injury is higher among patients who have a spinal cord injury than among those who do not have a spinal cord injury. Therefore, thromboprophylaxis in these patients should start as early as possible once it is deemed safe in terms of potential bleeding complications. Within this population, low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis, with fewer bleeding complications, than unfractionated heparin is.

Conventionally, the assessment process relies heavily on clinical experience and lacks quantitative analysis. In order to objectively quantify the upper-limb motor impairments in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis, this study proposes a novel assessment approach based on motor synergy quantification and multi-modality fusion. Fifteen post-stroke hemiparetic patients and fifteen age-matched healthy persons participated in this study. During different goal-directed tasks, kinematic data and surface electromyography(sEMG) signals were synchronously collected from these participants, and then motor features extracted from each modal data could be fed into the respective local classifiers. In addition, kinematic synergies and muscle synergies were quantified by principal component analysis (PCA) and k weighted angular similarity (k WAS) algorithm to provide in-depth analysis of the coactivated features responsible for observable movement impairments. By integrating the outputs of local classifiers and the quantification results of motor synergies, ensemble classifiers can be created to generate quantitative assessment for different modalities separately. In order to further exploit the complementarity between the evaluation results at kinematic and muscular levels, a multi-modal fusion scheme was developed to comprehensively analyze the upper-limb motor function and generate a probability-based function score. Under the proposed assessment framework, three types of machine learning methods were employed to search the optimal performance of each classifier. Experimental results demonstrated that the classification accuracy was respectively improved by 4.86% and 2.78% when the analysis of kinematic and muscle synergies was embedded in the assessment system, and could be further enhanced to 96.06% by fusing the characteristics derived from different modalities. Furthermore, the assessment result of multi-modality fusion framework exhibited a significant correlation with the score of standard clinical tests (R = - 0.87, P = 1.98e - 5). These promising results show the feasibility of applying the proposed method to clinical assessments for post-stroke hemiparetic patients.", "accepted_label": ["Remaining"]}

Here, we show that \u03b4-secretase selectively cleaves UNC5C and escalates its proapoptotic activity, facilitating neurodegeneration in AD. Netrin deficiency activates \u03b4-secretase that specifically cuts UNC5C at N467 and N547 residues and enhances subsequent caspase-3 activation, additively augmenting neuronal cell death. Blockade of \u03b4-secretase cleavage of UNC5C diminishes T835M mutant's proapoptotic activity.

Thus a major rewarding property of morphine is independent of the drug's ability to produce physical dependence.

The objective of our study was to investigate the role of adrenal sex steroids in a female population suffering an acute stroke. We addressed the question of whether their levels are associated with disease severity and prognosis. A 2-year cohort study was performed in 2 tertiary hospitals, where we prospectively studied 302 consecutive postmenopausal female patients hospitalized for an acute stroke. Neurological severity on admission was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; and handicap 1 month after stroke, with the modified Rankin Scale. \u03944-androstenedione levels were positively and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was inversely associated with stroke severity (r = 0.142, P = .014 and r = -0.153, P = .008, respectively), and both parameters remained as significant determinants even after entering other confounders in the multivariate model (r = 0.118, P = .039 and r = -0.150, P = .011, respectively). Levels of \u03944-androstenedione were significantly associated with 1-month mortality in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals: 1.540 [1.107-2.138)], P = .010). \u03944-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were associated with poor outcome in the univariate analysis, that is, combined severe handicap (modified Rankin Scale \u22654) and death, 1 month poststroke, although this was not significant in the multivariate analysis. Adrenal sex steroids, and especially \u03944-androstenedione, are significantly associated with stroke severity on admission and short-term prognosis among female stroke subjects.

In 2005, 47 laboratory-confirmed and probable clinical cases of SLEV infection were reported in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. Although the causes of 2005 outbreak remain unknown, they might be related not only to virological factors, but also to ecological and environmental conditions. We hypothesized that one of the factors for SLE reemergence in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, was the introduction of a new SLEV genotype (SLEV genotype III), with no previous activity in the area. In order to evaluate this hypothesis we carried out a molecular characterization of SLEV detections from mosquitoes collected between 2001 and 2004 in C\u00f3rdoba city. A total of 315 mosquito pools (11,002 individuals) including 12 mosquitoes species were analyzed. Overall, 20 pools (8 mosquitoes species) were positive for SLEV. During this study, genotypes II, V and VII were detected. No mosquito pool infected with genotype III was detected before the 2005 outbreak. Genotype V was found every year and in the 8 sampled sites. Genotypes II and VII showed limited temporal and spatial activities. We cannot dismiss the association of genotype II and V as etiological agents during the outbreak. However, the silent circulation of other SLEV strains in C\u00f3rdoba city before the 2005 outbreak suggests that the introduction of genotype III was an important factor associated to this event. Not mutually exclusive, other factors such as changes in avian hosts and mosquitoes vectors communities, driven by climatic and environmental modifications, should also be taken into consideration in further studies.", "accepted_label": ["Remaining"]}

These studies were performed with ligands, such as ketanserin, altanserin and LSD, that may bind with high-affinity to different structural or functional conformations of the 5-HT(2A)R. Interpretation of results may also be confounded by chronic antipsychotic treatment and suicidal behavior in the schizophrenia group. We quantified 5-HT(2A)R density by radioligand binding assays in postmortem prefrontal cortex of antipsychotic-free (n=29) and antipsychotic-treated (n=16) schizophrenics, suicide victims with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=13), and individually matched controls. [[3]H]Ketanserin binding, and its displacement by altanserin or the LSD-like agonist DOI, was assayed. Results indicate that the number of [[3]H]ketanserin binding sites to the 5-HT(2A)R was increased in antipsychotic-free (128 \u00b1 11%), but not in antipsychotic-treated (92 \u00b1 12%), schizophrenic subjects. In suicide victims, [[3]H]ketanserin binding did not differ as compared to controls. Aging correlated negatively with [[3]H]ketanserin binding in schizophrenia, suicide victims and controls. The fraction of high-affinity sites of DOI displacing [[3]H]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT(2A)R was increased in antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects. Functional uncoupling of heterotrimeric G proteins led to increased fraction of high-affinity sites of altanserin displacing [[3]H]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT(2A)R in schizophrenic subjects, but not in controls. Together, these results suggest that the active conformation of the 5-HT(2A)R is up-regulated in prefrontal cortex of antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects, and may provide a pharmacological explanation for discordant findings previously obtained.", "accepted_label": ["Remaining"]}

Both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels have been reported to decrease with age, and treatment with either GH or IGF-I can ameliorate age-related cognitive decline. Interestingly, acute GH and IGF-I treatments enhance glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus of juvenile animals. However, whether this enhancement also occurs in old rats, when cognitive impairment is ameliorated by GH and IGF-I (des-IGF-I), remains to be determined. To address this issue, we used an in vitro CA1 hippocampal slice preparation and extracellular recording techniques to study the effects of acute application of GH and IGF-I on compound field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), as well as AMPA- and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs, in young adult (10 months) and old (28 months) rats. The results indicated that both GH and IGF-I increased compound-, AMPA-, and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs to a similar extent in slices from both age groups and that this augmentation was likely mediated via a postsynaptic mechanism. Initial characterization of the signaling cascades underlying these effects revealed that the GH-induced enhancement was not mediated by the JAK2 signaling element in either young adult or old rats but that the IGF-I-induced enhancement involved a PI3K-mediated mechanism in old, but not young adults. The present findings are consistent with a role for a GH- or IGF-I-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission in mitigating age-related cognitive impairment in old rats.", "accepted_label": ["Animal-drug-intervention"]}

The angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R) is distributed in brain regions responsible for the control of stress response through peripheral and central sympathetic hyperactivation as well as in the hypothalamic paraventricular region, areas known for the release of several neurotransmitters related to inflammatory response facilitation. This relationship leads to the assumption that AT1R might be the receptor most related to the central deleterious actions of angiotensin II. New evidences from clinical studies have shown a possible role for RAS in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BD), a multifactorial disorder with acknowledged presence of neuronal damage via oxidative stress in brain areas such as hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum. Given the studies highlighting AT1R activation as a central pro-inflammatory pathway and, conversely, the involvement of inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of BD; this paper hypothesizes the use of AT1R antagonists for BD management and prevention of its neuroprogression, due to their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.", "accepted_label": ["Non-systematic-review"]}

Immunoglobulin from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, when tested on immunoblots, recognized a 56-kilodalton protein secreted by denervated rat diaphragm muscle; rabbit antiserum raised against this protein also suppressed terminal axonal sprouting. Thus, we have detected an antibody in the serum of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that inhibits sprouting of neurons and subsequent reinnervation of skeletal muscle.

Systemic chemotherapy is the first treatment of choice for ALL recurrence in the genital tract in a patient without poor prognostic factors in order to spare gonadal function and reproductive potential.", "accepted_label": ["Human-case-report"]}

Interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaires, desk review guide and urine drug assays were employed. Questionnaire recorded CPD non-medical and illicit drug use history from patients' files, CPD lifetime use and risk factors. Desk review guide recorded recently prescribed drugs in patients' files to corroborate with urine assays. Predictors were analysed by multivariate logistic regression.\tFrom desk review, 145 (11.4%) patients had history of CPD non-medical use and 36 (2.8%) had used illicit drugs. Of 988 patients who provided urine, 166 (16.8%) self-medicated CPDs, particularly benzodiazepines while 12 (1.2%) used illicit drugs. Of those with drug-positive urine, 123 (69.1%) had no documented history of CPD non-medical and illicit drug use. Being an inpatient (OR=10.90, p<0.001) was independently associated with CPD non-medical use. Additionally, being an inpatient (OR=8.29, p<0.001) and tobacco consumption (OR=1.85, p=0.041) were associated with CPD non-medical and illicit drug use combined. Among participants, 119 (9.3%) reported CPD lifetime use, and this was independently associated with education level (OR=2.71, p<0.001) and history of treatment for substance abuse (OR=2.08, p=0.018).\tCPD non-medical use is common among Uganda's psychiatric patients, and more prevalent than illicit drug use. Rapid diagnostic assays may be needed in psychiatric care in resource limited settings. It is necessary to assess how CPD non-medical use impacts mental care outcomes and patient safety. High risk groups like inpatients and tobacco consumers should be prioritised in psychiatric screening.", "accepted_label": ["Remaining"]}

The objective was to investigate GM changes in older depressed and similar aged healthy subjects using two different methods, cortical thickness in frontal lobe structures and voxel-based morphometry (VBM).\tSixty eight subjects participated (30 healthy comparison subjects, 38 depressed) and underwent 3T T1 MR imaging as well as clinical and cognitive assessments. Frontal cortical thickness was measured using FreeSurfer while VBM was undertaken using the DARTEL algorithm in SPM8. Group differences in cortical thickness and GM volumes were assessed using ANCOVA. Effects of cortical thickness and VBM results on cognitive and depression variables were also investigated.\tNo significant differences in frontal lobe cortical thickness were observed between groups (F(1, 62) \u2264 2.7, p \u2265 0.1). In addition, no significant relationships of cortical thickness on cognitive and depression scores were identified (partial correlation |r'|=0.01-0.31, p \u2265 0.06). VBM showed that GM volumes were indistinguishable between groups but significant age effects were apparent, independent of diagnosis.\tResults suggest that cortical GM changes in late life depression (LLD) are similar to healthy older subjects and appear to be related to age rather than cognitive or depressive symptoms. Changes to white matter and subcortical GM structures may be more relevant in explaining the underlying neurobiology of LLD.", "accepted_label": ["Remaining"]}

Recent breakthrough discoveries identifying common genes that are causal to either ALS or FTD or an overlapping ALS-FTD syndrome have dramatically transformed our view regarding their pathogenesis. Most recently, a massive hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion mutation in C9orf72 gene has been linked to the majority of familial ALS, FTD and mixed ALS-FTD cases. C9orf72 and other genes causal to ALS and FTD are consistently associated with the formation of cellular RNA inclusions and protein aggregates. This article summarizes the recently reported ALS-FTD-linked genes and the emerging common unifying mechanism in the pathogenesis of ALS-FTD spectrum disorders along with a comment on the potential new therapeutic targets in these hitherto incurable diseases.", "accepted_label": ["Non-systematic-review"]}
