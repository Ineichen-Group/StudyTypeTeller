{"pmid":"29101712","text":"Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice^\nPosttraumatic stress-related psychological functioning in adult survivors of childhood cancer.^\nThe majority of research examining posttraumatic stress symptoms/disorder (PTSS/PTSD) among adult survivors of childhood cancer has been oriented to cancer, assuming that cancer has been the most traumatic experience in their lives. Whether that assumption is valid, and how it might impact assessment of PTSS, is unknown.\tSurvivors in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort study completed an assessment of PTSS without cancer orientation, global psychological functioning, perceived stress, and cancer-related anxiety.\tParticipants (n\u00a0=\u00a02969; Mage\u00a0=\u00a032.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.5\u00a0years, 24.1\u00a0years since diagnosis, 49.1% female) obtained a mean score on the PTSD Checklist of 27.7, which is comparable to a normative population. Using established cutoffs, 11.8% obtained scores in the at-risk range.

However, few studies have examined this topic in youth. Thus, we aimed to examine the association of lithium and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), the first-line antimanic medications for youth with BD, with neurocognition in a relatively large sample of youth with BD. Methods: Participants included 91 youth with BD-I, -II, or -Not Otherwise Specified, aged 13-20 years (n = 14 current lithium use, n = 51 current SGA use). We examined four tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery: Intra/Extra Dimensional Set-Shifting Task (IED), Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP), Stockings of Cambridge Test (SOC), and Affective Go/No-Go (AGN). Within-sample Z-scores were computed, and a global neurocognitive composite score and g factor derived from these tests comprised the primary outcomes. Multivariable analyses controlled for age, sex, and IQ. Results: Current lithium use was significantly associated with poorer cognitive flexibility/set-shifting (IED). After further controlling for lifetime comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and current depression symptoms in sensitivity analyses, the lithium finding was no longer significant. Current SGA use was significantly associated with greater affective processing bias (AGN). No significant findings survived correction for multiple comparisons. All other cognitive outcomes were not significantly associated with current lithium use, current SGA use, or total number of current medications. Conclusions: Treatment with lithium or SGAs was associated with minimal neurocognitive impairments, with small effect sizes in primary multivariable analyses.

{"pmid":"22680244","text":"Journal of neurosurgery^\nDiagnostic value of the optic nerve sheath subarachnoid space in patients with intracranial hypotension syndrome.^\nThe size of the subarachnoid space in the optic nerve sheath (ONS) on MR images is thought to reflect intracranial pressure. The diagnostic value of this space was investigated in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) syndrome.\tCoronal fat-saturated T2-weighted MRI of the orbit was performed in 15 patients with SIH fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for headache caused by low CSF pressure of the International Classification of Headache Disorders or the criteria for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks and intracranial hypotension. The size of the subarachnoid space in the ONS was measured in 2 slices behind the eyeballs. The images were compared before and after treatment. The CSF pressure was measured by lumbar puncture.\tBefore treatment, the diameter of the ONS subarachnoid space ranged from 2.58 to 4.21 mm (mean 3.34 mm) and the thickness from 0 to 0.48 mm (mean 0.15 mm).

Compared with the Hcs, MoCA in the two LGG groups were lower than HCs with significant difference, and the disturbed networks in the LGG were negatively related to worse MoCA scores.\tDisturbed small-worldness preperty in the two LGG groups was found and widely spread in the strength and spatial organization of brain networks, and the alterated small-world network may be responsible for cognitive dysfunction in frontal lobe LGG patients.","_input_hash":862920759,"_task_hash":946457549,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":125,"end":133,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":457,"end":465,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":505,"end":510,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":686,"end":694,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":921,"end":929,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1077,"end":1085,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":2052,"end":2060,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"26, 26, 2, 26, 26, 26, 26"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705918964,"_session_id":"test_classification_pilot_2_ben","sessions":["test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":false}],"view_id":"choice"}

{"pmid":"11482700","text":"Acta neurochirurgica^\nIntracranial cerebrospinal fluid distribution and its postoperative changes in normal pressure hydrocephalus.^\nThis study was conducted to investigate the usefulness of intracranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume measurement using MR-based methods in the management of patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).\tThe study group comprised 19 patients with NPH who showed a favorable outcome after ventricular shunting, 15 normal volunteers (NV), and 15 patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD). A 3D-fast asymmetric spin echo MR imaging sequence and the region-growing method were used to extract the CSF space from MR images. Ventricular volume (VV) and intracranial CSF volume (ICV) were measured and the VV/ICV ratio was calculated in each case. In NPH patients, the CSF volume was measured again after shunting.\tThe mean VV and VV/ICV ratio in the NPH group (91.1 mL and 45.2%, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those in the NV group (26.5 mL and 13.7%) and in the CVD group (44.5 mL and 17.8%). On the other hand, mean ICV values were not significantly different among the three groups.

{"pmid":"19060588","text":"American journal of clinical oncology^\nBrain metastasis is an early manifestation of distant failure in stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer patients treated with radical chemoradiation therapy.^\nTo evaluate the patterns of distant relapse, focusing on brain metastasis, in patients with stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with radical chemoradiation therapy (CRT).\tThe British Columbia Cancer Agency provincial database identified 2268 patients presenting with stage III NSCLC between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2000. Of these, 120 patients received radical CRT, forming the study cohort. Variables analyzed included gender, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, stage, histology, sites of metastasis, and survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.\tThe study cohort comprised 59 men and 61 women, median age 54.5 years. There were 74 stage IIIA and 46 stage IIIB cases. Histologic subtypes were squamous cell carcinoma (n = 29), adenocarcinoma (n = 53), and other non-squamous histologies (n = 38). Median follow-up time was 17.7 months. Median overall survival time was 19.2 months. Thirty-two patients (27%) developed brain metastasis. Non-brain metastases occurred in 51 patients (42%). No variables were statistically significantly associated with the risk of developing brain metastasis. Trends for higher risks of brain metastasis were observed with younger age (P = 0.09), and poor performance status (P = 0.07).

In a real-time prediction scenario, a machine learning model may receive limited information for some patients.\tOur aim was to evaluate the influence of missing data on real-time prediction of delirium, and detect changes in prediction performance when training separate models for patients with missing data.\tWe compared a model trained specifically on data with missing values to the currently implemented model predicting delirium.

This should reduce the duration of the diagnostic assessment and make the process easier and quicker for clinicians, patients and will be useful for 'case' ascertainment in population based epidemiological studies.","_input_hash":1494573363,"_task_hash":-302864612,"spans":[{"text":"Diagnosis","start":48,"end":57,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"study","start":146,"end":151,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"diagnosis","start":248,"end":257,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":646,"end":655,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"cohort","start":685,"end":691,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"study","start":692,"end":697,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"study","start":759,"end":764,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"diagnosis","start":973,"end":982,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"Diagnosis","start":1090,"end":1099,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1172,"end":1181,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1398,"end":1407,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1439,"end":1448,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"classification","start":1526,"end":1540,"pattern":-756437862},{"text":"study","start":1584,"end":1589,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"diagnosis","start":1701,"end":1710,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnostic","start":1814,"end":1824,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":1892,"end":1900,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"case","start":1925,"end":1929,"pattern":1741807605}],"meta":{"pattern":"56, 2, 56, 56, 1, 2, 2, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 59, 2, 56, 55, 34, 35"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705839981,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-21_12-53-19","_session_id":"2024-01-21_12-53-19","sessions":["2024-01-21_12-53-19","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}

We have considered the possibility that portasystemic shunting may be a factor determining the organ distribution of copper in patients with liver disease. Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into a sham-operated group, and a group subjected to partial occlusion of the portal vein (PPVO).

The modality of anesthesia was not associated with any significant changes in the modified Rankin scale score distribution (MAC: OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.80-2.90; P\u2009=\u2009.19).\tIn endovascular therapy for acute posterior circulation stroke, MAC is feasible and appears to be as safe and effective as GA.

Thus, hypoxia imaging would be a valuable tool for pre-therapeutic assessment of tumor malignancy. However, there is no standard validated technique for clinical application available yet. Therefore, we performed a study in 12 patients with high-grade glioma, where we directly compared the two currently most promising techniques, namely the MR-based relative oxygen extraction fraction (MR-rOEF) and the PET hypoxia marker H-1-(3-[[18] F]-fluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)-2-nitroimidazole ([[18] F]-FMISO). MR-rOEF was determined from separate measurements of T2 , T2 * and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) employing a multi-parametric approach for quantification of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect. With respect to [[18] F]-FMISO-PET, besides the commonly used late uptake between 120 and 130 min ([[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min), we also analyzed the hypoxia specific uptake rate [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , as obtained by pharmacokinetic modeling of dynamic uptake data. Since pharmacokinetic modeling of partially acquired dynamic [[18] F]-FMISO data was sensitive to a low signal-to-noise-ratio, analysis was restricted to high-uptake tumor regions.

Volume-of-interest-based correlations between MR-rOEF and [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min as well as [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , and voxel-wise analyses in individual patients, yielded limited correlations, supporting the notion that [[18] F]-FMISO uptake, even after 2 h, might still be influenced by perfusion while [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 was severely hampered by noise. According to these results, vascular deoxygenation, as measured by MR-rOEF, and severe tissue hypoxia, as measured by [[18] F]-FMISO, show a poor spatial correspondence.

The PQ shows good preliminary validity in detecting individuals with an interview-diagnosed prodromal or psychotic syndrome, but it is less sensitive to the threshold between prodromal and full-blown psychosis.","_input_hash":44455652,"_task_hash":-934433776,"spans":[{"text":"questionnaire","start":38,"end":51,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"report","start":91,"end":97,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"study","start":161,"end":166,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"aims","start":167,"end":171,"pattern":-2080524606},{"text":"Questionnaire","start":223,"end":236,"pattern":-759522552},{"text":"report","start":258,"end":264,"pattern":1226364217},{"text":"Interview","start":446,"end":455,"pattern":1942352714},{"text":"interview","start":701,"end":710,"pattern":1942352714},{"text":"diagnosis","start":932,"end":941,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"interview","start":1056,"end":1065,"pattern":1942352714}],"meta":{"pattern":"57, 36, 2, 43, 57, 36, 58, 58, 56, 58"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705840533,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-21_12-53-19","_session_id":"2024-01-21_12-53-19","sessions":["2024-01-21_12-53-19","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}

{"pmid":"37564014","text":"The International journal of eating disorders^\nAn intervention mapping adaptation framework to develop a self-help intervention for athletes with eating disorder symptoms.^\nThis research forum describes the use of the intervention mapping for adaptation (IMA) framework to develop and evaluate a novel intervention for athletes with mild eating disorder (ED) symptoms.\tThe six IMA steps were followed. In step 1 (needs assessment), we conducted a systematic review of athlete ED interventions and held interviews/focus groups with athletes and sports professionals to inform intervention format and delivery. In step 2 (intervention search), needs assessment information guided the search for an evidence-based intervention suitable for adaptation to athletes. In steps 3 and 4 (intervention development), the identified intervention was adapted and feedback sought from athletes and sport professionals. In steps 5 and 6 (implementation and evaluation), a feasibility study was conducted with athletes (n\u2009=\u200935; females: n\u2009=\u200927; Mage \u2009=\u200927.1).\tThe review highlighted poor evidence for the acceptability and relative efficacy of existing interventions, which were all delivered face-to-face in groups. Interview/focus group data suggested a need for more accessible intervention formats (e.g., self-help). One non-athlete self-help intervention was determined suitable for adaptation to athletes, and adaptations were made. Initial feedback suggested the adapted intervention was relevant within sport settings.

The Nutrition Cohorts 1 (NC1) and 2 (NC2) are longitudinal observational mother-child cohorts in the Republic of Seychelles. Maternal serum LC-PUFA was measured at 28 weeks gestation and genotyping for rs174537 (FADS1), rs174561 (FADS1), rs3834458 (FADS1-FADS2) and rs174575 (FADS2) was performed in both cohorts. The children completed the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II) at 30 months in NC1 and at 20 months in NC2. Complete data were available for 221 and 1310 mothers from NC1 and NC2 respectively.

There were no significant associations between maternal FADS genotype and BSID-II scores in either cohort. A trend for improved PDI was found among infants born to mothers with the minor rs3834458 allele.In these high fish-eating cohorts, genetic variability in FADS genes was associated with maternal AA status measured in serum and a subtle association of the FADS genotype was found with neurodevelopment.","_input_hash":-1577764615,"_task_hash":-1175082016,"spans":[{"text":"genes","start":83,"end":88,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"fish","start":196,"end":200,"pattern":-741546164},{"text":"observational","start":208,"end":221,"pattern":232030698},{"text":"study","start":552,"end":557,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"genes","start":651,"end":656,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"fish","start":737,"end":741,"pattern":-741546164},{"text":"longitudinal","start":797,"end":809,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"observational","start":810,"end":823,"pattern":232030698},{"text":"cohort","start":1676,"end":1682,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"fish","start":1795,"end":1799,"pattern":-741546164},{"text":"genes","start":1844,"end":1849,"pattern":995975506}],"meta":{"pattern":"78, 100, 80, 2, 78, 100, 52, 80, 1, 100, 78"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"review","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1706196502,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-25_15-44-04","_session_id":"2024-01-25_15-44-04","sessions":["2024-01-21_12-53-19","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"versions":[{"pmid":"26474818","text":"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids^\nGenetic variation in FADS genes is associated with maternal long-chain PUFA status but not with cognitive development of infants in a high fish-eating observational study.^\nLong-chain n-6 and n-3 PUFA (LC-PUFA), arachidonic acid (AA) (20:4n-6) and DHA (22:6n-3), are critical for optimal brain development.

Maternal serum LC-PUFA was measured at 28 weeks gestation and genotyping for rs174537 (FADS1), rs174561 (FADS1), rs3834458 (FADS1-FADS2) and rs174575 (FADS2) was performed in both cohorts. The children completed the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II) at 30 months in NC1 and at 20 months in NC2. Complete data were available for 221 and 1310 mothers from NC1 and NC2 respectively. With increasing number of rs3834458 minor alleles, maternal concentrations of AA were significantly decreased (NC1 p=0.004; NC2 p<0.001) and precursor:product ratios for linoleic acid (LA) (18:2n-6)-to-AA (NC1 p<0.001; NC2 p<0.001) and \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA) (18:3n-3)-to-DHA were increased (NC2 p=0.028). There were no significant associations between maternal FADS genotype and BSID-II scores in either cohort. A trend for improved PDI was found among infants born to mothers with the minor rs3834458 allele.In these high fish-eating cohorts, genetic variability in FADS genes was associated with maternal AA status measured in serum and a subtle association of the FADS genotype was found with neurodevelopment.","_input_hash":-1577764615,"_task_hash":-1175082016,"spans":[{"text":"genes","start":83,"end":88,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"fish","start":196,"end":200,"pattern":-741546164},{"text":"observational","start":208,"end":221,"pattern":232030698},{"text":"study","start":552,"end":557,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"genes","start":651,"end":656,"pattern":995975506},{"text":"fish","start":737,"end":741,"pattern":-741546164},{"text":"longitudinal","start":797,"end":809,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"observational","start":810,"end":823,"pattern":232030698},{"text":"cohort","start":1676,"end":1682,"pattern":1717037299},{"text":"fish","start":1795,"end":1799,"pattern":-741546164},{"text":"genes","start":1844,"end":1849,"pattern":995975506}],"meta":{"pattern":"78, 100, 80, 2, 78, 100, 52, 80, 1, 100, 78"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705841239,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-21_12-53-19","_session_id":"2024-01-21_12-53-19","sessions":["2024-01-21_12-53-19","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}

Likely barriers to uptake include low affordability, preference for cigarettes and high numbers of smoking acquaintances.","_input_hash":2064272073,"_task_hash":1967109564,"spans":[{"text":"prevalence","start":232,"end":242,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"study","start":408,"end":413,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"traditional","start":1566,"end":1577,"pattern":1983949530}],"meta":{"pattern":"53, 2, 10"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705930555,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-22_14-32-54","_session_id":"2024-01-22_14-32-54","sessions":["2024-01-22_14-32-54","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}

{"pmid":"11905606","text":"The Lancet. Oncology^\nThe seed and soil hypothesis: vascularisation and brain metastases.^\nThe development of a relevant mouse model for the establishment and growth of brain metastases is essential for study of the biology and therapy of brain metastasis. Injection of human tumour cells into the internal carotid artery of syngeneic or nude mice produces experimental metastases in specific regions of the brain; these are not due to patterns of initial cell arrest, motility, or invasiveness, but rather to the ability of metastatic tumour cells to grow. Whether the progressive growth of brain metastases depends on neovascularisation is not clear.

{"pmid":"35090475","text":"Harm reduction journal^\nInterim opioid agonist treatment for opioid addiction: a systematic review.^\nOpioid use disorder is a public health problem and treatment variability, coverage and accessibility poses some challenges. The study's objective is to review the impact of interim opioid agonist treatment (OAT), a short-term approach for patients awaiting standard OAT, in terms of treatment retention, access to standard OAT, quality of life and satisfaction with treatment.\tWe conducted a systematic review searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL up to May 2020. Due to variability between studies and outcome measurements, we did not pool effect estimates and reported a narrative synthesis of findings rating their certainty according to GRADE.\tWe identified 266 unique records and included five randomized trials with some limitations in risk of bias and one observational study limited by selection bias. The studies assessed similar approaches to interim OAT but were compared to three different control conditions. Four studies reported on treatment retention at 4 months or less with no significant differences between interim OAT and waiting list or standard OAT. Two studies reported treatment retention at 12\u00a0months with no differences between interim OAT and standard OAT. Two trials assessed access to standard OAT and showed significant differences between interim OAT and waiting list for standard OAT.

Amino acid composition and sequence analyses of purified FA2 revealed identity to the amino acid sequence of the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human type I procollagen. Gel filtration of AF as well as purified FA2 demonstrated two molecular forms of FA2, which during gel filtration were elucidated corresponding to MW of approximately 100 kDa and 30 kDa. The molecular forms were referred to as the high molecular component (FA2-HM) and low molecular component (FA2-LM), respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis (reducing and nonreducing conditions) showed a MW of 27 kDa for both FA2-HM and FA2-LM. Mass spectrometry analysis however revealed a MW of 14.343 +/- 3Da. Proteins with collagenous domains often reveal aberrant behaviour both in gel filtration and SDS-PAGE and this phenomenon may account for the apparent higher MW of FA2 observed using these techniques compared to mass spectrometry and amino acid composition/sequence analyses. A polyclonal, monospecific rabbit antibody raised against FA2 was used in immunohistochemical localization studies. Due to the obvious association of FA2 to the BM structure in adult and fetal skin, it was initially referred to as a BM associated component.

Demonstration of FA2 within the cytoplasm of proliferating fibroblasts and diffusely in granulation tissue during wound healing suggest that FA2 was involved in the reparative processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","_input_hash":-160588415,"_task_hash":-1755345047,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":88,"end":93,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"study","start":116,"end":121,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"human","start":225,"end":230,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":491,"end":496,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"rabbit","start":1311,"end":1317,"pattern":1055392994},{"text":"human","start":1844,"end":1849,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"human","start":2055,"end":2060,"pattern":-1579252602}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 2, 0, 0, 91, 0, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["In-vitro-study"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705934549,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-22_14-32-54","_session_id":"2024-01-22_14-32-54","sessions":["2024-01-22_14-32-54","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}

These eyes were divided into two groups according to the amount of slanted recession. In right eyes, slanted superior recti (SR) muscle recession was performed with 6\u00a0mm of nasal margin and 2\u00a0mm of temporal margin (4-mm slanting group), and in fellow eyes, slanted SR muscle recession was performed with 6\u00a0mm and 4\u00a0mm, respectively (2-mm slanting group).

{"pmid":"3927342","text":"Psychopharmacology^\nEvidence that the selectively bred long- and short-sleep mouse lines display common narcotic reactions to many depressants.^\nThis report challenges the notion that the long-sleep and short-sleep selectively bred mouse lines display unique narcotic reactions to alcohols. First, we found that the specific ethanol sensitivity hypothesis is not supported by the relevant literature. Second, we found that much of the ambiguity with respect to this hypothesis concerns just pentobarbital. Consequently, the major intent of this paper was to further explore what effect pentobarbital had on these two mouse lines. Additionally, we examined the effects of barbital and ethanol.

{"pmid":"11919447","text":"Pediatric neurosurgery^\nImpact of selective posterior rhizotomy on fine motor skills. Long-term results using a validated evaluative measure.^\nSuprasegmental effects following selective posterior rhizotomy have been frequently reported. However, few studies have used validated functional outcome measures to report the surgical results beyond 3 years. The authors analyzed data obtained from the McGill Rhizotomy Database to determine the long-term impact of lumbosacral dorsal rhizotomy on fine motor skills.

{"pmid":"25960208","text":"Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie^\nmiR-25 promotes glioma cell proliferation by targeting CDKN1C.^\nMicroRNAs (miRNA) have oncogenic or tumor-suppressive roles in the development and growth of human glioma. Glioma development is also associated with alteration in the activities and expression of cell cycle regulators, and miRNAs are emerging as important regulators of cell cycle progression. Here, we show that miR-25 is overexpressed in 91% of examined human glioma tissues and 4 out of 6 human glioma cell lines. MiR-25 increases cell proliferation in two independent glioma cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-25 was found to reduce CDKN1C protein levels by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (UTR).

Its clinical use has expanded to control of seizures, by pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS), and is finding new purpose as an analgesic alternative and antidepressant. Ketamine brings hope for effective management of chronic pain in the absence of opioids and decreasing suicidal ideations; however, its persistence as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic properties remains. In the wake of expanding medicinal purposes, the diversity of New York City's population was explored to better understand its misuse. This retrospective study looks at the prevalence of ketamine in driver fatalities over a period of 18 years (2003-2020) and cases involving suspected driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) over a period of 6 years (2015-2020). Ketamine was identified in 6 driver fatalities and in 47 DUID cases. None of the driver fatalities were suspected of ketamine misuse, due to administration either in hospital or by EMS. In the DUID cases, an increasing trend was observed over the 6-year study period with 100% (n = 47) of the cases confirmed as non-hospital/non-EMS administered ketamine. Of the DUID cases, 94% were male with the majority between the age of 21 and 39 years (85%) and were predominantly Hispanic (36%) and Asian (34%). Blood concentrations of ketamine ranged from 27 to >2000 ng/mL with polydrug use prevalent.

In 2019, 2-fluoro-deschloroketamine was identified in two cases for the first time.

In practice, those situations include very different cases and it seems obvious that this is a polyfactorial disorder, no single factor alone being sufficient to account for all the difficulties experienced by the children. It would therefore be simplistic to consider the ADHD as issued only from a neurobiological disorder and to consider a drug treatment, only. We are rather in favor of an integrative approach and a global treatment on a case by case basis.","_input_hash":435903133,"_task_hash":-1539501684,"spans":[{"text":"diagnosis","start":51,"end":60,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":286,"end":295,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"case","start":879,"end":883,"pattern":1741807605},{"text":"case","start":887,"end":891,"pattern":1741807605}],"meta":{"pattern":"56, 56, 35, 35"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Non-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705940629,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-22_17-16-45","_session_id":"2024-01-22_17-16-45","sessions":["2024-01-22_17-16-45","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}

Visual acuity, refraction, endothelial cell count, and complications were assessed.\tData for 103 eyes were analyzed as 2 groups. Group 1 comprised 82 eyes with myopia or myopic astigmatism, and Group 2 contained 21 eyes with hyperopia or hyperopic astigmatism. The mean preoperative sphere in Group 1 was -13.42 diopters (D) \u00b1 5.62 (SD) with a mean cylinder of -2.35 \u00b1 1.75 D. In Group 2, the mean sphere and cylinder were +6.77 \u00b1 1.91 D and -2.63 \u00b1 2.43 D, respectively. The mean CDVA improved from 0.51 \u00b1 0.15 logMAR to 0.34 \u00b1 0.16 logMAR (P<.001) in Group 1 and from 0.54 \u00b1 0.17 logMAR to 0.46 \u00b1 0.14 logMAR in Group 2 (P<.005). The safety index was 1.48 in Group 1 and 1.19 in Group 2. The efficacy index was 1.21 in Group 1 and 1.00 in Group 2.

{"pmid":"18299151","text":"Journal of affective disorders^\nThe association between parental bonding and obsessive compulsive disorder in offspring at high familial risk.^\nThe aim of the current study is to estimate the association between parenting factors derived from the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) and a lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD.\tData were from approximately 1200 adults from 465 families assessed as part of a large family and genetic study of OCD. The association of three parenting factors, for fathers and mothers, with offspring OCD status were examined; analyses were stratified by parental OCD status and family loading for OCD (multiplex versus sporadic).\tThree factors were derived by principal components factor analysis of the PBI (maternal and paternal care, overprotection and control). Maternal overprotection was associated with OCD in offspring with familial OCD (familial cases) but only if neither parent was affected with OCD, which suggests independent but additive environmental and genetic risk (OR = 5.9, 95% CI 1.2, 29.9, p = 0.031). Paternal care was a protective factor in those not at high genetic risk (sporadic cases) (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 0.8, p = 0.027).

Future research should examine whether screening properties can be improved by developing an algorithm incorporating the negative consequences reported for different areas in the HCL-32.","_input_hash":-302163147,"_task_hash":-1478698261,"spans":[{"text":"systematic","start":58,"end":68,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"review","start":69,"end":75,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"systematic","start":358,"end":368,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"review","start":369,"end":375,"pattern":692368738},{"text":"systematic","start":444,"end":454,"pattern":-2143130953},{"text":"literature","start":455,"end":465,"pattern":-478699552},{"text":"diagnosis","start":755,"end":764,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnosis","start":826,"end":835,"pattern":-1255217628},{"text":"diagnostic","start":953,"end":963,"pattern":-808942259},{"text":"patients","start":1170,"end":1178,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 5, 56, 56, 55, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705940951,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-22_17-16-45","_session_id":"2024-01-22_17-16-45","sessions":["2024-01-22_17-16-45","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}

{"pmid":"26106544","text":"NeuroImage. Clinical^\nBrain activation during self- and other-reflection in bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis: Comparison to schizophrenia.^\nReflecting on the self and on others activates specific brain areas and contributes to metacognition and social cognition. The aim of the current study is to investigate brain activation during self- and other-reflection in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In addition, we examined whether potential abnormal brain activation in BD patients could distinguish BD from patients with schizophrenia (SZ).\tDuring functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 17 BD patients, 17 SZ patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs) performed a self-reflection task. The task consisted of sentences divided into three conditions: self-reflection, other-reflection and semantic control.\tBD patients showed less activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) extending to the precuneus during other-reflection compared to HCs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028 FWE corrected on cluster-level within the regions of interest). In SZ patients, the level of activation in this area was in between BD patients and HCs, with no significant differences between patients with SZ and BD. There were no group differences in brain activation during self-reflection.

This specific arm swing pattern during walking has shown to have a beneficial effect on gait as it reduces walking energy cost and optimizes balance. In several patient populations the arm movements can be directly affected (e.g. in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI)), which in turn has a negative effect on their gait pattern, balance and energy cost of walking.\tIn December 2019, Kahn et al. published a paper in JNER concerning the quantification of upper limb associated reactions (ARs) during walking in people with ABI. ARs are defined as 'an effort-dependent phenomenon causing an involuntary increase in upper limb muscle tone, with awkward and uncomfortable postures'. These upper limb ARs appear often in patients with ABI and can have an important effect on their gait. The authors calculated kinematic measures using three-dimensional gait analysis relating to range of motion, variability and mean position over the gait cycle for the different upper limb joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist) during self-selected steady-state walking. Based on differences they found between an ABI cohort and healthy control cohort, the authors concluded that they were able to quantify ARs during walking in this population. This calculation, however, is not specific for upper limb ARs. In fact, the authors calculated general measures of arm posture (e.g. mean position over the gait cycle) or arm movement (e.g. range of motion and variability) during gait. Previous research has already indicated that other factors than ARs can influence the posture or movement of the arm during gait in patients with brain injury, such as voluntary compensations for gait instability and contractures or spasticity of upper arm muscles.

Even non-smokers accepted 'just having a try' in the context of curiosity, life experiences and 'informed choice'.\tpreventing continuation after trial of smoking among young people needs to increase in importance, given the prevailing norms around 'trying it' and individual choice.","_input_hash":-1683653050,"_task_hash":-702778089,"spans":[{"text":"trial","start":623,"end":628,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"trial","start":1158,"end":1163,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"trial","start":1358,"end":1363,"pattern":-622671649}],"meta":{"pattern":"73, 73, 73"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705942272,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-22_17-16-45","_session_id":"2024-01-22_17-16-45","sessions":["2024-01-22_17-16-45","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}

Some associations were found between these measures and anxiety.","_input_hash":-976006472,"_task_hash":-1450097924,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":574,"end":579,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705942365,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-22_17-16-45","_session_id":"2024-01-22_17-16-45","sessions":["2024-01-22_17-16-45","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}

These findings provide genetic proof-of-concept for somatic TERT gene activation therapy in attenuating AD progression including cognitive decline.","_input_hash":1776101255,"_task_hash":1010868005,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":481,"end":486,"pattern":-1579252602},{"text":"mouse","start":636,"end":641,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"therapy","start":1214,"end":1221,"pattern":-227782321}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 73, 38"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705936924,"_session_id":"test_classification_pilot_2_ben","sessions":["test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":false}],"view_id":"choice"}

The purpose of the present study was to examine the literature in order to determine the optimum thromboprophylaxis regimen for patients with acute spinal injuries with or without spinal cord injury.\tEMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched from the earliest available date to April 2008 for clinical trials comparing different methods of thromboprophylaxis in adult patients following acute spinal injuries (with or without spinal cord injury). Outcome measures included the prevalences of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treatment-related adverse events.\tThe search yielded 489 studies, but only twenty-one of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis was significantly lower in patients without spinal cord injury as compared with patients with spinal cord injury (odds ratio = 6.0; 95% confidence interval = 2.9 to 12.7). Patients with an acute spinal cord injury who were receiving oral anticoagulants had significantly fewer episodes of pulmonary embolism (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.01 to 0.63) than those who were not receiving oral anticoagulants (either untreated controls or patients managed with low-molecular-weight heparin). The start of thromboprophylaxis within the first two weeks after the injury resulted in significantly fewer deep-vein-thrombosis events than delayed initiation did (odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1 to 0.4). With regard to heparin-based pharmacoprophylaxis in patients with spinal trauma, low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduced the rates of deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding episodes in comparison with the findings in patients who received unfractionated heparin, with odds ratios of 2.6 (95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 5.6) and 7.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 58.4) for deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding, respectively.\tThe prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis following a spine injury is higher among patients who have a spinal cord injury than among those who do not have a spinal cord injury. Therefore, thromboprophylaxis in these patients should start as early as possible once it is deemed safe in terms of potential bleeding complications. Within this population, low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis, with fewer bleeding complications, than unfractionated heparin is.

Targeted immunization of such groups may be the most efficient means of eliminating the risk of importation-associated outbreaks.","_input_hash":-1459941525,"_task_hash":1038058152,"spans":[],"meta":{"pattern":""},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705937303,"_session_id":"test_classification_pilot_2_ben","sessions":["test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":false}],"view_id":"choice"}

{"pmid":"32149692","text":"IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society^\nQuantitative Assessment of Upper-Limb Motor Function for Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Based on Motor Synergy Analysis and Multi-Modality Fusion.^\nFunctional assessment is an essential part of rehabilitation protocols after stroke. Conventionally, the assessment process relies heavily on clinical experience and lacks quantitative analysis. In order to objectively quantify the upper-limb motor impairments in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis, this study proposes a novel assessment approach based on motor synergy quantification and multi-modality fusion. Fifteen post-stroke hemiparetic patients and fifteen age-matched healthy persons participated in this study. During different goal-directed tasks, kinematic data and surface electromyography(sEMG) signals were synchronously collected from these participants, and then motor features extracted from each modal data could be fed into the respective local classifiers. In addition, kinematic synergies and muscle synergies were quantified by principal component analysis (PCA) and k weighted angular similarity (k WAS) algorithm to provide in-depth analysis of the coactivated features responsible for observable movement impairments. By integrating the outputs of local classifiers and the quantification results of motor synergies, ensemble classifiers can be created to generate quantitative assessment for different modalities separately. In order to further exploit the complementarity between the evaluation results at kinematic and muscular levels, a multi-modal fusion scheme was developed to comprehensively analyze the upper-limb motor function and generate a probability-based function score. Under the proposed assessment framework, three types of machine learning methods were employed to search the optimal performance of each classifier.

Conventionally, the assessment process relies heavily on clinical experience and lacks quantitative analysis. In order to objectively quantify the upper-limb motor impairments in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis, this study proposes a novel assessment approach based on motor synergy quantification and multi-modality fusion. Fifteen post-stroke hemiparetic patients and fifteen age-matched healthy persons participated in this study. During different goal-directed tasks, kinematic data and surface electromyography(sEMG) signals were synchronously collected from these participants, and then motor features extracted from each modal data could be fed into the respective local classifiers. In addition, kinematic synergies and muscle synergies were quantified by principal component analysis (PCA) and k weighted angular similarity (k WAS) algorithm to provide in-depth analysis of the coactivated features responsible for observable movement impairments. By integrating the outputs of local classifiers and the quantification results of motor synergies, ensemble classifiers can be created to generate quantitative assessment for different modalities separately. In order to further exploit the complementarity between the evaluation results at kinematic and muscular levels, a multi-modal fusion scheme was developed to comprehensively analyze the upper-limb motor function and generate a probability-based function score. Under the proposed assessment framework, three types of machine learning methods were employed to search the optimal performance of each classifier. Experimental results demonstrated that the classification accuracy was respectively improved by 4.86% and 2.78% when the analysis of kinematic and muscle synergies was embedded in the assessment system, and could be further enhanced to 96.06% by fusing the characteristics derived from different modalities. Furthermore, the assessment result of multi-modality fusion framework exhibited a significant correlation with the score of standard clinical tests (R = - 0.87, P = 1.98e - 5).

Like spinal muscular atrophy patients, patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy had significantly larger MU territories than normal controls.","_input_hash":-1722689093,"_task_hash":-2104032633,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":169,"end":177,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":362,"end":370,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":518,"end":523,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":663,"end":671,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":708,"end":716,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1092,"end":1100,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1102,"end":1110,"pattern":-1923511221}],"meta":{"pattern":"34, 34, 2, 34, 34, 34, 34"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705943528,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-22_17-53-56","_session_id":"2024-01-22_17-53-56","sessions":["2024-01-22_17-53-56","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}

People with bulimia nervosa may be of normal weight, making it difficult to diagnose. After ten years, about half of people with bulimia nervosa will have recovered fully, a third will have made a partial recovery, and 10-20% will still have symptoms.\tWe conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for bulimia nervosa in adults? What are the effects of discontinuing treatment in people with bulimia nervosa in remission?

{"pmid":"22851280","text":"Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)^\nGrowth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I alter hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission in young and old rats.^\nIn rats, as in humans, normal aging is characterized by a decline in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as in glutamatergic function. Both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels have been reported to decrease with age, and treatment with either GH or IGF-I can ameliorate age-related cognitive decline. Interestingly, acute GH and IGF-I treatments enhance glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus of juvenile animals. However, whether this enhancement also occurs in old rats, when cognitive impairment is ameliorated by GH and IGF-I (des-IGF-I), remains to be determined. To address this issue, we used an in vitro CA1 hippocampal slice preparation and extracellular recording techniques to study the effects of acute application of GH and IGF-I on compound field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), as well as AMPA- and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs, in young adult (10 months) and old (28 months) rats. The results indicated that both GH and IGF-I increased compound-, AMPA-, and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs to a similar extent in slices from both age groups and that this augmentation was likely mediated via a postsynaptic mechanism. Initial characterization of the signaling cascades underlying these effects revealed that the GH-induced enhancement was not mediated by the JAK2 signaling element in either young adult or old rats but that the IGF-I-induced enhancement involved a PI3K-mediated mechanism in old, but not young adults.

Interestingly, acute GH and IGF-I treatments enhance glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus of juvenile animals. However, whether this enhancement also occurs in old rats, when cognitive impairment is ameliorated by GH and IGF-I (des-IGF-I), remains to be determined. To address this issue, we used an in vitro CA1 hippocampal slice preparation and extracellular recording techniques to study the effects of acute application of GH and IGF-I on compound field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), as well as AMPA- and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs, in young adult (10 months) and old (28 months) rats. The results indicated that both GH and IGF-I increased compound-, AMPA-, and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs to a similar extent in slices from both age groups and that this augmentation was likely mediated via a postsynaptic mechanism. Initial characterization of the signaling cascades underlying these effects revealed that the GH-induced enhancement was not mediated by the JAK2 signaling element in either young adult or old rats but that the IGF-I-induced enhancement involved a PI3K-mediated mechanism in old, but not young adults. The present findings are consistent with a role for a GH- or IGF-I-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission in mitigating age-related cognitive impairment in old rats.","_input_hash":1874894694,"_task_hash":-32114880,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":597,"end":600,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"study","start":908,"end":913,"pattern":560847459}],"meta":{"pattern":"84, 2"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705938385,"_session_id":"test_classification_pilot_2_ben","sessions":["test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":false}],"view_id":"choice"}

Although the characteristic symptom of the disease in sheep is circling, that symptom was not observed in this study. Chamois may act as a host within the sheep-shepherd-dog cycle, but is probable that red fox (Vulpes vulpes) also acts as a definitive host.","_input_hash":-1299038855,"_task_hash":1231671540,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":462,"end":467,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"dog","start":521,"end":524,"pattern":1917698218}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 89"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Remaining"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705938417,"_session_id":"test_classification_pilot_2_ben","sessions":["test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":false}],"view_id":"choice"}

The modified ISODATA analysis of the ADC and CBF tissue characteristics during the acute phase could provide a useful and unbiased means to characterize and predict tissue fates in ischemic brain injury and to monitor therapeutic intervention.","_input_hash":793951527,"_task_hash":-366992487,"spans":[{"text":"therapeutic","start":2371,"end":2382,"pattern":1547368071},{"text":"intervention","start":2383,"end":2395,"pattern":-2001382570}],"meta":{"pattern":"47, 48"},"options":[{"id":"Clinical-study-protocol","text":"Clinical-study-protocol"},{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"In-vitro-study","text":"In-vitro-study"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1705947053,"_annotator_id":"2024-01-22_17-53-56","_session_id":"2024-01-22_17-53-56","sessions":["2024-01-22_17-53-56","test_classification_pilot_2_ben"],"default":true}],"view_id":"choice"}
