Protocol for a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study.^\nPerioperative sleep disorders (PSD) are an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD), which is a common complication after surgery. Elderly patients who undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) often experience perioperative sleep disorders (PSD). Dexamethasone, a medication that works by inhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-suprarenal cortical axis, can reduce the negative effects of surgical stress. The objective of this study was to determine whether intravenous administration of dexamethasone at the time of anesthesia induction could improve postoperative sleep quality in elderly patients, thereby indirectly reducing the risk of postoperative cognitive impairment and accelerating postoperative rehabilitation.\tThis study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted at a single center. A sample size of 116 patients was determined through calculation, and these patients were randomly assigned to either the dexamethasone group (group D, n\u2009=\u200958) or the blank control group (group C, n\u2009=\u200958). On the day of surgery, the anesthesia nurse prepared either diluted dexamethasone or saline in advance, according to the patient's assigned group. The blinded anesthesiologist administered the medication during induction, and a dedicated person followed up with the patient for three consecutive postoperative days. All other aspects of care were managed equally between the two groups. The primary outcome measure was sleep quality, while secondary outcome measures included postoperative sleep time, postoperative delirium (POD), pain scores, and other complications. Relevant test measures were recorded for analysis.\tThis study aims to investigate the impact of intravenous dexamethasone on sleep quality and duration of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). If the findings of this study protocol are affirmative, it could enhance the sleep quality of elderly patients after surgery, thereby minimizing the risk of postoperative delirium (POD), and providing substantial evidence for the perioperative enhanced recovery management of elderly patients.\tChinese clinical trial registry: ChiCTR2200063488, Registered on 5 October 2022.","_input_hash":-1617105166,"_task_hash":835131006,"spans":[{"text":"patients","start":92,"end":100,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"randomized","start":191,"end":201,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"surgery","start":374,"end":381,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":391,"end":399,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":690,"end":695,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":854,"end":862,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":991,"end":996,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"randomized","start":1002,"end":1012,"pattern":-1583500945},{"text":"placebo","start":1028,"end":1035,"pattern":-344698149},{"text":"trial","start":1047,"end":1052,"pattern":-622671649},{"text":"patients","start":1113,"end":1121,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"patients","start":1168,"end":1176,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"randomly","start":1182,"end":1190,"pattern":985041104},{"text":"assigned","start":1191,"end":1199,"pattern":-650468424},{"text":"surgery","start":1312,"end":1319,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"assigned","start":1429,"end":1437,"pattern":-650468424},{"text":"study","start":1924,"end":1929,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"aims","start":1930,"end":1934,"pattern":-2080524606},{"text":"patients","start":2023,"end":2031,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"study","start":2112,"end":2117,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"patients","start":2190,"end":2198,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"surgery","start":2205,"end":2212,"pattern":1899085217},{"text":"patients","start":2372,"end":2380,"pattern":-1923511221},{"text":"trial","start":2399,"end":2404,"pattern":-622671649}],"meta":{"pattern":"26, 17, 41, 26, 2, 26, 2, 17, 13, 65, 26, 26, 21, 11, 41, 11, 2, 35, 26, 2, 26, 41, 26, 65"},"options":[{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","config":{"choice_style":"single"},"accept":["Human-RCT-drug-intervention"],"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1701080762}

{"pmid":"36314672","text":"Journal of vector ecology : journal of the Society for Vector Ecology^\nEffects of woody plant encroachment by eastern redcedar on mosquito communities in Oklahoma.^\nWoody plant encroachment into grasslands is occurring worldwide, affecting ecosystems in ways that likely influence mosquito-borne disease transmission. In the U.S. Great Plains, encroachment by eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) (ERC) may be expanding conducive habitat for mosquitoes and their hosts, but few studies have evaluated associations between ERC encroachment and West Nile virus (WNV). To test the hypotheses that mosquito abundance and WNV-infected mosquitoes increase with increasing ERC cover, we collected mosquitoes in 32 sites in Oklahoma reflecting various ERC encroachment stages. We found support for our first hypothesis, as mean abundance of Aedes albopictus increased significantly with ERC cover. However, Psorophora columbiae and Anopheles quadrimaculatus abundance decreased with increasing ERC. There was no significant association with ERC for other mosquito species. We could not test our second hypothesis due to low WNV prevalence, but the only detected WNV-infected pool of mosquitoes (Cx. tarsalis) was collected in ERC. Our results suggest ERC encroachment increases abundance of at least one medically important mosquito species, but further research is needed to clarify how encroachment affects ecology of the entire WNV disease system through changes to vector and host communities, vector-host interactions, and thus disease transmission and prevalence. Understanding relationships between woody plant encroachment and the nidus of infection for mosquito-borne diseases will be crucial for targeting public health efforts, including land management activities that limit and/or eradicate woody plant encroachment, particularly in areas with high levels of disease risk.","_input_hash":862332700,"_task_hash":912170636,"spans":[{"text":"prevalence","start":1123,"end":1133,"pattern":1787723395},{"text":"prevalence","start":1553,"end":1563,"pattern":1787723395}],"meta":{"pattern":"45, 45"},"options":[{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1701080782}

There is accumulating evidence indicating a central role for the previously unknown but ubiquitous endocannabinoid physiological control system (EPCS) in the regulation of the rewarding effects of abused substances. Thus an endocannabinoid hypothesis of drug reward is postulated. Endocannabinoids mediate retrograde signaling in neuronal tissues and are involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission to suppress neurotransmitter release by the presynaptic cannabinoid receptors (CB-Rs). This powerful modulatory action on synaptic transmission has significant functional implications and interactions with the effects of abused substances. Our data, along with those from other investigators, provide strong new evidence for a role for EPCS modulation in the effects of drugs of abuse, and specifically for involvement of cannabinoid receptors in the neural basis of addiction. Cannabinoids and endocannabinoids appear to be involved in adding to the rewarding effects of addictive substances, including, nicotine, opiates, alcohol, cocaine, and BDZs. The results suggest that the EPCS may be an important natural regulatory mechanism for drug reward and a target for the treatment of addictive disorders.","_input_hash":1003168316,"_task_hash":-1159019145,"spans":[{"text":"therapeutic","start":205,"end":216,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"39"},"options":[{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-systematic-review"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1701080839}

Although most studies have focused on the pathology of the injured brain, we have noted that the liver plays an important role in TBI. Using two mouse models of TBI, we found that the enzymatic activity of hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) was rapidly decreased and then returned to normal levels following TBI, whereas such changes were not observed in the kidney, heart, spleen, or lung. Interestingly, genetic downregulation of hepatic Ephx2 (which encodes sEH) ameliorates TBI-induced neurological deficits and promotes neurological function recovery, whereas overexpression of hepatic sEH exacerbates TBI-associated neurological impairments. Furthermore, hepatic sEH ablation was found to promote the generation of A2 phenotype astrocytes and facilitate the production of various neuroprotective factors associated with astrocytes following TBI. We also observed an inverted V-shaped alteration in the plasma levels of four EET (epoxyeicosatrienoic acid) isoforms (5,6-, 8,9-,11,12-, and 14,15-EET) following TBI which were negatively correlated with hepatic sEH activity. However, hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally regulates the plasma levels of 14,15-EET, which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, we found that the application of 14,15-EET mimicked the neuroprotective effect of hepatic sEH ablation, while 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid blocked this effect, indicating that the increased plasma levels of 14,15-EET mediated the neuroprotective effect observed after hepatic sEH ablation. These results highlight the neuroprotective role of the liver in TBI and suggest that targeting hepatic EET signaling could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating TBI.","_input_hash":-388168920,"_task_hash":-1056481674,"spans":[{"text":"mouse","start":440,"end":445,"pattern":-1086236359},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1973,"end":1984,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"73, 39"},"options":[{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Animal-other"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1701080871}

DTI measures (i.e., fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) and histopathology measures were obtained from 2 tracts: the anterior thalamic radiation and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.\tFA was reduced in both tracts and MD was increased in cases with CAA compared to controls. Regional FA was significantly correlated with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, axonal density, and white matter microinfarcts. MD correlated significantly with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, and white matter microinfarcts, but not axonal density. FA and MD did not correlate with oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or gliosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that tissue rarefaction (\u03b2 = -0.32 \u00b1 0.12, p = 0.009) and axonal density (\u03b2 = 0.25 \u00b1 0.12, p = 0.04) were both independently associated with FA, whereas myelin density was independently associated with MD (\u03b2 = -0.32 \u00b1 0.12, p = 0.013).

Most ALS research in the past decade has focused on the neurotoxicity of mutant SOD1, and this knowledge has directed therapeutic strategies. We recently identified TDP-43 as the major pathological protein in sporadic ALS. In this study, we investigated TDP-43 in a larger series of ALS cases (n = 111), including familial cases with and without SOD1 mutations.\tUbiquitin and TDP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed on postmortem tissue from sporadic ALS (n = 59), ALS with SOD1 mutations (n = 15), SOD-1-negative FALS (n = 11), and ALS with dementia (n = 26). Biochemical analysis was performed on representative cases from each group.\tAll cases of sporadic ALS, ALS with dementia, and SOD1-negative FALS had neuronal and glial inclusions that were immunoreactive for both ubiquitin and TDP-43.

Biochemical analysis of postmortem tissue from sporadic ALS and SOD1-negative FALS demonstrated pathological forms of TDP-43 that were absent in cases with SOD1 mutations.\tThese findings implicate pathological TDP-43 in the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS.

However, the relationship between the mechanical impact level and neurological severity following weight-drop-induced TBI remains uncertain. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the relationship between physical impact and graded severity at various weight-drop heights.\tThe acceleration, impact force, and displacement during the impact were accurately measured using an accelerometer, a pressure sensor, and a high-speed camera, respectively. In addition, the longitudinal changes in neurological deficits and balance function were investigated at 1, 4, and 7 days post TBI lesion. The inflammatory expression markers tested by Western blot analysis, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, beta-amyloid precursor protein, and bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X, in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were investigated at 1 and 7 days post-lesion.\tGradations in impact pressure produced progressive degrees of injury severity in the neurological score and balance function. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all inflammatory expression markers were increased at 1 and 7 days post-impact injury when compared to the sham control rats. The severity of neurologic dysfunction and induction in inflammatory markers strongly correlated with the graded mechanical impact levels.\tWe conclude that the weight-drop-induced TBI model can produce graded brain injury and induction of neurobehavioral deficits and may have translational relevance to developing therapeutic strategies for TBI.","_input_hash":184574531,"_task_hash":-451011795,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":94,"end":97,"pattern":-569153227},{"text":"animal","start":317,"end":323,"pattern":-1575063083},{"text":"study","start":579,"end":584,"pattern":560847459},{"text":"longitudinal","start":902,"end":914,"pattern":-959651259},{"text":"score","start":1423,"end":1428,"pattern":1310160002},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1932,"end":1943,"pattern":1547368071}],"meta":{"pattern":"84, 59, 2, 44, 52, 39"},"options":[{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-case-report"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1701080944}
