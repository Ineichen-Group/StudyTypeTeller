{"pmid":"21118153","text":"Biochemical Society transactions^\nCINister thoughts.^\nChromosome instability (CIN) is the process that leads to aneuploidy, a known hallmark of human tumours for over a century. Nowadays, it is believed that CIN promotes tumorigenesis by shuffling the genome into a malignant order through translocations, amplifications, deletions (structural CIN), and gains and losses of whole chromosomes (numerical CIN or nCIN). The present review focuses on the causes and consequences of nCIN. Several roads can lead to nCIN, including a compromised spindle assembly checkpoint, cohesion defects, p53 deficiency and flawed microtubule-kinetochore attachments. Whereas the link between nCIN and tumorigenesis is becoming more evident, indications have emerged recently that nCIN can suppress tumour formation as well. To understand these paradoxical findings, novel reagents and more sophisticated mouse models are needed. This will provide us with a better understanding of nCIN and eventually with therapies that exploit this characteristic of human tumours.","_input_hash":66877021,"_task_hash":-2101435115,"spans":[{"text":"human","start":144,"end":149,"pattern":-777922570},{"text":"review","start":429,"end":435,"pattern":-1744616901},{"text":"mouse","start":887,"end":892,"pattern":-317781926},{"text":"human","start":1035,"end":1040,"pattern":-777922570}],"meta":{"pattern":"0, 3, 73, 0"},"options":[{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","config":{"choice_style":"single"},"accept":["Animal-systematic-review"],"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1700655220}

However, since cerebral ischemia patients are in old age group, the safety information needs to be confirmed. For the feasibility of H2 treatment in these patients, delivery of H2 by inhalation method needs to be checked for consistency.\tHydrogen concentration (HC) in the arterial and venous blood was measured by gas chromatography on 3 patients, before, during and after 4% (case 1) and 3% (case2,3) H2 gas inhalation with simultaneous monitoring of physiological parameters. For a consistency study, HC in the venous blood of 10 patients were obtained on multiple occasions at the end of 30-min H2 inhalation treatment.\tThe HC gradually reached a plateau level in 20 min after H2 inhalation in the blood, which was equivalent to the level reported by animal experiments. The HC rapidly decreased to 10% of the plateau level in about 6 min and 18 min in arterial and venous blood, respectively after H2 inhalation was discontinued. Physiological parameters on these 3 patients were essentially unchanged by use of hydrogen. The consistency study of 10 patients showed the HC at the end of 30-min inhalation treatment was quite variable but the inconsistency improved with more attention and encouragement.\tH2 inhalation of at least 3% concentration for 30 min delivered enough HC, equivalent to the animal experiment levels, in the blood without compromising the safety.

In this study, we used the Tg2576 AD mouse model to test the hypothesis that cognitive improvement following 1 month of PPAR gamma agonism with rosiglitazone (RTZ) correlates with peripheral gluco-regulatory status. We assessed cognition and peripheral gluco-regulatory status of Tg2576 mice following 1 month treatment with RTZ initiated prior to, coincident with, or after, the onset of peripheral gluco-regulatory abnormalities (4, 8, and 12 months of age, respectively). Whereas 5 months old (MO) and 13 MO Tg2576 did not gain cognitive improvement after 1 month treatment with RTZ, 9 MO Tg2576 mice exhibited reversal of associative learning and memory deficits. Peripheral gluco-regulatory abnormalities were improved in 9 and 13 MO Tg2576 with RTZ treatment; RTZ treatment had no effect on the normal glucose status of 5 MO Tg2576 mice. These findings suggest that RTZ-mediated cognitive improvement does not correlate with peripheral gluco-regulatory abnormalities per se, but reflects the age-dependent mechanistic differences that underlie cognitive decline in this mouse model.","_input_hash":2107501400,"_task_hash":-147029018,"spans":[{"text":"study","start":332,"end":337,"pattern":1866335380},{"text":"mouse","start":361,"end":366,"pattern":-317781926},{"text":"mice","start":611,"end":615,"pattern":-1996832754},{"text":"mice","start":923,"end":927,"pattern":-1996832754},{"text":"mice","start":1162,"end":1166,"pattern":-1996832754},{"text":"mouse","start":1400,"end":1405,"pattern":-317781926}],"meta":{"pattern":"2, 73, 74, 74, 74, 73"},"options":[{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","config":{"choice_style":"single"},"accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1700664833}

The present study evaluated the dose effectiveness and therapeutic time window of neuroprotection of XQ-1H by behavioral and histological measures in rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Neurological deficits, TTC stain, brain water content, necrosis neuron counts, and Evans-Blue extravasation were used to quantify brain damage and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Our results demonstrated that postischemic treatment with XQ-1H at a dose of 31.2 mg/kg produced a significant reduction in neurological scores when treatment was initiated within 2 h of pMCAO. A similar improvement was also observed in infarct volume, brain water content, Evans-Blue extravasation, and neuronal necrosis when treatment was initiated within 1 h of pMCAO. Treatment with XQ-1H at the dose of 15.6 mg/kg within 1 h also produced significant improvement in ischemia deficit. In conclusion, the therapeutic time window of XQ-1H extends for up to 1 h after pMCAO, and treatment with XQ-1H exhibits potent neuroprotection that may be of value for the design of stroke therapies.","_input_hash":910433956,"_task_hash":-492237287,"spans":[{"text":"rat","start":64,"end":67,"pattern":-1800265025},{"text":"in vitro","start":281,"end":289,"pattern":1922092709},{"text":"study","start":377,"end":382,"pattern":1866335380},{"text":"therapeutic","start":420,"end":431,"pattern":1031461305},{"text":"therapeutic","start":1273,"end":1284,"pattern":1031461305}],"meta":{"pattern":"84, 63, 2, 39, 39"},"options":[{"id":"Human-systematic-review","text":"Human-systematic-review"},{"id":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-RCT-non-intervention","text":"Human-RCT-non-intervention"},{"id":"Human-case-report","text":"Human-case-report"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention","text":"Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-systematic-review","text":"Animal-systematic-review"},{"id":"Animal-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-non-drug-intervention","text":"Animal-non-drug-intervention"},{"id":"Animal-other","text":"Animal-other"},{"id":"Non-systematic-review","text":"Non-systematic-review"},{"id":"Remaining","text":"Remaining"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":["Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention"],"config":{"choice_style":"single"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1700664871}
