Nowadays, it is believed that CIN promotes tumorigenesis by shuffling the genome into a malignant order through translocations, amplifications, deletions (structural CIN), and gains and losses of whole chromosomes (numerical CIN or nCIN). The present review focuses on the causes and consequences of nCIN. Several roads can lead to nCIN, including a compromised spindle assembly checkpoint, cohesion defects, p53 deficiency and flawed microtubule-kinetochore attachments. Whereas the link between nCIN and tumorigenesis is becoming more evident, indications have emerged recently that nCIN can suppress tumour formation as well. To understand these paradoxical findings, novel reagents and more sophisticated mouse models are needed. This will provide us with a better understanding of nCIN and eventually with therapies that exploit this characteristic of human tumours."}

HDLs may also modulate leukocyte and platelet activation, which may also represent an important target that would justify the use of HDL-based therapy in acute stroke.

However, since cerebral ischemia patients are in old age group, the safety information needs to be confirmed. For the feasibility of H2 treatment in these patients, delivery of H2 by inhalation method needs to be checked for consistency.	Hydrogen concentration (HC) in the arterial and venous blood was measured by gas chromatography on 3 patients, before, during and after 4% (case 1) and 3% (case2,3) H2 gas inhalation with simultaneous monitoring of physiological parameters. For a consistency study, HC in the venous blood of 10 patients were obtained on multiple occasions at the end of 30-min H2 inhalation treatment.	The HC gradually reached a plateau level in 20 min after H2 inhalation in the blood, which was equivalent to the level reported by animal experiments. The HC rapidly decreased to 10% of the plateau level in about 6 min and 18 min in arterial and venous blood, respectively after H2 inhalation was discontinued. Physiological parameters on these 3 patients were essentially unchanged by use of hydrogen. The consistency study of 10 patients showed the HC at the end of 30-min inhalation treatment was quite variable but the inconsistency improved with more attention and encouragement.	H2 inhalation of at least 3% concentration for 30 min delivered enough HC, equivalent to the animal experiment levels, in the blood without compromising the safety. However, the consistency of H2 delivery by inhalation needs to be improved."}

XQ-1H exerts neuroprotective effects under various neurotoxic conditions in vitro. In vivo, it reduces brain damage after transient focal cerebral ischemia. The present study evaluated the dose effectiveness and therapeutic time window of neuroprotection of XQ-1H by behavioral and histological measures in rats subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Neurological deficits, TTC stain, brain water content, necrosis neuron counts, and Evans-Blue extravasation were used to quantify brain damage and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Our results demonstrated that postischemic treatment with XQ-1H at a dose of 31.2 mg/kg produced a significant reduction in neurological scores when treatment was initiated within 2 h of pMCAO. A similar improvement was also observed in infarct volume, brain water content, Evans-Blue extravasation, and neuronal necrosis when treatment was initiated within 1 h of pMCAO. Treatment with XQ-1H at the dose of 15.6 mg/kg within 1 h also produced significant improvement in ischemia deficit. In conclusion, the therapeutic time window of XQ-1H extends for up to 1 h after pMCAO, and treatment with XQ-1H exhibits potent neuroprotection that may be of value for the design of stroke therapies."}

Although spontaneous recovery of pre-stroke functioning occurs in some cases, the process is demanding, slow, and often incomplete. A first step in the preclinical testing of new putative, neuroprotective and recovery-supporting therapeutics is to validate animal models of brain injury. In a series of four experiments we evaluated the behavioural impairments and the time course of recovery of functional deficits in rats with an experimentally induced subdural haematoma. We found that unilateral subdural haematoma resulted in dysfunction in both simple reflexive (experiment 1) and skilled sensorimotor behaviour (experiment 2). Reflexive behaviour did not recover, or recovered only marginally, and neither did the deficits in skilled forepaw use. Bilateral subdural haematoma impaired the learning and memory performance of adult (experiment 3) and old rats (experiment 4) in the Morris water escape task.

One-year-old rats were treated with tianma (~2.5 g/kg/day) for 3months and the brain tissue proteome was analyzed by using the iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification) technology. According to our results, the long-term treatment with tianma could modulate the brain protein metabolism at the proteome level by down-regulating the expressions of various proteins, such as Gnao1 and Dctn2, which are related to neuronal growth cone control and synaptic activities. In addition, tianma treatment also induced the up-regulation of molecular chaperons and proteins related to the misfolded protein response, like Anxa5, and also other proteins involved in Huntington's disease (HD) (e.g. Pacsin1 and Arf3).

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms and therapeutic effects of TMP on SCI.	A contusion SCI model was established that used a modified Allen's method. In the TMP group, TMP (200 mg/kg) was injected daily for 5 days post-injury, while in the Negative Control (NC) group, an equal volume of normal saline was injected. Hindlimb motor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) scale. The effects of TMP on protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2) and 9 (MMP9), Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were determined by western blotting. Apoptotic changes in vascular endothelial cells were evaluated using immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining.

However, what factor(s) is involved in the differentiation process has not been explored out thoroughly. Because pleiotrophin (PTN) is known to exert important trophic effects on DA neurons, in the present study, we investigated whether PTN is released by AECs and whether it is involved in the differentiation of hUCB-MSCs into DA neuron-like cells. The expression and secretion of PTN by AECs were detected by immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and ELISA. The hUCB-MSCs were isolated and treated with AEC-conditioned medium (ACM) or recombinant human PTN. Compared to the controls, a higher proportion of treated cells differentiated into DA neuron-like cells, indicated by the increased expression of TH and DAT and the increased dopamine content.

We conclude that the majority of phenotypes attributed to the monomeric G protein RhoA and mediated by its effector, Rho-kinase (ROK), reflect Ca2+ sensitization: inhibition of myosin II dephosphorylation in the presence of basal (Ca2+ dependent or independent) or increased MLCK activity. We outline the pathway from receptors through trimeric G proteins (Galphaq, Galpha12, Galpha13) to activation, by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), from GDP. RhoA. GDI to GTP. RhoA and hence to ROK through a mechanism involving association of GEF, RhoA, and ROK in multimolecular complexes at the lipid cell membrane. Specific domains of GEFs interact with trimeric G proteins, and some GEFs are activated by Tyr kinases whose inhibition can inhibit Rho signaling. Inhibition of MLCP, directly by ROK or by phosphorylation of the phosphatase inhibitor CPI-17, increases phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory light chain and thus the activity of smooth muscle and nonmuscle actomyosin ATPase and motility. We summarize relevant effects of p21-activated kinase, LIM-kinase, and focal adhesion kinase. Mechanisms of Ca2+ desensitization are outlined with emphasis on the antagonism between cGMP-activated kinase and the RhoA/ROK pathway. We suggest that the RhoA/ROK pathway is constitutively active in a number of organs under physiological conditions; its aberrations play major roles in several disease states, particularly impacting on Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle in hypertension and possibly asthma and on cancer neoangiogenesis and cancer progression.

However, the molecular mechanisms associated with the neuronal cell death induced by the nonfibrillar Abeta remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of the cytosolic Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), and its associated metabolic pathway, i.e., the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade, in the apoptotic cell death induced by soluble oligomers of Abeta. The treatment of rat cortical neurons with low concentrations of soluble Abeta(1-40) or Abeta(1-42) peptide resulted in an early calcium-dependent release of AA associated with a transient relocalization of cPLA2. Both cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotides and a selective inhibitor of cPLA2 activity abolished the release of AA from neurons and also protected cells against apoptosis induced by Abeta. Furthermore, inhibitors of the PKC, p38, and MEK/ERK pathways that are involved in cPLA2 phosphorylation and activation reduced Abeta-induced cell death. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 reduced the Abeta-induced cell death by 55%.

A distinct overlapping vector approach uses homologous recombination between overlapping regions in two independent vectors. Using the beta-galactosidase gene as template, trans-splicing approaches were threefold (in primary fibroblasts) and 12-fold (in muscle tissue) more effective in generating full-length transgene products than the overlapping vector approach. Nevertheless, the efficiency of trans-splicing remained moderate at approximately 4.3% (for muscle) and 7% (for fibroblasts) of that seen with a single vector encoding the full-length transgene. The efficiency of trans-splicing was augmented 1185-fold by adenoviral E4, but not E2a, gene products. This augmentation was much less pronounced with the overlapping vectoring approach (12-fold). Trans-splicing and overlapping vector approaches are two viable alternatives to expand rAAV packaging capacity."}

The principal etiopathogenic factors are the degree of nigro-striatal dopaminergic loss and the duration and dose of l-dopa treatment. In this review article we concentrate on analysis of the mechanisms underlying l-dopa-induced dyskinesias, a phenomenon that causes disability in a proportion of patients and that has not benefited from major therapeutic advances. Thus, we discuss the main neurotransmitters, receptors, and pathways that have been thought to play a role in l-dopa-induced dyskinesias from the perspective of basic neuroscience studies. Some important advances in deciphering the molecular pathways involved in these abnormal movements have occurred in recent years to reveal potential targets that could be used for therapeutic purposes. However, it has not been an easy road because there have been a plethora of components involved in the generation of these undesired movements, even bypassing the traditional and well-accepted dopamine receptor activation, as recently revealed by optogenetics. Here, we attempt to unify the available data with the hope of guiding and fostering future research in the field of striatal activation and abnormal movement generation. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."}

For comparison, the effects of the selective A2 adenosine receptor agonist, CGS 21680 were tested. 2. Five-min bilateral carotid occlusion produced within 1 week an irreversible suppression of the CA1, but not of the dentate extracellular electrical somatic responses, in 30% of gerbil hippocampal slices with respect to controls. In addition, a significant reduction occurred in the density of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurones but not of dentate granule cells with respect to controls. 3. Injection 1 h before or after bilateral carotid occlusion of L-PIA (0.8-1.5 mg kg-1, i.p.) but not of CGS 21680 (5 mg kg-1, i.p.), significantly prevented the irreversible disappearance of the CA1 extracellular electrical somatic responses with respect to controls. In addition, the CA1 pyramidal neuronal loss was also prevented. 4. The results show that activation of A1 adenosine receptors is able to prevent or block the electrophysiological and morphological correlates of hippocampal neuronal injury after global ischaemia in the gerbil, suggesting that adenosine receptor agonists might have a useful role in the treatment of neuronal functional and anatomical injury due to ischaemia."}

The superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)(G93A) mutant mouse is a frequently used animal model of ALS. We hypothesized that resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenolic molecule that enhances mammalian NAD(+)-dependent SIRT1 deacetylases and may increase life span, would improve motor function and survival in the SOD1 mouse model via modulation of p53 acetylation. Data were collected for mean survival times, neuromuscular performance on the ROTOR-ROD™ (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA), body weight, and p53 acetylation. Mean survival times were not statistically different (P=.23) between control and experimental (RSV-fed) groups (mean +/- SD, control [n=11] 138 +/- 6 days vs. experimental [n=10] 135 +/- 8 days). Performance was not significantly different between groups at time points corresponding to 50%, 80%, and 90% mean life span (P=.46), nor did RSV treatment attenuate body weight loss. Thus although manipulation of SIRT1 deacetylase activity has effects at the protein level in healthy aging organisms, we conclude that RSV treatment does not lead to functional improvement or increased longevity in a mouse model of ALS. We speculate that RSV-mediated modulation of p53 acetylation is either incapable of increasing or insufficient to increase motor performance and longevity in this model of ALS."}

Fermented rice bran (FRB) was prepared by dual fermentation of rice bran using fungi and lactic acid bacteria. The effect of FRB on metabolic syndrome in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) was investigated by single and chronic supplementation.	Dual fermentation of rice bran enriches the functional value of rice bran. Single-dose oral administration of FRB (2 g/kg body weight) reduced systolic blood pressure; however, chronic supplementation with 5 % FRB (4 weeks) significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. FRB supplementation improved leptin impairment and increased serum adiponectin levels and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity. Furthermore, FRB supplementation improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity as well as serum insulin levels. Lipid profiles were also improved by the regulation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation. Moreover, supplementation with FRB reduced the expressions of hepatic transcription factors such as liver X receptor alpha, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein alpha, as well as their target genes. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with FRB may lower hypertension and alleviate metabolic syndrome.	Metabolic syndrome was better alleviated with FRB supplementation. We therefore suggest FRB as an alternative medicine to reduce the risks of lifestyle-related diseases."}

Mice derived from these mutant blastocysts develop human-like diseases, either at developmental stages or in the adult, but blastocyst injection of ESCs prevents disease from occurring. Rather than entirely repopulating the affected organs, with just 20% of chimerism, the ESCs replenish protein levels that are absent in mutant mice, and induce novel or 'neomorphic' signals that help circumvent the requirements for the mutations. We also show data indicating that the 'neomorphic' mechanisms arise as a result of blastocyst injection of ESCs, regardless of the nature of the host blastocyst (mutant or wild-type).

The functional role of specific chemokines was studied in vitro and in vivo. The expression of some chemokine receptors was upregulated upon leukemic relapse, both in B- and in T-ALL, and in cases of medullary and extramedullary involvement. CXCL10 induced chemotaxis in leukemic cell lines and in primary leukemic cells, depending upon the levels of CXCR3 expression. CXCL10 specifically diminished chemotherapy-induced apoptosis on ALL cells expressing CXCR3, partially inhibiting caspase activation and maintaining the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Finally, immunodeficient mice engrafted with CXCR3-expressing human leukemic cells showed decreased infiltration of marrow, spleen, and CNS after receiving a CXCR3-antagonist molecule. CXCR3 signaling in ALL may have a dual function: chemotactic for the localisation of leukemic blasts in specific niches, and it may also confer resistance to chemotherapy, enhancing the chances for relapses."}

Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors. The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for dopamine, opioid, GABA(A) and NMDA receptors. In behavioral studies, pre-treatment of mice with BD1018, BD1063, or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality. Moreover, post-treatment with LR132 prevented cocaine-induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals. In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists, the well-characterized sigma receptor agonist di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) and the novel sigma receptor agonist BD1031 (3R-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane) each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine.

To further validate the hypothesis that the anti-cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine.

Yet, it is still debatable whether oligomers are formed as part of a multistep process towards amyloid fibril formation or alternatively as 'off-pathway' aggregates.	100μM α-syn was incubated with decreasing amounts of cinnamon extract precipitation (CEppt). The fibril formation was measured using spectroscopy and microscopy analyses and oligomers were detected using western blot analysis. The secondary structure of the protein was analyzed using CD. Drosophila brains were studied using immunostaining and confocal microscopy.	Here we probed the inhibition pattern of oligomeric and fibrillar forms of α-syn, using a natural substance, CEppt which was previously shown to effectively inhibit aggregation of β-amyloid polypeptide. We demonstrated that CEppt has a differential inhibitory effect on the formation of soluble and insoluble aggregates of α-synuclein in vitro. This inhibition pattern revokes the possibility of redirection to 'off-pathway' oligomers. When administering to Drosophila fly model expressing mutant A53T α-syn in the nervous system, a significant curative effect on the behavioral symptoms of the flies and on α-syn aggregation in their brain was observed.	We conclude that CEppt affects the process of aggregation of α-syn without changing its secondary structure and suggest that increasing amounts of CEppt slow this process by stabilizing the soluble oligomeric phase. When administered to Drosophila fly model, CEppt appears to have a curative effect on the defective flies.	Our results indicate that CEppt can be a potential therapeutic agent for PD."}

Four human and five porcine cross-sectional surveys were carried out from 2012 to 2015 in Mbozi and Mbeya district in Tanzania. Three rounds of school-based MDA of praziquantel were delivered in Mbozi and two in Mbeya. The prevalence of taeniosis and porcine cysticercosis was estimated annually. Stool samples were collected from humans and prevalence of taeniosis estimated by copro-Ag-ELISA. Blood samples from pigs were collected to estimate cysticercosis prevalence by Ag-ELISA. 'Track-and-treat' of taeniosis cases was carried out after each survey. In total 12082 stool samples and 4579 porcine serum samples were collected. Significantly fewer children (≤ 15) from Mbozi were infected throughout the study than children from Mbeya who showed a significant decrease in copro-Ag prevalence after the first treatment only. During the final survey in Mbozi the prevalence of taeniosis in adults (1.8%) was significantly lower (p = 0.031, OR 0.40, CI: 0.17-0.89), compared to baseline (4.1%). The prevalence of porcine cysticercosis (8%) had also dropped significantly (p = 0.002, OR 0.49, CI: 0.32-0.76) in this district compared to baseline (13%), whereas no significant difference was seen in Mbeya compared to baseline. The study suggests that three rounds of MDA targeting schistosomiasis in school-aged children combined with 'track-and-treat' contributed to a reduction in prevalence of T. solium in this population, and also had a spillover effect on adults in treated areas as well as reducing the prevalence of T. solium in the intermediate pig host population. Elimination of T. solium in this area would require a One Health approach."}

The present study tests the hypothesis that hypoxia results in NO-mediated modification of Na+, K+-ATPase in the fetal brain. Studies were conducted in guinea pig fetuses of 58-days gestation. The mothers were exposed to FiO2 of 0.07% for 1 hour. Brain tissue hypoxia in the fetus was confirmed biochemically by decreased ATP and phosphocreatine levels. P2 membrane fractions were prepared from normoxic and hypoxic fetuses and divided into untreated and treated groups. The membranes were treated with 0.5 mM peroxynitrite at pH 7.6. The Na+, K+-ATPase activity was determined at 37 degrees C for five minutes in a medium containing 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 6.0 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.4, 3.0 mM ATP with or without 10 mM ouabain. Ouabain sensitive activity was referred to as Na+, K+-ATPase activity. Following peroxynitrite exposure, the activity of Na+, K+-ATPase in guinea pig brain was reduced by 36% in normoxic membranes and further 29% in hypoxic membranes. Enzyme kinetics was determined at varying concentrations of ATP (0.5 mM-2.0 mM). The results indicate that peroxynitrite treatment alters the affinity of the active site of Na+, K+-ATPase for ATP and decreases the Vmax by 35% in hypoxic membranes. When compared to untreated normoxic membranes Vmax decreases by 35.6% in treated normoxic membranes and further to 52% in treated hypoxic membranes. The data show that peroxynitrite treatment induces modification of Na+, K+-ATPase. The results demonstrate that peroxynitrite decreased activity of Na+, K+-ATPase enzyme by altering the active sites as well as the microenvironment of the enzyme. We propose that nitric oxide synthase-mediated formation of peroxynitrite during hypoxia is a potential mechanism of hypoxia-induced decrease in Na+, K+-ATPase activity."}

We aimed at investigating changes of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (AR) indices during induction of deep hypothermia (HT) in a porcine model mimicking the clinical scenario of accidental HT. Thirteen pigs were surface-cooled to a core temperature of 28°C. High-frequency monitoring included brain temperature, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO2), and regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy to calculate AR-indices (pressure reactivity index [PRx], oxygen reactivity index [ORx], and cerebral oximetry index [COx]). Brain temperature decreased from 39.3°C ± 0.8°C to 28.8°C ± 1.0°C within a median 160 minutes (interquartile range 146-191 minutes), reflecting a rapid induction of deep HT (-4°C/h). MAP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) remained stable until a brain temperature of 35°C (69 ± 8 mmHg, 53 ± 7 mmHg) and decreased to 58 ± 17 mmHg and 40 ± 17 mmHg at 28°C (p = 0.031 and p = 0.015). Despite the decrease in MAP and CPP, brain oxygenation increased (PbtO2: +5 mmHg, p = 0.037; rSO2: +7.3%, p = 0.029). There was no change in ICP during HT induction. Baseline AR-indices reflected normal cerebral AR and did not change until a brain temperature of 34°C (ORx), 33°C (PRx), and 30°C (COx). At lower temperature, AR-indices increased (PRx: p < 0.001, ORx: p = 0.02, COx: p = 0.03), reflecting impaired cerebral AR. Cerebrovascular reactivity is impaired at lower brain temperature levels. Although these temperatures are usually not targeted in clinical routine, this should be kept in mind when treating patients with accidental deep HT."}

At the acute stage of infection in mice, HSV-1 replication in trigeminal ganglia and brain stem tissue was modestly but consistently enhanced in mice from which IFN-gamma was by ablated monoclonal antibody treatment and in mice genetically lacking the IFN-gamma receptor (Rgko mice). As determined by reverse transcriptase PCR, IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha transcripts were present in trigeminal ganglia during both acute and latent HSV-1 infection. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected initially in trigeminal ganglia at day 5 after HSV-1 inoculation, and these cells persisted for 6 months into latency. The T cells were focused around morphologically normal neurons that showed no signs of active infection, but many of which expressed HSV-1 latency-associated transcripts. Secreted IFN-gamma was present up to 6 months into latency in areas of the T-cell infiltration. By 9 months into latency, both the T-cell infiltrate and IFN-gamma expression had cleared, although there remained a slight increase in macrophage levels in trigeminal ganglia. In HSV-1-infected brain stem tissue, T cells and IFN-gamma expression were present at 1 month but were gone by 6 months after infection. Our hypothesis is that the persistence of T cells and the sustained IFN-gamma expression occur in response to an HSV-1 antigen(s) in the nervous system. This hypothesis is consistent with a new model of HSV-1 latency which suggests that limited HSV-1 antigen expression occurs during latency (M. Kosz-Vnenchak, J. Jacobson, D.M. Coen, and D.M. Knipe, J. Virol. 67:5383-5393, 1993). We speculate that prolonged secretion of IFN-gamma during latency may modulate a reactivated HSV-1 infection."}

We propose a novel molecular model for the pathogenesis of ALS that involves an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent muscle neuronal lactate shuttle (MNLS) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to regulate the flow of lactate from muscle to neurons and vice versa. Failure of the MNLS due to respiratory chain dysfunction is proposed to result in lactate toxicity and degeneration of nerve endings at the NMJ leading to nerve terminus dysjunction from the muscle cell. At a critical threshold where denervation outpaces reinnervation, a vicious cycle is established where the remaining innervated muscle fibers are required to work harder to compensate for normal function, and in so doing produce toxic lactate concentrations which induces further denervation and neuronal death. This mechanism explains the exponential progression of ALS leading to paralysis. The molecular events leading to the dysregulation of the MNLS and the dismantling of NMJ are explained in the context of known ALS familial mutations and age-related endocrine dyscrasia. Combination drug therapies that inhibit lactate accumulation at the NMJ, enhance respiratory chain function, and/or promote reinnervation are predicted to be effective therapeutic strategies for ALS."}

In the present study, we have examined the anticonvulsant activity of Harpagophytum procumbens secondary root aqueous extract (HPE, 50-800 mg/kg i.p.) against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-, picrotoxin (PCT)- and bicuculline (BCL)-induced seizures in mice. Phenobarbitone and diazepam were used as reference anticonvulsant drugs for comparison. Like the reference anticonvulsant agents used, H. procumbens secondary root aqueous extract (HPE, 100-800 mg/kg i.p.) significantly (P<0.05-0.001) delayed the onset of, and antagonized, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. The plant's extract (HPE, 100-800 mg/kg i.p.) also profoundly antagonized picrotoxin (PCT)-induced seizures, but only partially and weakly antagonized bicuculline (BCL)-induced seizures. Although the data obtained in the present study do not provide conclusive evidence, it would appear that H. procumbens secondary root aqueous extract (HPE) produces its anticonvulsant activity by enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission and/or facilitating GABAergic action in the brain. In general, the average onset of convulsion was delayed, while the average duration of convulsion was markedly reduced. The plant's extract also depressed the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, thought that the anticonvulsant property of the herb may be linked, at least in part, to its ability to depress the central nervous system. However, the results of this experimental animal study indicate that H. procumbens secondary root aqueous extract possesses anticonvulsant activity, and thus lend pharmacological support to the suggested folkloric, ethnomedical uses of the plant's extract in the treatment, management and/or control of epilepsy and childhood convulsions in some rural communities of South Africa."}

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common life- threatening, hereditary disease. ADPKD is more prevalent than Huntington's disease, haemophilia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, myotonic dystrophy and Down's syndrome combined. Early diagnosis and treatment of hypertension with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and its potential protective effect on left ventricular hypertrophy has been one of the major therapeutic goals to decrease cardiac complications and contribute to improved prognosis of the disease. Advances in the understanding of the genetics, molecular biology and pathophysiology of the disease are likely to facilitate the improvement of treatments for these diseases. Developments in describing the role of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) and its correlation with cellular signalling systems, Ras/Raf/mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), and interaction of these pathways with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, provide new insights on treatment strategies. Blocking the vasopressin V(2) receptor, a major adenylyl cyclase agonist, demonstrated significant improvements in inhibiting cytogenesis in animal models. Because of activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, the use of sirolimus (rapamycin) an mTOR inhibitor, markedly reduced cyst formation and decreased polycystic kidney size in several animal models.

Importantly, M30 elevated MPTP-reduced dopaminergic and transferrin receptor cell count in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Finally, M30 was shown to decrease mitosis and elevate HIF (hypoxia induced factor) which regulates the neurotrophins BDNF, GDNF, VEGF and erythropoietin by elevating their brain levels, thus providing additional protection.

In AD, BBB dysfunction has been associated with amyloid beta (Aß) pathology, but the role of tau in this process is not well characterized. Since increased BBB permeability is found in tauopathies without Aß pathology, like PSP, we suspected that tau accumulation alone could not only be sufficient, but even more important than Aß for BBB damage.	Longitudinal evaluation of brain tissue from the tetracycline-regulatable rTg4510 tau transgenic mouse model showed progressive IgG, T cell and red blood cell infiltration. The Evans blue (EB) dye that is excluded from the brain when the BBB is intact also permeated the brains of rTg4510 mice following peripheral administration, indicative of a bonafide BBB defect, but this was only evident later in life. Thus, despite the marked brain atrophy and inflammation that occurs earlier in this model, BBB integrity is maintained. Interestingly, BBB dysfunction emerged at the same time that perivascular tau emerged around major hippocampal blood vessels. However, when tau expression was suppressed using doxycycline, BBB integrity was preserved, suggesting that the BBB can be stabilized in a tauopathic brain by reducing tau levels.	For the first time, these data demonstrate that tau alone can initiate breakdown of the BBB, but the BBB is remarkably resilient, maintaining its integrity in the face of marked brain atrophy, neuroinflammation and toxic tau accumulation. Moreover, the BBB can recover integrity when tau levels are reduced. Thus, late stage interventions targeting tau may slow the vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia that occur in tauopathies."}

The molecular tweezer CLR01 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of abnormal self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins, including amyloid β-protein, tau, and α-synuclein. This small molecule interferes with aggregation by binding selectively to lysine side chains, changing the charge distribution of aggregation-prone proteins and thereby disrupting aggregate formation. However, the effects of CLR01 in cardiomyocytes undergoing proteotoxic stress have not been explored. Here we assess whether CLR01 can decrease cardiac protein aggregation catalyzed by cardiomyocyte-specific expression of mutated αB-crystallin (CryAB[R][120G]).

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of VB on glioblastoma cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion as well as the mechanism involving signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1).	U87 cells were assigned to different treatments. The MTT assay was used to test cell proliferation, flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis, and a Transwell assay was used for cell migration and invasion. We analyzed the glioblastoma tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Western blot analysis was employed to determine the protein expression of related genes.	Glioblastoma cells exhibited decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and increased apoptosis when treated with VB or TMZ. Western blot analysis revealed elevated SHP-1 expression and reduced phosphorylated (p)-STAT3 expression in glioblastoma cells treated with VB compared with controls. Correspondingly, in a xenograft mouse model treated with VB, glioblastoma tumor volume and growth were decreased. Glioblastoma xenograft tumors treated with VB showed elevated SHP-1, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP expression and reduced p-STAT3, Bcl-2, survivin, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression. siRNA-SHP-1 inhibited the VB effects on glioblastoma.	This study demonstrates that VB inhibits glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting apoptosis via SHP-1 activation and inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation."}

The effects of hydrogen on central nervous system-related diseases have recently become increasingly appreciated, but little is known about whether hydrogen affects the morphine withdrawal process. This study aims to investigate the potential effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) administration on naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms and morphine withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Mice received gradually increasing doses (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) of morphine over 3 days. In the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal procedure, the mice were treated with three HRS (20 μg/kg, i.p.) injections, and naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was given 30 min after HRS administration. Body weight, jumping behavior and wet-dog shakes were immediately assessed. In the spontaneous withdrawal procedure, the mice were treated with HRS (20 μg/kg, i.p.) every 8-h. Mice underwent naloxone-precipitated or spontaneous withdrawal were tested for anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and light/dark box (L/D box) paradigm, respectively. In addition, the levels of plasma corticosterone were measured. We found that HRS administration significantly reduced body weight loss, jumping behavior and wet-dog shakes in mice underwent naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, and attenuated anxiety-like behaviors in the EPM and L/D box tests after naloxone-precipitated withdrawal or a 2-day spontaneous withdrawal period. Hypo-activity or motor impairment after HRS administration was not observed in the locomotion tests. Furthermore, HRS administration significantly decreased the levels of corticosterone in morphine-withdrawn mice. These are the first findings to indicate that hydrogen might ameliorate withdrawal symptoms and exert an anxiolytic-like effect in morphine-withdrawal mice."}

ER stress can be triggered by depletion of ER calcium content and the accumulation of un- and mis-folded proteins, and relays stress signals to the ER mitochondria calcium cycle (ERMCC) and to the nucleus and protein translation machinery. The ensuing unfolded protein response (UPR) helps to cope with ER stress. Total protein synthesis is inhibited to keep protein load low, while the synthesis of ER chaperones, which assist protein folding, is induced. If cell integrity cannot be restored, signal cascades mediating cell death are activated. This review focuses on the role of ER stress and the UPR in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The triggers for ER stress are as yet unclear, but induction of UPR sensor proteins, up-regulation of chaperones and induction of cell death proteins have been described in human post mortem ALS tissue and in mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) expressing models of ALS. TDP-43 and VAPB seem to be involved in UPR signalling as well. Recent reports raise hope that UPR sensor proteins become effective therapeutic targets in the treatment of ALS."}

The P301L transgenic mice well mimic human tauopathy features; P-Tau localizes also at the dendritic spine level and this correlates with synaptic markers down-regulation. Importantly, tg females present a more severe pathology compared to male mice. We describe JNK activation in P301L-tg mice, characterizing by P-JNK and P-c-Jun, cleaved-Caspase-3, P-PSD95 and P-Tau (direct JNK-targets) increased levels in tg vs control mice. These data indicate that JNK stress pathway is involved in neuronal degenerative mechanisms of this mouse model. In addition, P-JNK level is higher in females compared to male tg mice, underlying a sexual dimorphism in the JNK pathway activation. The behavioral studies highlight that tg females present major cognitive and locomotor defects, strongly correlated with a more severe synaptic injury, in comparison to tg male. Notably, at the dendritic spine level, JNK is powerfully activated and its level reveals a sexual dimorphism that is coherent with behavioral defects and spine pathology. The P301L's synaptic pathology is characterized by a strong increase of P-PSD95/PSD95 and P-JNK/JNK ratios and by an augmented level of cleaved-Caspase-3 and a decrease of Drebrin level in the post-synaptic elements. These results suggest that JNK plays a key role in synaptopathy of P301L mice. Importantly, until now, there are any efficient treatments against synaptic pathology and JNK could represent an interesting target to tackle P-Tau-induced synaptic pathology.

Epidemiological studies suggest that environmental factors may be involved beside genetic risk factors. Some studies have shown higher mercury concentrations in brains of deceased and in blood of living patients with Alzheimer's disease. Experimental studies have found that even smallest amounts of mercury but no other metals in low concentrations were able to cause all nerve cell changes, which are typical for Alzheimer's disease. The most important genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease is the presence of the apolipoprotein Ee4 allele whereas the apolipoprotein Ee2 allele reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Some investigators have suggested that apolipoprotein Ee4 has a reduced ability to bind metals like mercury and therefore explain the higher risk for Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic approaches embrace pharmaceuticals which bind metals in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In sum, both the findings from epidemiological and demographical studies, the frequency of amalgam application in industrialized countries, clinical studies, experimental studies and the dental state of AD patients in comparison to controls suggest a decisive role for inorganic mercury in the etiology of AD."}

Novel alginate epicardial (EC) drug releasing platforms were used to deliver dobutamine to the left ventricle of rats. Pressure-volume analyses indicated that although both local and systemic intravenous (i.v.) use of inotropic drugs increase stroke volume and contractility, systemic infusion does so through heart unloading. Conversely, EC application preserves heart load and systemic blood pressure. EC dobutamine increased indices of contractility with minimal rise in heart rate and lower reduction in systemic vascular resistance than i.v. infusion. Drug sampling showed that dobutamine concentration was 650-fold higher in the anterior wall than in the inferior wall. The plasma dobutamine concentration with local delivery was about half as much as with systemic infusion. These data suggest that inotropic EC delivery has a localized effect and augments myocardial contraction by different mechanisms than systemic infusion, with far fewer side effects.

The mechanisms that lead to ER stress and whereby ER stress contributes to the degenerative cascades remain unclear but their understanding is critical to devising effective therapies. Here we show that knockdown of Herp (Homocysteine-inducible ER stress protein), an ER stress-inducible protein with an ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, aggravates ER stress-mediated cell death induced by mutant α-synuclein (αSyn) that causes an inherited form of Parkinson's disease (PD). Functionally, Herp plays a role in maintaining ER homeostasis by facilitating proteasome-mediated degradation of ER-resident Ca(2+) release channels. Deletion of the UBL domain or pharmacological inhibition of proteasomes abolishes the Herp-mediated stabilization of ER Ca(2+) homeostasis. Furthermore, knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of ER Ca(2+) release channels ameliorates ER stress, suggesting that impaired homeostatic regulation of Ca(2+) channels promotes a protracted ER stress with the consequent activation of ER stress-associated apoptotic pathways. Interestingly, sustained upregulation of ER stress markers and aberrant accumulation of ER Ca(2+) release channels were detected in transgenic mutant A53T-αSyn mice. Collectively, these data establish a causative link between impaired ER Ca(2+) homeostasis and chronic ER stress in the degenerative cascades induced by mutant αSyn and suggest that Herp is essential for the resolution of ER stress through maintenance of ER Ca(2+) homeostasis. Our findings suggest a therapeutic potential in PD for agents that increase Herp levels or its ER Ca(2+)-stabilizing action."}

The purpose of this study was to assess the detection of the early changes of PD by either imaging the dopamine transporter (DAT) or uptake of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). An early to advanced stage model of PD was induced in rats by stereotaxic injection of 1-10 microg 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the substantia nigra pars compacta. Using adjacent sections of the same animals, the binding of [I-125]beta-CIT, which labels DAT and the uptake of [C-14]L-DOPA, were evaluated 4 weeks after induction of the lesion. Any decrease in dopaminergic neurons was evaluated by in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISH) by detection of DAT mRNA-positive neurons. In addition, the expression levels of DAT, dopa decarboxylase (DDC), and vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) in each neuron were studied with ISH. Our results show a decrease in both [I-125]beta-CIT binding and [C-14]L-DOPA uptake in parallel with a decrease in DA neurons from early to advanced stage models of PD. The decrease in [C-14]L-DOPA uptake was smaller than that in [I-125]beta-CIT binding in the same animal (P < 0.0001). Expression levels of DAT, DDC, and VMAT2 mRNAs were also decreased with the progression of the disease. Although ISH failed to detect the origin of the discrepancy between [I-125]beta-CIT and [C-14]L-DOPA levels, it was concluded that [C-14]L-DOPA levels underestimated the decrease of dopaminergic neurons and that [I-125]beta-CIT levels more precisely reflected the decrease."}

Deregulated signaling through this pathway contributes to development of gliomas and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway has thus emerged as a promising approach to successful treatment of gliomas. We assessed the radiosensitizing potential of four small-molecule inhibitors that differ in their activities against specific isoforms of the PI3K 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). p110alpha inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of both protein kinase B/Akt and S6 in all cell lines examined, effectively decreased cellular proliferation, and produced additive cytotoxic effects in combination with radiation therapy. The p110beta inhibitor exhibited limited biochemical effects and failed to decrease cellular proliferation or viability as either a single agent or in combination with radiation or rapamycin. In vivo studies examining the effects of the p110alpha inhibitor in combination with radiation indicated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate induced by the combined treatment compared with each treatment modality alone. This translated into a trend toward prolonged time-to-failure for mice in the combination treatment group. In conclusion, PI3K inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of glioblastomas, especially when used in combination with ionizing radiation."}

Of these, only the neurodegenerative diseases represent a class of disease so poorly understood that no general strategies for prevention or treatment exist. These diseases, which include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are generally fatal and incurable. The first section of this review summarizes the diversity and common features of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on protein misfolding and aggregation-a recurring theme in the molecular pathology. The second section focuses on the particular case of ALS, a late-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of central nervous system motor neurons, leading to paralysis and patient death. Of the 10% of ALS cases that show familial inheritance (familial ALS), the largest subset is caused by mutations in the SOD1 gene, encoding the Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1).

Phaeochromocytoma cells did not grow processes under any of the samples assayed in the time interval explored, but neither showed evidence of dystrophy. The relevance of these findings to the transplantation of different cell types as one of the possible therapies for Parkinson's disease is discussed.

We have shown that syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) prolongs survival and reduces lysosomal storage in many organs of the MPS VII mouse. In this report, we quantify the hearing loss and determine the impact of syngeneic BMT on the development of deafness and the associated pathology in the MPS VII mouse. Eleven weeks after syngeneic BMT performed at birth, treated MPS VII mice had normal auditory-evoked brainstem responses (ABR), whereas untreated MPS VII mice had ABR thresholds 43 dB higher than normal. Treated MPS VII mice had beta-glucuronidase-positive cells in the temporal bone and in the subepithelial connective tissue of the external auditory canal. There was less thickening of the tympanic membrane and middle ear mucosa and decreased distortion of the ossicles and the cochlear bone. Although transplanted MPS VII mice had increased ABR thresholds by 33 weeks of age, four of the six had thresholds 12 to 32 dB lower than untreated mutants. These data indicate that syngeneic BMT in newborn MPS VII mice prevents early hearing loss and, in some animals, results in long-term improved auditory function."}

Understanding the proangiogenic functions of these somatic progenitor subtypes after transplantation is integral to the development of improved cell-based therapies to treat ischemic diseases. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to purify a rare (<0.5%) population of UCB cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH(hi)) activity, a conserved stem/progenitor cell function. ALDH(hi) cells were depleted of mature monocytes and T- and B-lymphocytes and were enriched for early myeloid (CD33) and stem cell-associated (CD34, CD133, and CD117) phenotypes. Although these cells were primarily hematopoietic in origin, UCB ALDH(hi) cells demonstrated a proangiogenic transcription profile and were highly enriched for both multipotent myeloid and endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro. Coculture of ALDH(hi) cells in hanging transwells promoted the survival of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) under growth factor-free and serum-free conditions. On growth factor depleted matrigel, ALDH(hi) cells significantly increased tube-like cord formation by HUVEC. After induction of acute unilateral hind limb ischemia by femoral artery ligation, transplantation of ALDH(hi) cells significantly enhanced the recovery of perfusion in ischemic limbs. Despite transient engraftment in the ischemic hind limb, early recruitment of ALDH(hi) cells into ischemic muscle tissue correlated with increased murine von Willebrand factor blood vessel and CD31+ capillary densities. Thus, UCB ALDH(hi) cells represent a readily available population of proangiogenic progenitors that promote vascular regeneration. This work provides preclinical justification for the development of therapeutic strategies to treat ischemic diseases using UCB-derived ALDH(hi) mixed progenitor cells."}

These newer AEDs symbolize a welcoming future in the management of epilepsy because they are able to produce a remarkable reduction in seizure frequency in up to 40% to 50% of the patients who had been refractory to old generation drugs. Despite the current availability of these new drugs, only a few patients with truly refractory seizures can be made seizure free. Although the newer agents are not superior to that of the older drugs, some have been shown to be non-inferior in terms of their efficacy. They offer additional advantages like better tolerability, ease of use, reduced interaction profile. Even though in most situations the older generation drugs still represent the best choice, advancing studies show that in many conditions, new generation drugs may be entirely vindicated for initial therapy. This urges a need for the search of novel and more efficacious new antiepileptic drugs in the management of uncontrollable seizures. More direct comparisons of newer versus newer and newer versus older drugs in clinical trials, both for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy must be conducted.

For instance, stem cells from the spiral ganglion could be isolated and expanded to regenerate neural structures of the inner ear. It is thus necessary to explore the potential procedures that may promote the proliferation and differentiation of such cochlear neural stem cells. In the present study, we study the effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a known antioxidant, for potential therapeutic use in NSC regeneration. At a non-toxic concentration, EGCG stimulated both proliferation and neurosphere formation in isolated mouse cochlear neural stem cell (NSC) in vitro. Specifically, the neural differentiation of NSC was promoted by EGCG treatment. The up-regulated neural function by EGCG was also supported by the increased calcium spike frequencies and enhanced neurite complexity in NSC-differentiated neurons. Finally, the induced neuron differentiation and Akt activation of cochlear NSC by EGCG were blocked by PI3 kinase inhibition. These data suggested that EGCG acts through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling in cochlea NSC to promote cell growth and neuron differentiation, which may be exploited for the treatment of hearing loss."}

They have now investigated the efficacy of AR inhibitors in the prevention of experimental autoimmune-induced uveitis (EAU) in rats.	Lewis rats were immunized with bovine interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding peptide (IRBP) to develop EAU. Two or 8 days after immunization, the rats started receiving the AR inhibitor fidarestat (7 mg/kg/d; intraperitoneally). They were killed when the disease was at its peak; aqueous humor (AqH) was collected from one eye, and the other eye of each rat was used for histologic studies. The protein concentration and the levels of inflammatory markers were determined in AqH. Immunohistochemical analysis of eye sections was performed to determine the expression of inflammatory markers. The effect of AR inhibition on immune response was investigated in isolated T lymphocytes.	Immunization of rats by IRBP peptide resulted in a significant infiltration of leukocytes in the posterior and the anterior chambers of the eye. Further, EAU caused an increase in the concentration of proteins, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in AqH, and the expression of inflammatory markers such as inducible-nitric oxide synthase and cycloxygenase-2 in the rat eye ciliary bodies and retina. Treatment with fidarestat significantly prevented the EAU-induced ocular inflammatory changes. AR inhibition also prevented the proliferation of spleen-derived T cells isolated from EAU rats in response to the IRBP antigen.	These results suggest that AR could be a novel mediator of bovine IRBP-induced uveitis in rats."}

Central metabolism by brain cytochromes P450 (CYPs) may contribute to interindividual variation in response to drugs. Brain CYPs have unique regional and cell-type expression and induction patterns, and they are regulated independently of their hepatic isoforms. In vitro, these enzymes can metabolize endogenous and xenobiotic substrates including centrally acting drugs, but there is no evidence to date of their in vivo function. This has been difficult to demonstrate in the presence of hepatically derived metabolites that may cross the blood-brain barrier. In addition, because of the membrane location of brain CYPs and the rate limiting effect of endogenous heme levels on the activity and appropriate membrane insertion of some induced CYPs, it has been unclear whether sufficient cofactors and coenzymes are present for constitutive and induced CYP forms to be enzymatically active. We have developed a method using a radiolabeled mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2B1, (3)H-8-methoxypsoralen, to demonstrate for the first time that both the constitutive and induced forms of this enzyme are active in situ in the living rat brain. This methodology provides a novel approach to assess the function of enzymes in extrahepatic tissues, where expression levels are often low.

Although subsequent trials have reportedly failed to replicate these finding, there is a growing body of evidence that Dimebon might be neuroprotective in certain models of neurodegeneration. The precise mechanism by which Dimebon is thought to act in AD is unclear, though changes in receptor activity, mitochondria function, and autophagy activity have been proposed. It is thus necessary to test Dimebon in transgenic animal model systems to determine if and how the drug affects development and manifestation of pathology, and which pathogenic processes are altered. In the present study we treated mice harboring five familial mutations associated with hereditary AD (5xFAD line) with a chronic regime of Dimebon. The compound was not found to improve the general health or motor behavior of these mice, nor prevent accumulation of Aβ peptides in the brain.

A wealth of data now demonstrates the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) towards unraveling complex neural connectivity operative in health and disease. A means to improve MRI sensitivity is through contrast agents and notably manganese (Mn[2+]). The Mn[2+] ions enter neurons through voltage-gated calcium channels and unlike other contrast agents such as gadolinium, iron oxide, iron platinum and imaging proteins, provide unique insights into brain physiology. Nonetheless, a critical question that remains is the brain target cells serving as sources for the signal of Mn[2+] enhanced MRI (MEMRI). To this end, we investigated MEMRI's abilities to detect glial (astrocyte and microglia) and neuronal activation signals following treatment with known inflammatory inducing agents. The idea is to distinguish between gliosis (glial activation) and neuronal injury for the MEMRI signal and as such use the agent as a marker for neural activity in inflammatory and degenerative disease. We now demonstrate that glial inflammation facilitates Mn[2+] neuronal ion uptake. Glial Mn[2+] content was not linked to its activation. MEMRI performed on mice injected intracranially with lipopolysaccharide was associated with increased neuronal activity. These results support the notion that MEMRI reflects neuronal excitotoxicity and impairment that can occur through a range of insults including neuroinflammation.

We advance the hypothesis that these failures can arise as a partial consequence of derangements to one-carbon (1-C) metabolism (i.e. metabolic pathways that utilize substrates/cofactors such as methionine, vitamin B12, folate). 1-C metabolic pathways drive the synthesis of proteins, biogenic amines and lipids required for early growth, together with the synthesis and methylation of DNA and histones essential for the regulation of gene expression. We review how deficiencies in periconceptional 1-C metabolism affect fertility and development together with underlying mechanisms derived from animal studies. METHODS A literature search was performed using PubMed and bibliographies of all relevant original research articles and reviews. RESULTS We define 'periconception' as a 5-6-month period in women embracing oocyte growth, fertilization, conceptus formation and development to Week 10 of gestation (coinciding with the closure of the secondary palate in the embryo). During this period significant epigenetic modifications to chromatin occur that correspond with normal development. Subtle variations in 1-C metabolism genes and deficiencies in 1-C substrates/cofactors together with poor lifestyle, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, disturb 1-C metabolism and contribute to subfertility and early miscarriage and compromise offspring health. Procedures used in assisted reproduction can also disturb these metabolic pathways and contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Evidence presented indicates that parental nutrition and other lifestyle factors during the periconceptional period can affect reproductive performance via 1-C metabolic pathways. This knowledge provides opportunities for treatment and prevention of reproductive failures and future non-communicable diseases."}

Based on the aforementioned tests, we developed a testing procedure in mice, the unilateral hot plate (UHP): the plantar side of one hindpaw is placed on a hot plate surface and, thus, the withdrawal latency of each paw can be measured separately. The effectiveness of several analgesic and hyperalgesic drugs measured by the UHP was compared with that measured by a method based on the application of radiant heat (RH) stimuli. In the UHP method, morphine (1-10 mg/kg) increases latencies, while spinal NMDA (0.001-1 ng) or PGE2 (30-300 ng), intraplantar carrageenan (2 - 4%) or PGE2 (30-300 ng) decrease latencies. In all cases, the UHP method detected changes in pain reactivity at lower doses than the RH test. The sensitivity and usefulness of the UHP test for performing pain studies in mice is described."}

We previously demonstrated that the transcription of G protein beta1 (Gbeta1) is enhanced by treatment of cultured myotubes with neuregulin (NRG), a trophic factor that plays an important role in neural development. In the current study, we report that the transcript levels of Gbeta1 and Gbeta2 subunits in skeletal muscle are up-regulated following sciatic nerve injury or blockade of nerve activity. These observations prompted us to explore the possibility that G protein subunits regulate NRG-mediated signaling and gene transcription. We showed that overexpression of Gbeta1 or Gbeta2 in COS7 cells attenuates NRG-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation, whereas suppression of Gbeta2 expression in C2C12 myotubes enhances NRG-mediated ERK1/2 activation and c-fos transcription. These results suggest that expression of Gbeta protein negatively regulates NRG-stimulated gene transcription in cultured myotubes. Taken together, our observations provide evidence that specific heterotrimeric G proteins regulate NRG-mediated signaling and gene transcription during rat muscle development."}

Specialized anatomic and physiological features of the cerebrovasculature and cerebral tissue fluids result in barriers which significantly restrict delivery of a wide range of possible therapeutic agents. In addition to these normal restrictions to brain drug delivery, pathophysiological features and sequelae of acute brain injury will also impact upon the efficiency of drug delivery. This review is focused on acutely damaged brain that occurs after stroke and trauma. Pathophysiological events that may influence drug delivery include blood-brain barrier disruptions, blood flow alterations, edema and increased intracranial pressure, metabolic perturbations, and altered profiles of gene expression and protein synthesis. Careful consideration of these obstacles will provide a framework for further research into the optimization of drug delivery strategies into damaged brain. Without a rigorous assessment of these issues, it may not be possible to translate our mechanistic understanding of acute brain injury into successful clinical therapies."}

We have now characterised this model of muscoskeletal pain pharmacologically, by evaluating the antinociceptive effects of various analgesics after systemic administration. The micro-opioid receptor agonist morphine (3 and 6 mg/kg) produced a particularly prolonged antiallodynic effect. The glutamate receptor antagonists ([8-methyl-5-(4-(N,N-dimethylsulfamoyl)phenyl)-6,7,8,9,-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-h]-iso-quinoline-2,3-dione-3-O-(4-hydroxybutyric acid-2-yl)oxime] NS1209 and ketamine (6 and 15 mg/kg, respectively), the KCNQ K(+) channel openers retigabine and flupirtine (10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively) and the Na(+) channel blocker mexiletine (37.5 mg/kg) also significantly increased paw withdrawal threshold, although to a lesser degree than morphine. In contrast, the anticonvulsant lamotrigine (30 mg/kg), the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor carprofen (15 mg/kg) and the benzodiazepine diazepam (3 mg/kg) were ineffective. All antinociceptive effects were observed at nonataxic doses as determined by the rotarod test. These results suggest that in this model, muscle-mediated pain can be alleviated by various analgesics with differing mechanisms of action, and that once established ongoing inflammation does not appear to contribute to this process."}

This study was aimed to define the role of ABCG2 in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection against ischemic injury. ABCG2 protein levels before and after ischemic stroke were increased in the brain of female mice by ovariectomy, which were reversed by estrogen replacement. In brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3, estrogen reduced the basal ABCG2 protein level and efflux activity and protected cells from ischemic injury without inducing ABCG2 expression. When bEnd.3 cells were transfected with ABCG2 small interfering RNA, ischemia-induced cell death was reduced, and the intracellular concentration of glutathione, an antioxidant that is transported by ABCG2, was increased. In addition, after ischemic stroke in ovariectomized mice, estrogen prevented the reduction of intracellular glutathione level in brain microvessels. These data suggested that the suppression of ABCG2 by estrogen is involved in neuroprotection against ischemic injury by increasing intracellular glutathione, and that the modulation of ABCG2 activity offers a therapeutic target for brain diseases in estrogen-deficient aged women."}

However, conventional strategies for generating oligodendrocytes have mainly focused on direct differentiation into forebrain- or spinal cord-restricted oligodendrocytes without establishing or amplifying stem/progenitor cells. Taking advantage of a recently established culture system, we generated expandable EN1- and GBX2-positive glial-restricted progenitor-like cells (GPLCs) near the anterior hindbrain. These cells expressed PDGFRα, CD9, S100β, and SOX10 and mostly differentiated into GFAP-positive astrocytes and MBP-positive oligodendrocytes. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the transcriptome of GPLCs was similar to that of O4-positive OPCs, but distinct from that of rosette-type neural stem cells. Notably, engrafted GPLCs not only differentiated into GFAP-positive astrocytes but also myelinated the brains of adult shiverer mice 8 weeks after transplantation.

Tat-BMPs-PAMAM was complexed with small interfering RNA expression plasmid (psiRNA) corresponding to the open reading frame of the human epidermal growth factor receptor gene (psiRNA-EGFR) to downregulate the EGFR gene by electrostatic interaction. The antitumor effect of psiRNA-EGFR delivered via Tat-BMPs-PAMAM was assessed both in human glioblastoma U251-MG cells and in nude mouse models. Compared with control groups, Tat-BMPs-PAMAM/psiRNA-EGFR resulted in better suppression of EGFR expression and a more obviously arrested effect on the proliferation and invasion ability of U251 cells in vitro. In addition, the growth rate of tumor in the U251 subcutaneous nude mouse model treated with Tat-BMPs-PAMAM/psiRNA-EGFR was slower than in those treated with phosphate-buffered saline or Lipofectamine 2000/psiRNA-Scr. Also, compared with control groups, the expression of oncoproteins (EGFR, p-AKT, MMP2/9, PCNA, VEGF, Bcl-2, and cyclin D1) was obviously downregulated and the number of apoptotic cells was clearly increased in the Tat-BMPs-PAMAM/psiRNA-EGFR treatment groups.

However, flies in the forest transmit more infective larvae than their savanna counterparts, even in sympatry, contradicting expectations based on the forest and savanna strains paradigm. We analysed data on the numbers of Onchocerca volvulus larvae of different stages found in 10 different taxonomic categories of the Simulium damnosum complex derived from more than 48,800 dissections of flies from Sierra Leone in the west of Africa to Uganda in the east. The samples were collected before widespread ivermectin distribution and thus provide a baseline for evaluating control measures. Savanna species contained fewer larvae per infected or per infective fly than the forest species, even when biting and parous rates were accounted for. The highest transmission indices were found in the forest-dwelling Pra form of Simulium sanctipauli (616 L3/1000 parous flies) and the lowest in the savanna-inhabiting species S. damnosum/S. sirbanum (135) and S. kilibanum (65). Frequency distributions of numbers of L1-2 and L3 larvae found in parous S. damnosum/S. sirbanum, S. kilibanum, S. squamosum, S. yahense, S. sanctipauli, S. leonense and S. soubrense all conformed to the negative binomial distribution, with the mainly savanna-dwelling species (S. damnosum/S. sirbanum) having less overdispersed distributions than the mainly forest-dwelling species. These infection patterns were maintained even when forest and savanna forms were sympatric and biting the same human population. Furthermore, for the first time, levels of blindness were positively correlated with infection intensities of the forest vector S. yahense, consistent with relations previously reported for savanna zones. Another novel result was that conversion rates of L1-2 larvae to L3s were equivalent for both forest and savanna vectors. We suggest that either a multiplicity of factors are contributing to the observed disease patterns or that many parasite strains exist within a continuum."}

The changes in the auditory nervous system that cause tinnitus and the changes in the somatosensory systems that cause central neuropathic pain may have been initiated from the periphery, i.e. the ear or the auditory nerve for tinnitus and receptors and peripheral nerves in the body for pain. In the chronic condition of tinnitus and pain, abnormalities in the periphery may no longer play a role in the pathology, but the tinnitus is still referred to the ear and central neuropathic pain is still referred to the location on the body of the original pathology.

However, the conventional analysis of neoplasias has preferentially focused on only one of these processes. This approach has led to a biased, primarily genetic view, of human tumorigenesis. Epigenetic alterations, such as aberrant DNA methylation, are sufficient to induce tumor formation, and can modify the incidence, and determine the type of tumor which will arise in genetic models of cancer. These observations raise important questions about the degree to which genetic and epigenetic mechanisms cooperate in human tumorigenesis, the identity of the specific cooperating genes and how these genes interact functionally to determine the diverse biological and clinical paths to tumor initiation and progression. These gaps in our knowledge are, in part, due to the lack of methods for full-scale integrated genetic and epigenetic analyses. The ultimate goal to fill these gaps would include sequencing relevant regions of the 3-billion nucleotide genome, and determining the methylation status of the 28-million CpG dinucleotide methylome at single nucleotide resolution in different types of neoplasias. Here, we review the emergence and advancement of technologies to map ever larger proportions of the cancer methylome, and the unique discovery potential of integrating these with cancer genomic data.

However, the main long-term complication of dopaminergic treatment is augmentation, which is an overall increase in symptom severity and intensity, with symptoms starting earlier in the afternoon and expanding to previously unaffected parts of the body. Augmentation is a common complication, with prevalence rates of nearly 50%, and is a common cause of treatment failure. Furthermore, augmentation occurs almost exclusively during treatment with dopaminergic drugs. Due to its frequency, there is a strong clinical need for treatment alternatives to dopaminergic drugs.

SCs transduced with LV-BDNF and LV-GDNF secreted measurable and bioactive amounts of each of these proteins, but reconstituted grafts containing LV-BDNF or LV-GDNF transduced SCs did not enhance RGC survival or axonal regrowth. LV-BDNF modified grafts did, however, contain many pan-neurofilament immunolabeled axons, many of which were also immunoreactive for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and were presumably of peripheral sensory origin. Nor-adrenergic and cholinergic axons were also seen in these grafts. There were far fewer axons in LV-GDNF engineered grafts. Reconstituted PN sheaths containing FBs that had been modified to express CNTF did not promote RGC viability or regeneration, and PN reconstituted with a mixed population of SCs and CNTF expressing FBs were less effective than SCs alone.

The levels of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E) and their metabolites in extracts of lymphocytes from 58 MS patients and 19 healthy controls were measured by using capillary electrophoresis. The MS patients were divided into clinical subgroups: a laboratory-supported definitive (first-attack) MS group, and a relapsing-remitting (RR) group in remission. The peripheral blood lymphocyte level of epinephrine was significantly higher in the first-attack MS patients (p=0.028) than in the controls. However, the norepinephrine levels were significantly (p=0.027) lower in the RR patients in remission. The catecholamines are known to be able to affect the lymphocyte activity, both by stimulation and by immunosuppression. Our results suggest that the catecholamines are important regulators of lymphocyte activation in MS, and of potential importance as concerns new diagnostic and therapeutic methods."}

We here investigated for the first time the effect of L-theanine intake on seizure susceptibility using acute pilocarpine and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) mouse models for studying, respectively, limbic seizures or primarily generalized seizures. Moreover, we studied the effect of l-theanine intake on extracellular hippocampal and cortical glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, using in vivo microdialysis. Feeding mice with a 4% L-theanine solution significantly decreased their susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures whereas susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures was increased. The latter effect was linked to decreased extracellular GABA concentrations in frontal cortex."}

Mast cells have been implicated as the source of various cytokines, chemokines and histamine in acute inflammation and fibrosis. Interleukin (IL)-10 has well-known immunomodulatory actions that are exerted during the recovery phase of myocarditis. In this study, 9-week-old male Lewis rats were immunized with cardiac myosin. A plasmid vector expressing mouse IL-10 cDNA (800 mug per rat) was then transferred three times (7, 12 and 17 days after immunization) into the tibialis anterior muscles of the rats by electroporation. Microscopic examination of mast cells was carried out on toluidine blue-stained transverse sections of the mid ventricles. Mouse IL-10 gene transfer significantly reduced mast cell density, cardiac histamine concentration and mast cell growth, and prevented mast cell degranulation. Furthermore, improvement in both myocardial function and the overall condition of the rats was evident from the reduction in the heart weight-to-body weight ratio and inflammatory infiltration as well as improvement in hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters. These findings suggest that IL-10 gene transfer by electroporation protected against myocarditis via mast cell inhibition."}

Dynamic CT-perfusion imaging (100 kV, 300 mAs), fluorescent microspheres, and histopathology were performed in all models. CT based myocardial blood flow (MBFCT), blood volume (MBVCT) and transit constant (Ktrans), as well as microsphere's based myocardial blood flow (MBFMic) were derived for each myocardial segment. According to histopathology or microsphere measurements, 20 myocardial segments were classified as infarcted and 23 were ischemic (12 and 14 %, respectively). Across all perfusion states, MBFCT strongly predicted MBFMic (β 0.88 ± 0.12, p < 0.0001). MBFCT, MBVCT, and Ktrans were significantly lower in ischemic/infarcted when compared to reference myocardium (all p < 0.01). Relative differences of all CT parameters between affected and non-affected myocardium were higher for infarcted when compared to ischemic segments under rest (48.4 vs. 22.6 % and 46.1 vs. 22.9 % for MBFCT, MBVCT, respectively). Under stress, MBFCT was significantly lower in infarcted than in ischemic myocardium (67.8 ± 26 vs. 88.2 ± 22 ml/100 ml/min, p = 0.002).

The adverse effects of opioids are well known but the long term use of opioids which produces tolerance with accompanying dose escalation and dependence is most problematic. Another potentially important consequence of opioid exposure that sometimes masks as tolerance is that of opioid induced hyperalgesia. This syndrome is manifest as enhanced pain, sensitivity and loss of analgesic efficacy in patients treated with opioids who actually become sensitized to painful stimuli. This article focuses on the treatment of burn pain and how current analgesic therapies with opioids may cause hyperalgesia and affect the adequacy of treatment for burn pain.

Two weeks after surgical operation, OVX mice underwent restraint stress for 21 days (6 h/day), and all animals were then subjected to a contextual fear conditioning test followed by morphological examination by Nissl staining. Placental extract was orally administered once daily until the behavioral analysis was carried out. Chronic treatment with both doses of placental extract improved the OVX/stress-induced fear memory impairment and Nissl-positive cell loss of the hippocampal CA3 region, although it did not affect the loss of bone mineral density and increase in body weight after OVX.

The experimental protocol contained an operant discrimination task, a two-component multiple (mult) 2-min fixed interval (FI) 5-min extinction (EXT) schedule of water reinforcement, a reliable behavioural paradigm for testing activity levels, discrimination behaviour and impulsiveness. The results indicated that both male and female SHRs show some of the most important behavioural traits of ADHD. Both were hyperactive and showed discrimination problems in terms of a behavioural extinction deficit towards the end of the EXT component. Still their behaviour differed markedly, which was probably due to quite different underlying mechanisms. The behavioural characteristics of the female SHRs may be compatible with an attention-deficit interpretation, whereas the behavioural characteristics of the male SHRs may be due to a shorter than normal delay-of-reinforcement gradient.

Although subretinal vector delivery has mainly been used to date, intravitreal delivery has potential advantages if low retinal transduction efficiency can be overcome. To this end, we investigated the effects of co-injection of glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, singly or in combination, with AAV2 as a method of increasing retinal transduction. Experiments using healthy mice demonstrated that these enzymes enhance retinal transduction. We found that heparinase III produced the greatest individual effect, and this was enhanced further by combination with hyaluronan lyase. In addition, this optimized AAV2-enzyme combination led to a marked improvement in transduction in retinas with advanced retinal degeneration compared with AAV2 alone. Safety studies measuring retinal function by flash electroretinography indicated that retinal function was unaffected in the acute period and at least 12 months after enzyme treatment, whereas pupillometry confirmed that retinal ganglion cell activity was unaffected. Retinal morphology was not altered by the enzyme injection. Collectively these data confirm the efficacy and safety of this intravitreal approach in enhancing retinal transduction efficiency by AAV in rodents. Translating this method into other species, such as non-human primates, or for clinical applications will have challenges and require further studies."}

At a concentration of 500 ng/ml of culture medium (0.97 microM), which falls within serum levels attained during long-term CQ therapy, the drugs produced varying degrees of growth retardation and dysmorphogenesis in the conceptuses. These effects were most severe with exposure to racemic CQ (100%) and also to equimolar concentrations of the two enantiomers (90%). Dysmorphogenesis was least with (+)-CQ (30%) and intermediate in severity in those exposed to (-)-CQ (32%). In the CQ and combined enantiomer groups, there was significant reduction in yolk sac diameter to 81% and 73%, the crown-rump length to 77% and 71%, the number of somites to 76% and 74%, and the embryonic protein content to 64% and 49%, respectively, of control values.

Unfused and underdeveloped cranial neural tube, microophthalmia and abnormal otic primordium also occurred frequently, especially in the CQ and enantiomeric combination groups. The results suggest that the commercially available form of chloroquine, CQ, is embryotoxic in doses comparable to serum levels reached during long-term therapy with the drug.

However, excessive platelet activation in narrowed atherosclerotic blood vessels that are subject to high shear forces may initiate the onset of arterial thrombosis. When platelets come into contact with, and adhere to collagen exposed by damaged endothelium, they undergo morphological and functional changes necessary to generate a platelet-rich thrombus. This process is complex and involves precise co-ordination of various signaling pathways which lead to firm platelet adhesion to sites of tissue damage, release of granule contents from activated platelets, platelet shape change, platelet aggregation and subsequent thrombus formation and consolidation. Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of key signaling molecules has emerged as a critical event central to stimulatory signaling pathways that generate platelet activation, but is an essential component associated with regulatory pathways that limit the extent of platelet activation. Understanding mechanisms that regulate platelet activation may contribute to the development of novel therapeutics that control common vascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke."}

These relentless and progressive diseases remain largely without disease-modifying treatments despite decades of research and investments. It is becoming clear that traditional two-dimensional culture and animal model systems, while providing valuable insights on the major pathophysiological pathways associated with these diseases, have not translated well to patients' bedside. Fortunately, the advent of induced-pluripotent stem cells and three-dimensional cell culture now provide tools that are revolutionizing the study of human diseases by permitting analysis of patient-derived human tissue with non-invasive procedures. Specifically, brain organoids, self-organizing neural structures that can mimic human fetal brain development, have now been harnessed to develop alternative models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, and Frontotemporal dementia by recapitulating important neuropathological hallmarks found in these disorders. Despite these early breakthroughs, several limitations need to be vetted in brain organoid models in order to more faithfully match human tissue qualities, including relative tissue immaturity, lack of vascularization and incomplete cellular diversity found in this culture system. Here, we review current brain organoid protocols, the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, and early studies with brain organoid neurodegeneration models. We then discuss the multiple engineering and conceptual challenges surrounding their use and provide possible solutions and exciting avenues to be pursued.

Two subcutaneous (sc) sarin challenge doses were evaluated in guinea pigs instrumented with brain and heart electrodes for electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). Sarin challenge doses were chosen to reflect exposure subclasses with sublethal (moderate to severe clinical signs) and lethal consequences. The level of protection of intramuscular human equivalent doses of the co-formulation was defined by (1) the mitigation of signs and symptoms at a sublethal level and (2) the increase of survival time at the supralethal sarin dose levels. Pharmacokinetics of both atropine sulfate and obidoxime were proportional at 1 and 3 human equivalent doses, and only a small increase in heart rate was observed briefly as a side effect. At both sarin challenge doses, 54 μg/kg and 84 μg/kg, the co-formulation treatment was effective against sarin-induced effects. Survival rates were improved at both sarin challenge levels, whereas clinical signs and changes in EEG activity could not in all cases be effectively mitigated, in particular at the supralethal sarin challenge dose level. Reactivation of sarin inhibited cholinesterase was observed in blood, and higher brain cholinesterase activity levels were associated with a better clinical condition of the co-formulation treated animals. Although the results cannot be directly extrapolated to the human situation, pharmacokinetics and the effects over time related to plasma levels of therapeutics in a freely moving guinea pig could aid translational models and possibly improve prediction of efficacy in humans."}

They carry defects in virulence proteins that antagonize host cell response to the virus, including innate response, apoptosis, authophagy, and depend on tumor cell proliferation. They grow robustly in cancer cells, provided that these are deficient in host cell responses, which is often the case. To overcome the attenuation limits, a strategy is to render the virus highly cancer-specific, e.g., by retargeting their tropism to cancer-specific receptors, and detargeting from natural receptors. The target we selected is HER-2, overexpressed in breast, ovarian and other cancers. Entry of wt-HSV requires the essential glycoproteins gD, gH/gL and gB. Here, we reviewed that oncolytic HSV retargeting was achieved through modifications in gD: the addition of a single-chain antibody (scFv) to HER-2 coupled with appropriate deletions to remove part of the natural receptors' binding sites. Recently, we showed that also gH/gL can be a retargeting tool. The insertion of an scFv to HER-2 at the gH N-terminus, coupled with deletions in gD, led to a recombinant capable to use HER-2 as the sole receptor. The retargeted oncolytic HSVs can be administered systemically by means of carrier cells-forcedly-infected mesenchymal stem cells. Altogether, the retargeted oncolytic HSVs are highly cancer-specific and their replication is not dependent on intrinsic defects of the tumor cells. They might be further modified to express immunomodulatory molecules."}

Acclimated mice were previously found to display improved functional recovery as well as an increase in the levels of the specific erythropoietin receptor. As the activation of this receptor is known to facilitate functional recovery on one hand and the phosphorylation and activation of Akt, an intracellular kinase which regulates anti-apoptotic pathways on the other, in this study we investigated whether HA affects Akt phosphorylation prior to and following injury and whether this step is required for development of HA-induced neuroprotection. Akt phosphorylation was blocked using Triciribine (TCN), a compound shown to block the phosphorylation process without affecting upstream effectors of this kinase, and several post-injury functional end-point measures were subsequently evaluated. Acclimation led to a post-injury increase in the levels of phosphorylated Akt, resulting in higher levels when compared with normothermic controls at 4 h post-injury (63.6 +/- 5.2% and 42.7 +/- 3.7%, respectively, p </= 0.05). This increase was diminished following TCN administration. Post-injury TCN treatment abolished the HA-induced functional benefits, including effects on motor and cognitive functions as well as the attenuation of edema formation.

LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a receptor for numerous ligands, including intracellular proteins released by injured cells and protein components of degenerated myelin. In certain cell types, including SCs, LRP1 is a cell-signaling receptor. Here, we show that binding of the LRP1 ligand, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), to cultured rat SCs induces c-Jun phosphorylation, a central event in activation of the SC repair program. The response to tPA was blocked by the LRP1 antagonist, receptor-associated protein. c-Jun phosphorylation was also observed when cultured rat SCs were treated with a recombinant derivative of matrix metalloproteinase-9 that contains the LRP1 recognition motif (PEX). The ability of LRP1 to induce c-Jun phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation was confirmed using cultures of human SCs. When tPA or PEX was injected directly into crush-injured rat sciatic nerves, c-Jun phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation were observed in SCs in vivo. The ability of LRP1 to bind proteins released in the earliest stages of PNS injury and to induce c-Jun phosphorylation support a model in which SC LRP1 functions as an injury-detection receptor in the PNS."}

In 2009, we made the case that this dichotomy was related to administered estrogen dose. Several other suggestions for the discordant results have also been propagated, including the age of the experimental animals and the length of hypoestrogenicity prior to estrogen administration. These two suggestions have gained much popularity, probably because of their kinship with the window of opportunity hypothesis, which is commonly used to explain the analogous dichotomy among human studies. We were therefore encouraged to perform an updated meta-analysis, and to improve it by including all relevant variables in a large multiple regression model, where the impact of confounders could be controlled for.	The multiple regression model revealed an indisputable impact of estrogen administration mode on the effects of estrogens in ischemic stroke. Subcutaneous slow-release pellets differed from the injection and silastic capsule treatments in terms of impact of estrogens on ischemic stroke, showing that the first mentioned were more prone to render estrogens damaging. Neither the use of elderly animals nor the adoption of longer wash-out periods influenced estrogens' effects on experimental ischemic stroke in rats.	We conclude that the discordant results regarding estrogens' effects in rat models of ischemic stroke are a consequence of differences in estrogen administration modes. These results are not only of importance for the ongoing debate regarding menopausal hormone therapy, but also have an important bearing on experimental stroke methodology and the apparent translational roadblock for suggested stroke interventions."}

Diazepam (10 mg/kg) administered to gerbils 30 and 90 minutes after forebrain ischemia produced significant protection of hippocampal area CA1 pyramidal neurons 7 days later. In gerbils surviving for 35 days, diazepam produced the same degree of neuroprotection (70% +/- 30%) in the hippocampus compared with 7 days after ischemia. The therapeutic window for diazepam was short; there was no significant neuroprotection when the administration of diazepam was delayed to 4 hours after ischemia. The neuroprotective dose of diazepam also produced hypothermia (approximately 32 degrees C) for several hours after injection. To assess the role of hypothermia in neuroprotection by diazepam, hypothermia depth and duration was simulated using a cold-water spray in separate gerbils. Seven days after ischemia, neuroprotection by hypothermia was similar to that produced by diazepam. However, 35 days after ischemia, there was no significant protection by hypothermia, suggesting that hypothermia does not play a significant role in long-term diazepam neuroprotection. Imidazenil (3 mg/kg), which produced only minimal hypothermia, protected area CA1 of hippocampus to the same degree as that by diazepam 7 days after ischemia. At 35 days after ischemia, significant protection remained, but it was considerably reduced compared with 7 days. Like diazepam, the therapeutic window for imidazenil was short. Imidazenil neuroprotection was lost when the drug was administered as early as 2 hours after ischemia. The ability of ischemia to produce deficits in working memory and of benzodiazepines to prevent the deficits also was investigated. Gerbils trained on an eight-arm radial maze before ischemia demonstrated a significant increase in the number of working errors 1 month after ischemia. The ischemia-induced deficits in working memory were completely prevented by diazepam but not by imidazenil. There was a significant, but weak, negative correlation between the degree of CA1 pyramidal cell survival and the number of working errors in both the diazepam and imidazenil groups. Thus, if given early enough during reperfusion, both benzodiazepine full and partial agonists are neuroprotective for at least 35 days, but the lack of sedating side effects of imidazenil must be weighed against its reduced efficacy."}

There are various means of how the amount of active proteasome complexes in the cell can be regulated such as transcriptional regulation of proteasomal subunit expression, association with different regulators, assembly and half-life of proteasomes and regulatory complexes, as well as post-translational modifications. It also becomes increasingly evident that proteasome activity is fine-tuned and depends on the state of the cell. We propose here that 20S proteasomes and their regulators can be regarded as dynamic building blocks, which assemble or disassemble in response to cellular needs.

After differentiation by GDNF and cyclic adenosine monophosphate, LUHMES were sensitive to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) toxicity at < or =5 microM, but resistant to the parental compound 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The high homogeneity and purity of the cultures allowed the detection of metabolic changes during the degeneration. Cellular ATP dropped in two phases after 24 and 48 h; cellular glutathione (GSH) decreased continuously, paralleled by an increase in lipid peroxidation. These events were accompanied by a time-dependent degeneration of neurites. Block of the dopamine transporter by GBR 12909 or mazindol completely abrogated MPP(+) toxicity. Inhibition of de novo dopamine synthesis by alpha-methyl-l-tyrosine or 3-iodo-l-tyrosine attenuated toxicity, but did not reduce the initial drop in ATP. Inhibition of mixed lineage kinases by CEP1347 completely prevented the MPP(+)-induced loss of viability and intracellular GSH, but failed to attenuate the initial drop of ATP. For the quantitative assessment of neurite degeneration, an automated imaging-based high content screening approach was applied and confirmed the findings made by pharmacological interventions in this study. Our data indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis is not sufficient to trigger cell death in MPP(+)-treated LUHMES."}

The aim of this work was to study the astrocytic response in rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex after repetitive seizures induced by 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MP) administration. Immunocytochemical studies were performed to analyze GFAP and S100beta expression. Both studied areas showed hypertrophied astrocytes with enlarged processes and increased soma size. Astrocyte hyperplasia was observed only in the cerebral cortex. A significant decrease in the astrocytic S100beta immunostaining occurs after MP treatment. These results indicate that MP administration induces an astroglial reaction with reduced intracellular S100beta level. The observed reduction in astroglial S100beta could be related to the release of this factor to the extracellular space, where it may produce neurotrophic or deleterious effects accordingly to the concentration achieved. The mechanism of this remains to be elucidated."}

In the present study, we investigated the effect of magnolol on apoptosis in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), using terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labelling (TUNEL) and flow cytometric analysis. Magnolol (5-20 micro M) concentration-dependently induced significant VSMC apoptosis, this effect being blocked by the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk, 50 micro M). To study the molecular mechanism, the mitochondrial death pathway was examined. Magnolol increased caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities significantly and reduced the mitochondrial potential (Deltapsi(m)). The levels of B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), but not those of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) or Bcl-x(L), were down-regulated concentration dependently by magnolol. In an animal model, balloon angioplasty-induced neointima formation was inhibited significantly by magnolol and Bcl-2 protein levels were reduced. Taken together, these results show that magnolol induces apoptosis in VSMCs via the mitochondrial death pathway. This effect is mediated through down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein levels, both in vivo and in vitro. Magnolol thus shows potential as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of atherosclerosis and re-stenosis."}

Cn is a facultative intracellular pathogen in mammals, insects and amoeba. Cn infection occurs after inhalation of spores or desiccated cells from the environment. After inhalation Cn localizes to the lungs where it can be phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Cn is surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule that helps the fungus survive in vivo by interfering with phagocytosis, quenching free radical bursts and shedding polysaccharides that negatively modulates the immune system. After phagocytosis, Cn resides within the phagosome that matures to become a phagolysosome, a process that results in the acidification of the phagolysosomal lumen. Cn replicates at a higher rate inside macrophages than in the extracellular environment, possibly as a result that the phagosomal pH is near that optimal for growth. Cn increases the phagolysosomal pH and modulates the dynamics of Rab GTPases interaction with the phagolysosome. Chemical manipulation of the phagolysosomal pH with drugs can result in direct and indirect killing of Cn and reduced non-lytic exocytosis. Phagolysosomal membrane damage after Cn infection occurs both in vivo and in vitro, and is required for Cn growth and survival. Macrophage treatment with IFN-γ reduces the phagolysosomal damage and increases intracellular killing of Cn. Studies on mice and humans show that treatment with IFN-γ can improve host control of the disease. However, the mechanism by which Cn mediates phagolysosomal membrane damage remains unknown but likely candidates are phospholipases and mechanical damage from an enlarging capsule. Here we review Cn intracellular interaction with a particular emphasis on phagosomal interactions and develop the notion that the extent of damage of the phagosomal membrane is a key determinant of the outcome of the Cn-macrophage interaction."}

Auditory damage is one of the primary sequela of blast trauma, affecting immediate situational awareness and causing permanent hearing loss. Protecting against blast exposure is limited by the inability to anticipate the timing of these exposures, particularly those caused by terrorists. Therefore a therapeutic regimen is desirable that is able to ameliorate auditory damage when administered after a blast exposure has occurred. The purpose of this study was to determine if administration of a combination of antioxidants 2,4-disulfonyl α-phenyl tertiary butyl nitrone (HPN-07) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) beginning 1 h after blast exposure could reduce both temporary and permanent hearing loss. To this end, a blast simulator was developed and the operational conditions established for exposing rats to blast overpressures comparable to those encountered in an open-field blast of 14 pounds per square inch (psi). This blast model produced reproducible blast overpressures that resulted in physiological and physical damage to the auditory system that was proportional to the number and amplitude of the blasts. After exposure to 3 consecutive 14 psi blasts 100% of anesthetized rats had permanent hearing loss as determined at 21 days post exposure by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) testing. Animals treated with HPN-07 and NAC after blast exposure showed a significant reduction in ABR threshold shifts and DPOAE level shifts at 2-16 kHz with significant reduction in inner hair cell (IHC) and outer hair cell (OHC) loss across the 5-36 kHz region of the cochlea compared with control animals. The time course of changes in the auditory system was documented at 3 h, 24 h, 7 day and 21 day after blast exposure. At 3 h after blast exposure the auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold shifts were elevated by 60 dB in both treated and control groups. A partial recovery of to 35 dB was observed at 24 h in the controls, indicative of a temporary threshold shift (TTS) and there was essentially no further recovery by 21 days representing a permanent threshold shift (PTS) of about 30 dB. Antioxidant treatment increased the amount of both TTS and PTS recovery relative to controls by 10 and 20 dB respectively. Distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) reached a maximum level shift of 25-30 dB measured in both control and treated groups at 3 h after blast exposure. These levels did not change by day 21 in the control group but in the treatment group the level shifts began to decline at 24 h until by day 21 they were 10-20 dB below that of the controls. Loss of cochlear hair cells measured at 21 day after blast exposure was mostly in the outer hair cells (OHC) and broadly distributed across the basilar membrane, consistent with the distribution of loss of frequency responses as measured by ABR and DPOAE analysis and typical of blast-induced damage. OHC loss progressively increased after blast exposure reaching an average loss of 32% in the control group and 10% in the treated group at 21 days. These findings provide the first evidence that a combination of antioxidants, HPN-07 and NAC, can both enhance TTS recovery and prevent PTS by reducing damage to the mechanical and neural components of the auditory system when administered shortly after blast exposure."}

Internal causes (causa interna) include imbalance in the basic bodily humors, that is, yellow bile, black bile, phlegm, and blood. According to medieval writers, the principal cause of epilepsy was vapor, a damp, cold volatile substance originating in the excessive production of one of the basic organismic liquids. Vapor allegedly stuck to the openings leading to the cerebral ventricles or blocked them entirely, resulting in convulsions. External causes (causa externa) include overeating and excessive drinking, teething, spoiled milk, poisons, badly treated spots and fever, cold air, moonlight, and wearing donkey hide. Medical treatments for epilepsy included surgical interventions (bloodletting) and pharmacological interventions. The latter included laxatives, sea onion (scilla maritima, urginea maritima), and ground human skull, all of which were supposed to protect the body from vapors.

Calcification occurs in both cusp and aortic wall portions of bioprosthetic heart valves. The purpose of this study was to discern the role of different aortic wall components in the calcification process. Thus, we selectively extracted cells and other extracellular matrix proteins from porcine aorta using trypsin/DNase/RNase, cyanogen bromide (CNBr), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treatments and subdermally implanted these pretreated aortas in young rats. Total DNA and phospholipid data showed complete removal of cells by CNBr and NaOH treatments, whereas trypsin/DNase/RNase treatment was effective in removing DNA but not phospholipids. As shown by amino acid data and Masson's trichrome staining, collagen was removed in CNBr and NaOH treatments. Control fresh porcine aorta calcified significantly after 21 days of implantation (Ca 26.4 +/- 2.4 microg/mg). Removal of cells and collagen from the aorta by CNBr treatment did not lead to a statistically significant reduction in aortic calcification (Ca 20.8 +/- 3.0 microg/mg). Moreover, partial degradation of elastin fibers caused by NaOH (during extraction) and trypsin treatment (after implantation) of the aorta significantly increased elastin-oriented calcification (Ca 94.4 +/- 9.3 and 58.4 +/- 4.6 microg/mg, respectively). Our results indicate that the elastin component of the aorta may undergo independent calcification irrespective of devitalized cell-mediated calcification observed in glutaraldehyde crosslinked aortas. Our results also demonstrate the importance of studying elastin-oriented calcification in decellularized elastin-rich aortic matrices currently used in tissue-engineering applications."}

They also appeared in the central terminals or cell bodies of IB4, CGRP, and NF200 sensory neurons. In addition, exosome treatment suppressed nerve ligation-induced upregulation of c-Fos, CNPase, GFAP, and Iba1. All these data suggest that the analgesic effects of exosomes may involve their actions on neuron and glial cells. Exosomes also inhibited the level of TNF-α and IL-1β, while enhanced the level of IL-10, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in the ipsilateral L5/6 dorsal root ganglion of nerve-ligated rats, indicating anti-inflammatory and proneurotrophic abilities. Protein analysis revealed the content of vascular endothelial growth factor C, angiopoietin-2, and fibroblast growth factor-2 in the exosomes. In summary, intrathecal infusion of exosomes from UCMSCs may be considered as a novel therapeutic approach for nerve injury-induced pain."}

Brain-to-blood efflux of glutamate is increased by decreasing the concentration of glutamate in blood. Little is known about the effect of hyperthermia on blood glutamate concentrations, and the effectiveness of blood glutamate-decreasing mechanisms in these conditions. Although hyperthermia is hypothesized to decrease blood glutamate concentrations by activation of stress mechanisms, blunting the stress response by blocking β-adrenergic receptors should prevent this decrease. Furthermore, during hyperthermia there should be a concurrent process of leakage of glutamate from muscle tissue into blood, resulting in a contradictory increase of blood glutamate concentrations. In this study we investigated the effects of hyperthermia on blood glutamate levels and studied the effects of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol on stress-induced changes in glutamate levels. We then studied the effectiveness of the blood glutamate scavenger oxaloacetate on hyperthermia-induced increases of glutamate levels.	Twenty-four rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. Rats' body temperatures were increased (by 1°C every 40 minutes) from 37°C to 42°C. The first group received 1 mL per 100 g of isotonic saline (control). The second group received 1 mL per 100 g of 1M oxaloacetate when the temperature reached 39°C. The third group received 10 mg/kg of propranolol before initiation of the warming.	Warming the rats from 37°C to 39°C decreased the blood glutamate levels in the control group (P < 0.01) and oxaloacetate treatment group (P < 0.0001), whereas further increases in temperature from 40°C to 42°C increased the blood glutamate levels (P < 0.01 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Pretreatment with propranolol prevented the decrease in blood glutamate concentrations seen in mild hyperthermia and did not affect the increase in blood glutamate levels seen at temperatures of 41°C and 42°C (P < 0.005).	The results of this study demonstrated that hyperthermia leads to decreases in glutamate levels in the blood, presumably by activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Oxaloacetate, previously reported to reduce blood glutamate levels at 37°C, was ineffective at temperatures over 40°C. Propranolol pretreatment blunted the initial decrease in blood glutamate, and thereafter had no effect when compared with control and treatment groups. Understanding the mechanisms underlying glutamate regulation in the blood during states of hyperthermia and stress has important clinical implications in treating neurodegenerative conditions."}

Calcium is critical for adherens junction function, but it appears that calcium is also important in regulating tight junction function necessary for the barrier characteristics of cerebral microvessels.	The BBB is critical for brain homeostasis and is located at the cerebral microvessel endothelial cells. These endothelial cells maintain their barrier characteristics via cell-cell contacts made up of adherens and tight junctions. Adherens junctions are calcium dependent; recent evidence suggests that calcium also affects tight junctions. After stroke, there is a disruption of the BBB. Interfering with calcium flux under hypoxic conditions can prevent BBB breakdown. Calcium may alter BBB junction integrity by a number of different signal transduction cascades, as well as via direct interaction of calcium ions with junction proteins. It remains to be determined whether clinical use of calcium channel antagonists is a viable means to reduce BBB disruption after stroke.	With the widespread use of calcium channel blockers as clinical treatments for hypertension, which is a risk factor for stroke, the exact role of calcium in modulating BBB integrity needs to be elucidated."}

The existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the delivery of therapeutic molecules into the brain and offers the clinical efficacy of many pharmaceuticals that have been demonstrated to be effective for other kinds of tumors. This challenge emphasizes the need to be able to deliver drugs effectively across the BBB to reach the brain parenchyma. Enhancement of the permeability of the BBB and being able to transport drugs across it has been shown to be a promising strategy to improve drug absorption and treatment efficacy. This review highlights the innovative technologies that have been introduced to enhance the permeability of the BBB and to obtain an optimal distribution and concentration of drugs in the brain to treat gliomas, such as nanotechniques, hyperthermia techniques, receptor-mediated transport, cell-penetrating peptides, and cell-mediated delivery."}

To solve these problems, several kernicterus (or acute bilirubin encephalopathy) animal models have been established, but these models are difficult and expensive. Therefore, the present study was performed to establish a novel kernicterus model that is simple and affordable by injecting unconjugated bilirubin solution into the cisterna magna (CM) of ordinary newborn Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.	On postnatal day 5, SD rat pups were randomly divided into bilirubin and control groups. Then, either bilirubin solution or ddH2O (pH = 8.5) was injected into the CM at 10 µg/g (bodyweight). For model characterization, neurobehavioral outcomes were observed, mortality was calculated, and bodyweight was recorded after bilirubin injection and weaning. Apoptosis in the hippocampus was detected by H&E staining, TUNEL, flow cytometry and Western blotting. When the rats were 28 days old, learning and memory ability were evaluated using the Morris water maze test.	The bilirubin-treated rats showed apparently abnormal neurological manifestations, such as clenched fists, opisthotonos and torsion spasms. Bodyweight gain in the bilirubin-treated rats was significantly lower than that in the controls (P<0.001). The early and late mortality of the bilirubin-treated rats were both dramatically higher than those of the controls (P = 0.004 and 0.017, respectively). Apoptosis and necrosis in the hippocampal nerve cells in the bilirubin-treated rats were observed. The bilirubin-treated rats performed worse than the controls on the Morris water maze test.	By injecting bilirubin into the CM, we successfully created a new kernicterus model using ordinary SD rats; the model mimics both the acute clinical manifestations and the chronic sequelae. In particular, CM injection is easy to perform; thus, more stable models for follow-up study are available."}

Some hypothetical pathways of ATP release are large ion channels, such as calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1), a membrane ion channel that can permeate ATP. Since this transmitter contributes to postischemic brain damage, we hypothesized that CALHM1 activation may be a relevant target to attenuate stroke injury. Here, we analyzed the contribution of CALHM1 to postanoxic depolarization after ischemia in cultured neurons and in cortical slices. We observed that the onset of postanoxic currents in neurons in those preparations was delayed after its blockade with ruthenium red or silencing of Calhm1 gene by short hairpin RNA, as well as in slices from CALHM1 knockout mice. Subsequently, we used transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and found that ruthenium red, a blocker of CALHM1, or the lack of CALHM1, substantially attenuated the motor symptoms and reduced significantly the infarct volume. These results show that CALHM1 channels mediate postanoxic depolarization in neurons and brain damage after ischemia. Therefore, targeting CALHM1 may have a high therapeutic potential for treating brain damage after ischemia."}

The AR is a ligand-controlled transcription factor and member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The central characteristics of the SBMA pathogenicity are muscle weakness, the loss of motoneurons and the occurrence of AR-containing protein aggregates that are observed in spinal cord motoneurons and skeletal muscles induced by the AR-PolyQ expansion in the presence of androgens. The PolyQ triggers a misfolding in the AR-PolyQ and leads to protein aggregation in spinal cord motoneurons and muscle cells. The AR-PolyQ toxicity is activated by the AR ligand testosterone and dihydrotestosterone that activate the receptor and triggers nuclear toxicity by inducing AR nuclear translocation. In line with this, androgen treatment of SBMA patients worsened the SBMA symptoms. SBMA has been modeled in AR-overexpressing and AR-PolyQ-knock-in animals, but precisely how the PolyQ expansion leads to neurodegeneration is unclear. The androgen-induced toxicity and androgen-dependent nuclear accumulation of AR-PolyQ protein seems to be central to the pathogenesis. Therefore, the inhibition of the androgen-activated AR-PolyQ might be a therapeutic option. Here the use of AR antagonists for treatment option of SBMA will be reviewed and discussed."}

The objective of this study was to develop a fast-acting, single-dose NiV vaccine that could be implemented in a ring vaccination approach during outbreaks.	In this study we have designed new live-attenuated vaccine vectors based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV) expressing NiV glycoproteins (G or F) or nucleoprotein (N) and evaluated their protective efficacy in Syrian hamsters, an established NiV animal disease model. We further characterized the humoral immune response to vaccination in hamsters using ELISA and neutralization assays and performed serum transfer studies.	Vaccination of Syrian hamsters with a single dose of the rVSV vaccine vectors resulted in strong humoral immune responses with neutralizing activities found only in those animals vaccinated with rVSV expressing NiV G or F proteins. Vaccinated animals with neutralizing antibody responses were completely protected from lethal NiV disease, whereas animals vaccinated with rVSV expressing NiV N showed only partial protection. Protection of NiV G or F vaccinated animals was conferred by antibodies, most likely the neutralizing fraction, as demonstrated by serum transfer studies. Protection of N-vaccinated hamsters was not antibody-dependent indicating a role of adaptive cellular responses for protection.

The differences among the groups were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test.	Up-regulation of VEGF expression was observed from 8 to 22 weeks after irradiation (p<0.05).

Mechanical allodynia, defined by a significant drop in paw withdrawal threshold force following spinal nerve ligation (L5-L6) in rats, can be reversed by one 30min lidocaine infusion at a constant plasma concentration as low as 1-2 microg/ml, an effect that is still present when the rats are tested days and weeks afterwards. In this study, we resolved the detailed time course of reversal of ipsilateral and contralateral allodynia in rats with spinal nerve ligation by a single systemic infusion of lidocaine, to 4 microg/ml, given either 2 days after ligation (POD2) or 7 days after ligation (POD7). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were examined for 21 days after undergoing sham operation or spinal nerve ligation to produce allodynia, which was quantified by a lower force of von Frey hairs at the plantar hind paw just required to produce paw withdrawal (paw withdrawal threshold, PWT). Six experimental protocols were followed: rats were infused with lidocaine on POD2 (L2) or on POD7 (L7), or with saline on POD2 (S2) or on POD7 (S7), and sham operated rats were infused with lidocaine on POD2 or on POD7. PWTs were measured during the last 5min of a single 30min lidocaine infusion; at 30, 60, 90, 120, 240 and 360min, and 24, 48 and 72h after beginning infusion, and then every 1-3 days up to 21 days. Three distinct sequential phases of ipsilateral relief were apparent in both L2 and L7 groups: (1) an acute elevation of PWT during the infusion, returning to the pre-infusion allodynic level within 30-60min after infusion; (2) a second, transient elevation of PWT within the next 360min; (3) a sustained elevation of PWT developing slowly over 24h after infusion and maintained over the next 21 days. A significant, although weaker contralateral allodynia developed more slowly (>POD8) than the ipsilateral condition, and could be delayed for more than 2 weeks by lidocaine infusion on POD2 but for only 1 week by the same treatment on POD7. None of the sham operated animals had any allodynic signs and no saline infusions elevated PWT in ligated, allodynic rats. These results of separate phases imply that there are mechanistic differences between the acute relief and the sustained relief of allodynia after a single infusion of lidocaine, and may present an experimental paradigm for investigating the advantages of earlier rather than late therapeutic intervention."}

We have now monitored changes in object recognition in mice with EAE to determine if altered nociceptive sensitivity is also associated with behavioral signs indicative of cognitive impairment in this model. At the onset of clinical signs, mice with EAE showed impairments in the novel object recognition (NOR) assay, indicative of deficits in cognitive functioning early in the disease course. At the spinal level, we found increased gene expression for the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and the glutamate transporter EAAT-2 that coincide with increased nociceptive sensitivity and deficits in object recognition. Increased levels of EAAT-2 mRNA appear to be a response to perturbed protein levels of the transporter as we found a loss of EAAT-2 protein levels in the spinal cord of EAE mice. To determine if changes in the levels of EAAT-2 were responsible for the observed changes in nociceptive sensitivity and cognitive deficits, we treated EAE mice with the β-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone, an agent known to increase glutamate transporter levels in vivo. Ceftriaxone prevented tactile hypersensitivity and normalized performance in the NOR assay in EAE mice.

At least one mechanism by which prolonged and/or elevated IL-1 expression contributes to irreversible corneal tissue destruction appears to be by increasing macrophage inflammatory protein-2 production, resulting in a prolonged stimulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophil influx into cornea.

The mammalian spinal cord has limited ability to regenerate and restore meaningful functional recovery following SCI. Riluzole, 2-amino-6-trifluoromethoxybenzothiazole, an anti-glutamatergic drug has been shown to reduce excitotoxicity and confer neuroprotection at the site of injury following experimental SCI. Based on promising preclinical studies, riluzole is currently under Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of SCI (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01597518). Riluzole's anti-glutamatergic role has the potential to regulate neuronal function and provide neuroprotection and influence glutamatergic connections distal to the initial injury leading to enhanced functional recovery following SCI. In order to investigate this novel role of riluzole we used a high cervical hemisection model of SCI, which interrupts all descending input to motoneurons innervating the ipsilateral forelimb and diaphragm muscles. Following C2 spinal cord hemisection, animals were placed into one of two groups: one group received riluzole (8 mg/kg) 1 h after injury and every 12 h thereafter for 7 days at 6 mg/kg, while the second group of injured rats received vehicle solution for the same duration of time. A third group of sham injured rats underwent a C2 laminectomy without hemisection and served as uninjured control rats. Interestingly, this study reports a significant loss of motoneurons within the cervical spinal cord caudal to C2 hemisection injury. Disruption of descending input led to a decrease in glutamatergic synapses and motoneurons caudal to the injury while riluzole treatment significantly limited this decline. Functionally, Hoffmann reflex recordings revealed an increase in the excitability of the remaining ipsilateral cervical motoneurons and significant improvements in skilled and unskilled forelimb function and respiratory motor function in the riluzole-treated animals. In conclusion, using a C2 hemisection injury model, this study provides novel evidence of motoneuron loss caudal to the injury and supports riluzole's capacity to promote neuronal preservation and function of neural network caudal to the SCI resulting in early and sustained functional improvements."}

Indeed, both hypoxia and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) stress are harmful, and may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of many human diseases, such as myocardial ischemia and stroke. Therefore, understanding how animals adapt to hypoxia and H/R stress is critical for developing better treatments for these diseases.

Here we tested whether an anti-inflammatory treatment with a selective cox-2 inhibitor (SC58236) could prevent the development of epilepsy or modify seizure activity during the chronic epileptic phase. SC58236 was orally administered (10mg/kg) during the latent period for 7 days, starting 4h after electrically induced SE. Seizures were monitored using EEG/video monitoring until 35 days after SE. Cell death and inflammation were investigated using immunocytochemistry (NeuN and Ox-42). Sprouting was studied using Timm's staining after 1 week and after 4-5 months when rats were chronic epileptic. SC58236 was also administered during 5 days in chronic epileptic rats. Hippocampal EEG seizures were continuously monitored before, during and after treatment. SC58236 effectively reduced PGE(2) production but did not modify seizure development or the extent of cell death or microglia activation in the hippocampus. SC58236 treatment in chronic epileptic rats did not show any significant change in seizure duration or frequency of daily seizures. The fact that cox-2 inhibition, which effectively reduced prostaglandin levels, did not modify epileptogenesis or chronic seizure activity suggests that this type of treatment (starting after SE) will not provide an effective anti-epileptogenic or anti-epileptic therapy."}

Its neuroprotective actions and mechanisms have been documented in a variety of rodent brain models. However, little is known of melatonin's antioxidative capacity in the brain of primates. Herein, we investigated whether melatonin would suppress autoxidation and exogenous hydrogen peroxide-induced lipid peroxidation in monkey cerebral cortical homogenates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The monkey brain was dissected during routine autopsy and immediately frozen at -80 degrees C until the experiment. A sample of cerebral cortex (50 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml ice cold phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.4) at 0-4 degrees C. Four different treatments of cerebral cortical homogenates were performed: 1) homogenates incubated in a water bath at different temperatures (4 degrees C, 25 degrees C or 37 degrees C, respectively) for two hours to induce autoxidation; 2) homogenates co-incubated with different concentrations of melatonin at 37 degrees C for 2 hours; 3) homogenates co-incubated with 1 mM vitamin C and different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide at 37 degrees C for 1 hour to induce membrane lipid peroxidation; 4) homogenates incubated with different concentrations of melatonin and 1 mM H2O2 plus 1 mM vitamin C. After incubation, homogenates were analyzed for products of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-alkenals). RESULTS: The levels of lipid peroxidation products significantly increased in monkey cerebral cortical homogenates as a consequence of autoxidation or after the addition of H2O2 plus vitamin C. Melatonin not only suppressed the increase in lipid peroxidation induced by H2O2 plus vitamin C but also inhibited lipid breakdown resulting from autoxidation. The concentrations of melatonin required to suppress lipid peroxidation resulting from autoxidation or induced by exogenous oxidants in monkey cerebral cortical homogenates were in the same dose range. CONCLUSION: The results show for the first time that melatonin functions as an antioxidant and neuroprotector in primate brain tissue as was observed previously in rodent brain. The data provide information supporting the use of melatonin in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders that involve oxidative damage to brain lipids."}

Recent studies demonstrate that MAB has important antinociceptive effects in models of chemically or thermally induced nociception in mice.	In the present study we evaluated the effect of MAB in different models of inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity in mice.	This study demonstrates that the pretreatment with MAB, given orally (8.4 to 83.8 μmol/kg), inhibited carrageenan- and complete Freund adjuvant-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. When administered after the induction of hypersensitivity, MAB also reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity in the ipsilateral and in the contralateral hindpaws of mice injected with complete Freund adjuvant, interfering with a signaling cascade already established. MAB reversed the hypersensitivity (mechanical and thermal) of operated animals, with similar results to those observed with gabapentin. MAB activity was evident when administered either systemically (PO or IV) or intrathecally, suggesting interference in the central pathways of pain control. Furthermore, MAB seems to present an antiinflammatory effect evidenced by the interference in both the neutrophil migration and in the increase of interleukin-1β levels after carrageenan injection. Of note, MAB treatment did not interfere with mechanical or thermal sensitivity in healthy mice, a frequent characteristic of commonly used analgesics, such as morphine or gabapentin. Side effects including interference in locomotor activity, motor performance, and body temperature in animals treated with MAB were absent.	MAB reduced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in mice submitted to models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, showing excellent potential for treating persistent pain in humans."}

A screen based on Tet-on DUX4-induced mouse myoblast death previously uncovered compounds from a 44,000-compound library that protect against DUX4 toxicity. Many of those compounds acted downstream of DUX4 in an oxidative stress pathway. Here, we extend this screen to an additional 160,000 compounds and, using greater stringency, identify a new set of DUX4-protective compounds. From 640 hits, we performed secondary screens, repurchased 46 of the most desirable, confirmed activity, and tested each for activity against other cell death-inducing insults. The majority of these compounds also protected against oxidative stress. Of the 100 repurchased compounds identified through both screens, only SHC40, 75, and 98 inhibited DUX4 target genes, but they also inhibited dox-mediated DUX4 expression. Using a target gene readout on the 640-compound hit set, we discovered three overlooked compounds, SHC351, 540, and 572, that inhibit DUX4 target gene upregulation without nonspecific effects on the Tet-on system. These novel inhibitors of DUX4 transcriptional activity may thus act on pathways or cofactors needed by DUX4 for transcriptional activation in these cells."}

As such, there is a need to develop better therapies that specifically target myelin-specific aberrant immune cells involved in CNS inflammation without compromising the general immune system. In the present study, we developed a new bifunctional peptide inhibitor (BPI) that is effective and specific. Our BPI (PLP-B7AP) is composed of an antigenic peptide from myelin proteolipid protein (PLP139-151) and a B7 antisense peptide (B7AP) derived from CD28 receptor. The main hypothesis is that PLP-B7AP simultaneously targets MHC-II and B7-costimulatory molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) and possibly alters the differentiation of naïve T cells from inflammatory to regulatory phenotypes. Results showed that PLP-B7AP was very effective in suppressing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) compared to various controls in a mouse model. PLP-B7AP was effective when administered both before and after disease induction. Secreted cytokines from splenocytes isolated during periods of high disease severity and remission indicated that PLP-B7AP treatment induced an increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Further, analysis of cortical brain tissue sections showed that PLP-B7AP treated mice had significantly lower demyelination compared to the control group. All these taken together indicate that the T cell receptor (TCR) and the CD28 receptor can be targeted simultaneously to improve efficacy and specificity of potential MS therapeutics."}

This study focused on evaluating muscle growth regulation differences in adult zebrafish and giant danio utilizing growth hormone treatment as a mode of growth manipulation. Growth hormone treatment resulted in increased overall growth in giant danio, but failed to increase growth in the zebrafish. Growth hormone treatment increased muscle IGF-I and GHrI gene expression in both species, but to a larger degree in the giant danio. In contrast, zebrafish exhibited a larger increase in IrA and IGF-IrB gene expression in muscle in response to GH treatment. In addition muscle myostatin levels were differentially regulated between the two species, with a down-regulation observed in rapidly growing, GH-treated giant danio and an up-regulation in zebrafish not actively growing in response to GH. This is the first report of differential expression of growth-regulating genes in closely related fish species exhibiting opposing growth paradigms.

Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a unilateral experimental controlled cortical contusion and killed at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10 days post injury (dpi). Cell death was examined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) method together with immunohistochemistry for cellular markers.

At all time points, 10-16% of the TUNEL-positive cells showed an apoptotic nuclear morphology. The apoptotic features were restricted to neurons and some inflammatory cells. Immunohistochemistry for Bax revealed a translocation of Bax from a diffuse to a granular distribution in neurons. An up-regulation of Bax mRNA at 6 dpi was discernible. This increase was associated with a statistically significant increase in number of cells with up-regulated and translocated Bax protein. Moreover, a statistically significant increase of Bcl-2 mRNA was detected at 10 dpi. The potential window for anti-apoptotic treatment to salvage neurons is wide.

Schltr leaves are used in Cameroonian traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Several studies have been performed on the biological activities of secondary metabolites extracted from these plants. However, to the best of our knowledge, the anti-neuro inflammatory and protective roles of the polysaccharides of these three plants have not yet been elucidated. This study aimed at investigating potential use of K. grandifoliola, C. sanguinolenta and C. citratus polysaccharides in the prevention of chronic inflammation.	Firstly, the composition of polysaccharide fractions isolated from K. grandifoliola stem bark (KGF), C. sanguinolenta (CSF) and C. citratus (CCF) leaves was assessed. Secondly, the cytotoxicity was evaluated on Raw 264.7 macrophages and U87-MG glioblastoma cell lines by the MTT assay. This was followed by the in vitro evaluation of the ability of KGF, CSF and CCF to inhibit lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced overproduction of various pro-inflammatory mediators (NO, ROS and IL1β, TNFα, IL6, NF-kB cytokines). This was done in Raw 264.7 and U87-MG cells. Finally, the in vitro protective effect of KGF, CSF and CCF against LPS-induced toxicity in the U87-MG cells was evaluated.	CCF was shown to mostly contain sugar and no polyphenol while KGP and CSP contained very few amounts of these metabolites (≤ 2%). The three polysaccharide fractions were non-toxic up to 100 μg.mL[- 1]. All the polysaccharides at 10 μg/mL inhibited NO production, but only KGF and CCF at 12.5 μg/mL down-regulated LPS-induced ROS overproduction. Finally, 100 μg/mL LPS reduced 50% of U87 cell viability, and pre-treatment with the three polysaccharides significantly increased the proliferation.	These results suggest that the polysaccharides of K. grandifoliola, C. citratus and C. sanguinolenta could be beneficial in preventing/treating neurodegenerative diseases in which neuroinflammation is part of the pathophysiology."}

In vivo pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of these channels indicates that TRPA1 plays a major role in iodine antiseptics-induced pain and the adjuvant effect of iodine antiseptics on allergic contact dermatitis and that TRPV1 is also involved.

We must integrate the following four facts: first, MS lesions have a signature of IL-6-, IL-17-, osteopontin- and IFN-driven transcriptional activity. Second, MS is worsened with administration of IFN-gamma, the quintessential type 2 IFN and Th1 cytokine. Third, blockade of TNF-alpha worsened MS in clinical trials. Fourth, inhibiting the main driver of Th17, IL-23, failed to modulate relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).

A paper in this issue of the European Journal of Immunology demonstrates that IFN-beta suppresses production in CD4(+) T cells of both osteopontin and IL-17. In this commentary, the roles of these two molecules, i.e. osteopontin and IL-17, are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of MS.

However, the precise mechanism(s) by which antioxidants inhibit this injury remain(s) unclear. We therefore studied the extent and location of protein oxidation in the brain using various biochemical and immunochemical methods. In cortical parenchyma, a trend for increased protein carbonyls was not evident until 21 hours after infection and the activity of glutamine synthetase (another index of protein oxidation) remained unchanged. Consistent with these results, there was no evidence for oxidative alterations in the cortex by various immunohistochemical methods even in cortical lesions. In contrast, there was a marked increase in carbonyls, 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts and manganese superoxide dismutase in the cerebral vasculature. Elevated lipid peroxidation was also observed in cerebrospinal fluid and occasionally in the hippocampus. All of these oxidative alterations were inhibited by treatment of infected animals with N-acetylcysteine or alpha-phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone. Because N-acetylcysteine does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and has no effect on the loss of endogenous brain antioxidants, its neuroprotective effect is likely based on extraparenchymal action such as inhibition of vascular oxidative alterations."}

We examined whether exposure of NF to 2,5-HD affected NF degradation. Two different models were used: (1) NF-enriched cytoskeletons isolated from human sciatic nerve were incubated with 2,5-HD in vitro and (2) differentiated human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH) were exposed to 2, 5-HD in culture prior to isolation of cytoskeletal proteins. The cytoskeletal preparations were subsequently incubated with calpain II. The amount of NF-H and NF-L remaining after proteolysis was determined by SDS-PAGE and quantitative immunoblotting. NF-M proteolysis could not be quantified. Incubation of sciatic nerve cytoskeletal preparations with 2,5-HD resulted in cross-linking of all three NF proteins into high molecular weight (HMW) material with a range of molecular weights. Proteolysis of the NF-H and NF-L polypeptides was not affected by 2,5-HD-exposure. Degradation of the HMW material containing NF-H or NF-L was retarded when comparing with degradation of the NF-H and NF-L polypeptides, respectively, from control samples, but not as compared to the corresponding NF polypeptides from 2,5-HD-treated samples. Exposure of SK-N-SH cells to 2,5-HD also resulted in considerable cross-linking of NF. No differences were found between the proteolytic rates of NF-L and NF-H from exposed cells as compared with those subunits from control cells. Moreover, degradation of cross-linked NF-H was not different from monomeric NF-H. In conclusion, whether 2,5-HD affects calpain-mediated degradation of cross-linked NF proteins will depend on which model better reflects NF cross-linking as occurring in 2, 5-HD-induced axonopathy. However, with both models it was demonstrated that exposure of NF proteins to 2,5-HD without subsequent cross-linking is not adequate to inhibit NF proteolysis in vitro by added calpain."}

NVP-BEZ235 radiosensitized a variety of cancer cell lines, including SQ20B head and neck carcinoma cells and U251 glioblastoma cells. NVP-BEZ235 also increased in vivo radiation response in SQ20B xenografts. Knockdown of Akt1, p110α, or mTOR resulted in radiosensitization, but not to the same degree as with NVP-BEZ235. NVP-BEZ235 interfered with DNA damage repair after radiation as measured by the CometAssay and resolution of phosphorylated H2A histone family member X foci. NVP-BEZ235 abrogated the radiation-induced phosphorylation of both DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated. Knockdown of either p110α or mTOR failed to decrease the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, suggesting that the effect of the drug was direct rather than mediated via p110α or mTOR. The treatment of cells with NVP-BEZ235 also promoted autophagy. To assess the importance of this process in radiosensitization, we used the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine and chloroquine and found that either drug increased cell killing after NVP-BEZ235 treatment and radiation. Knocking down the essential autophagy proteins autophagy related 5 (ATG5) and beclin1 increased NVP-BEZ235-mediated radiosensitization. Furthermore, NVP-BEZ235 radiosensitized autophagy-deficient ATG5(-/-) fibroblasts to a greater extent than ATG5(+/+) cells. We conclude that NVP-BEZ235 radiosensitizes cells and induces autophagy by apparently distinct mechanisms.

Lung cellular and molecular physiology^\nEarly coagulation events induce acute lung injury in a rat model of blunt traumatic brain injury.^\nAcute lung injury (ALI) and systemic coagulopathy are serious complications of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that frequently lead to poor clinical outcomes. Although the release of tissue factor (TF), a potent initiator of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, from the injured brain is thought to play a key role in coagulopathy after TBI, its function in ALI following TBI remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the systemic appearance of TF correlated with the ensuing coagulopathy that follows TBI in ALI using an anesthetized rat blunt trauma TBI model. Blood and lung samples were obtained after TBI. Compared with controls, pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary permeability were observed as early as 5 min after TBI without evidence of norepinephrine involvement. Systemic TF increased at 5 min and then diminished 60 min after TBI. Lung injury and alveolar hemorrhaging were also observed as early as 5 min after TBI. A biphasic elevation of TF was observed in the lungs after TBI, and TF-positive microparticles (MPs) were detected in the alveolar spaces. Fibrin(ogen) deposition was also observed in the lungs within 60 min after TBI. Additionally, preadministration of a direct thrombin inhibitor, Refludan, attenuated lung injuries, thus implicating thrombin as a direct participant in ALI after TBI. The results from this study demonstrated that enhanced systemic TF may be an initiator of coagulation activation that contributes to ALI after TBI."}

Many studies showed the cannabinoid-opioid cross-modulation in antinociception, hypothermia, sedation and reward. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of early application of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonism SR141716A after brain injury on dynorphin-κ opioid receptor (KOR) system and the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in a rat model of fluid percussion injury (FPI). Firstly, seizure latency induced by pentylenetetrazole was significantly prolonged 6 weeks after brain injury in group of SR141716A treatment. Then, PCR and western blot showed that SR141716A inhibited the long-term up-regulation of CB1 receptors in hippocampus. However, SR141716A resulted in long-term potentiation of dynorphin release and did not influence the up-regulation of KOR in hippocampus after brain injury. Furthermore, SR141716A reverse the overexpression of mGluR5 in the late stage of brain injury. We propose that during the induction of epileptogenesis after brain injury, early application of CB1 receptor antagonism could prevent long-term hyperexcitability by up-regulation of dynorphin-KOR system and prevention of mGluR5 induced epileptogenesis in hippocampus."}

One nonpharmacological treatment used is acupuncture, a procedure in which fine needles are inserted into body points with the intent of relieving pain and other symptoms. Here we investigated the effects of manual acupuncture (MA) on modulating macrophage phenotype and interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentrations in animals with muscle inflammation. Carrageenan, injected in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice, induces an inflammatory response characterized by mechanical hyperalgesia and edema. The inflammation is initially a neutrophilic infiltration that converts to a macrophage-dominated inflammation by 48 h. MA of the Sanyinjiao or Spleen 6 (SP6) acupoint reduces nociceptive behaviors, heat, and mechanical hyperalgesia and enhanced escape/avoidance and the accompanying edema. SP6 MA increased muscle IL-10 levels and was ineffective in reducing pain behaviors and edema in IL-10 knockout (IL-10(-/-)) mice. Repeated daily treatments with SP6 MA induced a phenotypic switch of muscle macrophages with reduced M1 macrophages (pro-inflammatory cells) and an increase of M2 macrophages (anti-inflammatory cells and important IL-10 source). These findings provide new evidence that MA produces a phenotypic switch in macrophages and increases IL-10 concentrations in muscle to reduce pain and inflammation."}

Numerous evidences suggest synergic effects when various neurotrophic factors are administered in experimental models of PD. The aim of the present work was to assess the morphological changes along the rostro-caudal axis of caudo-putamen complex and substantia nigra (SN) in the referred model in order to test the suitability of a severe model to evaluate new neurorestorative therapies. Administration of 6-OHDA into MFB in addition to a remarkable depletion of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system induced an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells in SN and an intense immunoreactivity for OX-42, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Lycopersycum esculentum agglutinin (LEA) in striatum and SN. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining revealed a significant decrease of the TH-immunopositive striatal volume in 6-OHDA group from rostral to caudal one. The loss of TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons and axodendritic network (ADN) was higher in caudal sections. Morphological recovery after the implantation of microspheres loaded with VEGF and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in parkinsonized rats was related to the preservation of the TH-ir cell number and ADN in the caudal region of the SN. In addition, these findings support the neurorestorative role of VEGF+GDNF in the dopaminergic system and the synergistic effect between both factors. On the other hand, a topological distribution of the dopaminergic system was noticeable in the severe model, showing a selective vulnerability to 6-OHDA and recovering after treatment."}

Nox1 and Nox2 gene expression were found to increase in striatum, whereas a marked increase of Nox2 expression was observed in substantia nigra (SN) of wild-type (wt) mice after PD induction. Gp91(phox-/-) 6-OHDA-lesioned mice exhibited a significant reduction in the apomorphine-induced rotational behavior, when compared to wt mice. Immunolabeling assays indicated that striatal 6-OHDA injections reduced the number of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the SN of wt mice. In gp91(phox-/-) 6-OHDA-lesioned mice the DA degeneration was negligible, suggesting an involvement of Nox in 6-OHDA-mediated SN degeneration. Gp91(phox-/-) 6-OHDA-lesioned mice treated with minocycline, a tetracycline derivative that exerts multiple anti-inflammatory effects, including microglial inhibition, exhibited increased apomorphine-induced rotational behavior and degeneration of DA neurons after 6-OHDA injections. The same treatment also increased TNF-α release and potentiated NF-κB activation in the SN of gp91(phox-/-)-lesioned mice. Our results demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of microglial cells increases the susceptibility of gp91(phox-/-) 6-OHDA lesioned mice to develop PD. Blockade of microglia leads to NF-κB activation and TNF-α release into the SN of gp91(phox-/-) 6-OHDA lesioned mice, a likely mechanism whereby gp91(phox-/-) 6-OHDA lesioned mice may be more susceptible to develop PD after microglial cell inhibition.

We studied the neuromodulatory effect of ALA against neurotoxicity of BPA in vitro in C8-D1A mouse astrocyte cell line and in vivo in C57BL/6J male mice. In vitro ALA (100 μM) protected cells from BPA (30 μM)-induced reactive oxygen species generation and increased activity of glial fibrillary acidic protein. ALA showed reduction in cell death in astrocytes treated with BPA. In vivo ALA (50 mg/kg) increased the neurospecific acetylcholinesterase activity and decreased the monoamine oxidase activity altered by BPA exposure (10 mg/kg, per os x 30 days). In addition to neuroprotective effects, ALA also showed protective effects against BPA-induced oxidative stress. We observed that ALA significantly replenished the declined neurobehavioral and cognitive performances, decreased muscle coordination and alerted short-term recognition memory in mice exposed to BPA.

Microglia and astrocytes play an important role in perpetuating multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by demyelination. Therefore, sildenafil can be a potential tool for MS treatment. The present study investigated the effects of sildenafil on the myelin structure and astrocyte/microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in an animal model of MS. Cuprizone-induced demyelination and neuroinflammation in rodents has been widely used as a model for MS. Herein, five male C57BL/6 mice (7-10 weeks old) were used per group. Over a 4-week period, the different groups received the following: (1) cuprizone (0.2%) mixed into the chow; (2) cuprizone in the chow and sildenafil (Viagra®; 3, 25 or 50mg/kg) in the drinking water; or (3) pure chow and water (control group). Cerebella were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and luxol fast blue staining. Cuprizone induced tissue damage, with an increase in GFAP, Iba-1 and COX-2 and demyelination in comparison to the control group. However, cuprizone did not affect the expression of cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β and IL-2). Sildenafil reduced GFAP (25 and 50mg/kg) and Iba-1 expression (25mg/kg) in comparison to the cuprizone group, indicating the modulation of astrocytes and microglia, respectively. Sildenafil preserved myelin and axons ultrastructure and strongly reduced IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2 and COX-2 expression in comparison to the control and/or cuprizone groups. The results demonstrate a protective effect of sildenafil in the cerebellum. Thus, well-designed clinical trials may demonstrate that the oral administration of sildenafil can be suitable for individuals with MS and other neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative diseases, providing additional benefits to current treatments."}

Interstitial drug delivery has been the most appealing method for the treatment of primary brain tumors because it provides the most direct method of overcoming the barriers to tumor drug delivery. By administering therapeutic agents directly to the brain interstitium and, more specifically, to tumor-infiltrated parenchyma, one can overcome the elevated interstitial pressure produced by brain tumors. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) has emerged as a leading investigational delivery technique for the treatment of brain tumors. Clinical trials utilizing these methods have been completed, with mixed results, and several more are being initiated. However, the potential efficacy of these drugs may be limited by ineffective tissue distribution. The development of computer models/algorithms to predict drug distribution, new catheter designs, and utilization of tracer models and nanocarriers have all laid the groundwork for the advancement of CED.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of mild hypoxia on cognitive function and hippocampal neurogenesis of rats with pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy. Chronic epilepsy induced marked spatial learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze that were rescued by consecutively 28 days mild hypoxia exposure (6 h/d at 3000 m altitude equivalent) during the chronic phase. Moreover, mild hypoxia reversed the suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis and the downregulation of NT-3 and BDNF expression in hippocampus and cortex of epileptic rats. Mild hypoxia in vitro also promoted hippocampus-derived NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation.

Argatroban is a synthetic small molecule derived from l-arginine with specific antithrombotic activity. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that binds avidly and reversibly to the catalytic site of thrombin and that does not require other cofactors to exert its antithrombotic action. Due to its selective inhibitory mechanism, argatroban blocks both circulating and clot-bound thrombin. A rapid onset of its anticoagulant action is achieved after intravenous administration. The short elimination half-life of argatroban (52+/-16 minutes) ensures a rapid restoration of hemostasis upon cessation of treatment. Argatroban produces a predictable dose response, and its anticoagulant actions can be monitored easily through the routine coagulation tests activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and activated clotting time (ACT). The specific mechanism of action and favorable pharmacokinetic profile of argatroban suggest that it could be beneficial in all indications where other intravenous anticoagulants are used. Results from clinical studies performed to date show that, when administered to patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or HIT with thrombosis (HITTS) in two large-scale, nonrandomized, prospective trials, argatroban reduced a combined endpoint of morbidity and mortality when compared with historical controls. Argatroban was well tolerated in clinical trials of patients with HIT and caused no increase in bleeding risk compared with historical controls. Argatroban does not induce the formation of antibodies that can neutralize its anticoagulant effect, prolong its half-life or enhance its activity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of this drug as an alternative antithrombotic treatment for patients with HIT as well as for patients with or at risk for HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. In 2004 (Sweden), 2005 (Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Iceland) and 2006 (Denmark) argatroban was approved for anticoagulation in adult patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II who require parenteral antithrombotic therapy."}

Muscle proteolysis, in particular through the ubiquitin- proteasome system (UPS), is considered to play a major role in the catabolic action of glucocorticoids. The stimulation by glucocorticoids of the UPS is mediated through the increased expression of several atrogenes ('genes involved in atrophy'), such as atrogin-1 and MuRF-1, two ubiquitin ligases involved in the targeting of protein to be degraded by the proteasome machinery. Glucocorticoids also exert an anti-anabolic action by blunting muscle protein synthesis. These changes in protein turnover may result from changes in the production of two growth factors which control muscle mass, namely IGF-I and myostatin respectively anabolic and catabolic toward the skeletal muscle. The decreased production of IGF-I as well as the increased production of myostatin have been both demonstrated to contribute to the muscle atrophy caused by glucocorticoids. At the molecular level, IGF-I antagonizes the catabolic action of glucocorticoids by inhibiting, through the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway, the activity of the transcription factor FOXO, a major switch for the stimulation of several atrogenes. These recent progress in the understanding of the glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy should allow to define new therapies aiming to minimize this myopathy.

The effect of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a ligand for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), was determined on the evoked-Ca2+ transient in the coculture condition. The level of PEA was reduced in DRG cells from tumor-bearing mice as well as those cocultured with fibrosarcoma cells. Pretreatment with PEA, a synthetic PPARα agonist (GW7647), or ARN077, an inhibitor of the enzyme that hydrolyzes PEA, acutely decreased the amplitude of the evoked Ca2+ transient in small DRG neurons cocultured with fibrosarcoma cells. The PPARα antagonist GW6471 blocked the effect of each. In contrast, the PPARα agonist was without effect in the control condition, but the antagonist increased the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient, suggesting that PPARα receptors are saturated by endogenous ligand under basal conditions. Effects of drugs on mechanical sensitivity in vivo paralleled their effects on DRG neurons in vitro. Local injection of ARN077 decreased mechanical hyperalgesia in tumor-bearing mice, and the effect was blocked by GW6471. These data support the conclusion that the activity of DRG neurons is rapidly modulated by PEA through a PPARα-dependent mechanism. Moreover, agents that increase the activity of PPARα may provide a therapeutic strategy to reduce tumor-evoked pain."}

Associated neurological features may be nonspecific (e.g., headache), subtle (e.g., gaze-evoked nystagmus), or delayed. Although neurosurgery may be required in some cases, primary strabismus management (surgical or prismatic correction) can be successful, particularly when strabismus is the lone (or sole specific) finding."}

Here we report a study of longitudinal metabolic differences between TASTPM transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice and their wild type counterparts using (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to look for potential biomarkers for use in AD research and drug discovery. Chloroform methanol extractions were performed on the brains of mice aged between 3 and 18 months. (1)H MR spectra were recorded from the aqueous fractions. Absolute metabolite concentrations, determined from resonance integrals relative to an internal standard, were analysed by 2-way ANOVA (genotype x age). Significant effects of age alone were identified for creatine, glutamine and total choline-containing compounds. There was a marked increase in creatine in the oldest (15-18 mo) TASTPM mice. The increase in creatine was unexpected and may be caused by osmotic stress in older animals as plaque load increases. Care should be taken when using creatine as a reference metabolite during scans of these animals in vivo. A significant effect of genotype alone was identified for myo-inositol (MI), which was higher in TASTPM mice at all ages. Succinate, glycerophosphocholine and choline all showed significant effects of age and genotype. No significant effects were detected in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels. Increased MI could be a marker of gliosis or microglial activation in TASTPM mice, but the absence of an age dependence for MI levels means it may be a biomarker of disease, but not of disease progression. Decreased succinate is indicative of disrupted neuronal energy metabolism, an effect that has been seen in human AD."}

The results showed that most of the target compounds displayed significant potency to inhibit Aβ(1-42) self-aggregation. Among them, compound 7q exhibited the best inhibition of Aβ(1-42) self-aggregation (59.11% at 20 μM) in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, the compounds 6b, 7p and 7q as representatives were found to present anti-inflammation properties in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial BV-2 cells. They could effectively suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Meanwhile, compound 7q could prevent the neuronal cell SH-SY5Y death by LPS-stimulated microglia cell activation mediated neurotoxicity. The molecular modeling studies demonstrated that compounds matched the pharmacophore well and had good predicted physicochemical properties and estimated IC50 values. Moreover, compound 7q exerted a good binding to the active site of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) through the docking analysis and could interfere with its homodimerization or heterodimerization. Consequently, these compounds emerged as promising candidates for further development of novel multifunctional agents for AD treatment."}

In recent years, cell-based therapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic tool. Schwann cells (SCs) are the main supportive cells for peripheral nerve regeneration; however, there are several technical limitations regarding its application for cell-based therapy. In this context, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have been used as alternatives to SCs for treating peripheral neuropathies, showing great promise. Several studies have been trying to shed light on the mechanisms behind the nerve regeneration-promotion potential of BM-MSCs. Although not completely clarified, understanding how BM-MSCs exert tissue repair effects will facilitate their development as therapeutic agents before they become a clinically viable tool for encouraging peripheral nerve regeneration."}

Partial replacement of lost oligodendrocytes and remyelination can occur as a result of activation and recruitment of resident oligodendroglial precursor cells. However, the overall remyelination capacity remains inefficient because precursor cells often fail to generate new oligodendrocytes. Increasing evidence points to the existence of several molecular inhibitors that act on these cells and interfere with their cellular maturation. The p57kip2 gene encodes one such potent inhibitor of oligodendroglial differentiation and this study sheds light on the underlying mode of action. We found that subcellular distribution of the p57kip2 protein changed during differentiation of rat, mouse, and human oligodendroglial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Nuclear export of p57kip2 was correlated with promoted myelin expression, higher morphological phenotypes, and enhanced myelination in vitro. In contrast, nuclear accumulation of p57kip2 resulted in blocked oligodendroglial differentiation. Experimental evidence suggests that the inhibitory role of p57kip2 depends on specific interactions with binding proteins such as LIMK-1, CDK2, Mash1, and Hes5 either by controlling their site of action or their activity. Because functional restoration in demyelinating diseases critically depends on the successful generation of oligodendroglial cells, a therapeutic need that is currently unmet, the regulatory mechanism described here might be of particular interest for identifying suitable drug targets and devising novel therapeutic approaches."}

Rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, has proven neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects and might also reduce SGC degeneration and fibrosis, but it has to pass the cellular membrane to be biologically active.	Lipidic nanocapsules (LNC) can be used as biodegradable drug carriers to increase the efficacy of conventional application methods. We examined the biological effects of rolipram and LNC's core encapsulated rolipram on SGC and dendritic cell (DC) tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in vitro and on SGC survival in systemically-deafened guinea pigs in vivo.	Our results prove that rolipram does not have a beneficial effect on cultured SGC. Incorporation of rolipram in LNC increased the survival of SGC significantly. In the DC study, rolipram significantly inhibited TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner. The rolipram-loaded LNC provided a significant cytokine inhibition as well. In vivo data do not confirm the in vitro results.	By transporting rolipram into the SGC cytoplasm, LNC enabled the neuroprotective effect of rolipram in vitro, but not in vivo. This might be due to dilution of test substances by perilymph or an inadequate release of rolipram based on differing in vivo and in vitro conditions. Nevertheless, based on in vitro results, proving a significantly increased neuronal survival when using LNC-rolipram compared to pure rolipram and pure LNC application, we believe that the combination of rolipram and LNC can potentially reduce neuronal degeneration and fibrosis after CI implantation. We conclude that rolipram is a promising drug that can be used in inner ear therapy and that LNC have potential as an inner ear drug-delivery system. Further experiments with modified conditions might reveal in vivo biological effects."}

However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Activation of NADPH oxidase critically contributes to ischemic brain damage via increase in ROS production. We herein tested the hypothesis that NBO protects the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via inhibiting gp91phox (or called Nox2) containing NADPH oxidase in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Wild-type C57/BL6 mice and gp91phoxknockout mice were given NBO (95% O2) or normoxia (21% O2) during 90-min MCAO, followed by 22.5 hrs of reperfusion. BBB damage was quantified by measuring Evans blue extravasation. The protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tight junction protein occludin and gp91phox were assessed with western blot. Gel zymography was used to assess the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9. In the wild type mice, cerebral ischemia and reperfusion led to remarkable Evans blue extravasation, significantly increased gp91phox and MMP-9 levels and decreased occludin levels in the ischemic brain tissue. In gp91phox knockout mice, the changes in Evans blue extravasation, MMP-9 and occludin were at much smaller magnitudes when compared to the wild type. Importantly, NBO treatment significantly reduced the changes in all measured parameters in wild type mice, while did not cause additional reductions in these changes when gp91phox was knocked out. These results indicate that activation of Nox2 containing NADPH oxidase is implicated in the induction of MMP-9, loss of occludin and BBB disruption in ischemic stroke, and inhibition of Nox2 may be an important mechanism underlying NBO-afforded BBB protection."}

SCH 50911 abolished seizures in all three models in a dose-dependent fashion (ID100 = 8-170 mumol/kg). In each model SCH 50911 was more potent (ID50 = 2-22 mumol/kg) than the following antiabsence compounds: the GABAB antagonist CGP 35348 (ID50 = 210-890 mumol/kg); ethosuximide (ID50 < or = 142-1240 mumol/kg); trimethadione (ID50 = 520-1100 mumol/kg); and valproic acid (ID50 = 900-2360 mumol/kg).

In the present study, we report that levels of Fos-related antigen-2 are elevated in several models of chemically induced brain injury. Trimethyltin, which causes degeneration of neurons primarily in the hippocampus and other limbic regions, results in a five-fold induction of Fos-related antigen-2 immunoreactivity in neurons in the pyramidal and dentate layers of the hippocampus starting at seven days post-treatment and persisting for 60days. Methamphetamine and methylenedioxymethamphetamine, agents which cause degeneration of dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum of the mouse, cause an increase in Fos-related antigen-2 immunoreactivity which begins at three days post-treatment and returns to basal levels by days 5 and 15, respectively. Treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine elevated levels of Fos-related antigen-2 in the mouse striatum at three days post-treatment. This abbreviated time-course of Fos-related antigen-2 induction is consistent with less severe insult (terminal damage) relative to trimethyltin (cell death), but induction occurs during the period of regeneration and repair in both models. Dexfenfluramine, a non-neurotoxic amphetamine, does not induce Fos-related antigen-2 expression. Decreasing core temperature of the mouse, which blocks amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity, also blocks Fos-related antigen-2 induction. In summary, Fos-related antigen-2 is induced in models of both cell death and terminal degeneration, suggesting that this transcription factor may serve as a universal signal transduction molecule involved in the regulation of genes related to regeneration and repair in the CNS."}

Using a controlled cortical impact model, TBI was induced in 8- to 10-week-old male C57BL/6J WT and IFNAR1(-/-) mice and brains were excised to study infarct volume, inflammatory mediator release via quantitative PCR analysis and immune cell profile via immunohistochemistry. IFNAR1(-/-) mice displayed smaller infarcts compared with WT mice after TBI. IFNAR1(-/-) mice exhibited an altered anti-inflammatory environment compared with WT mice, with significantly reduced levels of the proinflammatory mediators TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6, an up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory mediator IL-10 and an increased activation of resident and peripheral immune cells after TBI. WT mice injected intravenously with an anti-IFNAR1 blocking monoclonal antibody (MAR1) 1 h before, 30 min after or 30 min and 2 d after TBI displayed significantly improved histological and behavioral outcome. Bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that the hematopoietic cells are a peripheral source of type-1 IFNs that drives neuroinflammation and a worsened TBI outcome. Type-1 IFN mRNA levels were confirmed to be significantly altered in human postmortem TBI brains.

Since spermine, one of the main natural polyamines in the central nervous system, protects from LPS-induced memory deficit by a mechanism that comprises GluN2B receptors, the aim of the present study was to determine whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor and cAMP response element binding (CREB) are involved in this protective effect of spermine. Adult male Swiss albino mice received, immediately after training in the novel object recognition task, saline or LPS (250 μg/kg, i.p.); 5 min later they received saline or spermine (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) and, when specified, 5 min thereafter saline or the TrkB receptor antagonist ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) in different flanks. Animals were tested 24 h after training. Spermine protected from LPS-induced memory deficit and this protective effect was reversed by ANA-12. In a subset of animals BDNF, CREB and phospho-CREB immunoreactivity was determined in the hippocampi and cerebral cortex 4 h after spermine injection. Spermine reversed the decrease of mature BDNF levels induced by LPS in both hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Spermine increased phospho-CREB content and phospho-CREB/total CREB ratio in the cerebral cortex of LPS-treated mice. The results support that the protective effect of spermine on LPS-induced memory deficits depends on TrkB receptor activation and is accompanied by restoration of mature BDNF levels in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as well as increased CREB phosphorylation in the cerebral cortex."}

Pre-blocking with RGD peptide before injection of RGD-SERRS nanoparticles was used to verify the specificity of integrin-targeting. In contrast to the current belief that the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect results in a baseline uptake of nanoparticles regardless of their surface chemistry, integrin-targeting was shown to be highly specific, with markedly lower accumulation after pre-blocking. While the non-targeted SERRS particles enabled delineation of the main tumor, the RGD-SERRS nanoparticles afforded a major improvement in visualization of the true extent and the diffuse margins of the main tumor. This included the detection of unexpected tumor areas distant to the main tumor, tracks of migrating cells of 2-3 cells in diameter, and even isolated distant tumor cell clusters of less than 5 cells.

This effect is possibly related to the well-demonstrated evidence that fluoxetine and gepirone, on long-term treatment, facilitate net 5-HT neurotransmission through desensitization of presynaptic 5-HT autoreceptors."}

With the application of Occam's razor to asthma, it is proposed that there is one cause underlying the numerous phenotypes of this disease and that the responsible molecular pathway is a deficiency of iron in the lung tissues. This deficiency can be either absolute (e.g. asthma in the neonate and during both pregnancy and menstruation) or functional (e.g. asthma associated with infections, smoking, and obesity). Comparable associations between asthma co-morbidity (e.g. eczema, urticaria, restless leg syndrome, and pulmonary hypertension) with iron deficiency support such a shared mechanistic pathway. Therapies directed at asthma demonstrate a capacity to impact iron homeostasis, further strengthening the relationship. Finally, pathophysiologic events producing asthma, including inflammation, increases in Th2 cells, and muscle contraction, can correlate with iron availability. Recognition of a potential association between asthma and an absolute and/or functional iron deficiency suggests specific therapeutic interventions including inhaled iron."}

Currently, no studies have examined the potential for BBG to provide neuroprotection in animal models of TBI. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of BBG on TBI and to determine the underlying mechanisms. The rats were subjected to a diffuse cortical impact injury caused by a modified weight-drop device, and then divided randomly into three groups: the sham-operated, BBG treatment and vehicle groups. In the BBG treatment group, 50 mg/kg brilliant blue G (BBG; 100% pure), a highly specific and clinically useful P2X7 antagonist, was administered via the tail vein 15 min prior to or up to 8 h following TBI. The co-localization of NeuN and protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ) was followed with immunofluorescent staining. The expression of P2X7, PKCγ and inflammatory cytokines was identified by western blot analysis. Wet-dry weight method was used to evaluate brain edema, and motor function outcome was examined using the neurological severity score. The present study demonstrated that the administration of BBG attenuated TBI-induced cerebral edema and the associated motor deficits. Following trauma, BBG treatment significantly reduced the levels of PKCγ and interleukin-1β in the cortex. The results provide in vivo evidence that BBG exerted neuroprotective effects by attenuating brain edema and improving neurological functions via reducing PKCγ and interleukin-1β levels following TBI."}

In the present study, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of Bougainvillea glabra Choisy leaf extract (BG extract) against paraquat (PQ)-induced neurotoxicity. Male adult wild-type flies (1- 4days old) were exposed to PQ (3.5mM) and/or BG extract (120μg/mL) through food for 4days. PQ-fed flies had decreased locomotor capacity in negative geotaxis and crossing number assays and had a higher incidence of mortality than the control group. PQ neurotoxicity was also associated with a marked decrease in dopamine levels and increase in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation. Co-exposure to BG extract prevented mortality, and dopamine depletion, improved locomotor performance and decreased AChE activity, ROS production and lipid peroxidation. GC-MS and HPLC analyses of BG extract revealed the presence of many antioxidant compounds such as phytol, α,γ-tocopherol, squalene, stigmasterol, geranylgeraniol, quercetin, and caffeic, vanillic, coumaric, ferulic acids. Our results showed neuroprotective effects of BG extract, reflecting the presence of antioxidant compounds. Thus, we suggested that B. glabra leaves could be considered an effective agent in the prevention of neurological disorders, where dopamine depletion and/or oxidative stress are involved, as in Parkinson's disease (PD)."}

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin's effect on cognitive functions are not well-understood. In the present study, we examined the working memory and spatial reference memory in rats that received a ventricular injection of amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ1-42), representing a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The rats treated with Aβ1-42 exhibited obvious cognitive deficits in behavioral tasks. Chronic (seven consecutive days, once per day) but not acute (once a day) curcumin treatments (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) improved the cognitive functions in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the beneficial effect of curcumin is accompanied by increased BDNF levels and elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the cognition enhancement effect of curcumin could be mimicked by the overexpression of BDNF in the hippocampus and blocked by either bilateral hippocampal injections with lentiviruses that express BDNF shRNA or a microinjection of ERK inhibitor. These findings suggest that chronic curcumin ameliorates AD-related cognitive deficits and that upregulated BDNF-ERK signaling in the hippocampus may underlie the cognitive improvement produced by curcumin."}

Although vaccines are available, they are not fully protective and outbreaks of disease may occur in vaccinated herds. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective antiviral treatment. For three abortigenic (94P247, 97P70 and 99P96) and three neuropathogenic isolates (97P82, 99P136 and 03P37), the effect of acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, adefovir, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-2,6-diaminopurine (PMEDAP) and foscarnet on plaque number was studied. Additionally, for isolate 97P70, the effect on plaque size was investigated. Ganciclovir was most potent in reducing plaque number, followed by PMEDAP and acyclovir. Adefovir and cidofovir were less effective and foscarnet was the least effective compound. There were no differences detected for acyclovir, ganciclovir, adefovir and PMEDAP between the abortigenic and neuropathogenic isolates. One abortigenic isolate (99P96) was more susceptible to cidofovir and two neuropathogenic isolates (99P136 and 03P37) were less susceptible to foscarnet. For isolate 97P70, all compounds resulted in a significant reduction of plaque size. The most remarkable effect was observed for cidofovir. It was 40-fold more effective in reducing plaque size than in reducing plaque number. In conclusion, ganciclovir was the most potent compound and therefore, may be a valuable candidate for the treatment of EHV-1 infections in horses. The antiviral effect of foscarnet on plaque number was highly dependent on the viral isolate tested. Therefore, it is no valuable antiviral for the treatment of herpesvirus-infections. Cidofovir, although less effective in reducing plaque number, had a strong effect on plaque size."}

Accumulating data from experimental animal studies and clinical trials in humans suggest that neonatal seizures could adversely affect normal brain development and result in long-term neurologic sequelae. Unfortunately, currently used anticonvulsive drugs are often ineffective in the neonatal period. One particularity of the immature neuronal network during neonatal development is that the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is mainly depolarizing, rather than hyperpolarizing as commonly observed in adults. This might, in part, explain not only the higher seizure propensity of the immature neuronal network, but also the limited anticonvulsive efficacy of GABA-enhancing drugs during early postnatal life. Accordingly, pharmacologic attenuation of GABAergic depolarization has been proposed as a strategy for neonatal seizure control. However, the underlying conjecture of a depolarizing mode of GABA action has been seriously challenged recently. In the present review, we will summarize the state of knowledge regarding GABAergic depolarization in early life and discuss how these data might impact a currently tested anticonvulsive strategy."}

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanism of taraxasterol in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia cells. BV2 microglia cells were treated with taraxasterol 12 h before LPS stimulation. The effects of taraxasterol on LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1β production were detected by ELISA. The effects of taraxasterol on LXRα, ABCA1, TLR4, and NF-κB expression were detected by western blot analysis. The results showed that taraxasterol dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1β production and NF-κB activation. Taraxasterol also disrupted the formation of lipid rafts and inhibited translocation of TLR4 into lipid rafts. Furthermore, taraxasterol was found to activate LXRα-ABCA1 signaling pathway which induces cholesterol efflux from cells. In addition, our results showed that the anti-inflammatory effect of taraxasterol was attenuated by transfection with LXRα siRNA.

Blocking farnesylation leads to an improvement in the abnormal nuclear morphology observed in cells expressing progerin, which is associated with a re-localization of the variant protein from the nuclear envelope to the nuclear interior. We now show that a progerin construct that cannot be farnesylated is localized primarily in intranuclear foci and that its diffusional mobility is significantly greater than that of farnesylated progerin localized predominantly at the nuclear envelope. Expression of non-farnesylated progerin in transfected cells leads to a redistribution of lamin A and lamin C away from the nuclear envelope into intranuclear foci but does not significantly affect the localization of endogenous lamin B1 at nuclear envelope. There is a similar redistribution of lamin A and lamin C into intranuclear foci in transfected cells expressing progerin in which protein farnesylation is blocked by treatment with a protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor. Blocking farnesylation of progerin can lead to a redistribution of normal A-type lamins away from the inner nuclear envelope. This may have implications for using drugs that block protein prenylation to treat children with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. These findings also provide additional evidence that A-type and B-type lamins can form separate microdomains within the nucleus."}

Activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been implicated in the progression of NAFLD and proposed as a therapeutic target; however, the effects of Hh signaling inhibition have not been studied in humans with germline mutations that affect this pathway.	Patients with holoprosencephaly (HPE), a disorder associated with germline mutations disrupting Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, were clinically evaluated for NAFLD. A combined mouse model of Hh signaling attenuation (Gli2 heterozygous null: Gli2[+/-]) and diet-induced NAFLD was used to examine aspects of NAFLD and hepatic gene expression profiles, including molecular markers of hepatic fibrosis and inflammation.	Patients with HPE had a higher prevalence of liver steatosis compared to the general population, independent of obesity. Exposure of Gli2[+/-] mice to fatty liver-inducing diets resulted in increased liver steatosis compared to wild-type mice. Similar to humans, this effect was independent of obesity in the mutant mice and was associated with decreased expression of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes, and increased expression of PPARγ, a potent anti-fibrogenic and anti-inflammatory regulator. Interestingly, tumor suppressors p53 and p16INK4 were found to be downregulated in the Gli2[+/-] mice exposed to a high-fat diet.	Our results indicate that germline mutations disrupting Hh signaling promotes liver steatosis, independent of obesity, with reduced fibrosis. While Hh signaling inhibition has been associated with a better NAFLD prognosis, further studies are required to evaluate the long-term effects of mutations affecting this pathway. Lay summary: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excess fat deposition in the liver predominantly due to high calorie intake and a sedentary lifestyle. NAFLD progression is usually accompanied by activation of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway leading to fibrous buildup (scar tissue) and inflammation of the liver tissue. For the first time patients with holoprosencephaly, a disease caused by SHH signaling mutations, are shown to have increased liver steatosis independent of obesity. This observation was recapitulated in a mouse model of attenuated SHH signaling that also showed increased liver steatosis but with decreased fibrosis and inflammation. While SHH inhibition is associated with a good NAFLD prognosis, this increase in liver fat accumulation in the context of SHH signaling inhibition must be studied prospectively to evaluate its long-term effects, especially in individuals with Western-type dietary habits."}

Using a series of tagged constructs, we found that these two receptors undergo extracellular cleavages to release secreted forms of the receptors and intramembranous cleavages to degrade the C-terminal fragments. Release of the extracellular domains was blocked by an inhibitor of metalloproteinases and increased by PMA. Accumulation of the intracellular domain was increased by the presence of an inhibitor of gamma-secretase. ApoE binding to these receptors caused increased release of the extracellular domain and accumulation of the intracellular domains; similar increases in receptor proteolytic domains were observed from endogenous apoEr2 after treatment of primary neurons or rat hippocampus with an apoE-derived peptide. The human apoE isoforms promoted proteolysis to different degrees, with apoE2 resulting in a greater accumulation of the C-terminal fragments of apoEr2 compared with apoE4. These effects of apoE on receptor proteolysis were mediated by the ligand binding domain of the receptor. Similar promotion of receptor cleavage was seen with two other ligands, reelin and activated alpha2-macroglobulin.

This review outlines the use of cell products in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with focus on neuroinflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis. Treatment of autoimmune diseases should be selective and specific in order to avoid serious side effects. To achieve this, T lymphocyte regulation has been in focus for several immunomodulatory regimens. One area of great interest is the use of T cell vaccination, when autologous attenuated auto-reactive T cells are given to patients in order to initiate a specific immune response to the pathogenic T cell populations. Phopheresis may be an immunomodulatory treatment related to T cell vaccination. Another promising area involves ex-vivo alteration of the cytokine profile of harmful auto-reactive T cells. This can be achieved by genetic manipulation or by certain cytokine stimulations. A subsequent adoptive cell transfer will, by homing mechanisms, lead to at site specific delivery of the cells, which will have a local down-regulatory effect on the inflammatory process. Although unsolved questions regarding doses, timing, optimal preparing conditions and mechanisms still remain, both T cell vaccination and adoptive transfer of ex-vivo manipulated cytokine secreting cells have proven successful for treatment of neuroinflammation in experimental models.

The aim of the present study was to understand the importance of neuronal nuclear Ca(2+) in the role of CaM KIV activation and CREB protein phosphorylation associated with hypoxia. To accomplish this the present study tests the hypothesis that clonidine administration will block increased nuclear Ca(2+) influx by inhibiting high affinity Ca(2+)/ATPase and prevent increased CaM KIV activity and CREB phosphorylation in the neuronal nuclei of the cerebral cortex of hypoxic newborn piglets. To accomplish this piglets were divided in three groups: normoxic, hypoxic, and hypoxic-treated with clonidine. The piglets that were in the Hx+Cl group received clonidine 5 min prior to hypoxia. Cerebral tissue hypoxia was confirmed biochemically by tissue levels of ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr). The data show that clonidine prevents hypoxia-induced increase in CaM KIV activity and CREB protein phosphorylation. We conclude that the mechanism of hypoxia-induced activation of CaM KIV and CREB phosphorylation is nuclear Ca(2+) influx mediated. We speculate that nuclear Ca(2+) influx is a key step that triggers CREB mediated transcription of apoptotic proteins and hypoxic mediated neuronal death."}

To clarify the possible function of the SCF/c-kit receptor system in the adult animal, we investigated the expression of c-kit receptor in the spinal cord and DRG in relation to pain by using H2C7, a newly developed anti-c-kit monoclonal antibody. S.c. and intrathecal injection of SCF markedly reduced the paw withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimuli and intrathecal SCF at 10 pg maximally induced mechanical allodynia in conscious mice. Intrathecal SCF also reduced the paw withdrawal latency to heat stimuli significantly but transiently.

Cell-size profiles showed that c-kit receptor expression was significantly up-regulated and down-regulated in medium-sized DRG neurons after neonatal capsaicin treatment and nerve injury, respectively.

The proportion of gained insulin-specific cells with T regulatory phenotype (CD4[+]CD25[high]CD127[low]GITR[+]FoxP3[+]) was in average between 93% and 97%. These cells have shown potent in vitro suppressive effect on T effector cells, produced IL-10 and TGF-β and expressed PD-1 and CD39. Further proliferation of these insulin-specific Treg required the presence of dendritic cells, anti-CD3 antibody and IL-2. This study provides new, reproducible experimental design for the enrichment and expansion of insulin-specific Treg that can be used for the cell-based therapy of autoimmunity."}

This dose of Al did not alter body weight, and there was no evidence of systemic toxicity. The degree of phosphorylation of several kinases which lead to transcription factor activation (reflecting the extent of their activation) was studied. The proportion of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) that was activated was depressed in cortex but not in the hippocampus following treatment but c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, IkappaB phosphorylation was unaltered in either tissue. Treatment of mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) alone produced no significant changes in the degree of activation of any transcription factor studied. When MPTP dosing had been preceded by extended exposure to low levels of Al in drinking water, ERK activation was profoundly depressed in cortex and hippocampus, whereas JNK in hippocampus and IkappaB in cortex were greatly elevated. These changes consequent to exposure to both Al and MPTP were accompanied by an increase in NF-kappaB in both regions, whereas AP-1 was elevated in the hippocampus alone. Neither agent alone modulated AP-1 or NF-kappaB. Thus a synergistic interaction occurred between the toxicants. This interaction tended to promote the functioning of a kinase largely associated with inflammation and to depress that of ERK, which is associated with maintenance of cell survival. It is concluded that exposure to levels of Al with no evident toxicity can worsen the response to an acute challenge with MPTP. Al treatment alone was able to increase striatal 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels, suggesting an elevation of the rate of dopamine turnover in the striatum. However, no interaction in alteration of monoamine levels was found between Al and MPTP."}

This study investigates the role of the amyloid cascade and central neuronal function on the protective effects of echinacoside in amyloid β peptide 1-42 (Aβ 1-42)-treated SH-SY5Y cells and an Aβ 1-42-infused rat. Echinacoside inhibited Aβ 1-42 oligomerization in vitro and restored the cell viability that was reduced by Aβ 1-42 in SH-SY5Y cells. Intracisternal infusion with Aβ 1-42 by an osmotic pump caused cognitive deficits, an increase in amyloid deposition and acetylcholinesterase activities, and a decrease in the brain's levels of acetylcholine and dopamine. Echinacoside reduced the cognitive deficits and amyloid deposition, and it reversed the cortical cholinergic dysfunction that was caused by Aβ 1-42 in rats. Echinacoside further reversed the memory impairment in the Morris water maze task caused by scopolamine in mice. Therefore, we suggest that echinacoside ameliorated cognitive dysfunction that was caused by Aβ 1-42 by blocking amyloid deposition via inhibiting amyloid oligomerization and reversing the cortical cholinergic neuronal function via decreasing amyloid neurotoxicity."}

Male Swiss mice received an intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of CFA (50 µl/paw) or vehicle. Behavioural and inflammatory responses were measured at different time-points (1 to 4 weeks), and different pharmacological tools were tested. The brain levels of IL-1β and BDNF, or COX-2 expression were also determined. CFA elicited a time-dependent edema formation and mechanical allodynia, which was accompanied by a significant increase in the immobility time in the tail suspension (TST) or forced-swimming (FST) depression tests. Repeated administration of the antidepressants imipramine (10 mg/kg), fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) and bupropion (30 mg/kg) significantly reversed depression-like behaviour induced by CFA. Predictably, the anti-inflammatory drugs dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg), indomethacin (10 mg/kg) and celecoxib (30 mg/kg) markedly reduced CFA-induced edema. The oral treatment with the analgesic drugs dipyrone (30 and 300 mg/kg) or pregabalin (30 mg/kg) significantly reversed the mechanical allodyinia induced by CFA. Otherwise, either dipyrone or pregabalin (both 30 mg/kg) did not significantly affect the paw edema or the depressive-like behaviour induced by CFA, whereas the oral treatment with dipyrone (300 mg/kg) was able to reduce the immobility time in TST. Noteworthy, CFA-induced edema was reduced by bupropion (30 mg/kg), and depression behaviour was prevented by celecoxib (30 mg/kg). The co-treatment with bupropion and celecoxib (3 mg/kg each) significantly inhibited both inflammation and depression elicited by CFA. The same combined treatment reduced the brain levels of IL-1β, as well as COX-2 immunopositivity, whilst it failed to affect the reduction of BDNF levels. We provide novel evidence on the relationship between chronic inflammation and depression, suggesting that combination of antidepressant and anti-inflammatory agents bupropion and celecoxib might represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for depression."}

However, biochemical alterations associated with the interplay of cytosolic dopamine and increased α-synuclein are still unclear. Catecholaminergic SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells are a suitable model for investigating dopamine toxicity. In the present study, we report the proteomic pattern of SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing α-synuclein (1.6-fold induction) after dopamine exposure. Dopamine itself is able to upregulate α-synuclein expression. However, the effect is not observed in cells that already overexpress α-synuclein as a consequence of transfection. The proteomic analysis highlights significant changes in 23 proteins linked to specific cellular processes, such as cytoskeleton structure and regulation, mitochondrial function, energetic metabolism, protein synthesis, and neuronal plasticity. A bioinformatic network enrichment procedure generates a significant model encompassing all proteins and allows us to enrich functional categories associated with the combination of factors analyzed in the present study (i.e. dopamine together with α-synuclein). In particular, the model suggests a potential involvement of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway that is experimentally confirmed. Indeed, α-synuclein significantly reduces nuclear factor kappa B activation, which is completely quenched by dopamine treatment."}

In particular, coconut oil has received attention as having potentially having benefits in lessening the cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease. In a recent report, we showed that neuron survival in cultures co-treated with coconut oil and Aβ was rescued compared to cultures exposed only to Aβ. Here we investigated treatment with Aβ for 1, 6 or 24 h followed by addition of coconut oil for a further 24 h, or treatment with coconut oil for 24 h followed by Aβ exposure for various periods. Neuronal survival and several cellular parameters (cleaved caspase 3, synaptophysin labeling and ROS) were assessed. In addition, the influence of these treatments on relevant signaling pathways was investigated with Western blotting. In terms of the treatment timing, our data indicated that coconut oil rescues cells pre-exposed to Aβ for 1 or 6 h, but is less effective when the pre-exposure has been 24 h. However, pretreatment with coconut oil prior to Aβ exposure showed the best outcomes. Treatment with octanoic or lauric acid also provided protection against Aβ, but was not as effective as the complete oil. The coconut oil treatment reduced the number of cells with cleaved caspase and ROS labeling, as well as rescuing the loss of synaptophysin labeling observed with Aβ treatment. Treatment with coconut oil, as well as octanoic, decanoic and lauric acids, resulted in a modest increase in ketone bodies compared to controls. The biochemical data suggest that Akt and ERK activation may contribute to the survival promoting influence of coconut oil. This was supported by observations that a PI3-Kinase inhibitor blocked the rescue effect of CoOil on Aβ amyloid toxicity. Further studies into the mechanisms of action of coconut oil and its constituent medium chain fatty acids are warranted."}

Intracranial hemorrhage was induced by the injection of 100 or 200 microl of blood into the subdural space (SDH) or into the caudate nucleus (ICH) of the rat. CBF was measured using [14C]-iodoantipyrine autoradiography at 4 h. Brain damage was measured using 2,3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 24 h and brain edema was measured using the wet/dry weight method. Brain ion contents were measured at 24 h using a flame photometer and chloridometer. In the CBF studies, the volume of tissue perfused below the ischemic threshold (<20 ml/100 g/min) for SDH was 122+/-35 mm3 (sham: 3.3+/-1.7 mm3). Following ICH, there was a small volume of tissue perfused below the ischemic threshold 50+/-11 mm3 (sham: 3. 3+/-2.5 mm3) but this volume corresponded closely to the volume of clot (71+/-5 mm3). The extent of brain damage, measured by TTC staining, in the cerebral cortex correlated with the increasing volume of the subdural blood clot (sham: 9+/-3 mm3; 200 microl: 81+/-19 mm3; P<0.01). Conversely, minimal brain damage was detected following ICH. The injection of blood into the subdural space or into the brain parenchyma induced blood volume-dependent increases in brain water content at 24 h. Increases in brain water content after SDH, were confined to the cerebral cortex (sham: 0.1+/-0.1 g/g dry weight; 200 microl: 0.8+/-0.3 g/g dry weight; P<0.001).

Furthermore, we found no structural alterations in any organ, including all central and peripheral neural tissues, of BACE1 KO mice up to 14 months of age. Aged BACE1 KO mice engineered to overexpress human APP (BACE1 KO/APPtg) did not develop amyloid plaques.

However, the relative contribution of neural influences that are activity-dependent and -independent in modulating these characteristics is unclear. Comparisons of denervation (no neural influence) and spinal cord isolation (SI, neural influence with minimal activity) after 3, 14, and 28 days of treatment were used to demonstrate whether there are neural influences on muscle that are activity independent. Furthermore, the effects of these manipulations were compared for a fast ankle extensor (medial gastrocnemius) and a fast ankle flexor (tibialis anterior). The mass of both muscles plateaued at approximately 60% of control 2 wk after SI, whereas both muscles progressively atrophied to <25% of initial mass at this same time point after denervation. A rapid increase in myogenin and, to a lesser extent, MyoD mRNAs and proteins was observed in denervated and SI muscles: at the later time points, these myogenic regulatory factors remained elevated in denervated, but not in SI, muscles. This widespread neural activity-independent influence on MyoD and myogenin expression was observed in myonuclei and satellite cells and was not specific for fast or slow fiber phenotypes. Mitotic activity of satellite and connective tissue cells also was consistently lower in SI than in denervated muscles. These results demonstrate a neural effect independent of electrical activity that 1) helps preserve muscle mass, 2) regulates muscle-specific genes, and 3) potentially spares the satellite cell pool in inactive muscles."}

Mitochondrial alterations, oxidative stress and inflammation underpin NCD and are molecular mechanisms playing major roles in the disease onset and natural history. Interrelations between the mechanisms of oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolism are, in the broadest sense of energy transformations, being increasingly recognized as part of the problem in NCD. Whether or not oxidative stress and inflammation are the causes or the consequences of cellular disturbances, they do significantly contribute to NCD. Paraoxonases are associated with mitochondria and mitochondria-associated membranes. They modulate mitochondria-dependent superoxide production, and prevent apoptosis. Their overexpression protects mitochondria from endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction; highlighting that the anti-inflammatory effects of paraoxonases may be mediated, at least in part, by their protective role in mitochondria and associated organelle function.

Therefore, it is not known whether effects of drug exposure on growth and metabolism begin early in the preimplantation embryo, or whether IUGR is exclusively a postimplantation phenomenon. The present study investigates whether caffeine, a drug known to induce a dose-dependent fetal IUGR, affects embryo development before and/or after implantation or is exclusively a fetal phenomenon. Preimplantation embryo assessment (with treatment from Days 2 to 4 of pregnancy) included glucose utilization, cell number evaluation and stage of development (morula to hatched blastocyst); whereas, postimplantation embryo assessment (treatment from Days 2 to 10, 10.5 or 11 of pregnancy) included somite number evaluation and extent of neural tube closure, as seen using scanning electron microscopy. Comparing control preimplantation embryos with those exposed to 30 and 60 mg kg(-1) caffeine did not reveal any effects of caffeine exposure, as assessed on Day 5 of gestation. However, postimplantation embryo development assessed on Day 12 of gestation revealed that caffeine exposure of 15 and 30 mg kg(-1) significantly reduced, at both dosage levels, somite number and the extent of neural tube closure. In addition, comparisons of control and experimental groups revealed that in the high-dose caffeine group the forebrain cavity was significantly enlarged and bounded by a reduced, irregularly aligned neuroepithelium.

Protein is also degraded during adaptive muscle remodeling upon exercise, but extreme degradation in diverse clinical conditions can compromise function(s) and threaten life. Here, we show how two independent signals interact to control protein degradation. In striated muscles of Caenorhabditis elegans, reduction of insulin-like signaling via DAF-2 insulin/IGF receptor or its intramuscular effector PtdIns-3-kinase (PI3K) causes unexpected activation of MAP kinase (MAPK), consequent activation of pre-existing systems for protein degradation, and progressive impairment of mobility. Degradation is prevented by mutations that increase signal downstream of PI3K or by disruption of autocrine signal from fibroblast growth factor (FGF) via the FGF receptor and its effectors in the Ras-MAPK pathway. Thus, the activity of constitutive protein degradation systems in normal muscle is minimized by a balance between directly interacting signaling pathways, implying that physiological, pathological, or therapeutic alteration of this balance may contribute to muscle remodeling or wasting."}

In the present study, we analysed the effect of Dp71eΔ71 overexpression on neuronal differentiation of PC12 Tet-On cells. Overexpression of dystrophin Dp71eΔ71 stimulates neuronal differentiation, increasing the percentage of cells with neurites and neurite length. According to 2-DE analysis, Dp71eΔ71 overexpression modified the protein expression profile of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 Tet-On cells that had been treated with neuronal growth factor (NGF) for nine days. Interestingly, all differentially expressed proteins were up-regulated compared to the control.

To assess the involvement of excitatory drive onto inhibitory interneurons in this epileptiform activity, we examined changes in spontaneous and minimally evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs and eEPSCs) in CA1 interneurons in stratum oriens/alveus (O/A) and stratum radiatum (RAD) in rat hippocampal slices after KA treatment. The frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs and the amplitude of eEPSCs were unchanged in O/A interneurons, but the EPSC kinetics were significantly slower. These changes appear to be due to altered kinetics and voltage-dependent properties of the NMDA component of EPSCs in O/A interneurons. In contrast, sEPSCs and eEPSCs in RAD interneurons did not change after KA treatment. The distinct changes in excitatory synaptic activity in interneurons differentially involved in feedback (O/A) versus feedforward (RAD) inhibition suggest a cell type-specific reorganization of excitatory synapses after KA treatment. These modifications in excitatory input to interneurons could contribute to the maintenance of inhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells after KA treatment, or may also create network conditions favourable to epileptiform activity."}

Glioblastoma biopsy spheroids were also implanted into nude rats to assess the regional distribution of the molecules within the tumour. These xenografts showed extensive infiltration and growth that mimicked the growth patterns of human gliomas in situ. NG2 was identified in 20 out of 28 brain tumours, where the expression was confined to the main mass of the tumour, and was reduced towards the tumour periphery. NG2 was mainly associated with blood vessels on both the pericyte and basement membrane components of the tumour vasculature. Ki67 (MIB-1) labelling indicated that NG2 expression was associated with areas of high cellular proliferation. Conversely, all the tumours expressed GD3, which was present both in the tumour main mass and throughout the periphery. Thus, the expression of NG2 may be indicative of tumour progression and might be an amenable target for future therapeutic interventions."}

The present study investigated the role of abnormal gut microbiota in diabetes-induced CD and the potential underlying mechanisms. An intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin administered for 5 consecutive days was used for establishing a diabetic animal model. Hierarchical cluster analysis of Morris water maze (MWM) performance indices (escape latency and target quadrant crossing) was adopted to classify the diabetic model mice into CD and Non-CD phenotypes. Both β-diversity and relative abundance of several gut bacteria significantly differed between the CD and Non-CD groups. Further, fecal bacteria transplantation from Non-CD mice, but not from CD mice, into the gut of pseudo-germ-free mice significantly improved host MWM performance, an effect associated with alterations in β-diversity and relative abundance of host gut bacteria. Collectively, these findings suggest that abnormal gut microbiota composition contributes to the onset of diabetes-induced CD and that improving gut microbiota composition is a potential therapeutic strategy for diabetes and related comorbidities."}

Provided diagnosis is made at an early stage, treatments are available to prevent visual impairment. A locus, GLC1A, has been mapped on chromosome 1q23-q25 in several families affected with juvenile-onset POAG (JOAG) and also in some families affected with juvenile and middle-age onset POAG.

We now describe five new mutations in eight French families. All mutations known to date appear to concentrate in the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal domain of TIGR which bears homology to frog olfactomedin, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein of the olfactory epithelium, to rat and human neuronal olfactomedin-related proteins and to F11C3.2, a protein from Caenorhabditis elegans .

In an attempt to elucidate both the role of NO and sex differences in sensitivity to seizures, male and female Wistar rats were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) by pentylentetrazol (PTZ)(80 mg/kg) and by a nitric oxide synthase(NOS) inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine-mthylester(L-NAME)(50mg/kg) and a NO precursor sodium-nitroprusside(SNP)(2.5mg/kg)- applied 15 min. before PTZ injection. Latency, frequency, severity, and duration of generalized clonic and clonic-tonic convulsions were recorded. Furthermore, alterations in severity, latency, frequency, and duration of convulsions were observed to correlate with NO. Both sexes, injected with PTZ, showed repetitive seizure patterns. Seizures were found to be more severe in females. L-NAME and SNP pretreatment produced paradoxical effects on PTZ-induced seizures in both sexes. L-NAME completely prevented PTZ-induced seizures in male rats, whereas increased severity, frequency, duration, and significantly shortened the latency in female rats. Unexpectedly, SNP increased convulsion severity, frequency, duration, and shortened latencies in male, whereas it decreased convulsion severity, frequency, and duration and prolonged latency in females.

Significant immunoreactivities with anti-neuregulin, anti-ErbB2, and anti-ErbB3 antibodies were detected on astrocytes at the injured site 4 d after injury to the adult rat cerebral cortex. To elucidate the mechanisms for the upregulation of neuregulin expression in astrocytes, primary cultured astrocytes were treated with certain reagents, including forskolin, that are known to elevate the intracellular level of cAMP and induce marked morphological changes in astrocytes. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of a 52 kDa membrane-spanning form of a neuregulin protein was enhanced in cultured astrocytes after administration of forskolin. The upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein was also observed in astrocytes treated with forskolin. In contrast, inactivation of protein kinase C because of chronic treatment with phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate downregulated the expression of the 52 kDa isoform, although other splice variants with apparent molecular sizes of 65 and 60 kDa were upregulated. These results suggest that the enhancement of neuregulin expression at injured sites is induced, at least in part, by elevation in intracellular cAMP levels and/or a protein kinase C signaling pathway. The neuregulin expressed on reactive astrocytes may stimulate their proliferation and support the survival of neurons surrounding cortical brain wounds in vivo."}

The neonatal mouse brain can be sensitized to excitotoxic damage by IL-1beta exposure similar to that observed in the human situation. Positive modulators of AMPA receptors have received increasing attention as potential neuroprotective agents in a number of neurodegenerative disorders of the adult. However whether they can also act as a neuroprotectant in neonatal brain damage has yet to be defined. Therefore the present study uses a well-defined rodent model of neonatal excitotoxic brain lesions to assess the neuroprotective effects of S18986, a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors, as well as its mechanisms of action. In this model, S18986 provided a dose-dependent and long-lasting protection of developing white matter and cortical grey matter against an excitotoxic insult and also when this was combined with a sensitizing inflammatory insult. Neuroprotective effects of S18986 in cortical grey matter involved decreased necrotic and apoptotic cell death. S18986-induced neuroprotection against NMDA receptor-mediated brain lesions was blocked by inhibitors of ERK and PI3 kinase-Akt pathways. S18986 effects were abolished by a neutralizing anti-BDNF antibody and real time PCR confirmed the stimulation by S18986 of BDNF production in the neonatal brain. The present study provides strong experimental support for the role of S18986 as a candidate molecule for therapy in cases of excitotoxic perinatal brain lesions and identifies BDNF as a key mediator of this S18986-mediated neuroprotection."}

The cerebellum receives two catecholaminergic pathways: the dopaminergic pathway arising from the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra pars compacta, and the noradrenergic one from the locus coeruleus. The aim of the present study was to examine a contribution of the cerebellar catecholaminergic innervations to the harmaline-induced tremor in rats. Rats were injected bilaterally into the cerebellar vermis with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 8 μg/0.5 μl) either alone or this treatment was preceded (30 min earlier) by desipramine (15 mg/kg ip). Harmaline was administered to animals in doses of 7.5 or 15 mg/kg ip. Tremor of forelimbs was measured as a number of episodes during a 90-min observation. Rats were killed by decapitation 30 or 120 min after harmaline treatment. The levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and their metabolites were measured by HPLC in the cerebellum, substantia nigra, caudate-putamen, and frontal cortex. 6-OHDA injected alone enhanced the harmaline-induced tremor. Furthermore, it decreased the noradrenaline level by ca. 40-80% in the cerebellum and increased the levels of serotonin and 5-HIAA in the caudate-putamen and frontal cortex in untreated and/or harmaline-treated animals. When 6-OHDA treatment was preceded by desipramine, it decreased dopaminergic transmission in some regions of the cerebellum while inducing its compensatory activation in others. The latter lesion did not markedly influence the tremor induced by harmaline. The present study indicates that noradrenergic innervation of the cerebellum interacts with cerebral serotonergic systems and plays an inhibitory role in the harmaline-induced tremor."}

We previously found that serotonergic lesions of the dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampus in rats result in enhanced phencyclidine-induced locomotor hyperactivity.	The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of serotonin depletion in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus on hyperlocomotion induced by ketamine, cocaine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethampethamine (MDMA), methamphetamine, and D: -amphetamine.	Male Sprague-Dawley rats were bilaterally microinjected with vehicle or the serotonergic neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), into the dorsal or ventral hippocampus using a stereotaxic approach. Separate cohorts of rats were used for each drug of abuse; each rat received saline and a low, medium, and high dose of the drug in a random-sequence, repeated-measures protocol. Locomotor hyperactivity following treatment was measured using automated photocell cages.	Similar to phencyclidine, 5,7-DHT-induced lesions of the dorsal hippocampus enhanced ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion at all doses. They also reduced methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion at the high dose only and caused a minor, biphasic modulation of responses to cocaine. Locomotor responses to D: -amphetamine and MDMA were unchanged by lesions of the dorsal hippocampus. Serotonergic lesions of the ventral hippocampus did not significantly alter locomotor hyperactivity induced by any of the drugs investigated.	These findings further implicate a role for serotonin in the dorsal hippocampus in modulating the behavioral effects of dissociative anesthetics, such as ketamine, with more subtle effects on psychostimulant drugs of abuse. The dorsal hippocampus may be a site of serotonergic dysfunction in aspects of schizophrenia."}

Idebenone displayed no in vitro affinity toward any population of serotonin receptors and did not modify their kinetic parameters after a single dose of 100 mg/kg, at any age tested. A subchronic treatment with the drug for 21 days at the dose of 30 mg/kg did not induce any relevant change in 3- and 15-month-old rats, whereas it significantly increased the density of both 3H-5HT and 3H-ketanserin binding sites in 24-month-old rats, where a lower number of receptors is detected as a consequence of aging. This effect was rather specific, since under the same experimental conditions no changes were detected in the density of cortical beta-adrenergic receptors in aged animals. In microdialysis studies, acute administration with idebenone did not affect 5HT and 5HIAA release at any age. Conversely, the pattern of serotonin metabolism was significantly modified in aged rats following repeated treatment with idebenone and was partially restored to a value similar to the one observed in young animals. These results suggest that idebenone, a putative neuroprotective agent which has been shown to improve brain metabolism in ischemic conditions, might also attenuate age-associated neuronal damage, acting probably on several neurotransmitter systems which undergo selective modification during aging."}

Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are dependent upon trophic support by nerve growth factor (NGF) through its neurotrophin receptor, TrkA. In the present study, we investigated whether the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors donepezil and galantamine could influence neurotrophin receptor signaling in the brain. Acute administration of donepezil (3 mg/kg, i.p.) led to the rapid autophosphorylation of TrkA and TrkB neurotrophin receptors in the adult mouse hippocampus. Similarly, galantamine dose-dependently (3, 9 mg/kg, i.p.) increased TrkA and TrkB phosphorylation in the mouse hippocampus. Both treatments also increased the phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB and tended to increase the phosphorylation of AKT kinase but did not alter the activity of MAPK42/44. Chronic treatment with galantamine (3 mg/kg, i.p., 14 days), did not induce changes in hippocampal NGF and BDNF synthesis or protein levels.

We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model.	Thirty-five Wistar rats were given 1.5 mg/kg DOX, i.v., weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg/kg BW. Ten rats received saline as a control group. cTnI was measured with Access(R) (ng/ml) and a research immunoassay (pg/ml), and compared with cTnT, CK-MB mass and CK. By using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, LV diameters and LV fractional shortening (FS) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats. Histology was performed in DOX-rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls.	Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9-week period. End-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) LV diameters/BW significantly increased, whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group (p<0.001). These parameters remained unchanged in controls. Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. In 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found. Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis. A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7.5 and 12 mg/kg in comparison with baseline (p<0.05). cTnT found in rats after 12 mg/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.5 mg/kg DOX. Maximal cTnI (pg/ml) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls (p=0.006, 0.007). cTnI (ng/ml), CK-MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls. All markers remained stable in controls. Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters/BW (r=0.81 and 0.65; p<0.0001). A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between LV diameters/BW and histological findings.	Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments."}

We report herein that astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) collected from astrocytes of R6/2 mice (a mouse model of HD) caused primary cortical neurons to grow less-mature neurites, migrate more slowly, and exhibit lower calcium influx after depolarization than those maintained in wild-type (WT) ACM. Using a cytokine antibody array and ELISA assays, we demonstrated that the amount of a chemokine [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5)/regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)] released by R6/2 astrocytes was much less than that by WT astrocytes. When cortical neurons were treated with the indicated ACM, supplementation with recombinant CCL5/RANTES ameliorated the neuronal deficiency caused by HD-ACM, whereas removing CCL5/RANTES from WT-ACM using an anti-CCL5/RANTES antibody mimicked the effects evoked by HD-ACM. Quantitative PCR and promoter analyses demonstrated that mHtt hindered the activation of the CCL5/RANTES promoter by reducing the availability of nuclear factor kappaB-p65 and, hence, reduced the transcript level of CCL5/RANTES. Moreover, ELISA assays and immunocytochemical staining revealed that mHtt retained the residual CCL5/RANTES inside R6/2 astrocytes. In line with the above findings, elevated cytosolic CCL5/RANTES levels were also observed in the brains of two mouse models of HD [R6/2 and Hdh((CAG)150)] and human HD patients. These findings suggest that mHtt hinders one major trophic function of astrocytes which might contribute to the neuronal dysfunction of HD."}

A direct historical comparison to assess what has changed in two decades.^\nIn 1994, Hussain and Redmond revealed that up to 39% of prehospital deaths from accidental injury might have been preventable had basic first aid care been given. Since then there have been significant advances in trauma systems and care. The exclusion of prehospital deaths from the analysis of trauma registries, giv en the high rate of those, is a major limitation in prehospital research on preventable death. We have repeated the 1994 study to identify any changes over the years and potential developments to improve patient outcomes.	We examined the full Coroner's inquest files for prehospital deaths from trauma and accidental injury over a three-year period in Cheshire. Injuries were scored using the Abbreviated-Injury-Scale (AIS-1990) and Injury Severity Score (ISS), and probability of survival estimated using Bull's probits to match the original protocol.	One hundred and thirty-four deaths met our inclusion criteria; 79% were male, average age at death was 53.6 years. Sixty-two were found dead (FD), fifty-eight died at scene (DAS) and fourteen were dead on arrival at hospital (DOA). The predominant mechanism of injury was fall (39%). The median ISS was 29 with 58 deaths (43%) having probability of survival of >50%. Post-mortem evidence of head injury was present in 102 (76%) deaths. A bystander was on scene or present immediately after injury in 45% of cases and prior to the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in 96%. In 93% of cases a bystander made the call for assistance, in those DAS or DOA, bystander intervention of any kind was 43%.	The number of potentially preventable prehospital deaths remains high and unchanged. First aid intervention of any kind is infrequent. There is a potentially missed window of opportunity for bystander intervention prior to the arrival of the ambulance service, with simple first-aid manoeuvres to open the airway, preventing hypoxic brain injury and cardiac arrest."}

Considering that oxidative stress is central to excitotoxic damage, in this study we sought to analyze if the transcription factor Nrf2, guardian of redox homeostasis, might be targeted to prevent kainate-induced neuron death. Hippocampal slices from Nrf2 knockout mice exhibited increased oxidative stress and cell death compared to those of control mice in response to kainate, as determined with the redox sensitive probes 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFAC) and propidium iodide and lactate dehydrogenase release, respectively, therefore demonstrating a role of Nrf2 in antioxidant protection against excitotoxicity. In the hippocampus of mice intraperitoneally injected with kainate we observed a rapid activation of Akt, inhibition of GSK-3beta and translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus, but after 4 h Akt was inactive, GSK-3beta was active and Nrf2 was mostly cytosolic, therefore extending our previous studies which indicate that GSK-3beta excludes Nrf2 from the nucleus. Lithium, a GSK-3beta inhibitor, promoted Nrf2 transcriptional activity towards an Antioxidant-Response-Element (ARE) luciferase reporter and cooperated with sulforaphane (SFN) to induce this reporter and to increase the protein levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), coded by a representative ARE-containing gene. Conversely, ARE activation by SFN was attenuated by over-expression of active GSK-3beta. Finally, combined treatment with SFN and lithium attenuated oxidative stress and cell death in kainate-treated hippocampal slices of wild type mice but not Nrf2 null littermates. Our findings identify the axis GSK-3beta/Nrf2 as a pharmacological target in prevention of excitotoxic neuronal death."}

The lack of therapeutic approaches for TSE is partially due to the limited amount of information available on the involvement of host biological compartments and processes in the propagation of the infectious agent. The in vivo model presented here can provide information on the spread of the scrapie agent via the peripheral nerves of hamsters under normal and altered axonal conditions. Syrian hamsters were unilaterally footpad (f.p.) infected with scrapie. The results of the spatiotemporal ultrasensitive immunoblot-detection of scrapie-associated prion protein (PrP(Sc)) in serial nerve segments of both distal sciatic nerves could be interpreted as a centripetal and subsequent centrifugal neural spread of PrP(Sc) for this route of infection. In order to determine whether this propagation is dependent on main components in the axonal cytoskeleton (e.g. neurofilaments, also relevant for the component ;a' of slow axonal transport mechanisms), hamsters were treated -in an additional experiment- with the neurotoxin beta,beta-iminodiproprionitrile (IDPN) around the beginning of the scrapie infection. A comparison of the Western blot signals of PrP(Sc) in the ipsilateral and in the subsequently affected contralateral sciatic nerve segments with the results revealed from IDPN-untreated animals at preclinical and clinical stages of the TSE disease, indicated similar amounts of PrP(Sc). Furthermore, the mean survival time was unchanged in both groups. This in vivo model, therefore, suggests that the propagation of PrP(Sc) along peripheral nerves is not dependent on an intact neurofilament component of the axonal cytoskeleton. Additionally, the model indicates that the spread of PrP(Sc) is not mediated by the slow component ;a' of the axonal transport mechanism."}

ISRE and GAS motifs are present in a variety of interferon (IFN)-inducible genes. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether IFN-gamma affects mimecan gene expression and, if so, to determine the cis-elements and transcription factors that mediate its action.	Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to investigate whether nuclear proteins from IFN-gamma-treated cells bind to regions of the human mimecan promoter containing ISRE sites. Incubation of nuclear extracts with specific antibodies was used to identify transcription factors that bind to these sites. Transcriptional activity of the promoter was evaluated by transient transfections of human mimecan promoter/luciferase reporter constructs into corneal keratocytes and non-corneal cells. Co-transfection experiments were used to study the role of transcription factors that bind ISRE elements in the promoter and mediate the IFN-gamma response. Expression of mRNAs was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.	Using probes that correspond to two ISRE sites located in the first intron of the human mimecan gene, we detected specific DNA-protein complexes with nuclear extracts from IFN-gamma-treated cells. Formation of DNA-protein complexes was abrogated by competition with unlabeled probe and one of the complexes was supershifted by the anti-interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) antibody. Interestingly, when probe that corresponds to a conserved E-box (CACATG) in the proximal promoter and nuclear extracts from IFN-gamma-treated cells were used in EMSA, increased binding of upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1) was observed. Co-transfection of a mimecan promoter construct that contained the entire first intron with IRF-1, or with both IRF-1 and USF-1 expression plasmids, suppressed luciferase activity of the promoter in corneal keratocytes and T-47D cells. In contrast, co-transfection experiments with IRF-2, or with both IRF-2 and USF-1, led to increased luciferase activity of the same promoter construct. RT-PCR analyses demonstrate that IFN-gamma rapidly and transiently suppresses mimecan expression and induces IRF-1 and IRF-2 mRNAs in bovine corneal keratocytes.	IRF-1 binds to ISRE sites, located in the first intron of the human mimecan gene, and negatively regulates mimecan expression at the level of transcription. Consistent with these observations, an inverse correlation between the expression of mimecan and IRF-1 in bovine corneal keratocytes and non-corneal cells was demonstrated. IRF-2 positively regulates mimecan transcription in corneal keratocytes. Because the intact E-box in the proximal promoter was required for IRF-1 and IRF-2 effects on mimecan transcription, potential direct or indirect interactions between USF-1 and IRF-1 and IRF-2 are likely."}

The aim of this study was to reveal the pharmacogenomic mechanism of this synergistic effect of jasminoidin and ursodeoxycholic acid.	One hundred and fifteen mice with brain damage, induced by focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, were divided into 5 groups: jasminoidin-treated, ursodeoxycholic acid-treated, combination-treated, vehicle group, and sham-operated group. Comparative analysis of stroke-related gene expression profiles and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways among the 3 treatment groups were performed to reveal the mechanism of this synergistic effect.	This study demonstrated that (1) treatment with jasminoidin alone caused similar changes in the pattern of gene expression as those treated with the combination; (2) jasminoidin treatment and the combination treatment had more overlapping changes in gene expression and activated pathways than the ursodeoxycholic acid treatment; (3) Hspa1a and Ppm1e were only up-regulated in the combination-treated group; (4) the nonoverlapping genes Fgf12, Rarα, Map3k4, paxillin (PXN) in the combination-treated group were markedly expressed, and P53 pathway was obviously activated in the combination-treated group.	These findings may suggest that jasminoidin is the major component of the combination, and the combination plays an important role of the synergistic effect in up-regulating expression of gene Hspa1a, genes Fgf12, Rarα, Map3k4 and down-regulating gene PXN, as well as activating P53 pathway."}

We first time report that inhibition of COX-2 promotes 1-methyl-4-phenyl 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neuronal cell death via induction of autophagic mechanisms. We found that treatment with MPTP induced cell death of neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y in a dose dependent manner. Treatment of MPTP has also upregulated the expressions of autophagic proteins such as LC3, beclin, ATG-5, and p62. Interestingly, nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, further potentiated the MPTP-induced cell death of human neuroblastoma cells. Treatment of nimesulide with MPTP further potentiated expressions of p62, ATG-5, beclin-1, LC3 autophagic proteins. Furthermore, nimesulide with MPTP increased apoptotic protein cleaved caspase-3 and also induced expression of p53 gene. Interestingly, it was observed that Akt inhibitor significantly increased MPTP-induced cell death of neuroblastoma cells. However, (-) deprenyl, a monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) inhibitor, attenuated MPTP-induced autophagic response and protected cell death. The prior treatment with prostaglandin E2 protected against nimesulide induced-death of neuronal cells. This study confirms that neuroinflammation is associated to the autophagy and may be one of the main pathological mechanisms in Parkinson's disease and other inflammation-associated disorders."}

Clinically used drugs inhibit IH but delay re-endothelialization and also cause constrictive remodeling. Here we have examined halofuginone, an herbal derivative, for its beneficial effects on vessel remodeling and differential inhibition of IH versus re-endothelialization.	Two weeks after perivascular application to balloon-injured rat common carotid arteries, halofuginone versus vehicle (n=6 animals) enlarged luminal area 2.14-fold by increasing vessel size (adaptive remodeling; 123%), reducing IH (74.3%) without inhibiting re-endothelialization. Consistent with its positive effect on vessel expansion, halofuginone reduced collagen type 1 (but not type 3) production in injured arteries as well as that from adventitial fibroblasts in vitro. In support of its differential effects on IH versus re-endothelialization, halofuginone produced greater inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell versus endothelial cell proliferation at concentrations ≈50 nmol/L. Furthermore, halofuginone at 50 nmol/L effectively blocked Smad3 phosphorylation in smooth muscle cells, which is known to promote smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration, and IH, but halofuginone had no effect on phospho-Smad3 in endothelial cells.	Periadventitial delivery of halofuginone dramatically increased lumen patency via adaptive remodeling and selective inhibition of IH without affecting endothelium recovery.

To define the role of mGluR1 in actions of psychostimulant, we compared both motor behavior and striatal neuropeptide mRNA expression between mGluR1 mutant and wild-type control mice after a single injection of amphetamine. We found that acute amphetamine injection increased motor activity in both mutant and control mice in a dose-dependent manner (1, 4, and 12 mg/kg, i.p.). However, the overall motor responses of mGluR1 -/- mice to all three doses of amphetamine were significantly greater than those of wild-type +/+ mice. Amphetamine also induced a dose-dependent elevation of preprodynorphin mRNA in the dorsal and ventral striatum of mutant and wild-type mice as revealed by quantitative in situ hybridization. In contrast to behavioral responses, the induction of dynorphin mRNA in both the dorsal and ventral striatum of mutant mice was significantly less than that of wild-type mice in response to the two higher doses of amphetamine. In addition, amphetamine elevated basal levels of substance P mRNA in the dorsal and ventral striatum of mGluR1 mutant mice to a similar level as that of wild-type mice. There were no differences in basal levels and distribution patterns of the two mRNAs between the two genotypes of mice treated with saline. These results demonstrate a clear augmented behavioral response of mGluR1 knockout mice to acute amphetamine exposure that is closely correlated with reduced dynorphin mRNA induction in the same mice. It appears that an intact mGluR1 is specifically critical for full dynorphin induction, and impaired mobilization of inhibitory dynorphin system as a result of lacking mGluR1 may contribute to an augmentation of motor stimulation in response to acute administration of psychostimulant."}

We have previously shown that placing NGF in the bath after an initial puff of capsaicin can completely overcome the tachyphylaxis normally observed in response to a second puff 10 min later, and this response is often substantially larger than the first. If tachyphylaxis is abolished by carrying out the experiment in Ca2+-free solution, NGF still elicits potentiation of the second puff. However, the amount of potentiation is considerably less than that observed when tachyphylaxis also takes place. Thus it is concluded that NGF has two effects: overcoming tachyphylaxis and potentiation. With three puffs of capsaicin separated by 10 min, we have found that the potentiation established after 10 min exposure to NGF is no longer evident 10 min after removal of NGF. In Ca2+-free solution the potentiation can last up to 1 h after removal of NGF. These results suggest that the initial behavioral sensitization elicited by NGF could result from a direct effect on the sensory neuron but that its later components most likely involve other mechanisms. We have also investigated the contribution of various second-messenger pathways in these actions of NGF by treating the cells with blockers of MAP kinase (PD98059), protein kinase A (PKA; PKAI14-22, H89), and PKC (Bisindolylmaleimide I). Surprisingly, PD98059, which previously has been shown to diminish the enhancement of capsaicin responses of dissociated neurons when exposed to NGF for several days, had no effect on the acute response to NGF; nor did the PKC inhibitor. However, PKA inhibitors reduced the capsaicin response of the cells to NGF (as determined from the NGF effect on tachyphylaxis). Consistent with these findings we confirmed that forskolin, a PKA activator, enhances the effect of NGF on the capsaicin response. The percentage of small cells sensitized by NGF under these conditions, as determined by its ability to reduce tachyphylaxis, was 64%.

Thus, rodent models would benefit from a simple and reliable method to measure ICP in awake, mobile animals. Up to now most techniques have been limited to anesthetized or immobile animals, which is not practical for following the prolonged elevations in ICP that follow stroke and traumatic brain injury. With an initial set of data, we describe a simple method that uses blood pressure telemetry sensors, which are commercially available (Data Sciences Int.) to measure ICP in freely moving rats for several days following implantation. Basically, an epidural cannula is secured to the skull and connected to the catheter of the telemetry probe, which is then secured inside a protective plastic shield on the skull. We confirm the sensitivity of our measurements by experimentally modifying ICP by either the Valsalva maneuver (abdominal compression) or a large ischemic brain injury. The Valsalva maneuver caused a small brief spike in ICP (lasting about 2-3 sec), whereas a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion substantially increased ICP (up to 50 mmHg) for approximately 3 days post-surgery. In summary, the current method allows for ICP to be continuously monitored in rats for several days, and thus is suitable for studies investigating mechanisms of raised ICP and in testing experimental treatments that mitigate it."}

Cortical cooling in global transient ischemic models suggests that hypothermia limits glutamate excitotoxicity by decreasing the release of glutamate during ischemia. Few studies have examined glutamate release in the more physiological model of permanent focal ischemia. In this study, we used a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) of permanent focal ischemia. Extracellular glutamate concentration was analyzed bilaterally by microdialysis for 30 minutes before MCAO to 120 minutes after MCAO. Normothermic animals (n = 13) had a baseline glutamate concentration of 9.23 +/- 2.5 mumol/ml (mean +/- standard error of the mean) before MCAO. Extracellular glutamate rose quickly after vessel occlusion and peaked at 33.95 +/- 6.3 mumol/ml 30 minutes after MCAO. By 60 minutes after MCAO, this level had decreased to 25.14 +/- 6.3 mumol/ml; glutamate levels decreased slightly to 21.35 +/- 6.8 mumol/ml by 120 minutes. Hypothermic animals (n = 11) had an initial extracellular glutamate concentration of 5.22 +/- 1.3 mumol/ml before MCAO. This value rose gradually to a maximum of 10.69 +/- 3.3 microns/ml at 50 minutes after MCAO and then returned to a baseline value of 2.58 +/- 1.2 mumol/ml by 120 minutes. Contralateral control glutamate dialysates in the normothermic and hypothermic groups remained near baseline throughout the experimental period.

Aside from this, emotional deficits are known to be associated with PD. A key structure of emotional processing is the amygdala. Emotional deficits seen in PD might be due to alterations in the catecholaminergic innervation of this limbic structure. We therefore examined whether 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) applied to C57/BL6 mice (an animal model of PD) affects the density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive fibers in the amygdala as it does in the striatum. MPTP treatment caused a prominent reduction in dopamine levels (about -70%) in the striatum (determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection), accompanied by massive losses of TH-positive fibers in the striatum (-48.3%). Moreover, MPTP treatment caused prominent reductions of TH-positive fiber densities in the basolateral, lateral and central nucleus of the amygdala (about -20%). These results may provide the morphological basis for behavioral studies analyzing altered emotional responses in animal models of PD."}

Genome-wide studies highlighted that the majority of drug target genes are controlled by CTS. This suggests that chronotherapeutic approaches should be taken for many drugs to enhance their effectiveness. Currently chronotherapeutic approaches are successfully applied in the treatment of different types of cancers. The chronotherapy approach has improved the tolerability and antitumor efficacy of anticancer drugs both in experimental animals and in cancer patients. Thus, chronobiological studies have been of importance in determining the most appropriate time of administration of anticancer agents to minimize their side effects or toxicity and enhance treatment efficacy, so as to optimize the therapeutic ratio.

However, the mechanistic link connecting these events remains elusive. We observed that NAD[+] metabolism is altered in sporadic Parkinson's disease patient-derived cells, which contributes to Sirtuin-2 activation and subsequent decrease in acetylated-α-tubulin levels. Pharmacological inhibition of sirtuin-2 deacetylase activity selectively enhanced α-tubulin acetylation and facilitated the trafficking and clearance of misfolded proteins. Sirtuin-2 knock-out mice neurons had no alteration in microtubule assembly after exposure to MPP[+], allowing the maintenance of a normal autophagic flux. These data were validated using MPTP-treated sirtuin-2 knock-out mice, where no alterations in motor behavior were observed. Biochemical analysis of sporadic Parkinson's disease patient brains supports the in vitro and in vivo data. Our data provide strong evidence that sirtuin-2 controls the functional ability of the autophagic system through acetylation and highlight the association between mitochondrial metabolism and neurodegeneration in sporadic Parkinson's disease."}

In 1969, it was reported that lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), a single stranded positive sense mouse nidovirus, delays skin allograft rejection and inhibits spleen alterations in graft versus host disease (GVHD). As the underlying mechanisms have remained unresolved and given the need for new therapies of this disease, we reassessed the effects of the virus on GVHD and tried to uncover its mode of action.	GVHD was induced by transfer of parent (B6) spleen cells to non-infected or LDV-infected B6D2F1 recipients. In vitro mixed-lymhocyte culture (MLC) reactions were used to test the effects of the virus on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and responder T cells.	LDV infection resulted in a threefold increase in survival rate with reduced weight loss and liver inflammation but with the establishment of permanent chimerism that correlated with decreased interleukine (IL)-27 and interferon (IFN)γ plasma levels. Infected mice showed a transient elimination of splenic CD11b+ and CD8α+ conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) required for allogeneic CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in vitro. This drop of APC numbers was not observed with APCs derived from toll-like receptor (TLR)7-deficient mice. A second effect of the virus was a decreased T cell proliferation and IFNγ production during MLC without detectable changes in Foxp3+ regulatory T cell (Tregs) numbers. Both cDC and responder T cell inhibition were type I IFN dependent. Although the suppressive effects were very transient, the GVHD inhibition was long-lasting.	A type I IFN-dependent suppression of DC and T cells just after donor spleen cell transplantation induces permanent chimerism and donor cell implantation in a parent to F1 spleen cell transplantation model. If this procedure can be extended to full allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, it could open new therapeutic perspectives for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)."}

However, the specific mechanism of regulating intestinal peristalsis has not been found. This study aimed to discover TWA's therapeutic mechanism for regulating intestinal motility. The intestinal propulsion rate of diabetic rats was significantly increased after treatment with TWA for 8 weeks. Aiming at the mechanical structure, biomechanical testing indicated that TWA can significantly decrease the no-load intestinal wall thickness, cross-sectional area, and angular spread in a zero-stress state. Notably, intestinal stress-strain curve shifted to the right, which indicated TWA can inhibit intestinal hyperplasia and hardening and improve biomechanical remodeling. Further study of the mechanism revealed that TWA significantly inhibited the expression of AGE in the villi, crypt, and muscle and RAGE in crypt and upregulated the expression of nerve regulator (PSD95, C-kit and SCF). Radioimmunoassay showed TWA treatment decreased levels of serum somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Moreover, associations were found between the intestinal propulsion rate with the morphologic and biomechanical remodeling parameters, changes of nerve factors, and endocrine hormones. Morphologic and biomechanical remodeling of the intestinal wall are the pathologic basis of gastrointestinal dysfunction. TWA can benefit intestinal motility by improving biomechanical and morphologic remodeling and by regulating expression of neuroendocrine factors. The results showed that the effect of TWA was dose-dependent, the higher the dose, the greater is the improvement. Thus, traditional Chinese medicine might be a valuable tool for treating diabetic gastrointestinal dysfunction."}

The effectiveness of this drug delivery system was assessed in a rat 9L gliosarcoma model. The GCV-pellets (1 mm in length and in diameter) used in this experiment contained a total amount of 0.15 mg of GCV. In vitro experiments demonstrated that GCV was gradually released over a period of 7 days. Five days after stereotactic tumor inoculation into the right caudate nucleus, a herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) vector expressing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) (T1, 2x10(6) pfu) was administered at the same location. The survival rate of the group treated with the GCV-pellet was compared with that of the T1 group injected intraperitoneally (IP) with GCV (30 mg/kg/day for 7 days). The GCV-pellet-treated group had a significantly prolonged survival (a median of more than 80 days) compared with the GCV IP group (a median of 65 days) and with control groups (P<0.05). The control groups (untreated or receiving only the virus vector) had a survival of 35-38 days. The survival rate of the GCV-pellet group over 80 days was 75%, and all the rats that survived more than 80 days and did not show tumors upon histological examination of the brain were deemed cured. No toxic effects or immunological reactions were observed histologically around the pellet in brain sections from the rats treated with the GCV-pellet. After GCV-pellet inoculation into the tumor, drug concentrations were kept at 1-10 microg/g tissue for 3-4 days. When the same dose of GCV (0.15 mg) in aqueous solution was injected into the tumor, GCV concentrations reached a peak of 0.5 mg/g tissue after 30 min and decreased below measurable level within 12 h. After IP injections of 3 mg GCV, GCV concentrations in the tumor reached a peak of 5.7 microg/g tissue after 30 min and also decreased below measurable level within 12 h. This sustained release of a low and effective GCV dose with the silicone formulation significantly prolonged survival in combinations with HSV-tk expression if compared to IP administration of GCV. Histological examination suggests that the treatment appears to be safe."}

Given this growth factor's neuroprotective ability, we sought to determine if PDGF-BB would be neuroprotective against amyloid-β (1-42), one of the pathological agents associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).	In both primary hippocampal neurons and the human-derived neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, amyloid-β treatment for 24 h decreased surviving cell number in a concentrationdependent manner. Pretreatment with PDGF-BB failed to provide any neuroprotection against amyloid-β in primary neurons and only very limited protective effects in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition to its neuroprotective action, PDGF promotes cell growth and division in several systems, and the application of PDGFBB alone to serum-starved SH-SY5Y cells resulted in an increase in cell number. Amyloid-β attenuated the mitogenic effects of PDGF-BB, inhibited PDGF-BB-induced PDGFβ receptor phosphorylation, and attenuated the ability of PDGF-BB to protect neurons against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity.

The in vitro paired cells were exposed to clinically relevant concentrations of the two SSRIs under chronic and acute experimental conditions, and the incidence of synapse formation and the efficacy of synaptic transmission were tested electrophysiologically and with fluorescent Ca(2+) imaging. We demonstrate that chronic exposure to fluoxetine, but not to citalopram, inhibits synapse formation and reduces synaptic strength, and that these effects are reversible following prolonged drug washout. At the structural level, we demonstrate that fluoxetine, but not citalopram, prevents the expression and localization of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin. Acute exposure to fluoxetine substantially reduced synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity (post-tetanic potentiation) in established synapses, whereas citalopram reduced synaptic transmission, but not short-term synaptic plasticity.

Dominant negative IGF-I receptors were expressed in CHO and U87 cells by retroviral infection. Cell proliferation, transformation and tumor formation in athymic nude mice were assessed.	Inhibition of IGF-IR signaling in a CHO cell model system by expression of a kinase-defective IGF-IR impairs proliferation, transformation and tumor growth. Reduction in tumor growth is associated with an increase in apoptosis in-vivo. The dominant-negative IGF-IRs also prevented growth of U87 PTEN-negative glioblastoma cells when injected into nude mice. Injection of an IGF-IR blocking antibody alphaIR3 into mice harboring parental U87 tumors inhibits tumor growth and increases apoptosis.	Inhibition of an upstream growth factor signal prevents tumor growth of the U87 PTEN-deficient glioma to the same extent as re-introduction of PTEN. This result suggests that growth factor receptor inhibition may be an effective alternative therapy for PTEN-deficient tumors."}

Lamotrigine (LTG), an antiepileptic drug with mood stabilizing properties, has documented immunomodulatory effects. However, its effect on cytokine secretion in vivo has not been examined. Besides, studies have reported inconsistent results of the in vitro effects of LTG on cytokine secretion. Hence, we used murine models of inflammation to characterize the in vivo and the in vitro effects of LTG on the secretion of the aforementioned cytokines, using ELISA. LTG significantly inhibited basal and mitogen-induced IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β secretion in vivo and in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells in vitro. In PMs, LTG inhibited basal and LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF-α secretion. Our findings extend the current understanding of the anti-inflammatory properties of LTG and may be relevant to its role in modulating the immune system in epilepsy and bipolar disorder."}

Here, we tested the hypothesis that previously observed histological and neurochemical changes in the striatum of amygdala-kindled rats as a model of temporal lobe epilepsy are reflected in alterations of spontaneous striatal firing rates and patterns. Because experimental histological and clinical imaging studies indicated a bilateral involvement of the striatum in epilepsy-induced neuroplasticity, in vivo single-unit recordings were done bilaterally 1 day after a kindled seizure in rats kindled via the right amygdala. Compared to control animals, we observed (1) an increased irregularity of firing of neurons classified as striatal projection neurons and located in the anterior striatum ipsilateral to the kindling side and (2) an increased spontaneous activity of neurons classified as striatal projection neurons and located in the anterior striatum contralateral to the kindling side. These hyperactive neurons were located within the dorsolateral (sensorimotor) subregion of the striatum. The present study represents the first evidence of kindling-induced bilateral changes in electrophysiological properties of striatal neurons and demonstrates that the striatum is strongly affected by the functional reorganization of neurocircuits associated with kindling. The changes are probably caused by a combination of several factors including disturbed bilateral limbic and neocortical input as well as disturbed intrastriatal GABAergic function. The changes reflect a pathophysiological state predisposing the brain to epileptic discharge propagation or else (contralateral striatum) could represent a compensatory network of inhibitory circuits activated to prevent the propagation of seizure activity. The findings are relevant for a better understanding of kindling-induced network changes and might provide new targets for therapeutic manipulations in epilepsies."}

These injuries are chiefly ascribable to marked susceptibility of the immature brain to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. No treatments are available. One well-characterized model of perinatal brain injuries consists in injecting the glutamate analog ibotenate into the brain of 5-day-old mice. The resulting excitotoxic lesions resemble the hypoxic-ischemic gray-matter lesions seen in full-term and near-term newborns, as well as the white-matter lesions of preterm newborns. We previously reported that these lesions disrupted odor preference conditioning in newborn mice. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the neuroprotector melatonin in preventing learning disabilities in newborn mice with ibotenate-induced brain injury. In postnatal day (P) 6-P7 pups, we tested psychomotor reflexes, spontaneous preference for maternal odors as an index of memory, ultrasonic vocalization responses to stroking as an index of sensitivity to tactile stimuli, and conditioned preference for an odor previously paired with stroking as an index of learning abilities. Without melatonin, conditioning was abolished, whereas spontaneous odor preference, psychomotor reflexes, and sensitivity to tactile stimuli were normal. Thus, abolition of conditioning was not associated with sensorimotor impairments. Histological analysis confirmed the efficacy of melatonin in reducing white-matter lesions induced by ibotenate. Furthermore, treatment with melatonin protected the ability to develop conditioning. Thus, melatonin, which easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been proven safe in children, may be effective in preventing learning disabilities caused by perinatal brain injuries in human preterm infants."}

One day later, muscles from both limbs were removed to study the severity of dystrophy (uncrushed muscle) and the regeneration response (crushed muscle). In uncrushed TA muscle, the area of active dystrophy (fiber damage and infiltration as a proportion of muscle cross-sectional area) was reduced by half after T3 treatment. Uncrushed muscle fiber diameter was lower in T3-treated control muscles. In crushed muscles, the diameter of new myotubes was larger in mdx mice than in controls and was reduced after T3 treatment in control regenerating muscle. In the same muscles, developmental myosin heavy chain was present in new myotubes and in small numbers of mononuclear cells (possibly differentiating myoblasts) near new myotubes and surviving fibers. Myotube density in the regenerating muscles was not changed by T3 treatment, although the number of myotube nuclei per field was decreased in control and increased in mdx T3-treated mice. Results extend previous reports of T3 effects on dystrophy and the strain difference in muscle precursor cell (mpc) proliferation. The results also suggest the hypothesis that excess T3 affects muscle regeneration either by reducing mpc proliferation or by increasing mpc fusion early in regeneration in control and mdx muscle."}

Since erythropoietin, a hematopoietic growth factor that corrects chemotherapy-induced anemia, reduces transfusion requirements and seems to improve the patient's quality of life, has been shown to exert cytoprotective effects we decided to investigate its direct influence on cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity against primary cortical neurons isolated from rats. We observed that pre-treatment of neurons with erythropoietin significantly protects these cells from cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. These effects correlated with amelioration of cisplatin-mediated activation of ERK1/2 kinases and decreased cleavage of caspase 3. Similarly to erythropoietin, a selective ERK1/2 inhibitor significantly reduced cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity against neuronal cells. Importantly, using the same experimental setting we did not observe any protection from cisplatin cytotoxicity against four established tumor cell lines.

We found that oh(8)dG reduces LPS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, STAT3 activation, and ICAM-1 expression. oh(8)dG also suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma. Overexpression of dominant negative STAT3 completely diminshed STAT3-mediated ICAM-1 transcriptional activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that oh(8)dG inhibited recruitment of STAT3 to the ICAM-1 promoter, followed by a decrease in ICAM-1 expression. Using mice lacking a functional Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), we demonstrated that, while TLR4+/+ microglia were activated by LPS, TLR4-/- microglia exhibited inactivated STAT3 in response to LPS. Evidently, LPS modulates STAT3-dependent ICAM-1 induction through TLR4-mdiated cellular responses. Oh(8)dG apparently plays a role in anti-inflammatory actions via suppression of ICAM-1 gene expression by blockade of the TLR4-STAT3 signal cascade in inflammation-enhanced brain microglia. Therefore, oh(8)dG in the cytosol probably functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule and should be considered as a candidate for development of anti-inflammatory agents."}

In previous studies we established a powerful antiepileptic action for a commonly used diuretic (furosemide). However, it remains unclear precisely how furosemide terminates abnormal electrical discharges. To address this issue, we performed in vitro experiments to examine conditions where furosemide exerts antiepileptic activity and patch-clamp studies to analyze the effect of furosemide on neuronal membrane properties, synaptic function and inward potassium current. Furosemide was not found to alter synaptic field responses, excitatory postsynaptic currents or intrinsic membrane properties of principal hippocampal neurons. Our in vitro studies indicate that furosemide does not abolish spontaneous epileptiform bursting during co-application of Ba2+ or Cs+ ions (to block inwardly rectifying potassium channels). Our patch-clamp data indicate that furosemide enhances the function of astrocytic, but not neuronal, inward potassium channels and that this modulation may be required for its antiepileptic activity. Although a variety of antiepileptic drugs are already available, none of these compounds selectively target astrocytes while preserving synaptic/neuronal function. Thus, furosemide-mediated modulation of inward potassium current (on astrocytes) represents a new target for control of abnormal electrical discharge in the CNS."}

Treatment with warfarin is recommended for the first 3 months after biological AVR. The use of antiplatelet therapy - mainly aspirin (ASA) - is suggested as an alternative treatment but its efficacy is still unsettled. Due to the increased risk of bleeding complications even no use of any antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy was advocated. Given this ongoing dispute, the aim of this retrospective double-institutional study was to evaluate the necessity of antiplatelet treatment by ASA with no postoperative antiplatelet therapy in terms of survival, major bleedings and cerebral thromboembolism of patients undergoing biological AVR without thromboembolic risk factors.	From January 2001 to December 2003, 288 consecutive patients (72.8+/-7.5 years, 134 males) with sinus rhythm and no other thromboembolic risk factors underwent single biological AVR with porcine or bovine pericardial valves without concurrent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. By surgeons preference, 100 mg ASA was given to 132 patients, and 156 patients received no antiplatelet therapy. Patients were followed for cerebral ischemic events, major bleedings, need for repeat operation, NYHA class and survival at three time intervals postoperatively (30 days, 3 and 12 months).	None of all patients died during the operation. Mortality within 30 days was 3.8% in the ASA and 3.9% in the no ASA group (p=0.777). There were no statistically significant differences for cerebral ischemia within 3 months after AVR (ASA 0.8% vs no ASA 1.3%: p=0.884) and 3 to 12 months after AVR (ASA 0.8% vs no ASA 0%; p=0.933). Major bleedings occurred in two ASA-treated patients and in one patient without antiplatelet therapy (p=0.884). The incidence of NYHA class III-IV after 3 months (1.5% vs 1.9%; p=0.850) and 12 months (9.0% vs 5.1%; p=0.278) were similar, as were the need for repeat operative AVR after 12 months (0.8% vs 0.6%; p=0.553). Survival rates at 12-month follow-up were 95.5% for ASA treatment and 94.9% for no ASA treatment (p=0.963).	In patients without thromboembolic risk factors undergoing biological AVR administration of ASA confers no advantage compared to no antiplatelet therapy. Functional status, thromboembolic events and survival were not adversely affected by withholding any antiplatelet therapy. Guidelines need to be reviewed for the antithrombotic therapy of patients without risk factors undergoing bioprosthetic AVR."}

Brain edema is the major contributor to morbidity with inflammation, necrosis, oxidative stress, and apoptosis likely playing smaller roles. Effective therapies for SBI may improve neurological outcomes and postoperative morbidities associated with brain surgery. Previous studies show an adrenergic correlation to blood-brain barrier control. The α-2 receptor agonist dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been shown to improve neurological outcomes in stroke models. We hypothesized that DEX may reduce brain edema and improve neurological outcomes in a rat model of SBI.	Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 63) weighing 280 to 350 g were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 IP treatment groups: sham IP, vehicle IP, DEX 10 mg/kg, and DEX 30 mg/kg. Treatments were given 30 min before SBI. These treatment groups were repeated to observe the physiologic impact of DEX on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and blood glucose on SBI naïve animals. Rats were also assigned to 4 postinjury IV treatment groups: sham IV, vehicle IV, DEX 10/5, and DEX 30/15 (DEX group doses were 10 and 30 mg/kg/hr, with 5 and 15 mg/kg initial loading doses, respectively). Initial loading doses began 20 min after SBI, followed by 2 h of infusion. SBI animals were subjected to neurological testing 24 h after brain injury by a blinded observer, promptly killed, and brain water content measured via the dry/wet weight method.	All treatment groups showed a significant difference in ipsilateral frontal brain water content and neurological scores when compared with sham animals. However, there was no difference between DEX-treated and vehicle animals. Physiologic monitoring showed treatment with low or high doses of DEX significantly decreased MAP and HR, and briefly increased blood glucose compared with naïve or vehicle-treated animals.	DEX administration did not reduce brain edema or improve neurological function after SBI in this study. The statistical difference in brain water content and neurological scores when comparing sham treatment to vehicle and DEX treatments shows consistent reproduction of this model. Significant changes in MAP, HR, and blood glucose after DEX as compared to vehicle and sham treatments suggest appropriate delivery of drug."}

Delay of axon degeneration has beneficial effects on various neurodegenerative diseases, but its effect on DPN is yet to be elucidated. Deficiency of Sarm1 significantly attenuates axon degeneration in several models, but the effect of Sarm1 deficiency on DPN is still unclear. In this study, we show that Sarm1 knockout mice exhibit normal glucose metabolism and pain sensitivity, and deletion of the Sarm1 gene alleviates hypoalgesia in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Moreover, Sarm1 gene deficiency attenuates intraepidermal nerve fiber loss in footpad skin; alleviates axon degeneration, the change of g-ratio in sciatic nerves, and NAD[+] decrease; and relieves axonal outgrowth retardation of dorsal root ganglia from diabetic mice. In addition, Sarm1 gene deficiency markedly diminishes the changes of gene expression profile induced by streptozotocin in the sciatic nerve, especially some abundant genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. These findings demonstrate that Sarm1 gene deficiency attenuates DPN in mice and suggest that slowing down axon degeneration is a potential promising strategy to combat DPN."}

This study investigates the effects of PP1 on vascular permeability and inflammatory response in a rat spinal cord compression model. Ten minutes after compression, PP1 (PP1 group) or the vehicle only (control group) was administered. On days 1, 3, and 7 after compression, the spinal cords were removed and examined histopathologically to determine the expression of VEGF and the extent of edema and inflammation. The dryweight method was used to measure the water content of the spinal cords. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFalpha) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), which is related to inflammatory responses, were measured with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system 6 h after compression. Although VEGF expression was similar in both groups, the extent of contusional lesion in the PP1 group was reduced by approximately 35% on day 3. Moreover, the water content on days 1, 3, and 7 was significantly reduced and macrophage infiltration on days 3 and 7 was dramatically reduced in the PP1 group. TNF and IL-1beta mRNA expression in the PP1 group were also significantly reduced. These results indicate that PP1 reduces secondary damage after spinal cord injury."}

Because astrocytes play a key role in metabolism and detoxification processes in brain, we have investigated the capacity of these cells to metabolize formaldehyde using primary astrocyte-rich cultures as a model system. Application of formaldehyde to these cultures resulted in the appearance of formate in cells and in a time-, concentration- and temperature-dependent disappearance of formaldehyde from the medium that was accompanied by a matching extracellular accumulation of formate. This formaldehyde-oxidizing capacity of astrocyte cultures is likely to be catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase 3 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, because the cells of the cultures contain the mRNAs of these formaldehyde-oxidizing enzymes. In addition, exposure to formaldehyde increased both glucose consumption and lactate production by the cells. Both the strong increase in the cellular formate content and the increase in glycolytic flux were only observed after application of formaldehyde to the cells, but not after treatment with exogenous methanol or formate. The accelerated lactate production was not additive to that obtained for azide, a known inhibitor of complex IV of the respiratory chain, and persisted after removal of formaldehyde after a formaldehyde exposure for 1.5 h.

However, it is likely that chronically elevated IOP produces progressive changes in the optic nerve head, the retina, or both that alter susceptibility of remaining optic nerve fibers to IOP. In order to understand the nature of these progressive changes, relevant, cost-effective animal models are necessary. Several rat models are now used to produce chronic, elevated IOP, and methods exist for measuring the resulting IOP and determining the extent of the damage this causes to the retina and optic nerve. A comparison of damage, pressure and duration shows that these models are not necessarily equivalent. These tools are beginning to uncover clear evidence that elevated IOP produces progressive changes in the optic nerve head and retina. In the optic nerve head, these include axonal and non-axonal effects, the latter pointing to involvement of extracellular matrix and astrocyte responses. In the retina, retinal ganglion cells appear to undergo changes in neurotrophin response as well as morphologic changes prior to actual cell death. These, and other, as yet uncovered, abnormalities in the optic nerve head and retina may influence relative susceptibility to IOP and explain progressive optic nerve damage and visual field loss, in spite of apparent, clinically adequate IOP control.

This was associated with a reduction in the Trichinella spiralis -associated T-helper 2 response and a reduction in transforming growth factor-beta1, cyclooxygenase-2, and prostaglandin E 2 levels in muscle. Attenuation of muscle hypercontractility by Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium was abolished after heat treatment. Improvement of muscle hypercontractility at day 28 after infection was also observed after the administration of Lactobacillus paracasei or Lactobacillus paracasei -free spent culture medium from day 18 after infection.	Probiotics show strain-dependent attenuation of muscle hypercontractility in an animal model of postinfective irritable bowel syndrome. This likely occurs via both a modulation of the immunologic response to infection and a direct effect of Lactobacillus paracasei or a heat-labile metabolite on postinfective muscle hypercontractility. Lactobacillus paracasei may be useful in the treatment of postinfective irritable bowel syndrome."}

Recently, it has been demonstrated that acupuncture treatment has protective effects in PD. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms underlying acupuncture's effect on DA neuronal protection are largely unknown. In this study, we report that p53 signalling mediates the protective effects of acupuncture treatment in a mouse model of PD. We found that the acupuncture treatment in the mouse PD model results in significant recovery to the normal in the context of behaviour and molecular signatures. We found that the gene network associated with p53 signalling is closely involved in the protective effects of acupuncture treatment in PD. Consistent with this idea, we demonstrated that specific knockout of the p53 gene in the midbrain DA neurons abrogates the acupuncture induced protective effects in the mouse model of PD. Thus, these data suggest that p53 signalling mediates the protective effects of acupuncture treatment in PD."}

Among the 110 disorders listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, two of the most prevalent and treatable have only recently begun to receive significant attention: sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome with sleep-related periodic limb movements disorder. It is becoming clear that the sleep disruption caused by such disorders has ramifications beyond the usually associated daytime sleepiness, and may include: exacerbation of seizures, headaches, short-term memory deficits, and other cognitive problems. Sleep apnea has also been correlated with hypertension and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease. Animal studies have taken this one step further by demonstrating that total sleep deprivation is consistently fatal, usually within 1 month, although the precise mechanism remains to be discovered. The most compelling finding in the animal studies is that 'rescuing' the animals with sleep, before the irreversible stage, is associated with rebound amounts of deep sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep ('dream sleep'). This same response is seen after initiating treatment of sleep apnea with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and can also occur in patients with other sleep disorders in response to particular medications, such as valproate or gabapentin."}

The structure and properties of the intermediary oligomers have been difficult to study due to their instability and dynamic equilibrium with smaller and larger species. In hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy, a cystatin C variant is deposited in arterial walls and cause brain hemorrhage in young adults. In the present investigation, we use redox experiments of monomeric cystatin C, stabilized against domain swapping by an intramolecular disulfide bond, to generate stable oligomers (dimers, trimers, tetramers, decamers, and high molecular weight oligomers). These oligomers were characterized concerning size by gel filtration, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry, shape by electron and atomic force microscopy, and, function by assays of their capacity to inhibit proteases. The results showed the oligomers to be highly ordered, domain-swapped assemblies of cystatin C and that the oligomers could not build larger oligomers, or fibrils, without domain swapping. The stabilized oligomers were used to induce antibody formation in rabbits.

We have previously reported that activation of Etk leads to apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of Etk in neuronal injury induced by H(2)O(2) or ischemia.

Inhibiting Etk activity by LFM-A13 or knocking down Etk expression by a specific shRNA increased the survival of primary cortical neurons. Similarly, at 1 day after a 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in adult rats, both phosphorylated Etk and Stat1 were coexpressed with apoptotic markers in neurons in the penumbra. Pretreatment with LFM-A13 or an adenoviral vector encoding the kinase deletion mutant Etkk attenuated caspase-3 activity and infarct volume in ischemic brain.

We demonstrate that a Peltier-cooled cold plate with +/- 1 degrees C sensitivity enables quantitative measurement of a detection withdrawal response to cold stimuli in unrestrained rats. In naïve rats the threshold for eliciting cold pain behavior is 5 degrees C. The withdrawal threshold for cold allodynia is 15 degrees C in both the spared nerve injury and spinal nerve ligation models of neuropathic pain. Cold hyperalgesia is present in the spared nerve injury model animals, manifesting as a reduced latency of withdrawal response threshold at temperatures that elicit cold pain in naïve rats.

In recent years, accumulated evidence shows that estrogen also plays very important roles in the brain. Recent basic science studies show that estrogen treatment decreases the neuronal response to various forms of insult through the regulation of both estrogen synthesis and estrogen receptor expression in the brain. Some clinical evidence also suggests that estrogen deprivation might be implicated as a risk factor in various neurodegenerative diseases. Estrogen may play a neuroprotective role through estrogen dependent alterations in cell survival, enhancement of synaptic transmission and neurogenesis. Some of the mechanisms underlying these effects are independent of the classical nuclear estrogen receptors and involve direct modulation of neurotransmitter receptor function, or anti-oxidant activities of estrogen. It is controversial whether estrogen is indicated in the prevention or treatment of various brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The conflicting findings suggest that several variables, including age, estrogen dose and formulation, the length of treatment, may determine whether the potential benefits of estrogen treatment would outweigh the associated risks."}

The problem is no different from that posed by other drugs-such as calcium antagonists, antihypertensives, or hormones-normally prescribed for chronic diseases. What, however, is meant in this context by 'toxic' (from the Greek toxicon, meaning poison)? Irrevocable damage such as cell loss should not be confused with reversible side effects resulting from cell dysfunction. Clinically or experimentally, levodopa has not been shown to accelerate neurodegeneration or cause permanent impairment of cell function in a manner that would result in irreversible side effects. These data have been reasonably well established in vivo in animals and humans, although preliminary studies suggesting that levodopa is a trophic factor remain unconfirmed. Like oxygen or calcium, levodopa can be toxic in vitro when it is present in high concentrations or in the absence of glial cells. However, glial cells are much more numerous than neurons in vivo, so these conditions cannot simply be extrapolated to three-dimensional brain structures in which protective interactions with the cellular environment abound. Because levodopa remains the most effective treatment available for Parkinson's disease, questions regarding timing or manner of administration of the drug should arise not because levodopa is toxic to nerve cells, but because it causes reversible side effects. When the elementary rules of substitutive therapy to provide maximum comfort while limiting side effects are followed, we need not fear that levodopa is dangerous unless the contrary is proven."}

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which often precedes AD, is characterized by neuronal loss in the entorhinal cortex (EC). This loss leads to a hippocampal disconnection syndrome that drives clinical progression. The concomitant sprouting of cholinergic terminals in the hippocampus has been proposed to compensate for reduced EC glutamatergic input. However, in absence of direct experimental evidence, the compensatory nature of the cholinergic sprouting and its putative mechanisms remain elusive. Transgenic mice expressing the human APOE4 allele, the main genetic risk factor for sporadic MCI/AD, display impaired cholinergic sprouting after EC lesion. Using these mice as a tool to manipulate cholinergic sprouting in a disease-relevant way, we showed that this sprouting was necessary and sufficient for the acute compensation of EC lesion-induced spatial memory deficit before a slower glutamatergic reinnervation took place. We also found that partial EC lesion generates abnormal hyperactivity in EC/dentate networks. Dentate hyperactivity was abolished by optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic fibers. Therefore, control of dentate hyperactivity by cholinergic sprouting may be involved in functional compensation after entorhinal lesion. Our results also suggest that dentate hyperactivity in MCI patients may be directly related to EC neuronal loss. Impaired sprouting during the MCI stage may contribute to the faster cognitive decline reported in APOE4 carriers. Beyond the amyloid contribution, the potential role of both cholinergic sprouting and dentate hyperactivity in AD symptomatogenesis should be considered in designing new therapeutic approaches.	Currently, curative treatment trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have failed. The endogenous ability of the brain to cope with neuronal loss probably represents one of the most promising therapeutic targets, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we show that the mammalian brain is able to manage several deleterious consequences of the loss of entorhinal neurons on hippocampal activity and cognitive performance through a fast cholinergic sprouting followed by a slower glutamatergic reinnervation. The cholinergic sprouting is gender dependent and highly sensitive to the genetic risk factor APOE4 Our findings highlight the specific impact of early loss of entorhinal input on hippocampal hyperactivity and cognitive deficits characterizing early stages of AD, especially in APOE4 carriers."}

In the 5,7-DHT-treated animals, the number of neurons was significantly reduced following 2 min of ischemia compared to vehicle-treated animals in which this period of ischemia is non-lethal. Thus, intrahippocampal treatment with ZD-211 or buspirone can protect neuronal damage following transient ischemia in gerbils. These effects of ZD-211 and buspirone were mediated through the 5-HT1A receptor in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the destruction of the 5-HT nervous system in the hippocampus aggravated ischemic neuronal damage. Therefore, this study showed that the enhanced activity of the 5-HT nervous system in the hippocampus may protect against neuronal damage following cerebral ischemia."}

The characterization of the mechanistic actions exerted by different toxins in astrocytes is essential to understand the brain function and pathology. As age plays a critical role in degenerative processes, the aim of this study was to determine whether the administration of equimolar concentrations of two neurotoxins evoking different toxic patterns can induce differential effects on primary astrocytes obtained either from newborn or adult rats, with particular emphasis on those events linked to oxidative stress as a potential source of damage. Primary cortical astrocyte cultures derived from rat brains were exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) or beta-amyloid peptide (β-amyloid). Mitochondrial functionality and cell viability were determined as physiological parameters, whereas lipid and protein oxidation were used as markers of oxidative damage. The results of these experiments pointed towards a higher vulnerability to MPP + over β-amyloid, on most of the tested markers. Hence, in order to allow a comprehensive evaluation of astrocytic responses against MPP + intoxication, a third astrocyte group was included for dose-response experiments: astrocytes derived from aged rats.

Serum reactivity with paranodes and brain tissue was tested with immunohistochemistry of teased-nerve fibers and rat brain. Antibody titers and immunoglobulin (Ig) G isotypes were determined using ELISA. Clinical information was obtained retrospectively.	Two of 53 patients, but none of 204 controls, had antibodies to NF155 (p = 0.041). The 2 patients with NF155 antibodies developed severe polyradiculoneuropathy with predominant distal weakness that was refractory to IVIg. Eight additional patients with IVIg-refractory CIDP were then identified from a national database; 2 of them with the same clinical features also had NF155 antibodies. Overall, 3 of the 4 patients with NF155 antibodies had a disabling and characteristic tremor (high amplitude, low frequency, postural, and intention). Patients' antibodies reacted with the paranodes in teased-nerve fibers and with the neuropil of rat cerebellum, brain, and brainstem. Anti-NF155 antibodies were predominantly of the IgG4 isotype in all patients.	Patients with CIDP positive for IgG4 NF155 antibodies constitute a specific subgroup with a severe phenotype, poor response to IVIg, and disabling tremor. Autoantibodies against paranodal structures associate with distinct clinical features in CIDP and their identification has diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.	This study provides Class IV evidence that autoantibodies to NF155 identify a CIDP subtype characterized by severe neuropathy, poor response to IVIg, and disabling tremor."}

Although many of these nodules are small and benign in nature, some do grow and may cause pressure and/or thyrotoxic symptoms. Surgical resection has traditionally been recommended for symptomatic nodules but is associated with risk of hypothyroidism, bleeding, infection, and nerve damage. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is one of the non-surgical thermal ablation techniques that may serve as an alternative in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules. The present review is to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of HIFU ablation.	We comprehensively searched all studies that evaluated the use of HIFU ablation as a treatment of benign thyroid nodules from Medline (PubMed) and Cochrane Library electronic databases using specific keywords. All titles identified by the search strategy were independently screened by two authors. Case reports, animal studies, editorials, expert opinions, reviews without original data and studies on pediatric population were excluded. Multiple reports of the same dataset were assessed and the most representative and updated report of a study was included.	Five original studies were found. All treated thyroid nodules were confirmed to be benign cytologically and either appeared solid or predominantly (>70%) solid on ultrasonography. Only one type of commercially available US-guided device with an extracorporeal probe (3 MHz) was used in all the reported treatments. No major complications including recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, skin burn or haematoma were reported in all of the studies. The overall nodule volume reduction after single session of HIFU ablation ranged between 45 and 68%, depending on nodule size and length of follow-up.	Despite the few number of studies, our review appeared to suggest that HIFU is a safe and efficacious method of treating symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. However, larger-scale, prospective trials with longer follow-up period are indeed required to confirm this. In terms of the ablation itself, relative to other ablation techniques, there are still much room for improvements in shortening treatment duration and expanding the range of treatable nodules."}

We tested this hypothesis by determining the expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity after intrastriatal injection of 1S,3R-ACPD. Intense Fos-like immunoreactivity was noted in the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Ablation of the subthalamic nucleus 10 days prior to intrastriatal injection of 1S,3R-ACPD abolished rotational behaviour but not Fos-like immunoreactivity in the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra. Intrasubthalamic injection of 1S,3R-ACPD produced marked contralateral rotation and a pattern of Fos-like immunoreactivity similar to that seen after intrastriatal 1S,3R-ACPD injection. These results suggest that stimulation of striatal metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibits striatal projection neuron activity, while stimulation of subthalamic metabotropic glutamate receptors increases subthalamic nucleus activity. Increased subthalamic nucleus activity is necessary and sufficient for the expression of rotational behavior. These results also suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease."}

These vectors replicate in some of the established hamster tumor cell lines that can be used to generate tumors in vivo, that is, one can study oncolytic (replication competent) adenoviruses in a permissive, immunocompetent model. This has afforded the opportunity to study the effect of the host immune system on the vector-infected tumor and has allowed the use of a more relevant animal model to determine the safety and biodistribution of replication-competent adenoviruses.

Previous studies focused mainly on neuronal inputs such as altered synaptic plasticity. Axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized functional domain within neurons that regulates neuronal outputs. Structural changes of AIS have been implicated as a key pathophysiological event in various psychiatric and neurological disorders. Here we evaluated the structural integrity of the AIS in brains of db/db mice, an established animal model of type 2 diabetes associated with cognitive and mood impairments. We assessed the AIS before (5 weeks of age) and after (10 weeks) the development of type 2 diabetes, and after daily exercise treatment of diabetic condition. We found that the development of type 2 diabetes is associated with significant AIS shortening in both medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as evident by immunostaining of the AIS structural protein βIV spectrin. AIS shortening occurs in the absence of altered neuronal and AIS protein levels. We found no change in nodes of Ranvier, another neuronal functional domain sharing a molecular organization similar to the AIS. This is the first study to identify AIS alteration in type 2 diabetes condition. Since AIS shortening is known to lower neuronal excitability, our results may provide a new avenue for understanding and treating cognitive and mood impairments in type 2 diabetes."}

We previously reported that the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) alleviates neurotoxic prion peptide (PrP106-126)-induced toxicity in primary neurons. Here we confirmed the findings of the in vitro model in 263K infected hamsters, an in vivo model of prion diseases and further showed the relationships between REST and related signaling pathways. REST was depleted from the nucleus in prion infected brains and taken up by autophagosomes in the cytoplasm, co-localizing with LC3-II. Importantly, downregulation of the Akt-mTOR and at least partially inactivation of LRP6-Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathways correlated with the decreased levels of REST in vivo in the brain of 263K-infected hamsters and in vitro in PrP106-126-treated primary neurons. Overexpression of REST in primary cortical neurons alleviated PrP106-126 peptide-induced neuronal oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and partly inhibition of the LRP6-Wnt-β-catenin and Akt-mTOR signaling. Based on our findings, a model of REST-mediated neuroprotection in prion infected animals is proposed, with Akt-mTOR and Wnt-β-catenin signaling as the key pathways.

BDNF is encoded by multiple transcripts with distinct regulation and localization, but the impact of the Val66Met polymorphism on BDNF regulation remains unclear.	In BDNF Val66Met knock-in mice, which recapitulate the phenotypic hallmarks of individuals carrying the BDNF(Met) allele, we measured expression levels, epigenetic changes at promoters, and dendritic trafficking of distinct BDNF transcripts using quantitative PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and in situ hybridization.	BDNF-4 and BDNF-6 transcripts were reduced in BDNF(Met/Met) mice, compared with BDNF(Val/Val) mice. ChIP for acetyl-histone H3, a marker of active gene transcription, and trimethyl-histone-H3-Lys27 (H3K27me3), a marker of gene repression, showed higher H3K27me3 binding to exon 5, 6, and 8 promoters in BDNF(Met/Met). The H3K27 methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is involved in epigenetic regulation of BDNF expression, because in neuroblastoma cells BDNF expression was increased both by short interference RNA for EZH2 and incubation with 3-deazaneplanocin A, an inhibitor of EZH2. In situ hybridization for BDNF-2, BDNF-4, and BDNF-6 after pilocarpine treatment showed that BDNF-6 transcript was virtually absent from distal dendrites of the CA1 and CA3 regions in BDNF(Met/Met) mice, while no changes were found for BDNF-2 and BDNF-4.	Impaired BDNF expression and dendritic targeting in BDNF(Met/Met) mice may contribute to reduced regulated secretion of BDNF at synapses, and may be a specific correlate of pathology in individuals carrying the Met allele."}

However, the use of tPA has been profoundly constrained due to its narrow therapeutic time window and the increased risk of potentially deadly hemorrhagic complications. TPA-associated hemorrhagic transformation (HT) often occurs as a result of catastrophic failure of the blood brain barrier (BBB), wherein the affected cerebral capillaries can no longer hold blood constituents. Due to its direct contribution to edema and HT, reperfusion-associated BBB damage has been extensively studied, while BBB damage that occurs within the thrombolytic time window is largely neglected. Of note, ischemia-induced BBB damage in the early stroke stages is increasingly appreciated to negatively affect the safety and efficacy profiles of thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke. In this review, we discussed the recent findings of spatio-temporal evolution of BBB injury in the early stages of cerebral ischemia and its association with intracerebral hemorrhage following tPA thrombolysis. The increased understanding of early ischemic BBB damage and its close link to tPA-associated HT is of particular importance for developing new preventive and therapeutic strategies to reduce the hemorrhagic complications in stroke thrombolysis."}

In the current investigation we evaluate the time course of the analgesic effect for different endpoints after treatment with drugs with varying degrees of selectivity for COX-1 and COX-2. We also assess prostaglandin (PGE(2)) and thromboxane (TXB(2)) inhibition to establish the correlation between behavioural measures and the degree of selectivity for COX-1 and COX-2.	Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with FCA by intra-plantar injection. On post-inoculation day (PID) 7, rats received a single oral dose of naproxen, diclofenac, ketorolac or rofecoxib.

Behavioural endpoints for inflammatory pain and blood samples for biomarkers were obtained at various time points before and after dosing to characterise the time course of drug effect and disease progression.	COX-inhibitors showed no effect on the dynamic plantar test. In contrast, full analgesia was observed after drug administration for weight bearing capacity (WBC) and paw pressure (PP), with varying duration of the effect for each of the endpoints. No tolerance to drug effect was observed up to 14 days of chronic treatment. Rofecoxib showed an increase in baseline pain threshold values after chronic treatment, which may be related to its pharmacokinetic characteristics.	Changes in paw pressure threshold seem to best reflect the anti-hyperalgesic properties of COX-inhibitors with enough sensitivity to enable estimation of the dose-exposure-response curve."}

As much as 25% of L-glutamate in brain may be present in the form of NAAG. NAAG is also one of the most abundant neuroactive small molecules in the CNS: it is an agonist at Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR II) and, at higher concentrations, at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of ionotropic glutamate receptors. As such, NAAG can be either neuroprotective or neurotoxic and, in fact, both characteristics have been discussed and described in the literature. In the present studies, 250 nmol NAAG was infused into each lateral cerebral ventricle of 12-day-old rat pups and, using Nissl-stained sections, neurodegeneration in the hippocampus was evaluated 24 or 96 h after the infusion. In several experiments, the neuronal death was also visualised by Fluoro-Jade B staining and studied by TUNEL technique. Some of the NAAG-treated animals were allowed to survive until 50 days post partum and subjected to behavioural (open field) tests. The administration of NAAG to 12-day-old rats resulted in extensive death of neurons particularly in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The neurodegeneration was, in part, prevented by administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg). The nuclear DNA-fragmentation demonstrated by TUNEL technique pointed to the presence of non-specific single-strand DNA cleavage. The NAAG-associated neonatal neuronal damage may have perturbed development of synaptic circuitry during adolescence as indicated by an altered performance of the experimental animals in the open field testing (changes in grooming activity) at postnatal day 50. The results underscore the potential neurotoxicity of NAAG in neonatal rat brain and implicate neonatally induced, NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal loss in the development of abnormal behaviour in young adult rats."}

One potential drug target, the protein-protein interaction between neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), is critical to acute ischaemic damage and neurogenesis. We show that nNOS-PSD-95 dissociation induced by microinjection of a recombinant fusion protein, Tat-nNOS-N1-133 , or systemic administration of a small-molecule, ZL006, from day 4 to day 10 after photothrombotic ischaemia in mice reduced excessive tonic inhibition in the peri-infarct cortex and ameliorated motor functional outcome. We also demonstrated improved neuroplasticity including increased dendrite spine density and synaptogenesis after reducing excessive tonic inhibition by nNOS-PSD-95 dissociation. Levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABA transporter-3/4 (GAT-3/4) are increased in the reactive astrocytes in the peri-infarct cortex. The GAT-3/4-selective antagonist SNAP-5114 reduced tonic inhibition and promoted function recovery, suggesting that increased tonic inhibition in the peri-infarct cortex was due to GABA release from reversed GAT-3/4 in reactive astrocytes. Treatments with Tat-nNOS-N1-133 or ZL006 after ischaemia inhibited astrocyte activation and GABA production, prevented the reversal of GAT-3/4, and consequently decreased excessive tonic inhibition and ameliorated functional outcome. The underlying molecular mechanisms were associated with epigenetic inhibition of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 and monoamine oxidase B expression through reduced NO production. The nNOS-PSD-95 interaction is thus a potential target for functional restoration after stroke and ZL006, a small molecule inhibitor of this interaction, is a promising pharmacological lead compound.

One explanation for the lack of positive findings may be the lack of clinically evident muscle spasms (overactivity), despite the presence of muscle tenderness, tightness, or trigger points. Clinical observations of pain relief from injections of botulinum toxin for dystonia and spasticity and its apparent efficacy in treating migraine suggest an anti-nociceptive action independent of its neuromuscular junction-blocking action.

These involve modulation of the activity of the neurotransmitters glutamate, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, enkephalins, and others.

Studies of familial PD have uncovered rare causative mutations in genes, including alpha-synuclein. Mutations or oxidative modification of alpha-synuclein causes it to aggregate; alpha-synuclein is a major component of the Lewy body in both familial and sporadic PD. Biochemical analysis has implicated mitochondrial dysfunction in PD. Epidemiological studies indicate a role of exposure to pesticides, some of which are mitochondrial toxins. Mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting from genetic defects, environmental toxins, or a combination of the two, may cause alpha-synuclein aggregation and produce selective neurodegeneration through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and excitotoxicity. Efforts to better define PD pathogenesis should reveal novel therapeutic targets."}

Challenges in the development of, for example, gene therapy, such as delivery, distribution, and persistence of virus vectors or oligo sense nucleotides, can be explored in large brains and organisms approaching human size. We here introduce the transgenic Libechov minipig as a large animal model of HD. Methods developed to assess motor, cognitive, and behavioral features expected to manifest in an HD model are described. We also outline established protocols for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for minipigs. The successful conduct of long-term follow-up studies over several years with repeated behavioral testing and imaging is reported. We discuss the advantages and limitations of using this model with regard to translational reliability, homology to humans and with respect to feasibility, breeding, housing, handling, and finally ethical considerations. It is concluded that minipigs can fulfill an important role in preclinical development to bridge the gap between rodents and nonhuman primate research in the translation to humans."}

Influence of pulsatile flow during cerebral perfusion and its link to consistent full neurological recovery with controlled reperfusion following 30 min of global brain ischaemia.^\nBrain damage is universal in the rare survivor of unwitnessed cardiac arrest. Non-pulsatile-controlled cerebral reperfusion offsets this damage, but may simultaneously cause brain oedema when delivered at the required the high mean perfusion pressure. This study analyses pulsatile perfusion first in control pigs and then using controlled reperfusion after prolonged normothermic brain ischaemia (simulating unwitnessed arrest) to determine if it might provide a better method of delivery for brain reperfusion.	Initial baseline studies during isolated brain perfusion in 12 pigs (six non-pulsatile and six pulsatile) examined high (750 cc/min) then low (450 cc/min) fixed flow before and after transient (30 s) ischaemia, while measuring brain vascular resistance and oxygen metabolism. Twelve subsequent pigs underwent 30 min of normothermic global brain ischaemia followed by either uncontrolled reperfusion with regular blood (n = 6) or pulsatile-controlled reperfusion (n = 6) before unclamping brain inflow vessels. Functional neurological deficit score (NDS; score: 0, normal; 500, brain death) was evaluated 24 h post-reperfusion.	High baseline flow rates with pulsatile and non-pulsatile perfusion before and after transient ischaemia maintained normal arterial pressures (90-100 mmHg), surface oxygen levels IN Vivo Optical Spectroscopy (INVOS) and oxygen uptake. In contrast, oxygen uptake fell after 30 s ischaemia at 450 cc/min non-pulsatile flow, but improved following pulsatile perfusion, despite its delivery at lower mean cerebral pressure. Uncontrolled (normal blood) reperfusion after 30 min of prolonged ischaemia, caused negligible INVOS O(2) uptake (<10-15%), raised conjugated dienes (CD; 1.75 ± 0.15 A(233 mn)), one early death, multiple seizures, high NDS (243 ± 16) and extensive cerebral infarcts (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride stain) and oedema (84.1 ± 0.6%). Conversely, pulsatile-controlled reperfusion pigs exhibited normal O(2) uptake, low CD levels (1.31 ± 0.07 A(233 mn); P < 0.01 versus uncontrolled reperfusion), no seizures and a low NDS (32 ± 14; P < 0.001 versus uncontrolled reperfusion); three showed complete recovery (NDS = 0) and all could sit and eat. Post-mortem brain oedema was minimal (81.1 ± 0.5; P < 0.001 versus uncontrolled reperfusion) and no infarctions occurred.	Pulsatile perfusion lowers cerebral vascular resistance and improves global O(2) uptake to potentially offset post-ischaemic oedema following high-pressure reperfusion. The irreversible functional and anatomic damage that followed uncontrolled reperfusion after a 30-min warm global brain ischaemia interval was reversed by pulsatile-controlled reperfusion, as its delivery resulted in consistent near complete neurological recovery and absent brain infarction."}

Studies by our group have shown that passive transfer of autoimmune T cells specific to myelin basic protein (T(MBP)) can protect injured neurons in the rat CNS from secondary degeneration. In this study, we investigated the effects of T(MBP) treatment on the local immune response (by B cells and macrophages) and on the expression of neurotrophic factors after crush injury of the rat optic nerve. Systemic injection of activated T(MBP) caused an increase in the accumulation of macrophages/microglia and B cells in the injured nerve, which was greater than that seen in the injured optic nerves of untreated animals. This accumulation was accompanied by a transient, but massive, increase in the expression of neurotrophic factors. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated differential expression of neurotrophins by resident astrocytes and by infiltrating B cells, T cells, and macrophages. Because postinjury neuronal survival and maintenance are known to be affected by neurotrophins, our findings point to a possible contribution of a neurotrophin-related mechanism to the protective effect conferred by T cell-mediated autoimmunity on injured neurons."}

Hyperglycemia is a major characteristic of T2DM, but how elevated glucose levels lead to cognitive decline remains elusive. Here, we report that patients with T2DM and mutations in the formaldehyde (FA)-degrading enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene had higher levels of FA and more severe dementia. Injection of FA induced hyperglycemia and cognitive deficits in rats. Ablation of gene expression of ALDH2, the main enzyme to oxidize FA, resulted in abnormally high levels of hippocampal FA, leading to hyperglycemia and cognitive impairments as well as potentiating streptozotocin-induced diabetes development in ALDH2 knockout mice. We found that FA interacts with insulin to form FA-insulin adducts, and these FA-insulin adducts caused insulin deficiency, contributing to memory decline in diabetic rodent models. Reduction of FA by transgenic overexpression of human ALDH2 attenuates hyperglycemia and alleviates cognitive deficits in diabetic mouse models. These findings suggest that excess FA plays a critical role in mediating diabetes-related dementia. Targeting FA and its metabolizing enzyme ALDH2 may be a valid approach for preventing and treating dementia in diabetes mellitus.-Tan, T., Zhang, Y., Luo, W., Lv, J., Han, C., Hamlin, J. N.

Unfortunately, little progress has been made over the past 20 years in terms of the development of effective disease-modifying drugs with the currently available symptomatic treatments having limited clinical utility.	This article reviews the principal pharmacological intervention studies for FTD.

There is insufficient evidence on effective treatments for FTD and studies with better methodological backgrounds are needed. Most studies reporting therapeutic benefits were conducted with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, while anti-dementia drugs have been ineffective in FTD. Since the underlying pathology of FTD mostly consists of abnormal tau protein or TDP-43 aggregates, treatments are being developed to interfere with their aggregation process or with the clearance of these proteins. Furthermore, disease-modifying treatments remain years away as demonstrated by the recent negative Phase III findings of a tau aggregation inhibitor (LMTM) for treating the behavioral variant of FTD.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in microfluidic channels subjected to flow conditions overnight to stimulate glycocalyx growth.

Perfusate was then collected 60 minutes and 120 minutes following treatments. Relevant biomarkers were then evaluated and HUVEC underwent fluorescent staining followed by microscopy.	Glycocalyx degradation as indexed by hyaluronic acid and syndecan-1 was elevated in all subgroups, particularly those subjected to HR + Epi with Na 160 mEq/L.

Because oxidative stress has been implicated in the clinical side effects of HP, rat primary cortical neurons and the mouse hippocampal cell line HT-22 were used to characterize the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other cellular alterations caused by HP. Primary neurons and HT-22 cells are equally sensitive to HP with an IC50 of 35 microM in the primary neurons and 45 microM in HT-22. HP induces a sixfold increase in levels of ROS, which are generated from mitochondria but not from the metabolism of catecholamines by monoamine oxidases. Glutathione (GSH) is an important antioxidant for the protection of cells against HP toxicity because (1) the intracellular GSH decreases as the ROS production increases, (2) the exogenous addition of antioxidants, such as beta-estradiol and vitamin E, lowers the level of ROS and protects HT-22 cells from HP, and (3) treatments that result in the reduction of the intracellular GSH potentiate HP toxicity. The GSH decrease is followed by the increase in the intracellular level of Ca2+, which immediately precedes cell death. Therefore, HP causes a sequence of cellular alterations that lead to cell death and the production of ROS is the integral part of this cascade."}

PC12 neurons engineered to express human IGF-1R (PC12/IGF-1R) maintain neuronal processes on collagen IV for several weeks. However, prolonged treatment with TNFalpha caused degeneration of neuronal processes, with no apparent signs of apoptosis. In this process, TNFalpha did not affect IGF-1-mediated phosphorylation of IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, or Erks. In addition, PC12/IGF-1R cells were found to express predominantly alpha1beta1 integrin, which has high affinity to collagen IV. The treatment of PC12/IGF-1R neurons with a specific alpha1beta1 integrin inhibitor, obtustatin, also caused loss of neuronal processes, accompanied by a quick cell detachment and extensive apoptosis. In the presence of IGF-1, both TNFalpha-induced and obtustatin-induced degeneration of neuronal processes were effectively inhibited. Furthermore, TNFalpha-mediated neuronal degeneration correlated with decreased attachment of PC12/IGF-1R cells to collagen IV and with a reduced level of alpha1beta1 integrin, consistent with a role for this surface protein in the maintenance of neuronal processes. Thus the neuroprotective effects of IGF-1 are not restricted to its antiapoptotic properties but also involve an additional neuroprotective mechanism, by which IGF-1 counteracts the negative effect of TNFalpha on alpha1beta1 integrin-mediated attachment to collagen IV."}

These effects of CBD were not associated with any side effects. These results emphasize the interest in CBD as a neuroprotective agent for neonatal HI."}
{"pmid": "28701542", "text": "Journal of neurophysiology^\nGroup IV nociceptors develop axonal chemical sensitivity during neuritis and following treatment of the sciatic nerve with vinblastine.^\nWe have previously shown that nerve inflammation (neuritis) and transient vinblastine application lead to axonal mechanical sensitivity in nociceptors innervating deep structures. We also have shown that these treatments reduce axonal transport and have proposed that this leads to functional accumulation of mechanically sensitive channels in the affected part of the axons. Though informing the etiology of mechanically induced pain, axonal mechanical sensitivity does not address the common report of ongoing radiating pain during neuritis, which could be secondary to the provocation of axonal chemical sensitivity. We proposed that neuritis and vinblastine application would induce sensitivities to noxious chemicals and that the number of chemo-sensitive channels would be increased at the affected site. In adult female rats, nerves were either untreated or treated with complete Freund's adjuvant (to induce neuritis) or vinblastine. After 3-7 days, dorsal root teased fiber recordings were taken from group IV neurons with axons within the sciatic nerve. Sciatic nerves were injected intraneurally with a combination of noxious inflammatory chemicals. Whereas no normal sciatic axons responded to this stimulus, 80% and 38% of axons responded in the neuritis and vinblastine groups, respectively. In separate experiments, sciatic nerves were partially ligated and treated with complete Freund's adjuvant or vinblastine (with controls), and after 3-5 days were immunolabeled for the histamine H3 receptor. The results support that both neuritis and vinblastine treatment reduce transport of the histamine H3 receptor. The finding that nociceptor axons can develop ectopic chemical sensitivity is consistent with ongoing radiating pain due to nerve inflammation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Many patients suffer ongoing pain with no local pathology or apparent nerve injury. We show that nerve inflammation and transient application of vinblastine induce sensitivity of group IV nociceptor axons to a mixture of endogenous inflammatory chemicals. We also show that the same conditions reduce the axonal transport of the histamine H3 receptor. The results provide a mechanism for ongoing nociception from focal nerve inflammation or pressure without overt nerve damage."}

An ASM knockout (ASMKO) mouse model of NP-A is available through targeted disruption of the parent gene. This study presents the pattern and time course of lysosomal pathology and neurodegeneration in the ASMKO mouse nervous system. Cells throughout the nervous system developed the classic foamy appearance associated with lysosomal storage disorders. Despite this, neurons were capable of retrogradely transporting dyes within established brain pathways comparable to control animals. A silver degeneration staining method demonstrated widespread damage in the form of 'classic' impregnation of cells, fibers and synaptic terminals. Of particular interest was the degeneration of Purkinje cells (PC) within the cerebellum, beginning by 7 weeks of age in parasagittal bands and culminating with near complete degeneration of this cell type by 20 weeks. In parallel, ASMKO mice had progressively deteriorating motor performance on two versions of the rotating rod test (accelerating and rocking). ASMKO mice at 5-7 weeks of age performed similarly to controls on both rotating rod tests, but performance sharply deteriorated between 7 and 20 weeks of age. This study further characterized the neuropathology associated with ASM deficiency, and identifies quantitative histological and behavioral endpoints for evaluation of therapeutic intervention in this authentic NP-A mouse model."}

The clinical manifestations of this process include age-related hearing loss (AHL)/presbycusis. Several investigations indicated the association between a mitochondrial common deletion (CD) (mtDNA 4977-bp deletion in humans, corresponding to 4834-bp deletion in rats) and presbycusis. Previous researches have shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism. However, the expression of PGC-1α in the inner ear and the possible effect of PGC-1α on presbycusis are not clear. Our data demonstrated the distribution of PGC-1α and its downstream transcription factors nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in marginal cells (MCs) for the first time. To explore the role of PGC-1α in cellular senescence, we established a model of marginal cell senescence harboring the mtDNA4834 common deletion induced by d-galactose. We also found that PGC-1α and its downstream transcription factors compensatorily increased in our cell senescence model. Furthermore, the overexpression of PGC-1α induced by transfection largely increased the expression levels of NRF-1 and TFAM and significantly decreased the expression level of NF-κB in the cell senescence model. And the levels of CD, senescent cells and apoptotic cells in the cell model decreased after PGC-1α overexpression. These results suggested that PGC-1α might protect MCs in this cell model from senescence through a nuclear-mitochondrial interaction and against apoptosis. Our study may shed light on the pathogenesis of presbycusis and provide a new therapeutic target for presbycusis."}

So, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of DHEA on learning and memory activities in a rat model of vascular dementia (VD). Forty-eight male rats that positively passed the holeboard memory test were chosen for the study before bilateral permanent occlusion of the common carotid artery. They were divided into four groups (n=12, each) as follows (i) untreated control, (ii) rats exposed to surgical permanent bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (BCCAO) leading to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, (iii) rats exposed to BCCAO then received DHEA (BCCAO + DHEA) and (i.v.) rats exposed to BCCAO then received donepezil (BCCAO + DON). Holeboard memory test was used to assess the time, latency, working memory and reference memory. Central level of acetylcholine, norepinephrine and dopamine in the hippocampus were measured. Furthermore, the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus was determined. Histopathological studies of the cerebral cortex and transmission electron microscope of the hippocampus were performed. BCCAO decreased the learning and memory activities in the holeboard memory. Also, it decreased the expression of BDNF as well as the central level of acetylcholine, noradrenaline and dopamine as compared to control rats. Treatment with DHEA and donepezil increased the working and reference memories, BDNF expression as well as the central acetylcholine in the hippocampus as compared to BCCAO rats.

The phylogeny of these sponges and the wide scope of 2-aminoimidazolone alkaloids they produce are reviewed in this article. The origin (invertebrate cells, associated microorganisms, or filtered plankton), physiological functions, and natural molecular targets of these alkaloids are largely unknown. Following the identification of leucettamine B as an inhibitor of selected protein kinases, we synthesized a family of analogues, collectively named leucettines, as potent inhibitors of DYRKs (dual-specificity, tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinases) and CLKs (cdc2-like kinases) and potential pharmacological leads for the treatment of several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome. We assembled a small library of marine sponge- and ascidian-derived 2-aminoimidazolone alkaloids, along with several synthetic analogues, and tested them on a panel of mammalian and protozoan kinases. Polyandrocarpamines A and B were found to be potent and selective inhibitors of DYRKs and CLKs. They inhibited cyclin D1 phosphorylation on a DYRK1A phosphosite in cultured cells. 2-Aminoimidazolones thus represent a promising chemical scaffold for the design of potential therapeutic drug candidates acting as specific inhibitors of disease-relevant kinases, and possibly other disease-relevant targets."}

As this is a process of delayed neuronal cell death and not an instantaneous event, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies have been developed to attenuate or block this cascade. The most promising neuroprotectant so far is therapeutic hypothermia and its beneficial effects have inspired researchers to further improve its protective benefit by combining it with other neuroprotective agents. This review provides an overview of all neuroprotective strategies that have been combined with therapeutic hypothermia in rodent models of focal cerebral ischemia. A distinction is made between drugs interrupting only one event of the ischemic cascade from those mitigating different pathways and having multimodal effects. Also the combination of therapeutic hypothermia with hemicraniectomy, gene therapy and protein therapy is briefly discussed.

Venous blood volume exclusion from the inferior vena cava (phlebotomy) or/and mannitol are used as a treatment for I/R injury of kidney in humans, despite the fact that the effectiveness of these treatments is still debated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of phlebotomy or/and mannitol on rat kidneys in a model of lower limbs I/R-induced acute renal injury (ARI).	Thirty male Wistar albino rats were used and divided into five groups: (I) sham-operated group, laparotomy without I/R injury (group [S], n = 6); (II) I/R group, infrarenal aortic cross-clamp was used for lower limbs I/R, 3 hours of ischemia followed by 2 hours of reperfusion (group [I/R], n = 6); (III) I/R + phlebotomy group, identical to group [I/R] except for 1 mL of blood aspiration from the inferior caval vein just after ischemia (group [P], n = 6); (IV) I/R + mannitol-treated group, these rats were subjected to I/R and received a bolus injection of mannitol (group [M], n = 6); and (V) I/R + phlebotomy + mannitol-treated group (group [P + M], n = 6), the same procedures were performed as those described for previous groups. At the end of 2-hour reperfusion, all rats were sacrificed. Both kidneys were harvested for biochemical assay (myeloperoxidase [MPO] and superoxide dismutase [SOD] activities, and malondialdehyde [MDA] and reduced glutathione levels) and for histopathological examination (tubular necrosis and acute inflammation on kidney [ARI score]).	Aortic I/R significantly increased the level of MDA (reflecting lipid peroxidation), SOD (enzymatic endogenous antioxidant), and MPO (reflecting neutrophil infiltration) activity (p < 0.05). Phlebotomy or/and mannitol treatments significantly decreased the level of MDA, SOD, and MPO activity and increased glutathione level (nonenzymatic antioxidant in the kidney tissues) (p < 0.05). Histological evaluation of ARI score showed that aortic I/R significantly increased (p value for group [S] versus group [I/R] was 0.012), whereas phlebotomy or/and mannitol treatments significantly decreased tubular necrosis and inflammatory infiltration (p values for group [I/R] versus group [P], [M], and [P + M] were 0.043, 0.043, and 0.003, respectively).	This experiment clearly indicated that the lower limbs I/R-induced ARI attenuated significantly by phlebotomy or/and mannitol treatments. Phlebotomy plus mannitol is more effective treatment than phlebotomy or mannitol alone in preventing lower limbs I/R-induced ARI in rats. Further clinical studies are required to clarify whether phlebotomy or/and mannitol treatments are beneficial in alleviating of ARI during abdominal aortic surgery."}

Exposure to ACR causes neuropathy and associated neurological defects including gait abnormalities and skeletal muscle weakness, due to impaired neurotransmitter release and eventual neurodegeneration. Using in vivo and in vitro models, we examined whether oxidative events are involved in ACR-mediated neurotoxicity and whether these could be prevented by natural plant extracts. Administration (i.p.) of ACR in mice (40 mg/kg bw/ d for 5d) induced significant oxidative damage in the brain cortex and liver as evidenced by elevated lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species and protein carbonyls. This was associated with lowered antioxidant activities including antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione-s-transferase) and reduced glutathione (GSH) compared to untreated controls. Similarly, exposure of N27 neuronal cells in culture to ACR (1-5 mM) caused dose-dependent neuronal death and lowered GSH. Interestingly, dietary supplementation with the leaf powder of Bacopa monnieri (BM) (which possesses neuroprotective properties and nootropic activity) in mice for 30 days offered significant protection against ACR toxicity and oxidative damage in vivo. Similarly, pretreatment with BM protected the N27 cells against ACR-induced cell death and associated oxidative damage. Co-treatment and pre-treatment of Drosophila melanogaster with BM extract protected against ACR-induced locomotor dysfunction and GSH depletion. We infer that BM displays prophylactic effects against ACR induced oxidative damage and neurotoxicity with potential therapeutic application in human pathology associated with neuropathy."}

To determine whether BP lowering with candesartan, initiated at reperfusion, can reduce neurovascular damage and improve outcome in a model of hypertension after experimental ischemic stroke.	Male Wistar rats (280-305 g) underwent 3 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). At reperfusion, either saline (n = 18) or candesartan 1 mg/kg (n = 18) was administered intravenously.

Mean BP increased from 96 to 124 mmHg immediately upon MCAO and decreased to 114 mmHg after reperfusion, remaining elevated for 24 h (P < 0.001) in the saline group. Candesartan reduced BP back to baseline and BP remained lower than in saline-treated animals until sacrifice (P < 0.001).

While previous studies have suggested that histone hypoacetylation may regulate the expression of genes associated with memory and learning in AD, little is known about histone regulation of AD-related genes such as Presenilin 1(PS1) and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1). By utilizing neuroblastoma N2a cells transfected with Swedish mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APP) (N2a/APPswe) and wild-type APP (N2a/APPwt) as cellular models of AD, we examined the alterations of histone acetylation at the promoter regions of PS1 and BACE1 in these cells. Our results revealed that histone H3 acetylation in PS1 and BACE1 promoters is markedly increased in N2a/APPswe cells when compared to N2a/APPwt cells and control cells (vector-transfected), respectively, causing the elevated expression of PS1 and BACE1. In addition, expression of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) adenoviral E1A-associated 300-kDa protein (p300) is dramatically enhanced in N2a/APPswe cells compared to N2a/APPwt and control cells. We have further demonstrated the direct binding of p300 protein to the PS1 and BACE1 promoters in N2a/APPswe cells. The expression levels of H3 acetylation of the PS1 and BACE1 promoters and p300 protein, however, were found to be not significantly different in N2a/APPwt cells when compared to controls in our studies. Furthermore, curcumin, a natural selective inhibitor of p300 in HATs, significantly suppressed the expression of PS1 and BACE1 through inhibition of H3 acetylation in their promoter regions in N2a/APPswe cells.

However, ways to improve this combined NMES+TT therapy have not been investigated. We have developed NMES system for a rodent model of SCI to investigate whether and how more precisely timing the stimulation to robotically assisted hindlimb position might achieve rehabilitation of independent stepping after SCI. In our therapy (NMES+RTT), rodent ankle flexor muscles are stimulated while the hindlimbs are robotically driven through pre-programmed trajectories during treadmill training. The objectives of the work presented here were to quantify changes in step trajectory resulting from our combined NMES+RTT therapy and compare those effects with those induced by robotic treadmill training (RTT) alone. Animals were spinally contused to model severe SCI, and either received 2 weeks of NMES+RTT followed by 2 weeks of RTT (n=6) or 2 weeks of RTT followed by 2 weeks of NMES+RTT (n=7). Changes in step trajectories after training were analyzed. According to a deviation measure we developed, the step trajectories improved after either NMES+RTT or RTT training but more closely matched the desired pre-programmed trajectories after NMES+RTT than after RTT only. The step trajectories are also more consistent, as indicated by a coefficient of variation measure, after training and more so after NMES+RTT than after RTT only.

Specific removal of an exon from a defective DMD gene transcript has the potential to allow synthesis of a semi-functional dystrophin, thereby reducing the severity and presumably progression of muscle wasting. The efficacy of this treatment will vary greatly between the different mutations that preclude the synthesis of a functional dystrophin. Restoration of the reading frame from a large multi-exon genomic deletion, typically greater than 36 exons, may lead to synthesis of a protein with only partial function and limited clinical benefit, whereas excising a nonsense mutation in a redundant exon should generate a near normal dystrophin. A clinical trial has recently confirmed proof-of-principle that exclusion of Exon 51 from human dystrophin mRNAs, carrying frame-shifting deletions adjacent to this exon, results in dystrophin expression. No major side-effects after local administration of the antisense oligomer were reported. Additional trials are underway, targeting the same exon but using an oligomer of different backbone chemistry. If functional dystrophin synthesis is demonstrated, and safety issues are addressed, subsequent trials will involve systemic delivery. Great challenges are ahead, some technical; establishing an effective delivery regimen, some ethical; choosing subsequent targets for therapy, and others of an administrative and regulatory nature."}

Therefore, blood-brain-barrier integrity is an important potential therapeutic target in the treatment of the acute phase of brain trauma. In this short communication, we report our data showing that neuregulin-1 (NRG1), a growth factor with diverse functions in the CNS, ameliorates pathological increases in endothelial permeability and in BBB permeability in experimental models of injury. For in-vitro studies, rat brain endothelial cells were incubated with the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, which caused an increase in permeability of the cell layer. Co-incubation with NRG1 ameliorated this permeability increase. For in-vivo studies, C57Bl mice were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) under anesthesia, and BBB permeability was assessed by measuring the amount of Evans blue dye extravasation at 2h. NRG1 administered by tail-vein injection 10 minutes after CCI resulted in a decrease in Evans blue dye extravasation by 35%. Since Evans blue extravasation may result from an increase in BBB permeability or from bleeding due to trauma, hemoglobin ELISA was also performed at the same time point. There was a trend towards lower levels of hemoglobin extravasation in the NRG1 group, but the results did not reach statistical significance. MMP-9 activity was not different between groups at 2h. These data suggest that NRG1 has beneficial effects on endothelial permeability and BBB permeability following experimental trauma, and may have neuroprotective potential during CNS injury."}

Despite increasing participation in clinical trials, there is a clear need for pre-clinical models. Heterotransplantation of surgical specimens directly into the anterior chamber of the nude mouse eye has been demonstrated to produce evaluable xenografts. Drug access in this model is considered to mimic the blood-brain barrier. Five clinical specimens in 3 children with primitive neuroectodermal tumor/medulloblastoma were the sources of 293 intraocular xenografts (5 cohorts by source). Each tumor-bearing mouse received 1 of 5 drugs or normal saline, by intraperitoneal injection, weekly for 5 weeks. Response was monitored for up to 22 weeks, using a staging system which estimates the proportion of the anterior chamber filled by tumor. Results were analysed both as response rates (shrinkage in excess of 50%) at the conclusion of the treatment course and as time to tumor progression by the life table method. Comparison of response rates within cohorts by source of xenografts (exact chi-square test for overall and 2-sided Fisher's exact test for paired comparisons) indicated cyclophosphamide to be the most effective single agent. In logrank analyses cyclophosphamide achieved significantly longer delays to progression than all other drugs in one cohort and longer delays than all but diaziquone in 2 other cohorts. The intraocular xenograft model is a clinically relevant system for the study of therapeutic agents in brain tumors. The effectiveness of intensive dosage cyclophosphamide in a model dependent on access across the blood-aqueous barrier is important and consistent with recent clinical data."}

Successful drug discovery relies on the use of appropriate animal models to assess likely outcome in the clinic.	The purpose of this study was to develop a translational, caffeine-induced model of insomnia in rats and healthy volunteers. We used sleep onset latency (SOL) as a comparable sleep measure between the two species. The model was validated by two effective sleep-promoting agents with different pharmacology, zolpidem and trazodone, which have GABA-ergic and serotonergic mechanisms, respectively.	In rats, radiotelemetry transmitters with electroencephalogram and electromyogram electrodes were implanted for sleep recording. Animals were administered with caffeine alone (10 mg/kg) or in combination with zolpidem (10 mg/kg) or trazodone (20 mg/kg), or vehicle, in crossover experiments. Home polysomnography was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers in a randomised, placebo-controlled, 4-week crossover study. Subjects received placebo, caffeine (150 mg) or caffeine in combination with zolpidem (10 mg) or trazodone (100 mg). Subjective sleep effects in volunteers were assessed using the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire.	Caffeine caused a significant prolongation in objective SOL in rats and humans. This effect was sensitive to zolpidem and trazodone, both of which attenuated the caffeine-induced increase in SOL. Furthermore, both hypnotics restored the disruption in subjective measures of sleep onset caused by caffeine in volunteers.	This model therefore provides a promising paradigm in which we can study novel treatments for sleep disorders and an opportunity for direct comparison of results between rodents and humans."}

Mitochondrial impairment and consecutive oxidative stress appear to be major molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Therefore we studied some major cannabinoids, i.e. delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) in mice mesencephalic cultures for their protective capacities against 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP(+)) toxicity. MPP(+) is an established model compound in the research of parkinsonism that acts as a complex I inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in excessive radical formation and cell degeneration. MPP(+) (10 μM) was administered for 48 h at the 9th DIV with or without concomitant cannabinoid treatment at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 μM. All cannabinoids exhibited in vitro antioxidative action ranging from 669 ± 11.1 (THC), 16 ± 3.2 (THCA) to 356 ± 29.5 (CBD) μg Trolox (a vitamin E derivative)/mg substance in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) assay. Cannabinoids were without effect on the morphology of dopaminergic cells stained by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreaction. THC caused a dose-dependent increase of cell count up to 17.3% at 10 μM, whereas CBD only had an effect at highest concentrations (decrease of cell count by 10.1-20% at concentrations of 0.01-10 μM). It influenced the viability of the TH immunoreactive neurons significantly, whereas THCA exerts no influence on dopaminergic cell count. Exposure of cultures to 10 μM of MPP(+) for 48 h significantly decreased the number of TH immunoreactive neurons by 44.7%, and shrunken cell bodies and reduced neurite lengths could be observed. Concomitant treatment of cultures with cannabinoids rescued dopaminergic cells. Compared to MPP(+) treated cultures, THC counteracted toxic effects in a dose-dependent manner. THCA and CBD treatment at a concentration of 10 μM lead to significantly increased cell counts to 123% and 117%, respectively. Even though no significant preservation or recovery of neurite outgrowth to control values could be observed, our data show that cannabinoids THC and THCA protect dopaminergic neurons against MPP(+) induced cell death."}

We tested these sera to determine WNV antibody prevalence and geometric mean antibody titer (GMAT). Four-fold higher antibody prevalence and 2-fold higher GMAT in 2003-2004 indicated greater exposure of mesopredators to WNV during the apparent epizootic phase. The period 2005-2006 was likely the enzootic phase because WNV antibody prevalence fell to a level similar to other flaviviruses. Our results suggest that, in mesopredators, vector-borne transmission is the primary route of infection and WNV antibodies persist for < 1 year. Mesopredators may be sensitive indicators of West Nile virus spill-over into humans and horses.

The combination of an inherited inability to repair UV-induced DNA damage and environmental exposure to UV must occur for cutaneous and ocular symptoms to develop. There is no cure for XP, but many of its manifestations may be reduced or prevented through consistent UV protection; thus XP serves as a model for sun protection of patients with marked photosenstivity. Sun protective clothing including hats, sunglasses and face shields, sun screen lotions and avoidance of environmental sources of UV are cornerstones of prevention of skin and eye damage and cancer.

Thus, in 5-HTT-/- mice, reduced 5-HT levels in the injured peripheral nerves correlate with diminished behavioral signs of thermal hyperalgesia, a pain-related symptom caused by peripheral sensitization.

Animal models that faithfully capture this time course of action are few. Inhibition of hyperlocomotion induced by amphetamine or phencyclidine has been widely used as a screening tool for the antipsychotic activity of a drug. We thus investigated whether repeated antipsychotic treatment could produce an early-onset and progressively increased antagonistic effect on amphetamine or phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion as a way of assessing the validity of such models in capturing time course of antipsychotic action. On each of the five consecutive test days, different groups of rats (n=6-7/group) received an initial injection of either haloperidol (0.01-0.10 mg/kg, sc), clozapine (5-20.0 mg/kg, sc), olanzapine (1.0 mg/kg, sc), chlordiazepoxide (10.0 mg/kg, ip) or vehicle (sterile water, sc) 30 min prior to a second injection of either amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg, sc) or phencyclidine (3.2 mg/kg, sc). Motor activity was subsequently monitored for 60 min after amphetamine or phencyclidine treatment. Repeated treatment of haloperidol, clozapine, or olanzapine progressively potentiated inhibition on repeated phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion and prolonged this action over the five consecutive days. In contrast, antipsychotic inhibition on repeated amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion was gradually attenuated and shortened. Repeated treatment of chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, retained its inhibition on amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, but had no effect on phencyclidine-induced one. These results suggest that repeated phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion model based on repeated antipsychotic treatment regimen is capable of capturing the progressive increase pattern of antipsychotic treatment seen in the clinic and differentiating antipsychotics from anxiolytics; thus it may serve as a better model for the investigation of the neurobiological mechanisms of action of antipsychotic drugs and delineating the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."}

Although its rates of toxicity are low, GKRS has been associated with some, if low, risks for serious sequelae, including hemiparesis and even death. Anecdotal reports have suggested that even with a standardized prescription dose, rates of functional GKRS toxicity increase after replacement of an old cobalt-60 source with a new source. Dose rate changes over the course of the useful lifespan of cobalt-60 are not routinely considered in the study of patients treated with functional GKRS, but these changes may be associated with significant variation in the biologically effective dose (BED) delivered to neural tissue. METHODS The authors constructed a linear-quadratic model of BED in functional GKRS with a dose-protraction factor to correct for intrafraction DNA-damage repair and used standard single-fraction doses for trigeminal nerve ablation for TN (85 Gy), thalamotomy for tremor (130 Gy), and capsulotomy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (180 Gy). Dose rate and treatment time for functional GKRS involving 4-mm collimators were derived from calibrations in the authors' department and from the cobalt-60 decay rate. Biologically plausible values for the ratio for radiosensitivity to fraction size (α/β) and double-strand break (DSB) DNA repair halftimes (τ) were estimated from published experimental data. The biphasic characteristics of DSB repair in normal tissue were accounted for in deriving an effective τ1 halftime (fast repair) and τ2 halftime (slow repair). A sensitivity analysis was performed with a range of plausible parameter values. RESULTS After replacement of the cobalt-60 source, the functional GKRS dose rate rose from 1.48 to 2.99 Gy/min, treatment time fell, and estimated BED increased. Assuming the most biologically plausible parameters, source replacement resulted in an immediate relative BED increase of 11.7% for GKRS-based TN management with 85 Gy, 15.6% for thalamotomy with 130 Gy, and 18.6% for capsulotomy with 180 Gy. Over the course of the 63-month lifespan of the cobalt-60 source, BED decreased annually by 2.2% for TN management, 3.0% for thalamotomy, and 3.5% for capsulotomy. CONCLUSIONS Use of a new cobalt-60 source after replacement of an old source substantially increases the predicted BED for functional GKRS treatments for the same physical dose prescription. Source age, dose rate, and treatment time should be considered in the study of outcomes after high-dose functional GKRS treatments. Animal and clinical studies are needed to determine how this potential change in BED contributes to GKRS toxicity and whether technical adjustments should be made to reduce dose rates or prescription doses with newer cobalt-60 sources."}

We further determined a quantitative pattern of specific HDACs expressed in various human and mouse neural tissues. In human AD frontal cortex, HDAC1,2 decreased 32%, HDAC5 increased 47%, and HDAC6 increased 31% in comparison to age-matched controls. Human neural retina concentrations of HDAC1, 2, HDAC5, HDAC6, and HDAC7 decreased in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-affected donors and exhibited a greater decrease in AD-affected donors in comparison to age-matched control neural retinas.

This hypothesis was tested using the anti-epileptic drug sodium valproate, a known histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI), utilizing a delayed-start study design in the lactacystin rat model of PD.	The irreversible proteasome inhibitor lactacystin was unilaterally injected into the substantia nigra of Sprague-Dawley rats that subsequently received valproate for 28 days starting 7 days after lactacystin lesioning. Longitudinal motor behavioural testing, structural MRI and post-mortem assessment of nigrostriatal integrity were used to track changes in this model of PD and quantify neuroprotection/restoration. Subsequent cellular and molecular analyses were performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying valproate's effects.	Despite producing a distinct pattern of structural re-modelling in the healthy and lactacystin-lesioned brain, delayed-start valproate administration induced dose-dependent neuroprotection/restoration against lactacystin neurotoxicity, characterized by motor deficit alleviation, attenuation of morphological brain changes and restoration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Molecular analyses revealed that valproate alleviated lactacystin-induced histone hypoacetylation and induced up-regulation of brain neurotrophic/neuroprotective factors.	The histone acetylation and up-regulation of neurotrophic/neuroprotective factors associated with valproate treatment culminate in a neuroprotective and neurorestorative phenotype in this animal model of PD. As valproate induced structural re-modelling of the brain, further research is required to determine whether valproate represents a viable candidate for disease treatment; however, the results suggest that HDACIs could hold potential as disease-modifying agents in PD."}

However, clinical use of NOB could be partly limited due to its poor solubility and bioavailability, which might necessitate high doses in order to reach therapeutic plasma concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS) after oral administration. In the present study, amorphous solid dispersion (SD) of nanosized NOB (NOB/SD) was prepared by wet-milling technique with the aim of improving dissolution behavior and pharmacokinetic properties of NOB. Physicochemical properties of the NOB/SD were characterized with focus on surface morphology, particle size distribution, dissolution, and crystallinity assessment. Wet-milled NOB particles in NOB/SD appeared to be amorphous with a diameter of approximately 270 nm, and there was marked improvement in the dissolution behavior compared with that of crystalline NOB. After oral administration of NOB/SD, higher exposure of NOB was observed with increases of bioavailability and CNS distribution by 13- and sevenfold, respectively, compared with those of crystalline NOB. These findings suggest that an amorphous, nanosized SD could be a viable option for enhancing the bioavailability and CNS delivery of NOB."}

However, the mechanism(s) determining the role of CX3CR1 in atherosclerosis have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we developed DCs from monocytes of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in the presence of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and recombinant human interleukin-4 (IL-4). The presence of recombinant human TNF-α and LPS forced the cells to mature. When compared to immature DCs, flow cytometry (FACS) analysis revealed that mature DCs display a sustained increase in the levels of CD11c, CD86, and CD80 expression. The expression of Fractalkine (FKN) in endothelial cells (ECs) contributes to the maturation of DCs and expression of CX3CR1. We revealed that mRNA expression levels of CX3CR1 in mature DCs are significantly higher than those of immature DCs (P<0.001). Transfection of DCs with siRNA specific for the CX3CR1 gene resulted in potent suppression of gene expression and inhibition of interactions between DCs and ECs. Based on these data, we hypothesized that CX3CR1 contributes to the DC-EC interaction. CX3CR1 may serve as a new target molecule for increasing therapeutic interactions in atherosclerosis."}

It is reported that repeated administration of haloperidol caused dopamine supersensitivity in rats. Blonanserin is an atypical antipsychotic drug with high affinity for dopamine D2, D3 and serotonin2A receptors. In this study, we investigated whether chronic administration of blonanserin leads to dopamine supersensitivity. Following oral treatment with blonanserin (0.78 mg/kg) or haloperidol (1.1 mg/kg) twice daily for 28 days, the dopamine D2 agonist quinpirole-induced hyperlocomotion test and a dopamine D2 receptor binding assay were conducted. We found that haloperidol significantly enhanced both quinpirole-induced hyperlocomotion and striatal dopamine D2 receptor density in rats. On the other hand, repeated administration of blonanserin had no effect on either locomotor activity or striatal dopamine D2 receptor density. Further, our results show that mRNA levels of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors in several brain regions were unaffected by repeated administration of both agents. In addition, we examined the effect of the dopamine D3 receptor antagonist PG-01037 on development of dopamine supersensitivity induced by chronic haloperidol treatment and showed that PG-01037 prevents the development of supersensitivity to quinpirole in chronic haloperidol-treated rats. Given the higher affinity of blonanserin at dopamine D3 receptors than haloperidol, antagonism of blonanserin at dopamine D3 receptors may play a role in lack of dopamine supersensitivity after chronic administration. The present findings suggest long-term treatment with antipsychotic dose of blonanserin may be unlikely to lead to dopamine supersensitivity."}

Though the associated dose-dependent ototoxicity is known, the cellular mechanisms by which cochleovestibular hair cell death occur are not well understood. We have previously shown that aminoglycoside ototoxicity is mediated in part by cytosolic protein synthesis inhibition. Despite a lack of molecular similarity, aminoglycosides were shown to elicit similar stress pathways to cisplatin. We therefore reasoned that there may be some role of protein synthesis inhibition in cisplatin ototoxicity. Employing a modification of the bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) method, we evaluated the effects of cisplatin on cellular protein synthesis. We show that cisplatin inhibits cellular protein synthesis in organ of Corti explant cultures. Similar to what was found after gentamicin exposure, cisplatin activates both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. In contrast to aminoglycosides, cisplatin also inhibits protein synthesis in all cochlear cell types. We further demonstrate that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib completely prevents JNK activation, while providing only moderate hair cell protection. Simultaneous stimulation of cellular protein synthesis by insulin, however, significantly improved hair cell survival in culture. The presented data provides evidence for a potential role of protein synthesis inhibition in cisplatin-mediated ototoxicity."}

Insoluble PrPres tends to aggregate into amyloid fibrils. The anthracycline 4'-iodo-4'-deoxy-doxorubicin (IDX) binds to amyloid fibrils and induces amyloid resorption in patients with systemic amyloidosis. To test IDX in an experimental model of prion disease, Syrian hamsters were inoculated intracerebrally either with scrapie-infected brain homogenate or with infected homogenate coincubated with IDX. In IDX-treated hamsters, clinical signs of disease were delayed and survival time was prolonged. Neuropathological examination showed a parallel delay in the appearance of brain changes and in the accumulation of PrPres and PrP amyloid."}

It is toxic to neurons, but the mechanism for its action remains largely unknown. Here, we have identified a novel death-inducing protein, Abeta-related DIP (AB-DIP), by two-hybrid screening of the human brain cDNA library and confirmed the binding of Abeta with AB-DIP by coimmunoprecipitation. Overexpression of AB-DIP-induced cell death and coexpression of Abeta enhanced the cell death. During apoptosis, the 97-kDa AB-DIP was cleaved to a 62-kDa protein (AB-DIP p62) at the caspase cleavage site, LEKD. It is more important that cotransfection of Abeta with AB-DIP produced the AB-DIP p62 fragment. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of AB-DIP protein expression significantly protected neuroblastoma cells from Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. AB-DIP may mediate the neurotoxicity of Abeta, and therefore, AB-DIP may be a potential, therapeutic target for AD."}

The aim of the study is to examine the effect of SUN C8079, a newly synthesized NF-kappaB inhibitor in vitro and in vivo.	We examined the effects of SUN C8079 on the transcriptional responses of NF-kappaB, on activation of NF-kappaB in electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and on the gene expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and iNOS. We also studied effects of SUN C8079 on lethal endotoxemia and viral myocarditis in mice.	SUN C8079 inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of the genes of TNF-alpha and iNOS by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB in vitro. SUN C8079 inhibited the systemic release of TNF-alpha and improved mortality in LPS-treated mice. In addition to protecting mice against lethal endotoxemia, SUN C8079 prevented the development of myocarditis due to the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and inhibited the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and the iNOS gene in cardiac tissues.	These findings suggest that the activation of NF-kappaB plays an important role in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia and viral myocarditis, and that the NF-kappaB inhibitor, SUN C8079, may be therapeutic in these disorders."}

Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is an important neurotrophic factor for the regeneration of the spinal neuraxial bundle, but GDNF would degrade rapidly if the protein was injected into the site of injury; thus, it cannot exert its fullest effects. Therefore, we introduced a delivery system of GDNF, poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) delayed-release microspheres, in the current study and observed the effect of PLGA-GDNF and the combination of PLGA-GDNF and another 2 agents PLGA-chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) and PLGA-Nogo A antibody in the treatment of SCI rats. Our results showed that PLGA-GDNF and the combination of chABC, GDNF, and Nogo A antibody microspheres could elevate the locomotor scores of SCI rats. The effect of PLGA-GDNF was much better than that of GDNF. The cortical somatosensory evoked potential was also improved by PLGA-GDNF and the combination of chABC, GDNF, and Nogo A antibody microspheres. Our results suggest that PLGA delayed-release microsphere may be a useful and effective tool in delivering protein agents into the injury sites of patients with SCI. This novel combination therapy may provide a new idea in promoting the functional recovery of the damaged spinal cord."}

However, recent studies using intact animals indicate that benserazide acts also in the central nervous system. We determined the influence of benserazide on the central AADC activity in rats with dopaminergic denervation and observed changes in extracellular dopamine (DA) levels after benserazide and L-DOPA administration. First, using in vivo microdialysis technique, we measured extracellular DA levels in the striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats treated with benserazide and L-DOPA. Second, we measured AADC activity in the striatal tissues after benserazide administration. Although administration of 5, 10 and 50 mg/kg benserazide to 6-OHDA-lesioned rats showed an identical increase in exogenous L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA levels, the time to reach the peak DA levels were significantly prolonged by benserazide dose-dependently. The AADC activity in the denervated striatal tissues showed a significant decrease by 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg benserazide. These results suggest that benserazide reduces the central AADC activity in the striatum of rats with nigrostriatal denervation, which leads to changes in the metabolism of exogenous L-DOPA. Central activity of AADC inhibitors should be taken into consideration when they are used both in experimental and clinical studies on Parkinson's disease."}
