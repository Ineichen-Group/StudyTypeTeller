Participants were 18-65 years old and recruited from 17 clinics at 4 different sites to participate in a randomized controlled trial for anxiety disorders, which compared the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention (consisting of CBT, medication, or both) with usual care. Of those participants who were randomized to the intervention arm and selected CBT (either alone or in combination with medication), 85 were Latino and 251 were non-Latino White; the majority of the Latino participants received the CBT intervention in English (n = 77). Blinded assessments of clinical improvement and functioning were administered at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline. Measures of engagement, including attendance, homework adherence, understanding of CBT principles, and commitment to treatment, were assessed weekly during the CBT intervention.	Findings from propensity-weighted linear and logistic regression models revealed no statistically significant differences between Latinos and non-Latino Whites on symptom measures of clinical improvement and functioning at almost all time points. There were significant differences on 2 of 7 engagement outcomes, namely, number of sessions attended and patients' understanding of CBT principles.	These findings suggest that CBT can be an effective treatment approach for Latinos who are primarily English speaking and likely more acculturated, although continued attention should be directed toward engaging Latinos in such interventions."}

Most mutations of PDC are localized in the alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. We have kinetically characterized a patient's missense mutation alphaH44R in E1alpha by creating and purifying three recombinant human E1s (alphaH44R, alphaH44Q, and alphaH44A). Substitutions at histidine-15 resulted in decreased V(max) values (6% alphaH44R; 30% alphaH44Q; 90% alphaH44A) while increasing K(m) values for thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) compared to wild-type (alphaH44R, 3-fold; alphaH44Q, 7-fold; alphaH44A, 10-fold). This suggests that the volume of the residue at site 15 is important for TPP binding and substitution by a residue with a longer side chain disrupts the active site more than the TPP binding site. The rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of alphaH44R E1 by E1-kinase and phospho-E1 phosphatase, respectively, were similar to that of the wild-type E1 protein. These results provide a biochemical basis for altered E1 function in the alphaH44R E1 patient."}

The risk of SUDEP increases according to the frequency and severity of uncontrolled seizures; therefore, SUDEP risk is higher in patients with refractory epilepsy (RE), in whom most antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are ineffective for both seizure control and SUDEP prevention. Consequently, RE and SUDEP share a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, which is mainly associated with brain overexpression of ABC-transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The activity of P-gp can also contribute to membrane depolarization and affect the normal function of neurons and cardiomyocytes. Other molecular regulators of membrane potential are the inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir), whose genetic variants have been related to both epilepsy and heart dysfunctions. Although it has been suggested that dysfunctions of the cardiac, respiratory, and brainstem arousal systems are the causes of SUDEP, the molecular basis for explaining its dysfunctions remain unknown. In rats, repetitive seizures or status epilepticus induced high expression of P-gp and loss Kir expression in the brain and heart, and promoted membrane depolarization, malignant bradycardia, and the high rate of mortality. Here we reviewed clinical and experimental evidences suggesting that abnormal expression of depolarizing/repolarizing factors as P-gp and Kir could favor persistent depolarization of membranes without any rapid functional recovery capacity. This condition induced by convulsive stress could be the molecular mechanism leading to acquired severe bradycardia, as an ineffective heart response generating the appropriate scenario for SUDEP development.

Immune abnormalities have been found in the central nervous system by pathological studies and also in the blood and CSF of subjects with ALS. Inflammation and immune abnormalities are also found in animals with a model of ALS due to mutations in the SOD1 gene.

However, the same test may be used for measuring QoL, well-being or health status in different studies. QoL has been defined as the subjective appraisal of one's current life based primarily on psychological function. The most important in the appraisal of well-being is mental function and concerning health status patients evaluate physical function as most important. To differentiate the effects of GH replacement on psychological variables in patients with GHD we carried out a number of meta-analyses, classifying questionnaires into instruments measuring QoL, psychological well-being and health status.	We searched the electronic databases PUBMED and PiCarta from 1985 to 2004. Studies were included that evaluated the effect of GH on patient-reported outcomes in adults with GHD (aged 18 years and above). According to generally accepted definitions we classified the questionnaires as instruments measuring QoL, well-being and health status. By means of meta-analyses the average effect size (d) for QoL, well-being and health status was calculated.	Based on open studies GH replacement is found to improve QoL with a small effect size (d = 0.18), well-being with a medium effect size (d = 0.47) and health status with a small effect size (d = 0.26). As the effect size of well-being is most pronounced the generally reported effects of GH replacement on QoL may be overestimated and actually reflect the effect on well-being.	To get more insight in the specific psychological effects of GH treatment it is recommended that instruments selected for these studies should be more consistently classified as instruments measuring QoL, well-being or health status."}

Injection of human tumour cells into the internal carotid artery of syngeneic or nude mice produces experimental metastases in specific regions of the brain; these are not due to patterns of initial cell arrest, motility, or invasiveness, but rather to the ability of metastatic tumour cells to grow. Whether the progressive growth of brain metastases depends on neovascularisation is not clear. Immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses show that the density of blood vessels within experimental metastases in the brains of nude mice, or within brain metastases derived from human lung cancer, is lower than in the adjacent, tumour-free brain parenchyma. However, blood vessels associated with brain metastases are dilated and contain many dividing endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis also reveals that tumour cells located less than 100 microm from a blood vessel are viable, whereas more distant tumour cells undergo apoptosis. The blood-brain barrier is intact in and around experimental brain metastases smaller than 0.25 mm in diameter, but is leaky in larger metastases. Nevertheless, the lesions are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The way in which the brain microenvironment influences the biological behaviour of tumour cells is a subject of intense investigation."}

Previously, we found that intravenous administration of the synthetic tetrapeptide Acetyl-His-Ala-Glu-Glu-Amide (HAEE), which is an analogue of the 35-38 region of the α4 subunit of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and specifically binds to the 11-14 site of Aβ, reduced the development of cerebral amyloidogenesis in a mouse model of AD. In the current study on three types of laboratory animals, we determined the biodistribution and tissue localization patterns of HAEE peptide after single intravenous bolus administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters of HAEE were established using uniformly tritium-labeled HAEE. Pharmacokinetic data provided evidence that HAEE goes through the blood-brain barrier. Based on molecular modeling, a role of LRP1 in receptor-mediated transcytosis of HAEE was proposed. Altogether, the results obtained indicate that the anti-amyloid effect of HAEE, previously found in a mouse model of AD, most likely occurs due to its interaction with Aβ species directly in the brain."}

Previous research has supported the model that people tend initially to look for external or environmental explanations for bodily sensations (normalizing attributions) and only if this process fails do they search for attributions internal to themselves (somatic or psychological attributions). This study tested two hypotheses about frequent general practice attenders: (1) compared with others, they are more likely to make somatic attributions and less likely to make normalizing ones; and (2) given a bodily symptom together with a somatic explanation, frequent attenders will have greater difficulty than others in finding reasons why the given (pathological) explanation is untrue. The frequent attenders' group had themselves initiated an average of 12 general practice visits in the 12 months before assessment, while a control group of infrequent attenders had not made appointments to see their general practitioner for an average of 24 months. The results provide partial support for the hypotheses. Frequent attenders generated significantly fewer normalizing explanations for a series of common bodily sensations than the comparison group, although the two groups did not differ in their somatic attributions. Given a common bodily sensation and an accompanying pathological explanation, the frequent attenders were less able than the control group to generate reasons why the given explanation might be untrue.

The development of stereotactic radiation therapy, using gamma knife, linear accelerators or proton beam based methods, has enabled selective radiation delivery to the target while minimizing exposure of healthy tissues. In patients whose tumors are sufficiently distant from the optic apparatus, stereotactic radiation therapy can be delivered in a single session, a procedure termed radiosurgery, which significantly improves patient convenience.	Original articles on radiation therapy in Cushing's disease, published during the past 12 months (2013-2014), were identified and pertinent data extracted.	Recent studies have reported on the outcomes of patients with Cushing's disease who received mostly stereotactic radiation therapy. While tumor control has been excellent, biochemical remission was less consistently achieved. Some studies suggested that stereotactic radiation may lead to biochemical remission faster than conventional radiation therapy. In addition, retrospective data have suggested that withdrawing medical therapy around the time stereotactic radiation therapy is administered might lead to a faster biochemical response. Regardless of the radiation therapy method, biochemical recurrences may develop and these patients are at long-term risk of developing anterior hypopituitarism and require lifelong periodic endocrine follow-up. Other, less frequent complications may include cranial neuropathies, secondary tumor formation or temporal lobe necrosis. It is plausible that complications may be less frequent after stereotactic radiation therapy, but this requires confirmation.

Intact (I), ovariectomized (OVX), and OVX + 17 beta-estradiol (E50) rats were subjected to 30 min of forebrain ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. Using the platelet activation marker P-selectin, postischemic platelet reactivity was quantified by flow cytometry. In a separate cohort (I, OVX, E50), the authors quantified platelet eNOS by Western blot. Another cohort (OVX, E50) was subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, and cerebral blood flow was determined using the iodoantipyrine technique. Collagen-stimulated platelet P-selectin expression was increased in the OVX rats at 60 min of reperfusion, and this effect was reversed by estrogen treatment. No differences in platelet eNOS expression were detected among groups. Cerebral blood flow at 60 min reperfusion was comparable between the OVX and the E50 rats. The authors conclude that during reper-fusion, estrogen deficiency increases postischemic platelet sensitivity to stimuli in estrogen-deficient rats. Estrogen treatment mitigates effects of estrogen loss on platelets, but this early effect is apparently not caused by intraplatelet eNOS depression. Neither estrogen deficiency nor estrogen treatment changes early postischemic regional brain blood flow. In this rodent global cerebral ischemic model, physiologic doses of estrogen are not deleterious to platelet reactivity and may initially reduce postischemic platelet reactivity."}

FindMyApps is a tablet intervention consisting of a selection tool to help people with dementia find usable apps for self-management and meaningful activities, including training to support informal carers in employing errorless learning principles to help people with dementia learn tablet and tool usage.	We conducted an exploratory, pilot randomized controlled trial with a mixed-methods design. Twenty persons with mild dementia and carer dyads were randomly assigned to the FindMyApps group (n = 10), receiving either the FindMyApps training and selection tool, or a control condition (n = 10), receiving only a short tablet training. Pre- and post-test measurements at a three month follow-up, consisted of questionnaires and post-test semi-structured interviews.	The FindMyApps tool was mostly perceived as useful and easy to use. Persons with dementia were generally able to learn how to use the tool, though they regularly needed support from informal carers. Persons with dementia found apps through the tool, which they used regularly. Persons with dementia and informal carers were positive about the training and support they received. No significant differences were found on outcome measures of persons with dementia, but based on effect sizes FindMyApps is a promising intervention.	Qualitative results indicate that the FindMyApps intervention has the potential to positively influence the self-management abilities and engagement in meaningful activities of people with dementia. Remarks are made to improve the intervention and recommendations are given for future effectiveness studies.Implications for rehabilitationThe person-centred tablet intervention FindMyApps has the potential to positively influence the self-management and engagement in meaningful activities in people with dementia.Based on the input of persons with dementia and informal carers, the FindMyApps intervention and study procedure will be further improved and evaluated in terms of effectiveness in an RCT."}

The resulting HSD10 (p.R130C) loses most or all catalytic functions, and the males with this mutation have a much more severe clinical phenotype than those carrying p.V65A, p.L122V, or p.E249Q mutations. We found that the mutated cytosine which is +2259 nucleotide from the ATG of the gene, is >90% methylated in both the active and inactive X chromosomes in two normal females as well as in the X chromosome of a normal male. Since 5-methylcytosine is prone to conversion to thymine by deamination, the methylation of this cytosine in normal X chromosomes provides an explanation for the prevalence of the p.R130C mutation among patients with HSD10 deficiency. The substitution of arginine for cysteine eliminates several hydrogen bonds and reduces the van der Waals interaction between HSD10 subunits. The resulting disruption of protein structure impairs some if not all of the catalytic and non-enzymatic functions of HSD10. A meta-analysis of residual HSD10 activity in eight patients with the p.R130C mutation showed an average 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (MHBD) activity of only 6 (±5) % of the normal control level. This is significantly lower than in cells of patients with other, clinically milder mutations and suggests that the loss of HSD10/MHBD activity is a marker for the disorder."}

While the condition has been well described in patients with acute hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, post-transplantation and chemotherapy, RPLS has been increasingly identified in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Though experience in the diagnosis and management of RPLS in patients with SLE is likely accumulating, few have systematically worked out the strategy to distinguish RPLS from neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) and lupus-related complications of the central nervous system (CNS). Prompt recognition of, and differentiation between, these conditions is essential since their clinical presentations substantially overlap and yet their management strategy and subsequent outcomes can be entirely different. Indeed, inappropriate treatment such as augmentation of immunosuppression may be detrimental to patients with RPLS. A high index of suspicion of RPLS, prompt magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, including diffusion imaging, exclusion of CNS infection and metabolic derangement, a comprehensive medication review accompanied by timely and aggressive control of blood pressure and seizure are keys to successful management of RPLS. Such treatment strategy ensures a very high chance of total neurological recovery in lupus patients with RPLS."}

However, the association between diabetes duration and the prognosis of stroke remains uncertain. We aimed to characterize whether an association exists between diabetes duration and stroke outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).	Between 2015 and 2018, 14,674 patients with ischemic stroke or TIA within 7 days and older than 18 years from the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III) were included in this analysis. Diabetes duration at baseline was collected by face-to-face interviews and further categorized into groups of without diabetes, diabetes < 4, 4 to <8 and ≥8 years. The association between diabetes duration and clinical outcomes, including stroke recurrence, poor function outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6), and all-cause mortality at the 1-year follow-up after stroke onset, was evaluated by a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model, competing risk model and logistic regression model with adjustment for demographic and clinical features.	Among the 14,674 patients included, the average age was 62.0 years, and 68.5% were male. There were 1419 (9.7%) patients who had stroke recurrence, 1912 (13.0%) who had poor function outcome, and 478 (3.3%) who had all-cause mortality at the 1-year follow-up. After adjusting for potential covariates, a diabetes duration ≥8 years was associated with an increased risk of 1-year stroke recurrence (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.64; p = .02) in comparison to those without Diabetes mellitus. Using a competing risk regression model, a diabetes duration ≥8 years was a significant risk factor for stroke recurrence (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53). In contrast, there was no significant association between diabetes duration < 4, 4 to <8 years and clinical outcomes.	Long-term diabetes duration (≥8 years), but not short-term diabetes duration, was associated with an increased risk of 1-year stroke recurrence in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA."}

Five patients underwent GKRS for their pituitary adenomas. Other treatment modalities included transsphenoidal resection and conservative management. Comparisons were made between treatment groups and between those with Cushing disease versus those with a nonfunctioning adenoma by the use of psychometric tests of general intellectual functioning, memory, and current mood state. These tests were the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised, Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, Wechsler Memory Scale-third edition, selected subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-third edition, and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System.	When analyzed collectively, the patient group showed deficits in immediate memory (t=-2.70, P=0.02) and high levels of psychological distress (46% of patients) in the presence of intact general intellectual functioning.

We examined which secretory pathway trypsinogen takes to the surface of this endocrine-derived cell line. The 'constitutive' pathway externalizes proteins rapidly and in the absence of an external stimulus. In the alternate, 'regulated' pathway, proteins are stored in secretory granules until the cells are stimulated to secrete with 8-Br-cAMP. On the basis of indirect immunofluorescence localization, stimulation of release, and subcellular fractionation, we find that trypsinogen is targeted into the regulated secretory pathway in AtT-20 cells. In contrast, laminin, an endogenous secretory glycoprotein, is shown to be secreted constitutively. Thus it appears that the transport apparatus for the regulated secretory pathway in endocrine cells can recognize not only endocrine prohormones, but also the exocrine protein trypsinogen, which suggests that a similar sorting mechanism is used by endocrine and exocrine cells."}

In the United States (US) each year, 170 million adults participate in physical recreational activities, and 38 million children and adolescents participate in organized sports. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that in this group ~1.6 to 3.8 million concussions occur annually. Recent class-action lawsuits in the US filed by professional athletes against their respective leagues allege negligence in protecting them from concussions, and this has contributed to the attention received in the popular media. In response, concussion-related publications have increased exponentially during the past several years. Recent studies have challenged earlier assumptions that the effects of concussion are transient. Stronger links between concussion and neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease-like conditions, depression, and heightened risk for suicide are being elucidated. In this article, we explore the current knowledge on concussion, including pathophysiology, management, and long-term effects. We conclude that more evidence-based results regarding guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and return to play (RTP) are needed and should be the focus of future investigations. Attributing the etiology of certain neurodegenerative conditions to a history of concussion has been suggested in the current literature, but additional quantitative data regarding the pathophysiology and causality are needed as well. Bioengineers can have an important role in measuring the dynamic forces encountered during head impacts and their effects on the brain. These results can be effective in designing better helmets as well as improved playing surfaces to reduce the impact of such injuries. At this time, we believe that groups of people with heightened risk for concussion should be followed closely during longer periods of time and compared to matched controls. Such long-term studies are urgently needed to develop appropriate guidelines for safety and protect our young and adult athletes in the future."}

However, associations between family-level variables (maternal hostility, maternal depressive symptoms) and child behaviors (developmental course of ADHD and aggression) may be explained by genes that are shared by biologically related parents and children. Furthermore, ADHD symptoms and aggression commonly co-occur: it is important to consider both simultaneously to have a better understanding of processes underlying the developmental course of ADHD and aggression. To addresses these issues, we employed a longitudinal genetically sensitive parent-offspring adoption design. Analyses were conducted using Cohort I (n = 340) of the Early Growth and Development Study with cross-validation analyses conducted with Cohort II (n = 178). Adoptive mother hostility, but not depression, was associated with later child ADHD symptoms and aggression. Mothers and their adopted children were genetically unrelated, removing passive rGE as a possible explanation. Early child impulsivity/activation was associated with later ADHD symptoms and aggression. Child impulsivity/activation was also associated with maternal hostility, with some evidence for evocative gene-environment correlation processes on adoptive mother depressive symptoms.

MK-801 (dizocilpine) binds to the same hydrophobic channel domain in the NMDA receptor-associated ionophore as PCP, and has been shown to elicit intense irregular episodes of jumping behavior in mice, termed 'popping.' MK-801-elicited mouse popping is an animal model of NMDA receptor hypofunction that has been used to screen novel candidate compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia. Recently, a selective abnormality in the transduction of the acetylcholine signal at the level of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor has been described in schizophrenia. The existence of a nicotinic cholinergic abnormality in schizophrenia has stimulated interest in a potential therapeutic role for positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic receptors. Galantamine is a compound that possesses two interesting properties: inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic neurotransmission. Theoretically, galantamine would be expected to increase the efficiency or likelihood that acetylcholine will promote channel opening and ionic conductance at nicotinic receptors. As expected, in the current investigation statistically significant popping behavior was elicited by MK-801 in mice (T(22) = 2.16, P < 0.05). This MK-801-elicited popping was significantly attenuated by 100 mg/kg of galantamine (T(22) = 2.24, P < 0.05). The data show that nicotinic interventions can influence NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the intact mouse."}

In many cases paediatricians are the first point of contact. In order to increase recognition rates, screening instruments may be a helpful support for health care professionals. However, there is a lack of valid and economical screening instruments for primary care patients. Thus, the aim of the study was the development of the new Depression Screener for Teenagers (DesTeen) and its validation in a paediatric sample.	326 patients between 13 and 16 years old completed the DesTeen and a diagnostic interview, serving as gold standard. Prevalence rate for any depressive disorder (minor depression, major depression and dysthymia) was 12.6%. Psychometric properties were calculated. For validity measures, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for any depressive disorder and the diagnostic subgroups was computed.	DesTeen showed a high reliability (Cronbach's α=.87) and a high validity (AUC=.91). For the diagnostic subgroups AUC values did not significantly differ from overall accuracy of any depressive disorder (major depression: AUC=.95, p=.179; dysthymia: AUC=.88, p=.605; minor depression: AUC=.87, p=.327). The optimal cut-off point for any depressive disorder according to the Youden-Index yielded a sensitivity of .90 and a specificity of .80. An abbreviated 5-item version of DesTeen showed no loss in validity (AUC=.90, p=.695).	Overall, DesTeen can be regarded as a valid screening instrument for adolescent paediatric patients. For practical use, the 5-item version is even more promising. A replication of these results is essential."}

We hypothesized that low rates of lithium efflux (a potential manifestation of strong transport inhibition) would be associated with better clinical outcome of maintenance pharmacotherapy. We measured the erythrocyte (RBC) apparent rate constant for lithium efflux (kexch) in 22 patients with bipolar disorder who had been euthymic on lithium for 1 month. Subsequently, clinical mood ratings and in vivo RBC: plasma lithium ratios (LiR) were determined monthly. Outcome was categorized according to whether subjects completed 1 year of successful maintenance treatment (n = 10), experienced a recurrent affective episode (n = 8), or dropped out (n = 4). The kexch at the outset of the study was significantly lower (potentially because of greater transport inhibition) in 1-year completers than in patients with recurrences or those who dropped out (median kexch = 0.09, 0.24, and 0.27 h-1, respectively; P < .03). Moreover, 77% of patients with a kexch of 0.11 h-1 or lower were successfully maintained on lithium for 1 year, whereas only 23% of those with a kexch greater than or equal to 0.12 h-1 had a successful treatment outcome. LiR measured during the course of maintenance treatment was significantly higher (suggesting greater transport inhibition) in 1-year completers than in noncompleters (recurrences and dropouts). Measurement of kexch at an early point in treatment may provide a means for prospectively identifying those bipolar patients at greater risk for failure of maintenance lithium therapy."}

Two cross-sectional surveys 20 years apart.	The surveys were performed at two Norwegian medical faculties in 1993 and 2015.	One hundred and seventy-four first-year medical students in 1993 were compared with 169 students in 2015.	Mental distress (Hopkins Symptom Checklist 5) and Mental Health Problems in Need of Treatment.	Mental distress increased from 1993 to 2015 (p<0.001) due to a larger increase among female students, which seemed to be of clinical importance (Cohen's d=0.63). There was a significant gender difference in mental distress in 2015 (p=0.007), but not in 1993. Independent factors associated with mental distress in 2015 were female sex (p<0.001), low perceived social support from parents (p=0.023) and low perceived social support from other friends (p=0.048). Additional analyses showed that social support from friends was more important for female students than for their male peers. From 1993 to 2015, there was no significant increase in the proportion of female students reporting previous mental health problems in need of treatment (21.3% vs 27.8%), but we found a significant increase in help-seeking among those in need of treatment over these years from 30.0% (6/20) to 74.3% (26/35; p=0.003).	We found a significant increase in mental distress among female medical students over the past 20 years, but also a promising increase in help-seeking among those in need of treatment. The strong and important association between low social support and mental distress should urge both universities and students to maintain students' social life after entering medical school."}

As the aged population increases, incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias will also increase. Professionals agree that early intervention is essential for therapeutic and quality of life purposes; however, many older adults wait several months or years to seek medical help after first noticing signs of cognitive impairment. The present study sought to identify the predictors of help-seeking for cognitive impairment by an individual for him/herself after the first detection of symptoms.Method: An online survey was administered to adults (N = 250) 50 years old and older. Individuals responded about their help-seeking intentions in response to a hypothetical vignette depicting symptoms of cognitive decline derived from a similar study with caregivers conducted by Qualls and colleagues. Additional standardized measures measuring constructs such as knowledge of Alzheimer's disease were completed.Results: The present study reveals that cognitive (i.e. symptom identification and disease attribution) and affective (i.e. symptom impact and threat appraisal) factors, as well as an interaction between the two, are predictive of help-seeking intentions with excellent model fit.Conclusion: Help-seeking intentions by individuals with possible cognitive impairment are comparable to those of potential caregivers. Contrary to hypotheses, high threat appraisal positively predicted help-seeking intentions despite the expectation that threat-induced fear would lead to avoidance. Recommendations are made for future research to further investigate both patients' help-seeking intentions and actions in response to signs of cognitive impairment.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1910791 ."}

This paper discusses a nutritional knowledge and attitudes survey conducted as part of a larger project focused on improving nutritional intake of people with dementia within a residential care facility in Brisbane, Australia.	The specific aims of the survey were to identify (i) knowledge of the nutritional needs of aged care facility residents; (ii) mealtime practices; and (iii) attitudes towards mealtime practices and organisation.	A survey based on those used in other healthcare settings was completed by 76 staff members. The survey included questions about nutritional knowledge, opinions of the food service, frequency of feeding assistance provided and feeding assessment practices.	Nutritional knowledge scores ranged from 1 to 9 of a possible 10, with a mean score of 4.67. While 76% of respondents correctly identified risk factors associated with malnutrition in nursing home residents, only 38% of participants correctly identified the need for increased protein and energy in residents with pressure ulcers, and just 15% exhibited correct knowledge of fluid requirements. Further, while nutritional assessment was considered an important part of practice by 83% of respondents, just 53% indicated that they actually carried out such assessments. Identified barriers to promoting optimal nutrition included insufficient time to observe residents (56%); being unaware of residents' feeding issues (46%); poor knowledge of nutritional assessments (44%); and unappetising appearance of food served (57%).	An important step towards improving health and quality of life for residents of aged care facilities would be to enhance staff nutritional awareness and assessment skills. This should be carried out through increased attention to both preservice curricula and on-the-job training.	The residential facility staff surveyed demonstrated low levels of nutrition knowledge, which reflects findings from the international literature. This has implications for the provision of responsive care to residents of these facilities and should be explored further."}

La Crosse virus (LACV) from the Bunyavirales order is responsible for pediatric encephalitis cases in the United States, yet little is known about the infectivity of LACV. Given the structural similarities between class II fusion glycoproteins of LACV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus from the Togaviridae family, we hypothesized that LACV would share similar entry mechanisms with CHIKV. To test this hypothesis, we performed cholesterol-depletion and repletion assays and used cholesterol-modulating compounds to study LACV entry and replication. We found that LACV entry was cholesterol dependent, while replication was less affected by cholesterol manipulation. In addition, we generated single-point mutants in the LACV Gc ij loop that corresponded to known CHIKV residues important for virus entry. We found that a conserved histidine and alanine residue in the Gc ij loop impaired virus infectivity and attenuated LACV replication in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we took an evolution-based approach to explore how the LACV glycoprotein evolves in mosquitoes and mice. We found multiple variants that cluster in the Gc glycoprotein head domain, providing evidence for the Gc glycoprotein as a contributor to LACV adaptation. Together, these results begin to characterize the mechanisms of LACV infectivity and how the LACV glycoprotein contributes to replication and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Vector-borne viruses are significant health threats that lead to devastating disease worldwide. The emergence of arboviruses, in addition to the lack of effective antivirals or vaccines, highlights the need to study how arboviruses replicate at the molecular level. One potential antiviral target is the class II fusion glycoprotein. Alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and bunyaviruses encode a class II fusion glycoprotein that contains strong structural similarities at the tip of domain II. Here, we show that the bunyavirus La Crosse virus uses a cholesterol-dependent entry pathway similar to the alphavirus chikungunya virus, and residues in the ij loop are important for virus infectivity in vitro and replication in mice. These studies show that genetically diverse viruses may use similar pathways through conserved structure domains, suggesting that these viruses may be targets for broad-spectrum antivirals in multiple arboviral families."}

One proposed phenotype is impaired inhibitory gating of the auditory evoked potential to repeated stimuli. Normally, the amplitude of the P50 response to the second stimulus is significantly less than the response to the first, but this gating of response is generally impaired in schizophrenia. Clinically unaffected individuals within a pedigree who have both an ancestral and descendant history of schizophrenia may be useful for studying whether this physiological defect is a possible alternative phenotype. We have studied inhibitory gating of the auditory P50 response to pairs of auditory stimuli in 17 nuclear families. In 11, there was one parent who had another relative with a chronic psychotic illness, in addition to the schizophrenic proband. All of the parents with family histories of schizophrenia had gating of the P50 response similar to their schizophrenia offspring, whereas only 7% of the parents without family history had gating of the P50 response in the abnormal range. These results support loss of gating of the auditory P50 wave as an inherited deficit related to schizophrenia and suggest that studies of parents may help elucidate the neurobiological expression of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia."}

The incidence of RHD, double valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and mitral valve vegetation was significantly higher in the stroke group than in the non-stroke group (p = 0.045, 0.000, 0.033, and 0.045, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratios (ORs) for RHD, double valve replacement, and fungal infection as risk factors of stroke were 7.26 (95% CI: 1.23-42.68), 25.60 (95%CI: 4.33-126.16), and 20.58 (95% CI: 2.13-198.82), respectively, and were statistically significant. Eight patients died during hospitalization and the in-hospital mortality was 12.90%. The OR for in-hospital mortality with concurrent stroke was 5.13 (95% CI: 1.08-24.46, p = 0.028).	Stroke is a common complication in PVE that increases patient mortality. Rheumatic heart disease, double valve replacement, and fungal infection may be risk factors for patients with PVE complicated by stroke."}

The main objective of this pilot study was to clearly identify the number of factors present in the SIB and to analyze the relationships between the different cognitive domains explored by the SIB and loss of autonomy. We administered the SIB, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and two scales of dependency to 48 patients with Alzheimer's disease in its late stages. A factorial analysis (Principal Components Analysis) showed a 4-factor solution for the SIB: a cognitive factor, a praxis and visuospatial functions factor, the reactivity to external stimuli factor and the social aptitudes factor. A factorial analysis involving the dependency scales showed a cognitive factor, a dependency and constructional praxis factor, the reactivity to external stimuli factor and the social aptitudes factor. Reactivity to external stimuli and social aptitudes were not significantly correlated to cognitive aspects nor to dependency. The finding of dependency as a factor different from cognitive deterioration suggests that, in setting a treatment strategy for demented patients, attempts should be made to treat dependency in its own right. In addition, since reactivity to external stimuli and social aptitudes are not related to cognitive aspects nor to dependency, these functions should also be encouraged and stimulated."}

Design Cross-sectional studies of carotid artery atherosclerosis in 24,822 Chinese adults from the China Kadoorie Biobank and 2579 Europeans from the UK Biobank. Methods Mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries and presence of carotid artery plaque were examined in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) findings in Chinese (mean age 59 years) were compared with a European population (mean age 62 years). Results Overall, the mean cIMT in Chinese was 0.70 mm (SD 0.16) and increased with age by 0.08 mm (SE 0.008) per 10-years older age. About 31% of the Chinese had carotid plaques and the prevalence varied 10-fold with age (6% at 40-49 to 63% at 70-89 years) and four-fold by region (range, 14%-57%). After adjustment for age, sex and region, plaque prevalence was higher in smokers than in non-smokers (36% vs. 28%) and two-fold higher in individuals with systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg than those with systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg (44% vs. 22%) in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Mean cIMT was similar in the younger Chinese and European adults, but increased more steeply with age in the Chinese (p = 0.002). Conclusions About one-third of Chinese adults had carotid plaques. The rate of progression of carotid atherosclerosis with age was more extreme in the Chinese compared with the European population, highlighting the need for more intensive strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention in China."}

In this study we investigated functional connectivity changes in MS using resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Data from 34 MS patients and 28 age and gender-matched controls was assessed using synchronization likelihood (SL) as a measure of functional interaction strength between brain regions, and graph analysis to characterize topological patterns of connectivity changes. Cognition was assessed using extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Structural measures included brain and lesion volumes, using MRI. Results show SL increases in MS patients in theta, lower alpha and beta bands, with decreases in the upper alpha band. Graph analysis revealed a more regular topology in the lower alpha band in patients, indicated by an increased path length (λ) and clustering coefficient (γ). Attention and working memory domains were impaired, with decreased brain volumes. A stepwise linear regression model using clinical, MRI and MEG parameters as predictors revealed that only increases in lower alpha band γ predicted impaired cognition. Cognitive impairments and related altered connectivity patterns were found to be especially predominant in male patients. These results show specific functional changes in MS as measured with MEG.

We describe our experience of a new system - IMPARTS (Integrating mental and physical: research training and services), which uses validated tools to identify and to monitor the progress of patients who may benefit from psychological intervention. At outpatient clinics, patients used an electronic tablet to complete the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Inclusion of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Data were linked directly to their electronic record to allow the results, with suggestions for treatment, to be reviewed immediately during the consultation. A total of 162 patients were included. Screening showed that referral was required in 28 (17%) with a probable major depressive disorder and 32 (20%) with a general anxiety disorder. Two (1%), who were identified as being at high risk of suicide or self-harm, were referred for immediate psychological assessment.

The disorder is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous. Despite intense research efforts, the response rates of antidepressant treatments are relatively low and the etiology and progression of MDD remain poorly understood. Here we use computational modeling to advance our understanding of MDD. First, we propose a systematic and comprehensive definition of disease states, which is based on a type of mathematical model called a finite-state machine. Second, we propose a dynamical systems model for the progression, or dynamics, of MDD. The model is abstract and combines several major factors (mechanisms) that influence the dynamics of MDD. We study under what conditions the model can account for the occurrence and recurrence of depressive episodes and how we can model the effects of antidepressant treatments and cognitive behavioral therapy within the same dynamical systems model through changing a small subset of parameters. Our computational modeling suggests several predictions about MDD. Patients who suffer from depression can be divided into two sub-populations: a high-risk sub-population that has a high risk of developing chronic depression and a low-risk sub-population, in which patients develop depression stochastically with low probability. The success of antidepressant treatment is stochastic, leading to widely different times-to-remission in otherwise identical patients. While the specific details of our model might be subjected to criticism and revisions, our approach shows the potential power of computationally modeling depression and the need for different type of quantitative data for understanding depression."}

Among the various tissue-derived MSCs, we have isolated human cranial bone-derived MSCs (cMSCs) in our laboratory. In addition, we have focused on simulated microgravity (MG) as a valuable culture environment of MSCs. However, detailed mechanisms underlying functional recovery from transplantation of MSCs cultured under MG conditions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice. Human cMSCs were cultured under 1G and MG conditions, and cMSCs cultured under MG conditions expressed significantly higher messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). In TBI model mice, the transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions (group MG) showed greater motor functional improvement compared with only phosphate-buffered saline administration (group PBS). Moreover, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/b cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) ratio were significantly lower at brain injury sites in mice of group MG than those of group PBS. In addition, an in vitro study showed that the conditioned medium of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions significantly suppressed the cell death of NG108-15 cells exposed to oxidative or inflammatory stress through anti-inflammatory and antiapoptosis effects. These findings demonstrate that culturing cMSCs under simulated MG increases the neuroprotective effects, suggesting that simulated MG cultures may be a useful method for cell-based therapy strategies for CNS diseases."}

CSF analysis showed strong concordance for total α-synuclein content between two TR-FRET assays and, in agreement with a previously characterized 36 h protocol-based ELISA, demonstrated lower α-synuclein levels in PD donors. Critically, the assay suitability for high-throughput screening of siRNA constructs and small molecules aimed at reducing endogenous α-synuclein levels was established and validated. In a small-scale proof of concept compound screen using 384 well plates, signals ranged from <30 to >120% of the mean of vehicle-treated cells for molecules known to lower and increase cellular α-synuclein, respectively. Furthermore, a reverse genetic screen of a kinase-directed siRNA library identified seven genes that modulated α-synuclein protein levels (five whose knockdown increased and two that decreased cellular α-synuclein protein). This provides critical new biological insight into cellular pathways regulating α-synuclein steady-state expression that may help guide further drug discovery efforts. Moreover, we describe an inherent limitation in current α-synuclein oligomer detection methodology, a finding that will direct improvement of future assay design.

Regional and national surveys conducted in China during 1960-1990 focused on severe mental disorders and revealed very low and stable rates of disorders. By contrast, those performed in the last decade, whether psychiatrists or lay interviewers were used, have shown much higher and more 'reliable' rates comparable to those found in high-income countries. This is especially so for depression and anxiety disorders.	Given the sociopolitical turmoil that had previously plagued people in China, the dramatic rise in prevalence estimates of mental disorders in recent years cannot be simply interpreted as a substantive deterioration of mental health following rapid social change. Global and local factors that shape research methodology aimed at showing that mental disorders are common may play an important role in the dramatic increase. Future research in China should move beyond descriptive epidemiology. It should also address policy relevant issues in view of the limited resources available for mental health interventions."}

This is a register-based, retrospective cohort study. Using data from the National Health Insurance Service database, we included the patients who received rehabilitation for stroke from 2006 to 2013. Of the 14,984 patients diagnosed with stroke, 2483 died within 1 year, and 2866 did not receive rehabilitation; hence, they were also excluded. The final sample included 9635 (49.2% men, 50.8% women) patients. After correcting for covariates, the Cox model was used to evaluate the effects of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) on survival. We estimated the independent contribution of each factor to the risk of death from the initiation of rehabilitation. Significant differences in mortality were observed according to age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), income level, and stroke type. Patients with stroke who received both PT and OT had a better long-term prognosis than those who received either treatment alone. Therapy performed by a physical therapist with more than 120 hours of training effectively improved the patients' long-term prognosis. Intensive PT and OT will help improve the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke. This study emphasizes the importance of intensive rehabilitation in these patients."}

An interview-based rating scale, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-heavy drinkers (YBOCS-hd), has been found useful in quantifying this concept in alcohol-dependent individuals. A self-rating scale, the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) has been developed by us as a modification of the YBOCS-hd. The YBOCS-hd showed excellent interrater reliability in our hands. The correlation between the YBOCS-hd and the OCDS total scores obtained on 60 alcohol-dependent individuals was 0.83. The test-retest correlation for the OCDS total score was 0.96, and the obsessive and compulsive subscales test-retest correlations were 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. The internal consistency of the items in the OCDS was high (0.86) and did not improve significantly with removal of individual items. The shared variance between the OCDS scores and alcohol consumption during the period of evaluation was only approximately 20%, indicating that the dimension measured by the scale was somewhat independent of actual drinking. As such, it might act as an independent measure of the 'state of illness' for alcohol-dependent individuals. When used during a prospective 12-week treatment research study, initial results indicate that the OCDS seems to validly measure a dimension of alcohol dependence, because it decreased from baseline during alcohol reduction and increased in relationship to relapse drinking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

The objective of this study was to examine the role of dual sensory loss in the onset and persistence of depression in older persons living in U.K.	The data used in this study was a 2-year, population-based, prospective, observational study of 3782 older adults aged 65 and above selected from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing Waves 1 and 2. Sensory loss in vision and hearing, 8-item CES-D, socio-economic variables, health indicators, and social support were assessed. We calculated the odds ratio for any association between sensory loss and depression.	Vision loss was a consistent predictor of both onset and persistence of depression even after a wide range of covariates had been adjusted, but the association between dual sensory loss and depression disappeared once health indicators were controlled for.	Aged care service practitioners must take this risk factor, visual impairment, into consideration in their preventive intervention and treatment for depression in aged population."}

The question addressed was: is it safe to stop anticoagulants after successful surgery for atrial fibrillation? Altogether, 177 papers were found using the reported search, of which 14 were selected that represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. Selection criteria included study relevance, primary outcome, size of study population and length of follow-up. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The weight of evidence, including over 10,000 patient-years of follow-up, supports the discontinuation of warfarin following atrial fibrillation correction procedures as being safe, with an associated annual thromboembolic stroke rate of 0-3.8% off warfarin, in studies where warfarin was stopped at a mean of 3.6 months (range 0-8 months) after the procedure. However, the confidence of this conclusion suffers from a paucity of high-quality randomized controlled trials in the field, with the main body of evidence coming instead from observational non-randomized studies. The stroke rate also varies with the exact procedure performed; pulmonary vein isolation procedures are the most extensively evaluated and carry the lowest stroke rate following warfarin discontinuation (0-0.4% per annum when performed as an isolated procedure). By contrast, left atrial appendage occlusion by insertion of a transcatheter device has an associated annual stroke rate of 0-3.8% off warfarin. Thus, discontinuation of warfarin following such transcatheter procedures cannot be recommended at this time. Concomitant heart surgeries, such as mitral valve repair have been shown to increase the thromboembolic rate both unpredictably and dramatically, and this review thus identifies concomitant mitral valve surgery as a potentially substantial risk factor for late thromboembolic stroke in patients undergoing corrective surgeries for atrial fibrillation. This review finds in favour of warfarin discontinuation in selected patients at three months post-procedure, emphasizing consideration of the patient's individual risk-factor profile as paramount. This recommendation is in line with the 2010 guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation produced by the European Society of Cardiology."}

Activated microglia are widely believed to be the principal source of inflammation-induced neuronal degeneration in these disorders. To investigate the neurotoxic potential of human astrocytes, we exposed them and human astrocytic U-373 MG cells to a variety of inflammatory stimulants. We then assessed the effects of their supernatants on human SH-SY5 cells. When astrocytes and U-373 MG cells were stimulated with interferon (IFN)-gamma (150U/ml), their supernatants significantly reduced SH-SY5Y cell viability. Other powerful inflammatory stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide (0.5mug/ml), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (10ng/ml) and interleukin-1beta (10ng/ml), alone or in combination, were without effect. These combinations were also unable to enhance the IFN-gamma effect. The induced cytotoxicities were reversed by JAK inhibitor I, a potent and specific inhibitor of JAKs. This result indicates that the neurotoxic effect was proceeding through the IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR)-JAK-STAT intracellular pathway. To establish that the IFNGR is expressed on both cultured astrocytes and U-373 MG cells, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA extracts to identify a specific IFNGR product. We showed the protein product on these cultured cells by immunocytochemistry using an antibody to IFNGR. Finally, using human postmortem material, we showed sharp upregulation of the IFNGR on activated astrocytes in affected areas in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. These findings suggest that activated astrocytes may become neurotoxic when stimulated by IFN-gamma and may therefore exacerbate the pathology in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases."}

LEV had no significant effect on the appearance of dyskinesia when administered de novo in combination with l-dopa. However, after a week of drug holiday, the 2 groups exhibited a different response to an acute l-dopa challenge. Thus, animals previously treated with l-dopa alone exhibited a similar level of dyskinesia to that seen on day 21 of the repeated treatment phase of the study. However, animals previously treated with l-dopa/LEV demonstrated significantly reduced dyskinesia compared with day 21 of the repeated treatment phase of the study.	LEV does not modify the onset of dyskinesia following de novo treatment with l-dopa. However, concomitant treatment with l-dopa/LEV reduces the level of dyskinesia induced by l-dopa following a drug holiday.

Complement plays a central role in post-TBI neuroinflammation, and C3 opsonins and the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) have been implicated in promoting secondary injury. We used single cell mass cytometry to characterize the immune cell landscape of the brain at different time points after TBI. To specifically investigate how complement shapes the post-TBI immune cell landscape, we analyzed TBI brains in the context of CR2-Crry treatment, an inhibitor of C3 activation. We analyzed 13 immune cell types, including peripheral and brain resident cells, and assessed expression of various receptors. TBI modulated the expression of phagocytic and complement receptors on both brain resident and infiltrating peripheral immune cells, and distinct functional clusters were identified within same cell populations that emerge at different phases after TBI. In particular, a CD11c+ (CR4) microglia subpopulation continued to expand over 28 days after injury, and was the only receptor to show continuous increase over time. Complement inhibition affected the abundance of brain resident immune cells in the injured hemisphere and impacted the expression of functional receptors on infiltrating cells. A role for C5a has also been indicated in models of brain injury, and we found significant upregulation of C5aR1 on many immune cell types after TBI. However, we demonstrated experimentally that while C5aR1 is involved in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain after injury, it does not alone affect histological or behavioral outcomes. However, CR2-Crry improved post-TBI outcomes and reduced resident immune cell populations, as well as complement and phagocytic receptor expression, indicating that its neuroprotective effects are mediated upstream of C5a generation, likely via modulating C3 opsonization and complement receptor expression."}

A total of 1212 unique records were screened by 2 independent reviewers. Forty trials were identified, including 2718 patients with history of stroke.	Outcome data were pooled according to assessment timing (ie, 4-8wk and 12wk after injection), and categorized into 6 main clinical goals (ie, spasticity-related pain, involuntary movements, passive joint motion, care ability, arm and hand use, and standing and walking performance). Sensitivity analyses were performed for the influence of study and intervention characteristics, involvement of pharmaceutical industry, and publication bias.	Robust evidence is shown for the effectiveness of BoNT in reducing resistance to passive movement, as measured with the (Modified) Ashworth Score, and improving self-care ability for the affected hand and arm after intervention (P<.005) and at follow-up (P<.005). In addition, robust evidence is shown for the absence of effect on arm-hand capacity at follow-up. BoNT was found to significantly reduce involuntary movements, spasticity-related pain, and caregiver burden, and improve passive range of motion, while no evidence was found for arm and hand use after intervention.	In view of the robustness of current evidence, no further trials are needed to investigate BoNT for its favorable effects on resistance to passive movement of the spastic wrist and fingers, and on self-care. No trials are needed to further confirm the lack of effects of BoNT on arm-hand capacity, whereas additional trials are needed to establish the suggested favorable effects of BoNT on other body functions, which may result in clinically meaningful outcomes at activity and participation levels."}

TAR RNA/DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP43) is an ALS-causative protein forming IBs in ALS patients. The relation between localization of the IBs and neurotoxicity remains largely unknown. We characterized aggregation of fluorescently tagged TDP43 and its carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) by analytical fluorescence imaging techniques. Quantitative time-lapse analysis in individual live cells showed that fluorescent-protein-tagged TDP43 was cleaved and a 35 kDa TDP43 CTF (TDP35) formed ubiquitin (Ub)-negative cytoplasmic IBs. Although TDP35 formed mildly toxic Ub-negative IBs in the cytoplasm, TDP25, another type of a TDP43 CTF, efficiently formed sufficiently toxic Ub-positive IBs. One- or two-color fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) revealed that coaggregation of TDP25 with TDP43 was initiated by depletion of the RNA that binds to TDP25. Moreover, nuclear localization tagging TDP25 reduced the rate of neuronal cell death. These observations point to the need to elucidate the novel sequestration mechanism and details of the toxicity of the misfolded and aggregation-prone TDP43 CTFs (as well as the RNA binding and nuclear retention) in order to identify possible preventive interventions against ALS."}

In this study, we investigated whether DJ-1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and function in neuronal cells. Confocal and electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that M17 human neuroblastoma cells over-expressing wild-type DJ-1 (WT DJ-1 cells) displayed elongated mitochondria while M17 cells over-expressing PD-associated DJ-1 mutants (R98Q, D149A and L166P) (mutant DJ-1 cells) showed significant increase of fragmented mitochondria. Similar mitochondrial fragmentation was also noted in primary hippocampal neurons over-expressing PD-associated mutant forms of DJ-1. Functional analysis revealed that over-expression of PD-associated DJ-1 mutants resulted in mitochondria dysfunction and increased neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress (H(2) O(2)) or neurotoxin. Further immunoblot studies demonstrated that levels of dynamin-like protein (DLP1), also known as Drp1, a regulator of mitochondrial fission, was significantly decreased in WT DJ-1 cells but increased in mutant DJ-1 cells. Importantly, DLP1 knockdown in these mutant DJ-1 cells rescued the abnormal mitochondria morphology and all associated mitochondria/neuronal dysfunction.

Accordingly, we found that patients had significantly stronger neural responses in the superior parietal cortices during memory encoding and significantly weaker activity in parietal-occipital regions during maintenance compared with control subjects. Moreover, disease duration and glycemic control were both significantly correlated with neural responses in various brain regions.

However, previous analyses involving LOHS did not consider confounding or indirect factors, or the effects of other factors on LOHS and inpatient costs.	To investigate the direct and indirect effects of LOHS on the hospitalization costs of inpatients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.	This was a population-based, retrospective, and observational study that analyzed data acquired from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2015 and 2020 relating to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in Ningxia, China.	Hospitalizations were identified by the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10). Inpatient costs were described by the median M (P25, P75). We used a quantile regression model to estimate the linear relationships between a group of independent variables X and the quantile of the explained variable hospitalization cost (Y). A structural equation model (SEM) was then used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of LOHS on inpatient costs.	The study included 129,444 patients with ischemic stroke and 15,525 patients with hemorrhagic stroke. The median LOHS was 10 (8-13) days for ischemic stroke and 15 (10-22) days for hemorrhagic stroke. The median M (P25, P75) of inpatient costs was $1020 (742-1545) for ischemic stroke and 2813 (1576-6191) for hemorrhagic stroke. The total effect of LOHS on inpatient costs was 0.795 in patients with ischemic stroke. The effect of yearof discharge (X4) and CCI (X8) on inpatient costs was dominated by an indirect effect through the LOHS. The indirect effect was -0.071 (84.52% of the total effect value) and 0.034 (69.39% of the total effect value), respectively. The total effect of LOHS on inpatient costs in patients with hemorrhagic stroke was 0.754. The influence of CCI on inpatient costs was dominated by an indirect effect through LOHS; the indirect effect value was -0.028 (77.78% of the total effect value). The payment type, surgery, method of discharge, and hospital level also exerted an impact on inpatient costs by direct and indirect effects through the LOHS.	Length of hospital stay (LOHS) was identified as the main factor influencing hospitalization costs. However, other social factors were shown to indirectly influence hospitalization costs through the LOHS. Taking effective measures to further reduce hospitalization costs remains an effective way to control hospitalization costs for stroke patients."}

A total of 104 patients with aneurysmal SAH were studied. Computed tomography (CT) scan findings of SAH were assessed by Fisher's grade and clinical neurologic assessment was performed using the Hunt and Hess (H&H)grading system.

Male and female juvenile rats were treated orally with risperidone (0.3 mg/kg, 3 times/day), aripiprazole (1 mg/kg), olanzapine (1 mg/kg) or vehicle (control), starting from postnatal day (PD) 23 (±1 day) for 3 weeks (corresponding to the childhood-adolescent period in humans). Quantitative autoradiography was used to detect the binding density of [[3]H]MK-801 (an NMDA receptor antagonist) and [[3]H]muscimol (a selective GABAA receptor agonist). Aripiprazole elevated the [[3]H]MK801 binding levels in the NAcC of male rats, and the NAcS and CPu of female rats. Risperidone increased [[3]H]MK801 levels in the CPu of female rats, and the NAcS of male rats. Aripiprazole upregulated [[3]H]muscimol binding levels in the CPu and NAcC of male rats, while it elevated the [[3]H]muscimol levels in the PFC of female rats, compared to controls.

Only 3-5% of patients are intolerant because of hypotension or bradycardia. Data from randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies show that most patients eligible to receive BB tolerate them well. BB are not contraindicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); in fact, these patients also benefit because of their high cardiovascular risk. In patients with COPD, as in the elderly, BB should be started at a low dose and uptitrated slowly. Monitoring of lung function during initiation is important, as undiagnosed coexistent asthma could be revealed. When patients are unaware of the drug in use, erectile dysfunction (ED) is reported no more often with BB than with any other drug prescribed for heart failure or hypertension.

Although clinical trials have demonstrated that both synthetic surfactant and animal derived surfactant preparations are effective, comparison in animal models has suggested that there may be greater efficacy of animal derived surfactant products, perhaps due to the protein content of animal derived surfactant.	To compare the effect of animal derived surfactant to protein free synthetic surfactant preparations in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).	Searches were updated of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2014), PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE (1975 through November 2014). All languages were included.	Randomized controlled trials comparing administration of protein free synthetic surfactants to administration of animal derived surfactant extracts in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome were considered for this review.	Data collection and analysis were conducted according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.	Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that the use of animal derived surfactant rather than protein free synthetic surfactant resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of pneumothorax [typical relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.77; typical risk difference (RD) -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 11 studies, 5356 infants] and a marginal reduction in the risk of mortality (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99; typical RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.00; NNTB 50; 13 studies, 5413 infants).Animal derived surfactant was associated with an increase in the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis [typical RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 50; 8 studies, 3462 infants] and a marginal increase in the risk of any intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05; 10 studies, 5045 infants) but no increase in Grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; 9 studies, 4241 infants).The meta-analyses supported a marginal decrease in the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality associated with the use of animal derived surfactant preparations (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00; 6 studies, 3811 infants). No other relevant differences in outcomes were noted.	Both animal derived surfactant extracts and protein free synthetic surfactant extracts are effective in the treatment and prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Comparative trials demonstrate greater early improvement in the requirement for ventilator support, fewer pneumothoraces, and fewer deaths associated with animal derived surfactant extract treatment. Animal derived surfactant may be associated with an increase in necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage, though the more serious hemorrhages (Grade 3 and 4) are not increased. Despite these concerns, animal derived surfactant extracts would seem to be the more desirable choice when compared to currently available protein free synthetic surfactants."}

The study took place between September 2005 and September 2015 at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and between September 2010 and September 2015 at the Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia. Patients requiring emergent intubation prior to endovascular therapy were excluded. The remaining patients were categorized into (1) MAC and (2) elective intubation for the procedure (elective GA). Patients who converted from MAC to GA during the procedure were included in the MAC group. The 2 groups were matched for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and glucose levels. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared.	The primary outcome measure was the shift in the degree of disability among the 2 groups as measured by the modified Rankin scale at 90 days.	A total of 215 patients underwent endovascular therapy for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes during the study period. Thirty-nine patients were excluded owing to emergent pre-endovascular therapy intubation. Sixty-three patients had MAC (36%) and 113 patients had GA (64%). The conversion rate from MAC to GA was 13% (n = 8). After matching, 61 pairs of patients (n = 122) underwent primary analysis. The 2 groups were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. Median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 60-75 years) in the MAC group vs 67 years (interquartile range, 55.5-78.5 years) in the GA group (P = .83). Fifty-four percent of the patients in the MAC group were men vs 41% in the GA group (P = .44). When compared with the elective GA group, patients who underwent the procedure with MAC had similar rates of successful reperfusion, good clinical outcomes, hemorrhagic complications, and mortality. The modality of anesthesia was not associated with any significant changes in the modified Rankin scale score distribution (MAC: OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.80-2.90; P = .19).	In endovascular therapy for acute posterior circulation stroke, MAC is feasible and appears to be as safe and effective as GA. Future clinical trials are warranted to confirm our findings."}

Throughout history, liver transplantation for this population has been controversial, and many policies and regulations have existed to limit access to lifesaving transplant for patients who use alcohol. In recent years, the rates of liver transplantation for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease have increased dramatically; however, disparities persist. For instance, many criteria used in evaluation for transplant listing, such as social support and prior knowledge of the harms of alcohol use, are not evidence based and may selectively disadvantage patients with alcohol use disorder. In addition, few transplant providers have adequate training in the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and few transplant centers offer specialized addiction treatment. Finally, current approaches to liver transplantation would benefit from adopting principles of harm reduction, which have demonstrated efficacy in the realm of addiction medicine for years. As we look toward the future, we must emphasize the use of evidence-based measures in selecting patients for listing, ensure access to high-quality addiction care for all patients pretransplant and posttransplant, and adopt harm reduction beliefs to better address relapse when it inevitably occurs. We believe that only by addressing each of these issues will we be able to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources in liver transplantation for all patients."}

Advances in our knowledge of RRB are hindered by the inconsistencies in how RRB is measured. The present study examined the factor structure of the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) in a sample of 350 children with ASD ages 2-9. Confirmatory factor analysis designed for items with categorical response types was implemented to examine six proposed structural models. The five-factor model demonstrated the most parsimonious fit based on common overall fit indices that was further supported by examination of local model fit indicators, though, the four- and six-factor models evidenced adequate-to-good fit as well. Examination of RRB factor score approaches indicated only minor differences between summed item subscale scores and extracted factor scores with regard to associations with diagnostic measures. All RRB subtypes demonstrated significant associations with cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior.

LAY SUMMARY: Repetitive behaviors are one of the two main symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To better understand the role of repetitive behaviors, we must establish effective ways of measuring them. This study assessed the measurement qualities of the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) in a sample of 350 children with ASD ages 2-9. We found that the RBS-R measures multiple types of repetitive behaviors and that these behaviors are related to thinking ability and independence."}

The primary triggers for motor neuronal death are still unknown, but inflammation is considered to be an important factor contributing to the pathophysiology of ALS both clinically and in ALS models. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its corresponding four E-prostanoid receptors play a pivotal role in the degeneration of motor neurons in human and transgenic models of ALS. It has also been shown that PGE2-EP2 signaling in glial cells (astrocytes or microglia) promotes motor neuronal death in G93A mice. The present study was designed to investigate the levels of expression of EP receptors in the spinal motor neurons of ALS model mice and to examine whether PGE2 alters the expression of EP receptors in differentiated NSC-34 cells, a motor neuron-like cell line. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that EP2 and EP3 immunoreactivity was localized in NeuN-positive large cells showing the typical morphology of motor neurons in mice. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that the immunoreactivity of EP2 in motor neurons was significantly increased in the early symptomatic stage in ALS model mice. In contrast, the level of EP3 expression remained constant, irrespective of age. In differentiated NSC-34 cells, bath application of PGE2 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease of MTT reduction. Although PGE2 had no effect on cell survival at concentrations of less than 10 μM, pretreatment with 10 μM PGE2 significantly up-regulated EP2 and concomitantly potentiated cell death induced by 30 μM PGE2. These results suggest that PGE2 is an important effector for induction of the EP2 subtype in differentiated NSC-34 cells, and that not only EP2 up-regulation in glial cells but also EP2 up-regulation in motor neurons plays a pivotal role in the vulnerability of motor neurons in ALS model mice."}

The phenotypic change in malignant cells, and the importance of the microenvironment in the formation of brain metastases are also inspected.

In panic disorder there is recurrent attacks of severe anxiety which are unprovoked and unexpected. Dominant symptoms vary from person to person. The syndrome is likely to be heterogeneous as the biological aetiology may be related to abnormalities in the function of a number of neurotransmitters ie serotonin, noradrenaline, gamabutyric acid, dopamine and cholecystokinin. As such different benzodiazepines and anti-depressants are efficacious in the treatment of the disorder. Medications should be titrated to prevent attacks and restore confidence.

Cognition was investigated by means of objective assessment of executive functions (EpiTrack®) and verbal memory and by subjective ratings of self-perceived side effects (cognition, mood, and vegetative). Quality of life was assessed using the QOLIE-10 questionnaire. Patients underwent assessment at baseline and after a median follow-up interval of 32 weeks. Forty-four patients were treated with LCM, 11 with LTG, and 15 with TPM. Treatment arms differed with regard to the age at onset of epilepsy (LTG>TPM) and to seizure control from baseline to follow-up, which was best in patients whose seizures were treated with LTG (55% vs. 16% in patients whose seizures were treated with LCM and 13% in patients whose seizures were treated with TPM). Groups did not differ in the type of epilepsy, daily drug load or drug load change, nor in baseline seizure frequency. Repeated measures statistics controlling for epilepsy onset and seizure outcome showed deteriorated executive functions with TPM (F=7.5, p=0.001). On an individual level (reliable change indices), 53% of the patients whose seizures were treated with TPM showed losses in this domain (LCM 14%, LTG 27%) and none of the patients showed improvement (LCM 23%, LTG 27%; χ(2)=11.8, p=0.019).

The present study examined behavioral deficits in rats after recovery from a bout of thiamine deficiency. Following behavioral testing, the brains were dissected into regions and assayed biochemically for levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and the primary metabolites of these monoamines. Based on previous findings in this laboratory, we predicted that thiamine deficiency not only produces behavioral deficits but loss in catecholamines as well. Impairments were observed for a spatial delayed alternation task that had been learned prior to experimental treatment. In addition, experimental animals were impaired in their ability to acquire two novel tasks, active and passive shock avoidance, after recovery from the acute effects of thiamine deficiency. Comparable deficits were not observed for a number of reflex responses that were measured to assess the general neurological state of the animals. Biochemical analyses revealed that the concentration of norepinephrine was reduced significantly in cortex-hippocampus and olfactory bulb but not in other regions, while dopamine and serotonin levels were not altered in any brain region examined. These data demonstrate that a bout of thiamine deficiency can produce persistent deficits in brain norepinephrine and concomitant decrements in behavioral measures of learning and memory. These results are consistent with our hypothesis and evidence that noradrenergic deficits contribute to the amnesic symptoms of Korsakoff's psychosis."}

C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into sham-operated group, model group, TAE (110 mg/kg) group, TPNS (115 mg/kg) group, TAE-TPNS combination group and Edaravone (4 mg/kg) group, treated for 4 days, then, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was established by bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) ligation for 20 min followed by reperfusion for 1 and 24 h.	TPNS could increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, TAE and TAE-TPNS combination increased ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) contents and Na[+]-K[+]-ATPase activity, and the effects of TAE-TPNS combination were stronger than those of TAE or TPNS alone after reperfusion for 1 h. After reperfusion for 24 h, TAE, TPNS and TAE-TPNS combination significantly increased neurocyte survival rate and decreased the apoptosis rate as well as down-regulated the expression of phosphorylated c-June N-terminal kinase1/2 (p-JNK1/2), cytochrome C (Cyt C), cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease (Caspase)-9 and Caspase-3. Furthermore, the effects in TAE-TPNS combination were better than those in TAE or TPNS alone.

Costs associated with RxO abuse were grouped into healthcare, criminal justice, and workplace categories. Costs were estimated by either (1) a quantity method that multiplies the number of RxO abusers derived from various national surveys by the estimated per abuser cost, or (2) an apportionment method that starts with overall (ie, prescription and nonprescription) drug abuse costs for a cost component (eg, police protection) and apportions the share of costs based on the prevalence of RxO abuse relative to overall drug abuse. Medical costs in excess of those for otherwise similar nonabusers were based on an analysis of a large administrative claims database for an employed population using multivariate regression methods.	A lower bound estimate of the costs of RxO abuse in the United States was 8.6 billion dollars in 2001 (or 9.5 billion dollars in 2005 dollars). Of this amount, 2.6 billion dollarswere healthcare costs, 1.4 billion dollars were criminal justice costs, and 4.6 billion dollars were workplace costs.

Fifty patients underwent examination with dynamic CT for nonendocrinologic disease as a control group to establish the normal pattern of pituitary gland enhancement. One hundred seventy microadenomas (65.4%) displayed the usual dynamic CT pattern (ie, they did not show early enhancement before that of the portal system of the pituitary gland: those pituitary microadenomas appeared less enhanced than the normal pituitary gland during the entire examination). On the other hand, in 90 microadenomas (34.6%), early partial or complete enhancement was seen within the microadenoma before the normal portal enhancement of the gland. Therefore, analysis with dynamic CT yields two groups of pituitary microadenomas separable on the basis of blood supply: those with portal blood supply only and those with partial or predominantly direct arterial blood supply; in theory, the second group avoids hypothalamic control."}

Typically, protection is seen when the gap between insults is several days to a week. However, the effect of mild but persistent hypoxia is unknown. In this study we examined the hypothesis that mild pre-existing hypoxia (PaO2<17 mm Hg) would reduce neural injury in chronically instrumented late-gestation (0.85 gestation) fetal sheep exposed to 30 min of global cerebral ischaemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion (normoxia: n=9 vs. pre-existing hypoxia: n=9) or normoxia plus sham ischaemia (sham controls: n=9). Histopathology was assessed after 7 days of recovery. Fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia had lower PaO2 values (16.1±0.6 vs. 26.0±1.1 mm Hg) and were lighter at post-mortem (4,033±412 vs. 5,261±238 g) compared to normoxic fetuses. Cerebral ischaemia was associated with secondary cortical oedema and seizures, reduced final EEG power, loss of sleep state cycling, and significant loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, with no significant effect of pre-existing hypoxia. Pre-existing hypoxia was associated with a significantly attenuated rise in mean arterial pressure between 18 and 36 h and slower resolution of cortical oedema between 96 and 150 h after ischaemia. These data suggest that chronic hypoxia is not associated with a significant preconditioning effect."}

Height, weight, head circumference and bone age were recorded at regular intervals for the first 6 years of life. The mean SD score (SDS) for height was not significantly different from zero at study entry, but decreased mainly during the second year of life to a nadir of -0.78 in boys and -0.54 in girls at 2.5 years. During the subsequent years, a significant trend towards a regain of height SDS was noted in both sexes. Weight-for-height SDS was close to zero in both sexes, with a significant continuous increasing trend throughout the observation period. Head circumference SDS decreased in boys during the first year of life from -0.28 to -0.68, whereas girls showed only a minor change. During the further follow-up period, head circumference SDS remained at approximately -0.3 in boys and 0.0 in girls. While the mean verbal and performance IQ of the total study population at 5 and 6 years of age did not differ from a group of 212 healthy non-PKU children, patients with a head circumference SDS less than the population median at 2 years of age exhibited poorer cognitive abilities at school age than those patients with a relative head size greater than the population median. The children with a head circumference less than the median at 2 years had smaller head sizes already at birth; in addition, the change in relative head size during the first 2 years was correlated significantly with cognitive abilities at school age in boys. Mean bone age was identical to chronological age at each time point of observation. The rate of maturation was one year of bone age per year of chronological age. No correlation between phenylalanine intake or phenylalanine concentrations and the rates of body or head growth or skeletal maturation could be established. We conclude that despite adequate weight gain, moderate growth retardation occurred during the first 2 years of life in this group of children treated for PKU. Growth was more compromised in boys than in girls and tended to be compensated during later follow-up. Early infantile head circumference and growth appear to be predictors of cognitive development."}

Disturbances develop after the child has already achieved the capacity for language comprehension and verbal expression. Brain trauma is most often the cause. The clinical picture of the disorder varies over different age groups and, in contrast to adults, shows no consistent typology. In most of the cases there exists a disturbance of speech production; problems with writing and comprehension are seen less often (although comprehension of language is primarily affected in the Landau-Kleffner syndrome). Only once and a while logorrhoea and jargon can be diagnosed. Besides the speech and language disorders cognitive, motor und emotional problems may appear. Therefore, several diagnostic levels have to be considered (e.g. clinical neurology, neuropsychology, psychophysiology, psychopathology). Course and prognosis of the acquired aphasia in childhood (30% longterm difficulties) depend on several factors like etiology and extension of the lesion, the development of the functional hemispheric dominance for language and the initial recovery velocity after the symptoms appeared. The plasticity of the child's brain is a source for compensating mechanisms which might be triggered by three aspects of therapeutic activities which should be used synchronously: speech and language training, principles of psychotherapy and social medicine and treatment of additional disorders."}

Here, we show that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) haploinsufficiency decreases BDNF and increases amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor in murine brain. Moreover, prior to disease onset, the TERT locus sustains accumulation of repressive epigenetic marks in murine and human AD neurons, implicating TERT repression in amyloid-induced neurodegeneration. To test the impact of sustained TERT expression on AD pathobiology, AD mouse models were engineered to maintain physiological levels of TERT in adult neurons, resulting in reduced Aβ accumulation, improved spine morphology, and preserved cognitive function. Mechanistically, integrated profiling revealed that TERT interacts with β-catenin and RNA polymerase II at gene promoters and upregulates gene networks governing synaptic signaling and learning processes. These TERT-directed transcriptional activities do not require its catalytic activity nor telomerase RNA. These findings provide genetic proof-of-concept for somatic TERT gene activation therapy in attenuating AD progression including cognitive decline."}

It is argued that most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) do not have the power to discriminate between an effective and an even more effective medication. Until RCTs that enroll 300 or more patients per arm are conducted, or more sensitive research designs are developed, it will be difficult to determine if a 'not statistically different' finding reflects true therapeutic equivalence or if it is a false-negative result (or type II error). Statistical methods that evaluate data from a number of studies are used increasingly to compare treatment strategies. The relative merits and limitations of quantitative meta-analysis and pooled analysis of original data are discussed. The former method is preferred when a large number of relevant RCTs can be analyzed.

Uric acid (UA), when given twice daily at 200 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 10 consecutive days, elevated urate (the anionic form of UA) in plasma and striatum by 55% and 36.8%, respectively, as compared with vehicle group. This regimen of UA was found to ameliorate the behavioral deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss as well as dopamine depletion in the nigrostriatal system. Moreover, UA administration was capable of increasing glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity while decreasing malondialdehyde accumulation in striatum. In addition, the phosphorylation of both protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) in the lesioned striata of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was dramatically reduced as compared with sham-operated rats. This reduction was attenuated in the Parkinsonian rats receiving UA treatment. Similarly, in vitro findings showed that UA alleviated the decrease in Akt activation and the increase in GSK3β activity caused by 6-OHDA. Furthermore, neuroprotection by urate and its regulation on GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9 was found to be abolished in the presence of PI3K inhibitor. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that urate was able to protect dopaminergic neurons in rat nigrostriatal pathway against the neurotoxicity of 6-OHDA, and showed that its beneficial effects may be related to its regulation on Akt/GSK3β signaling."}

The lesions were divided into two groups according to maximum diameters: ≤ 1.5 cm (n = 16) and > 1.5 cm (n = 70). The two groups were compared using Fisher's exact test.	Diagnostic yield and diagnostic accuracy were 95.3% and 94.2%, respectively. The diagnostic yield of lesions ≤ 1.5 cm and > 1.5 cm were 93.8% and 95.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference in diagnostic yield between the two groups (p > 0.05). Mean procedure duration was 41 ± 5 min (range 33-49 min). All biopsy needles were placed with one pass. Complication rate was 3.5% (3/86). Minor complications included three cases of a small amount of haemorrhage. No serious complications were observed.	Real-time MR-guided brain biopsy using a 1.0-T open MRI scanner is a safe, feasible and accurate diagnostic technique for pathological diagnosis of brain lesions. The procedure duration is shortened and biopsy work flow is simplified. It could be considered as an alternative for brain biopsy.	• Real-time MRI-guided brain biopsy using a 1.0-T open MRI scanner is safe, feasible and accurate. • No serious complications occurred in real-time MRI-guided brain biopsy. • Procedure duration is shortened and biopsy work flow is simplified."}

HLH affecting the CNS mimics several neurological disorders and may be misdiagnosed. The diagnostic and therapeutic problems of this disease are discussed.	We report a case of a 5-year-old girl with a 2-month history of right hemiparesis. The initial magnetic resonance imaging scan mimicked the appearance of malignant glioma or cerebral infarction. By use of neuroimaging alone, it was extremely difficult to reach an appropriate diagnosis.	Pathological examination of a surgical specimen of the lesion revealed histological characteristics typical of HLH. Because of the absence of both physical and blood chemical findings of systemic HLH, the patient was diagnosed as having HLH isolated in the CNS without systemic HLH. Radiotherapy with corticosteroid administration led to complete resolution of the CNS lesions, but the duration of remission was only 3 months. The patient died secondary to refractory progression of the CNS lesion.	Radiotherapy with corticosteroid administration led to a complete resolution of the lesions, although for only a transitory remission. Although HLH is extremely rare, the existence of this disease isolated in the CNS should be documented, and further case accumulation and therapeutic investigations are needed to clarify the pathophysiological characteristics of this disease."}

The present investigation followed prospectively long-term BZD users over 1 year following graded BZD withdrawal in terms of clinical and withdrawal symptoms.	Clinical symptoms were measured by the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) and by the Newcastle Anxiety and Depression Diagnostic Index (NADDI) in a sample of BZD users over a 50-week period following graded BZD withdrawal.	The results showed that the frequency and severity of clinical symptomatology measured by both scales significantly decreased over time. A detailed analysis of possible patterns of symptoms on both scales revealed four patterns: 1) a gradual decrease over the 50-week time period; 2) an increase in the severity of symptoms at the onset of tapering and a decrease in severity post-tapering; 3) an increase in the severity of symptoms 4 weeks after the cessation of BZD tapering; and 4) no change over the 50-week time period.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have demonstrated neurochemical alterations in the frontal lobe of alcohol users, although most studies focused on older, alcohol-dependent subjects.	In this study, neurochemical data were acquired using MRS at 4.0 Tesla from emerging adults (18 to 24 years old) who were binge alcohol drinkers (BD, n = 23) or light drinkers (LD, n = 31). Since binge drinking is also associated with increased prevalence of experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout, BD were stratified into alcohol-induced blackout (BDBO) and non-blackout (BDN) groups.	Overall, BD had significantly lower gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) than LD. When stratified by blackout history, BDBO also had lower ACC glutamate (Glu) than LD. No group differences in MRS metabolites were observed in the parietal-occipital cortex. Lower ACC GABA and Glu remained significant after accounting for lower gray matter content in BD, however, NAA differences were no longer evident. In addition, low ACC GABA levels were associated with greater alcohol use consequences, and worse response inhibition and attention/mental flexibility in BD.	These data indicate that binge drinking affects frontal lobe neurochemistry, more so in those who had experienced an alcohol-induced blackout. Characterization of the neurochemical profiles associated with binge alcohol consumption and blackout history may help identify unique risk factors for the later manifestation of alcohol abuse and dependence, in young individuals who are heavy, frequent drinkers, but who do not meet the criteria for alcohol abuse disorders."}

However, the past decade of gene discovery in ASD has been most notable for the application, in large family-based cohorts, of high-density microarray studies of submicroscopic chromosomal structure as well as high-throughput DNA sequencing-leading to the identification of an increasingly long list of risk regions and genes disrupted by rare, de novo germline mutations of large effect.

Using steady-state stimuli during a pro/antisaccade task, this study addressed the relationship between nonspecific and stimulus-related neural activity, and how these activities are modulated as a function of cognitive demands. In 98 psychosis probands (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychosis), neural activity was assessed during baseline and during a 5-s period in preparation for the pro/antisaccade task. To maximize the ability to identify meaningful differences between psychosis subtypes, analyses were conducted as a function of subgrouping probands by standard clinical diagnoses and neurobiological features. These psychosis 'biotypes' were created using brain-based biomarkers, independent of symptomatology (Clementz et al.,). Psychosis probands as a whole showed poor antisaccade performance and diminished baseline oscillatory phase synchrony. Psychosis biotypes differed on both behavioral and brain measures, in ways predicted from Clementz et al. (). Two biotype groups showed similarly deficient behavior and baseline synchrony, despite diametrically opposed neural activity amplitudes. Another biotype subgroup was more similar to healthy individuals on behavioral and brain measures, despite the presence of psychosis. This study provides evidence that (a) consideration of baseline levels of activation and synchrony will be essential for a comprehensive understanding of neural response differences in psychosis, and (b) distinct psychosis subgroups exhibit reduced versus augmented intrinsic neural activity, despite cognitive performance and clinical similarities."}

Reduced medullary serotonergic neurones, modulators of respiration in response to hypercapnia, were reported in a SUDEP post-mortem series. The amygdala and hippocampus have high serotonergic innervation and are functionally implicated in seizure-related respiratory dysregulation. We explored serotonergic networks in mesial temporal lobe structures in a surgical and post-mortem epilepsy series in relation to SUDEP risk. We stratified 75 temporal lobe epilepsy patients with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE/HS) into high (N = 16), medium (N = 11) and low risk (N = 48) groups for SUDEP based on generalised seizure frequency. We also included the amygdala in 35 post-mortem cases, including SUDEP (N = 17), epilepsy controls (N = 10) and non-epilepsy controls (N = 8). The immunohistochemistry labelling index (LI) and axonal length (AL) of serotonin transporter (SERT)-positive axons were quantified in 13 regions of interest with image analysis. SERT LI was highest in amygdala and subiculum regions. In the surgical series, higher SERT LI was observed in high risk than low risk cases in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and subiculum (p < 0.05). In the post-mortem cases higher SERT LI and AL was observed in the basal and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala and peri-amygdala cortex in SUDEP compared to epilepsy controls (p < 0.05). Patients on SRI showed higher SERT in the dentate gyrus (p < 0.005) and CA4 (p < 0.05) but there was no difference in patients with or without a psychiatric history. Higher SERT in hippocampal subfields in TLE/HS cases with SUDEP risk factors and higher amygdala SERT in post-mortem SUDEP cases than epilepsy controls supports a role for altered serotonergic networks involving limbic regions in SUDEP.

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of ACE in this model and to compare the treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat with that with the angiotensin II antagonist HR 720. The endothelial layer of the left carotid artery was removed using an inflated balloon catheter. Injured and control vessels were both submitted to histomorphological analysis and DNA content quantification at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 days after injury. Evaluation of neointima thickening demonstrated a slow but steady increase of neointima that was significant after day 6 and reached 30% of the lumen in 2 weeks. This was paralleled by an increase in DNA content, which was significant 4 days after injury. ACE mRNA levels were quantified by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. Measurement of ACE mRNA levels revealed a significant upregulation 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. ACE activity was also significantly enhanced at 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. In addition, the treatment with ramiprilat was more efficient in reducing neointima formation than that with HR 720. These data underlie the role of ACE in this model of restenosis. The early induction of ACE expression after endothelial injury but before significant changes in the vessel structure suggests that ACE activity might be one of the mechanisms that trigger neointima formation in the rat."}

There have been reports suggesting that circulating non-22K GH isoforms are increased in acromegaly, but the possible implications of such observations in the management of the disease have not been addressed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proportion of circulating non-22K GH isoforms in acromegaly. In addition, the relationships between the amount of non-22K GH and tumor size, biochemical measurements, and body composition also were investigated. Samples with different GH levels were selected from 24-h GH profiles from 15 acromegalic men evaluated before and 1 yr after transsphenoidal surgery and from 13 healthy men. The serum non-22K GH levels, expressed as percentage of total GH concentration, were determined by the 22K GH exclusion assay, which is based on immunomagnetic extraction of 22K GH from serum and quantitation of non-22K GH using a polyclonal GH assay. The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was fairly constant in different samples from the same patient, regardless of the GH level. However, a wide variation of values was observed among acromegalics, both before (14-51%) and after surgery (8-62%). The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was increased in untreated patients, compared with controls (26.6 vs. 17.4%; P < 0.01), and the values correlated significantly to tumor size, mean 24-h GH concentration, serum PRL, and extracellular water. After surgery, patients not truly cured, with mean 24-h GH concentration of 1 microg/L or more, had an increased proportion of non-22K GH, compared with those with levels less than 1 microg/L (P < 0.01). In the former group, the median values were similar than those in untreated acromegalics (34 vs. 26.6%, respectively), whereas in the latter, they were comparable with those in the controls (15.2 vs. 17.4%, respectively). We conclude that acromegalics have an increased proportion of circulating non-22K GH isoforms. The values are fairly constant in different samples from an individual, regardless of GH level, but a large spectrum can be observed among patients. This variability suggests that different pituitary adenomas secrete GH isoforms in variable amounts. Our observation that a higher proportion of non-22K GH isoforms is present in patients not truly cured after surgery suggests that the evaluation of non-22K GH isoforms can be useful in the follow-up of acromegalic patients."}

Self-reported data were analyzed by nonparametric methods. Because MPA's effectiveness is evident early in treatment, we report on data from the first six months. Subjects reported a differential rate of suppression of sexual activities, a median of up to two weeks for deviant and 2 to 10 weeks for nondeviant behaviors (p < or = .01 for each of the five dimensions).

Recent studies have shown that IDUs are often exposed to viral infections relatively early in the course of injection, highlighting the importance of understanding this initiation process for both epidemiology and prevention. Epidemiologic evidence similarly suggests that at least some youth populations, most notably young men who have sex with men (YMSM), are at substantial risk for exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) from early sexual activity. Despite the importance of this issue for both epidemiology and prevention, however, surprisingly little information is available on the social course of injection initiation, including the individual, social, or ecological factors that might mitigate or exacerbate transmission risks within the critical phase of early injection drug use. Similarly, we know little about the ways that YMSM and other high-risk youth understand risk, the kinds of exchanges and relationships in which they participate in the context of initiating sexual activity, or how drug use is operant in these exchanges and early sexual experiences. In this article, we explore key dimensions of the early initiation of injection and sexual risk, and discuss how a social network approach might be instrumental in understanding the social course of drug injection and sexual activities among youth and young adult populations."}

Mitochondria and the phenomenon of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), which marks the point of no return in cell death cascades, have special value in this regard. It is important that the vulnerability to MPT-inducing factors is increased with aging. Simultaneously, a decrease in the calcium retention capacity of mitochondria is developed, which leads to the disturbance of the functional activity of neurons.	The systematic investigations and web content related to the importance of MPT as the target for the search of neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing drugs, especially with multitargeted action, are reviewed.	Here, we have highlighted some experimental data that determines the importance of mitochondria for the search of neuroprotective drugs, and drugs with multitargeted action. We have also discussed a number of new compounds with similar properties. Being MPT inhibitors/modulators, virtually all the compounds described in this review have the ability to exhibit a neuroprotective effect, interact with some other targets, providing coupled beneficial therapeutic effects such as cognitive stimulation, anti-seizure, and antidepressant actions.

The present study investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of YC‑1 in cultured neurons exposed to glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity and in an animal model of stroke. In a cortical neuronal culture model, YC‑1 demonstrated neurotoxicity at a concentration >100 µM, and YC‑1 (10‑30 µM) achieved potent cytoprotection against glutamate‑induced neuronal damage. Additionally, YC‑1 (30 µM) effectively attenuated the increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Delayed treatment of YC‑1 (30 µM) also protected against glutamate‑induced neuronal damage and cell swelling in cultured neurons, though only at 4 h post‑treatment. In addition, immediate treatment of YC‑1 (30 µM) following the exposure of cortical neurons to glutamate (300 µM) produced a marked reduction in intracellular pH. Delayed treatment of YC‑1 (25 mg/kg) protected against ischemic brain damage in vivo, though only when administered at 3 h post‑insult. Thus, YC‑1 exhibited neuroprotection against glutamate-induced neuronal damage and in mice subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia. This neuroprotection may be mediated via its ability to limit the glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity. However, the neuroprotective therapeutic window of YC‑1 is only at 3 h in vivo and 4 h in vitro, which may, at least in part, be attributed to its ability to reduce the intracellular pH in the early phase of ischemic stroke. Although YC‑1 provided the potential for clinical therapy, the treatment time point must be carefully evaluated following ischemia."}

Models were connected to a pulsatile flow circuit, filled with a blood-mimicking fluid and treated by two operators using a single MED. Intra-aneurysmal flow velocity was measured using conventional and high-frequency digital subtraction angiography (HF-DSA) before and after each deployment. Aneurysm neck coverage by the implanted devices was assessed with flat detector computed tomography on a three-point Likert scale.	A total of 80 individual MED deployments were performed by the two operators. The mean intra-aneurysmal flow velocity reduction after MED implantation was 33.6% (27.5-39.7%). No significant differences in neck coverage (p = 0.99) or flow disruption (p = 0.84) were observed between operators. The degree of flow disruption significantly correlated with neck coverage (ρ = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21-0.59, p = 0.002) as well as with neck area (ρ = -0,35, 95% CI: -0.54 --0.13, p = 0.024). On multiple regression analysis, both neck coverage and total neck area were independent predictors of flow disruption.	The degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption after MED implantation can be quantified in vitro and varies considerably between different aneurysms and different device configurations.

They are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available in various strengths and formulations, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the triptans exist, as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including half-life, time to peak plasma concentrations, peak plasma concentrations, area under the concentration-time curve, metabolism and drug-drug interaction profiles. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability advantages for one agent over another is not well differentiated. However, delivery systems may play an important role in onset of action. Given that the clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle, identification of the most appropriate triptan for an individual patient requires consideration of the specific characteristics of the patient and knowledge of patient preference, an accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute-care medications and individual features of the drug being considered. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug also depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. Individual patient response to the triptans seems to be idiosyncratic and possibly genetically determined. Therefore, a set of specific questions can be used to determine whether a currently used triptan is optimally effective, whether the dose needs to be increased or whether another triptan should be tried. The clinician has in his/her armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of triptans, available in multiple formulations and dosages, which have good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimise therapeutic benefit. Use of the methods outlined in this review in choosing a triptan for an individual patient is probably more likely to lead to migraine relief than making an educated guess as to which triptan is most appropriate."}

We analyzed data from 3327 participants aged 20-79 years of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) from Northeast Germany with a median follow-up time of 14.5 years. Linear, logistic, and Cox-regression models were used to assess the associations of the APOE polymorphism with CCA-IMT, carotid plaques, incident MI and stroke, respectively.

However, the positive association between CCA-IMT and incident MI was more pronounced in E2 carriers than E3 homozygotes. Thus, our study suggests that while APOE E2 allele may predispose individuals to lower CCA-IMT, E2 carriers may be more prone to MI than E3 homozygotes as the CCA-IMT increases.

The former corresponds to the period until 6 weeks after the beginning of estrogen treatment and the latter to the period thereafter. In the former, PRL cells were significantly increased in number and volume, and were diffusely immunoreactive for PRL in the cytoplasm. Cell atypism was rarely found. The extent of acidophil staining was well preserved in hematoxylin-eosin staining. Ultrastructurally, organelles were well developed, especially rough endoplasmic reticulum showed whorl formation. Immature, irregularly shaped secretory granules were frequently observed within the Golgi area. Mature granules were richly stored at the periphery of the cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

We analyzed data using repeated measurement models. Social integration, family ties, and engagement with family were associated with cognitive function at advanced ages, controlling for education and introducing depressive symptoms, functional limitations, and chronic conditions as intervening variables. Association of social integration, through participation in community activities, with change in cognitive decline was more significant at advanced ages. Having friends was significantly associated with change in cognitive function in women only. Our findings have important implications for clinical medicine and public health because associations of social relations with cognitive function suggests that they may help to maintain cognitive function in old age."}

Evidence suggests that VSP impairment is common in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite this evidence, the ability of VSP tests to discriminate between healthy older adults and people with AD remains mixed. The purpose of this literature review was to employ a systematic search strategy to identify empirical evidence supporting the diagnostic utility of VSP tests which may be used in the screening and diagnosis of AD.	Specified criteria were used to perform a systematic literature search of the PsycINFO and PubMed databases with no date restrictions. Relevant data from the selected studies were extracted, and a published appraisal tool (the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) was used to evaluate methodological quality.	Of the 144 articles returned, six studies and 11 VSP tests met review inclusion criteria. Four tests demonstrated both sensitivity and specificity values above 80%. A computerised 3D Visual Task demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity values (90% and 95%, respectively). The quality of the identified studies was considered to be satisfactory. Identified limitations and the implications of issues relating to study methodology are discussed, and recommendations for future research are suggested.	The evidence from this review suggests that certain tests of VSP may be a useful addition to the routine screening of AD."}

However, studies on cholesterol measured in late-life and cognitive function have been inconsistent. Few studies have explored nonlinear relationships or considered interactions with other biomarker measures.	A cross-sectional sample of 1,889 participants from four rural counties in the People's Republic of China was included in this analysis. Serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and homocysteine levels were measured in fasting blood samples. A composite cognitive score was derived based on nine standardized cognitive test scores. Analysis of covariance models were used to investigate the association between biomarker measures and the composite cognitive scores.	There was a significant interaction between the homocysteine quartile group and the cholesterol quartile group on cognitive scores (P=0.0478). In participants with normal homocysteine levels, an inverse U-shaped relationship between total cholesterol level and cognitive score was found, indicating that both low and high cholesterol levels were associated with lower cognitive scores. In participants with high homocysteine levels, no significant association between cholesterol and cognition was found.	The relationship between cholesterol levels and cognitive function depends upon homocysteine levels, suggesting an interactive role between cholesterol and homocysteine on cognitive function in the elderly population. Additional research is required to confirm our findings in other populations, and to explore potential mechanisms underlying the lipid-homocysteine interaction."}

The study is a retrospective observational cohort study.	The study retrieved data from electronic health record from Hospital Authority (HA), HK.	The study included patients aged 18 years old or above, who were admitted to seven institutions under HA with diagnosis of ACS during 2008-2017.	The primary outcome was the frequency of antiplatelet therapy prescription at the point of index hospitalisation discharge each year during 2008-2017. Association between demographics, baseline comorbidities, procedures and antiplatelet prescription were examined as secondary outcome using multivariate logistic regression model, with commonly used antiplatelet groups selected for comparison.	Among the included 14 716 patients, 5888 (40.0%) discharged with aspirin alone, 6888 (46.8%) discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel, and 973 (6.6%) discharged with DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor. Prescribing rate of aspirin alone decreased substantially from 56.8% in 2008 to 27.5% in 2017. Utilisation of DAPT with clopidogrel increased from 33.7% in 2008 to 52.7% in 2017.

Parents invest a significant portion of their household income in their children's education. Private education has been considered to greatly affect students' psychology and behavior. However, past research has largely neglected to study parents who pay these costs. Since household income and education level are important determinants of socioeconomic status (SES), education expenditures are likely to cause depressive symptoms. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.	Data were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS, 2015, 2018). The sample analyzed consisted of 397 and 337 fathers and 403 and 370 mothers in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The independent variable in this study was the proportion of private education cost. This proportion was calculated by dividing each household's private education costs by its equivalized household disposable income (EHDI) and multiplying this number by 100. The main dependent variable was parental responses to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-11 (CESD-11). Using a generalized linear model, we investigated the effects of the proportion of private education cost on parental depression.	The results showed that fathers with higher proportions of private education cost exhibited higher CESD-11 scores compared to fathers with lower proportions cost (moderate: β = 0.419, S. E = 0.164, p = 0.0105; high: β = 0.476, S. E = 0.178, p = 0.0076), indicating that a higher ratio of private education cost may negatively affect depression in fathers. However, there was no discernable correlation between mothers' CESD-11 scores and the proportion of private education cost (moderate: β = - 0.078, S. E = 0.250, p = 0.7555; high: β = 0.003, S.

Age-related changes in obstacle avoidance were examined by comparing the foot kinematics of 105 older and 103 younger adults when stepping over an obstacle. The difference in the clearance between the leading and trailing limbs (Δ clearance) was calculated to determine the degree of decrement in the clearance of the trailing limb. A cognitive test battery was used to evaluate cognitive function among older adults to assess their association with Δ clearance. Older adults showed a significantly lower clearance of the trailing limb than young adults, resulting in greater Δ clearance. Significant correlations were observed between greater Δ clearance and scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and immediate recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory test. Therefore, memory functions may contribute to the control of trailing limb movements, which can secure a safety margin to avoid stumbling over an obstacle during obstacle avoidance locomotion."}

Use of ergots contributed to initial theories of migraine pathogenesis and provided the substrate for development of the triptans. Triptans are very efficacious for many migraineurs, and since their widespread use, use of ergots has significantly declined. Unfortunately, there remain many migraineurs who benefit little from triptans, yet respond very well to ergots. Discoveries in migraine pathophysiology have given us better understanding of the complex processes involved, although there remain many unknown factors in migraine treatment. Additional, unrecognized therapeutic targets may exist throughout the neuronal connections of the brainstem, cortex, and cerebral vasculature. Ergots interact with a broader spectrum of receptors than triptans. This lack of receptor specificity explains potential ergot side effects, but may also account for efficacy. The role of ergots in headache should be revisited, especially in view of newer ergot formulations with improved tolerability and side effect profiles, such as orally inhaled dihydroergotamine. Redefining where in the headache treatment spectrum ergots belong and deciding when they may be the optimal choice of treatment is necessary."}

Here we show that a deficiency of this DNA repair pathway in humans does not predispose to neoplasia or dysfunctions in rapidly replicating tissues, but instead causes spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) by affecting large, terminally differentiated, non-dividing neuronal cells. Using genome-wide linkage mapping and a positional candidate approach in a Saudi Arabian family affected with autosomal recessive SCAN1, we identified a homozygous mutation in TDP1 (A1478G) that results in the substitution of histidine 493 with an arginine residue. The His493 residue is conserved in TDP1 across species and is located in the active site of the enzyme. Protein modeling predicts that mutation of this amino acid to arginine will disrupt the symmetric structure of the active site. We propose that loss-of-function mutations in TDP1 may cause SCAN1 either by interfering with DNA transcription or by inducing apoptosis in postmitotic neurons."}

AD-type tau phosphoepitopes, detected by various monoclonal antibodies, are absent from normal adult neurons, but recent studies have shown that their expression may contribute to neuritogenesis and axon differentiation in the developing nervous system. Therefore, we have examined a brain nerve cell line that is spontaneously neuritogenic for possible expression of AD-type tau epitopes. The neuritogenic rat brain cell line B103 was found to constitutively produce two-AD related epitopes of tau, detected by cellular immunofluorescence studies with the PHF-1 and Alz-50 monoclonal antibodies. Biochemical studies showed that the antibodies bound to proteins within the molecular, weight range expected for phosphorylated tau isoforms. Further verification was established by use of tau antisense oligomers, which eliminated cellular immunofluorescence due to the AD-related monoclonals and polyclonal anti-tau but did not eliminate fluorescence due to anti-tubulin. Cells treated with tau antisense were not neurite-free. Neurites that remained, however, were abnormal, generally short and wavy in appearance. Cellular distribution of the tau epitopes was found to be particularly interesting. Alz-50 recognized only cytoplasmic tau whereas PHF-1 recognized nuclear tau as well as cytoplasmic. Thus, the two epitopes, are morphologically segregated within the cell. Because subcellular segregation of tau is compromised in Alzheimer's disease, mechanisms that segregate AD-type phosphotau epitopes in B103 cells may have relevance to this neurodegenerative disorder."}

The outcome measures needed to include physiological or psychological variables, measures of general health or quality of life.	Of the initial 7554 articles, 34 were included after the title, abstract, and full-text screening. Only six studies were designed as randomized-controlled trials. Most interventions were supported by technologies, mainly functional electrical stimulation (cycling or rowing). The duration of the intervention ranged from four to 52 weeks. Endurance and strength training interventions (and a combination of both) were performed and over 70% of studies resulted in health improvements.	Non-ambulatory people with severe motor impairments may benefit from physical activity interventions. However, the number of studies and their comparability is very limited. This indicates the need for future research with standard measures to develop evidence-based, specific recommendations for physical activity in this population.Key messagesPhysical activity interventions can have health benefits in non-ambulatory people with severe motor impairments.Even simple, low-tech interventions allow for health-enhancing training."}

Considering the limited knowledge regarding the immune mechanisms involved in narcolepsy whether related to flu vaccination or not and the recent progresses in cytokine measurement technology, we assessed 30 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors using the Luminex technology in either peripheral (serum) or central (CSF) compartments in a large population of 90 children and adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 in comparison to 58 non-hypocretin deficient hypersomniacs and 41 healthy controls. Furthermore, we compared their levels in patients with narcolepsy whether exposed to pandemic flu vaccine or not, and analyzed the effect of age, duration of disease and symptom severity. Comparison for sera biomarkers between narcolepsy (n = 84, 54 males, median age: 15.5 years old) and healthy controls (n = 41, 13 males, median age: 20 years old) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of several pro- and anti-inflammatory serum cytokines and growth factors with interferon-γ, CCL11, epidermal growth factor, and interleukin-2 receptor being independently associated with narcolepsy. Increased levels of interferon-γ, CCL11, and interleukin-12 were found when close to narcolepsy onset. After several adjustments, only one CSF biomarker differed between narcolepsy (n = 44, 26 males, median age: 15 years old) and non-hypocretin deficient hypersomnias (n = 57, 24 males, median age: 36 years old) with higher CCL 3 levels found in narcolepsy. Comparison for sera biomarkers between patients with narcolepsy who developed the disease post-pandemic flu vaccination (n = 36) to those without vaccination (n = 48) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of three cytokines, regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted, CXCL10, and CXCL9, being independently and significantly increased in the group exposed to the vaccine. No significant differences were found between narcoleptics whether exposed to flu vaccination or not for CSF biomarkers except for a lower CXCL10 level found in the exposed group. To conclude, we highlighted the role of sera cytokine with pro-inflammatory properties and especially interferon-γ being independently associated with narcolepsy close to disease onset. The activity of the interferon-γ network was also increased in the context of narcolepsy after the pandemic flu vaccination being a potential key player in the immune mechanism that triggers narcolepsy and that coordinates the immune response necessary for resolving vaccination assaults."}

TH insufficiency showed a decrease in the expression of parvalbumin (PV) in the cortex and hippocampus of pups at postnatal day (PD) 14, while treatment with thyroxine from PD 0 to PD 14 ameliorated the PV loss. On the other hand, treatment with antithyroid agents in adulthood did not result in a decrease in the expression of PV in these areas. These results indicate the existence of a critical period of TH action during the early postnatal period. A decrease in MeCP2-positive neuronal nuclei was also observed in the cortical layers II-IV of the cerebral cortex. The brains were then stained with CUX1, a marker for cortical layers II-IV. In comparison with normal mice, CUX1 signals were decreased in the somatosensory cortex of the hypothyroid mice, and the total thickness of cortical layers II-IV of the mice was lower than that of normal mice. These results suggest that TH insufficiency during the perinatal period strongly and broadly affects neuronal development."}

A regional cohort of 81 of 84 ELBW survivors born between 1980 and 1982 were reassessed at age 8 years by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R), and tests of motor function. The association of FKSB risk status and WRAT-R reading subtest for predicting general reading disability in the overall sample at age 8 years resulted in a sensitivity of 0.68, specificity of 0.48, and a likelihood ratio of 1.3. Of the 43 'normal' children at age 5 years with no neurosensory impairments and IQ > or = 84 (McCarthy GCI), 49% were considered to be at 'mild' to 'high' risk for future LD. The prevalence of specific LD (reading disorder) at age 8 years in children with normal IQ (WISC-R > or = 85) was 28%. The positive predictive value of the 5-year FKSB for identifying children with specific LD at age 8 years was 0.20 (sensitivity 0.33, specificity 0.48).

In nine of the children who had not required shunts the distribution of intelligence was within the normal range. The need for a shunt was significantly related to the presence of craniolacunae and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Seven of the 74 shunt-treated children had suffered ventriculitis, meningitis or septicaemia, and their intelligence was significantly worse than the others. In the 67 shunt-treated children who had not suffered infection, intelligence was significantly related to the thickness of the pallium when the shunt was inserted during the first four weeks of life, and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Intelligence was not related to the function of the shunt at time of assessment, to the number of revisions of the shunt, or to the rate of increase in head size during the first four weeks of life. It is concluded that the best indication of later intelligence can be gained at birth from the thickness of the pallium and the sensory level of the lesion."}

FISH study confirmed these rearrangements and array CGH analysis estimated the loss sizes to at least 635 kb on chromosome 17 and to 15.6 Mb on chromosome 21. The absence of lissencephaly and major brain malformations often associated with 17p terminal deletions could be attributed to the retention of PAFAH1B1, YWHAE and CRK genes. Dysmorphic features, moderate mental impairment and minor brain malformations could result from the 21q monosomy and particularly the partial deletion of the APP-SOD1 region. Azoospermia should result from gamete apoptosis induced by a control mechanism triggered in response to chromosome imbalances. Our study provides an additional case for better understanding and delineating both 17p and 21q deletions."}

Histone acetylation has been shown to be a key process in sevoflurane-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities. Here, we investigated whether histone acetylation regulates the interaction between autophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome in models of sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Aged C57BL/6 J mice and cultured primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 2 h. Hippocampal tissue samples and hippocampal neurons were harvested. The processes of histone acetylation and autophagy and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome were observed using western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in both the mouse hippocampus and primary neurons. Concomitantly, sevoflurane upregulated components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and IL-1β) by promoting autophagic degradation in the aging brain. Cognitive deficits and inadequate autophagy induced by sevoflurane were reversed and NLRP3 inflammasome activation was inhibited by SAHA. Treatment with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, eliminated the neuroprotective effects of SAHA on improving cognition in mice, activating autophagy and downregulating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Based on these results, histone acetylation activates autophagy plays an important role in inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome to protect the host from excessive neuroinflammation and sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction in the aging brain."}

Near miss incidents (NMI) that did not result in death have a crucial role in understanding risk factors in custody. Such research has not previously been undertaken. A program of research has been developed to study NMI, in order to better identify those at risk in police custody. For the purposes of this research, NMI have been defined as 'an unplanned and unforeseeable or unforeseen event that could have resulted, but did not result, in human death or may have resulted in injury or other adverse outcomes'. It was intended that the definition although broad, would not include simple accidents (e.g. slipping on urine in a cell) or trivial injury.	The two aims of the study are (a) to determine whether it is realistic to attempt to assess NMI with the intention of identifying information of use in enhancing detainee care and (b) to assess how frequently NMIs occur and whether there are specific patterns. Pilot interviews were conducted with three forensic physicians practising in London, UK to create a structured questionnaire for all forensic physicians working in London. The questionnaire provided the basis of a retrospective recall survey of all forensic physicians working in London as Forensic Medical Examiners. The questionnaire was designed to assess the numbers of NMI, patterns in occurrence and relevant learning points within the previous 6 months. A covering letter, background questionnaire (exploring the background of the medical practitioner), copies of the survey, and reply paid envelopes were sent to each Forensic Medical Examiner (n=134) in London, contracted to provide forensic medical services for the Metropolitan Police Service. Data about all incidents were anonymized.	Ninety six (73%) Forensic Medical Examiners responded. Of these 18% were Principal grade, the remainder were Senior (24%), Standard (35%) and Assistant (23%). Thirty eight NMI were reported by 27 Forensic Medical Examiners (of all levels). The initial reason for police contact was recorded as alcohol (n=8), theft and robbery (n=7), warrants (n=4), violence (n=3), traffic violations (n=2) and single cases of drugs, murder and immigration offences. Of the main perceived cause of each NMI, illicit drugs were involved in 12/38, alcohol in 17/38, deliberate self-harm in 11/38, issues concerning searches, checks or rousing in 8/38, failure of inter-agency communications in 5/38, and possible resource issues in 4/38. In a number of cases more than one factor was involved.	The information established about NMI is broadly consistent with documented patterns of deaths in police custody in England and Wales which supports the validity of the data. The next stage of this research will be a prospective six month study in which NMI will be analysed in order to learn lessons which may be utilised to attempt to prevent potentially avoidable deaths in police custody."}

We performed a literary search of the PubMed database for articles published relating to GBM and depression. A total of 85 articles were identified with 46 meeting inclusion criteria. Depression significantly impacts care, decreasing medication compliance, and patient survival. Diagnostically, because depression and GBM share intricate neuro-connectivity in a way that effect functionality, these diseases can be mistaken for alternative psychological or pathological disorders, complicating care. Therapeutically, anti-depressants have anti-tumor properties; yet, some have been shown to interfere with GBM treatment. One reason for this is that the pathophysiological development of depression and GBM share several pathways including altered regulation of the 5-HT receptor, norepinephrine, and 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. Over time, depression can persist after GBM treatment, affecting patient quality of life. Together, depression and GBM are complicated concomitant diseases. Clinicians must be aware of their co-existence. Because of overlapping molecular pathways involved in both diseases, careful medication selection is imperative to avoid potential adverse interactions. Since GBMs are the most common primary brain cancer, physicians dealing with this disease should be prepared for the development of depression as a potential sequela of this condition, given the related pathophysiology and the known poor outcomes."}

Here, we examined signaling events in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and searched for therapeutic agents that could overcome TRAIL resistance in glioma cells. TRAIL induced apoptosis through death receptor 5 (DR5) and was mediated by caspase-8-initiated extrinsic and intrinsic mitochondrial pathways in sensitive glioma cell lines. TRAIL also triggered apoptosis in resistant glioma cell lines through the same pathways, but only if the cells were pretreated with chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin, camptothecin and etoposide. Previous studies suggested that this was due to an increase in DR5 expression in wild-type TP53 cells, but this mechanism did not account for cells with mutant TP53. Here, we show that a more general effect of these agents is to downregulate caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP(S) (the short form of cellular Fas-associated death domain-fike interleukin-1-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein) and up-regulate Bak, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, independently of cell's TP53 status.

This need motivated the present initiative to use data from a uniquely large patient population and design a novel methodology to achieve a risk determination with unprecedented accuracy. The authors also aimed to determine the impact of sex, pregnancy, AVM volume, and location on the risk for AVM rupture.METHODSThe present study does not consider any specific management of the AVMs, but only uses the age distribution for the first hemorrhage, the shape of which becomes universal for a sufficiently large set of patients. For this purpose, the authors collected observations, including age at first hemorrhage and AVM size and location, in 3425 patients. The average annual risk for hemorrhage could then be determined from the simple relation that the number of patients with their first hemorrhage at a specific age equals the risk for hemorrhage times the number of patients at risk at that age. For a subset of the patients, the information regarding occurrence of AVM hemorrhage after treatment of the first hemorrhage was used for further analysis of the influence on risk from AVM location and pregnancy.RESULTSThe age distribution for the first AVM hemorrhage was used to determine the average annual risk for hemorrhage in unruptured AVMs at adult ages (25-60 years). It was concluded to be 3.1% ± 0.2% and unrelated to AVM volume but influenced by its location, with the highest risk for centrally located AVMs. The hemorrhage risk was found to be significantly higher for females in their fertile years.CONCLUSIONSThe present methodology allowed the authors to determine the average annual risk for the first AVM hemorrhage at 3.1% ± 0.2% without the need for individual patient follow-up. This methodology has potential also for other similar types of investigations. The conclusion that centrally located AVMs carry a higher risk was confirmed by follow-up information. Follow-up information was also used to conclude that pregnancy causes a substantially greater AVM hemorrhage risk. The age distribution for AVM hemorrhage is incompatible with AVMs present at birth having the same hemorrhage risk as AVMs in adults. Plausibly, they instead develop in the early years of life, possibly with a lower hemorrhage risk during that time period."}

Overall, 44.2% (n = 23) of the study participants screened positive on the SDS-khat, indicating probable khat dependence. Screening positive for khat dependence was associated with increased risk for khat use frequency in the last 30 days (adjusted prevalence risk ratio [APRR] = 2.26, 95% CI [1.23, 4.15], p = .009), experiencing three or more psychological health problems (APRR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.04, 3.36], p = .037), and experiencing two or more physical health problems (APRR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.13, 3.27], p = .016) after using khat.	Screening positive on the SDS-khat is associated with increased recent khat use frequency and elevated physical and psychological health problems, providing preliminary evidence that probable khat use dependence may be associated with an increased risk of harm in Australia.

Despite a strong relationship between these 2 important factors in population health, there are few studies quantifying the mortality risk associated with their co-occurrence in the general population. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality according to self-reported mental health problems and alcohol intake in the general population.	We followed 243,372 participants in Norwegian health surveys (1994-2002) through 2014 for all-cause and CVD mortality by data linkage to national registries. The mean (SD) age at the time of participation in the survey was 43.9 (10.6) years, and 47.8% were men. During a mean (SD) follow-up period of 16.7 (3.2) years, 6,587 participants died from CVD, and 21,376 died from all causes. Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs according to a mental health index (low, 1.00-1.50; high, 2.01-4.00; low score is favourable) based on the General Health Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and according to self-reported alcohol intake (low, <2; light, 2-11.99; moderate, 12-23.99; high, ≥24 grams/day). HRs were adjusted for age, sex, educational level, marital status, and CVD risk factors. Compared to a reference group with low mental health index score and low alcohol intake, HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality were 0.93 (0.89, 0.97; p = 0.001), 1.00 (0.92, 1.09; p = 0.926), and 1.14 (0.96, 1.35; p = 0.119) for low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. HRs (95% CIs) were 1.22 (1.14, 1.31; p < 0.001), 1.24 (1.15, 1.33; p < 0.001), 1.43 (1.23, 1.66; p < 0.001), and 2.29 (1.87, 2.80; p < 0.001) for high index score combined with low, light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. For CVD mortality, HRs (95% CIs) were 0.93 (0.86, 1.00; p = 0.058), 0.90 (0.76, 1.07; p = 0.225), and 0.95 (0.67, 1.33; p = 0.760) for a low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively, and 1.11 (0.98, 1.25; p = 0.102), 0.97 (0.83, 1.13; p = 0.689), 1.01 (0.71, 1.44; p = 0.956), and 1.78 (1.14, 2.78; p = 0.011) for high index score combined with low, light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. HRs for the combination of a high index score and high alcohol intake (HRs: 2.29 for all-cause and 1.78 for CVD mortality) were 64% (95% CI 53%, 74%; p < 0.001) and 69% (95% CI 42%, 97%; p < 0.001) higher than expected for all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, respectively, under the assumption of a multiplicative interaction structure.

To report our single-centre preliminary experience, focusing on feasibility, safety and short-term efficacy of this procedure.	Patients implanted from December 2013 to February 2014 were included. The procedure, performed under general anaesthesia, was guided by fluoroscopy and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Efficacy was defined as the ability to implant the WM with no peridevice leak; safety was defined as the occurrence of in-hospital and 45-day events, including stroke, pericardial effusion and device migration.	Twenty-three patients (mean age: 77.6 years; 16 men [69.6%]; mean CHA2DS2-VASc score: 5) underwent WM implantation. The indication was gastrointestinal bleeding in 14 (60.9%) patients, cerebral haemorrhage in eight (34.8%) and need for long-term ticagrelor after stent thrombosis on clopidgrel in one (4.3%). Procedural success was 95.7% (95% confidence interval: 77.3-100.0); efficacy was 90.9% (95% confidence interval: 71.0-98.7). The size of the implanted WATCHMAN™ device was in agreement with the prespecified size, based on measurement of the LAA, in 56.5% of cases. In five cases, the criteria were not met, but the device was successfully implanted in four of these, with a good result (80.0%). Treatment at discharge was a reduced dose of anticoagulant plus aspirin in three cases (13.0%) or antiplatelet therapy alone in 20 cases (90.9%). No adverse event occurred during the index hospitalization or at 45 days. At 45 days, the LAA was sealed in 18/19 patients (94.7%) on TOE, with no difference between those who did or did not have an implanted device of the prespecified size.	When performed by an operator trained in the procedure, WM implantation appears to be safe and effective.

Using molecular and behavioral assessments of mice that carry null or tissue-specific mutations of Slc12a2, we found that inner ear dysfunction causes motor hyperactivity by increasing in the nucleus accumbens the levels of phosphorylated adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein (pCREB) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), key mediators of neurotransmitter signaling and plasticity. Hyperactivity was remedied by local administration of the pERK inhibitor SL327.

A sample of 52 older adults underwent neuropsychological assessments, including CompCog, and medical appointments, to be classified as a control group or be diagnosed with MCI. The accuracy of CompCog for distinguishing between the two groups was calculated.	The results from diagnostic accuracy analyses showed that the AUCs of ROC curves were as high as 0.915 (CI 0.837-0.993).

How this mutation leads to these neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Here, we show using patient stem cell-derived motor neurons that the repeat expansion impairs microtubule-based transport, a process critical for neuronal survival. Cargo transport defects are recapitulated by treating neurons from healthy individuals with proline-arginine and glycine-arginine dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced from the repeat expansion. Both arginine-rich DPRs similarly inhibit axonal trafficking in adult Drosophila neurons in vivo. Physical interaction studies demonstrate that arginine-rich DPRs associate with motor complexes and the unstructured tubulin tails of microtubules. Single-molecule imaging reveals that microtubule-bound arginine-rich DPRs directly impede translocation of purified dynein and kinesin-1 motor complexes. Collectively, our study implicates inhibitory interactions of arginine-rich DPRs with axonal transport machinery in C9orf72-associated ALS/FTD and thereby points to potential therapeutic strategies."}

The hallmark symptom of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is acute orthostatic headache; however, clinical presentations can be heterogeneous. New evidence shows that lumbar puncture is not always necessary or sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Some patients may have normal opening pressure, which suggests that insufficiency of CSF volume (hypovolemia) rather than CSF pressure might be the underlying mechanism. Several neuroimaging modalities can aid in diagnosis and localization of the CSF leakage, including brain MRI, spinal MRI, CT myelography, digital subtraction myelography, and radionuclide cisternography. Complications, such as subdural hematoma, can lead to a change in the headache pattern and potentially life-threatening consequences. Conservative treatments, such as fluid supplementation, can provide temporary relief; however, epidural blood patches, especially targeted ones, are more effective and definitive. For patients with refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension, surgical repair of spinal CSF leakages should be considered.

We have thus compared the effects of a single hydroxydopamine bilateral striatal lesion (SB-hydroxydopamine) with those of a double hydroxydopamine bilateral lesion (DB-hydroxydopamine) at the same dose (16 microg/striatum) by HPLC determination of dopamine and 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (dopac) levels in the striatum. Two weeks after neurosurgery, SB-hydroxydopamine and DB-hydroxydopamine induced dopaminergic depletion of at least 81% compared with control groups. After eight weeks striatal dopaminergic depletion was only 60.97% in SB-hydroxydopamine rats, suggesting a compensatory phenomenon, whereas in DB-hydroxydopamine rats dopaminergic loss was stable at 88%. For the DB-hydroxydopamine group the dopac/dopamine ratio was significantly increased at week 2 only, whereas no significant change was observed for other groups. This increase might be explained by increased dopamine turnover. We have demonstrated that striatal DB-hydroxydopamine injection induces lasting 80-100% neuronal loss, close to that observed in the disease in man, without induced mortality, and provides a tool which meets our experimental requirements."}

From desk review, 145 (11.4%) patients had history of CPD non-medical use and 36 (2.8%) had used illicit drugs. Of 988 patients who provided urine, 166 (16.8%) self-medicated CPDs, particularly benzodiazepines while 12 (1.2%) used illicit drugs.

Histopathological analyses of spinal cords in animals with ischemic spastic paraplegia show a selective loss of small inhibitory interneurons in previously ischemic segments but with a continuing presence of ventral alpha-motoneurons and descending cortico-spinal and rubro-spinal projections. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of human spinal stem cells (hSSCs) implanted spinally in rats with fully developed ischemic paraplegia on the recovery of motor function and corresponding changes in motor evoked potentials. In addition the optimal time frame for cell grafting after ischemia and the optimal dosing of grafted cells were also studied. Spinal cord ischemia was induced for 10 min using aortic occlusion and systemic hypotension. In the functional recovery study, hSSCs (10,000-30,000 cells/0.5 mul/injection) were grafted into spinal central gray matter of L2-L5 segments at 21 days after ischemia. Animals were immunosuppressed with Prograf (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg) for the duration of the study. After cell grafting the recovery of motor function was assessed periodically using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system and correlated with the recovery of motor evoked potentials. At predetermined times after grafting (2-12 weeks), animals were perfusion-fixed and the survival, and maturation of implanted cells were analyzed using antibodies recognizing human-specific antigens: nuclear protein (hNUMA), neural cell adhesion molecule (hMOC), neuron-specific enolase (hNSE) and synapthophysin (hSYN) as well as the non-human specific antibodies TUJ1, GFAP, GABA, GAD65 and GLYT2. After cell grafting a time-dependent improvement in motor function and suppression of spasticity and rigidity was seen and this improvement correlated with the recovery of motor evoked potentials. Immunohistochemical analysis of grafted lumbar segments at 8 and 12 weeks after grafting revealed intense hNSE immunoreactivity, an extensive axo-dendritic outgrowth as well as rostrocaudal and dorsoventral migration of implanted hNUMA-positive cells. An intense hSYN immunoreactivity was identified within the grafts and in the vicinity of persisting alpha-motoneurons. On average, 64% of hSYN terminals were GAD65 immunoreactive which corresponded to GABA immunoreactivity identified in 40-45% of hNUMA-positive grafted cells. The most robust survival of grafted cells was seen when cells were grafted 21 days after ischemia. As defined by cell survival and laminar distribution, the optimal dose of injected cells was 10,000-30,000 cells per injection. These data indicate that spinal grafting of hSSCs can represent an effective therapy for patients with spinal ischemic paraplegia."}

OPC differentiation requires significant genetic reprogramming, implicating chromatin remodeling. Mounting evidence indicates that chromatin remodelers play important roles during normal development and their mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental defects, with CHD7 haploinsuficiency being the cause of CHARGE syndrome and CHD8 being one of the strongest autism spectrum disorder (ASD) high-risk-associated genes. Herein, we report on uncharacterized functions of the chromatin remodelers Chd7 and Chd8 in OPCs. Their OPC-chromatin binding profile, combined with transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analyses of Chd7-deleted OPCs, demonstrates that Chd7 protects nonproliferative OPCs from apoptosis by chromatin closing and transcriptional repression of p53 Furthermore, Chd7 controls OPC differentiation through chromatin opening and transcriptional activation of key regulators, including Sox10, Nkx2.2, and Gpr17 However, Chd7 is dispensable for oligodendrocyte stage progression, consistent with Chd8 compensatory function, as suggested by their common chromatin-binding profiles and genetic interaction. Finally, CHD7 and CHD8 bind in OPCs to a majority of ASD risk-associated genes, suggesting an implication of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in ASD neurological defects. Our results thus offer new avenues to understand and modulate the CHD7 and CHD8 functions in normal development and disease."}

Therefore, we investigated the influence of acute hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia induced by glucose or insulin infusion on neuronal and humoral control of vascular tone in rats. Euglycemic male Wistar rats were pithed under anesthesia and arterial blood pressure was measured. Changes in vascular responses to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and intravenous bolus injections of noradrenaline, angiotensin II, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were studied by infusing various concentrations of glucose or insulin. Continuous glucose infusion, which increased both blood glucose and serum insulin levels, significantly augmented adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses to SCS without affecting pressor responses to injection of noradrenaline or angiotensin II. In pithed rats with artificially increased blood pressure and blockade of autonomic outflow, glucose infusion attenuated CGRPergic nerve-depressor responses to SCS without affecting depressor responses to injection of CGRP, acetylcholine or SNP. In pithed rats treated with octreotide, which increased blood glucose without increasing serum insulin levels, glucose infusion caused only significant augmentation of adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses. Combined infusion of insulin and glucose, which resulted in increased serum insulin levels with euglycemia, significantly augmented adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses and attenuated CGRPergic nerve-mediated depressor responses.

The primary aim of the current study was to assess whether Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is efficacious in reducing emotional reactivity to social evaluative threat in a clinical sample with recurrent depression. A secondary aim was to assess whether improvement in emotional reactivity mediates improvements in depressive symptoms. Fifty-two individuals with partially remitted depression were randomized into an 8-week MBCT course or a waitlist control condition. All participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) before and after the 8-week trial period. Emotional reactivity to stress was assessed with the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory at several time points before, during, and after the stressor. MBCT was associated with decreased emotional reactivity to social stress, specifically during the recovery (post-stressor) phase of the TSST.

Improvements in emotional reactivity partially mediated improvements in depressive symptoms. Limitations include small sample size, lack of objective or treatment adherence measures, and non-generalizability to more severely depressed populations.

Patients who underwent closed treatment of a distal fibula fracture served as a comparative group. We evaluated peritreatment and posttreatment opioid prescription fills. The primary outcome, new persistent opioid use, was defined as opioid prescription fulfillment between 91 and 180 days after the procedure. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of patient factors, and the differences of the effect were tested using Wald statistics. The adjusted persistent use rates were calculated. A total of 13 088 patients underwent treatment of an ankle fracture and filled a peritreatment opioid prescription.	When compared with closed treatment of a distal fibula fracture, only 2 surgical treatment subtypes demonstrated significantly increased rates of persistent use compared with the closed treatment group: open treatment of bimalleolar ankle fracture (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.58; P = .002) and open treatment of trimalleolar ankle fracture with fixation of posterior lip (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04-2.07; P = .027).

We describe two young men with various neurological symptoms after traffic accident, who were diagnosed with Barrè-Lièou syndrome. Both case 1 (41-year-old man) and case 2 (34-year-old man) showed no abnormal findings in head and cervical X-ray, CT-scan and MRI. Only radionuclide cisternography (RNC) showed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak into epidural space at thoracolumbar level. Three months (case 1) and four years (case 2) had passed after each accident. Two patients underwent epidural blood patch (EBP) for total of three times. The average volumes of the blood used for EBP were 30 ml (case 1) and 24 ml (case 2). The procedure improved various symptoms except for neck stiffness and dizziness. EBP had led to low back pain, which disappeared within three days. CSF leak vanished in RNC after EBP. Severe complication, for example epidural infection or neurological disorders due to hematoma, was not noticed. While neural blockade did not relieve pain before EBP, we could get good effect from neural blockade for remaining symptoms after EBP. We consider that Barrè-Lièou syndrome is due to CSF leak and EBP may be one of the useful treatments."}

The concept of agitation is not well defined. In addition, there exists much confusion about the characteristics and boundaries of agitation, as well as the distinction between agitation and related concepts. Recently developed theoretical models for agitation in dementia require new interpretation and conceptualization of agitation.	Morse's method of critical appraisal of the literature was used. In addition, some parts of Rodgers' evolutionary method were employed. Data were selected using six electronic databases and the key words 'agitation', 'agitated', 'dementia', 'demented' and 'Alzheimer'. The analysis included 86 empirical or theoretical papers and one book.	A transition from the observer's perspective to the patient's perspective in the interpretation of agitation was found. Five critical attributes of agitation in dementia were identified: excessive, inappropriate, repetitive, non-specific and observable. Patient factors, interpersonal factors, environmental factors and restraint were identified as precipitating antecedents. Mediating antecedents included discomfort, unmet need and misinterpretation. Consequences of agitation were identified at the levels of patient, caregiver and others.	This transition in perspectives has important implications as it can change health providers' attitudes and responses to agitation and lead to patient-focused and individualized care. Researchers and clinicians are encouraged to avoid labelling agitated behaviour as 'disturbing behaviour'."}

We conducted a randomized controlled trial (n = 1,719) in south-eastern Hungary in 62 antepartum centers.

Our intervention appeared to significantly reduce the risk of PPD, as defined by Leverton Questionnaire total scores (OR = 0.69). It resulted in an absolute risk reduction of about 18% in those with antepartum depression and 0.5% in those with no depression at recruitment. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a much reduced risk in those with a perceived lack of partner support (OR = 0.4) in the treatment group. Unplanned pregnancy, an irreversible risk factor affecting every fifth woman, also seemed to have a reduced effect on PPD after our group intervention (OR = 0.81).	A brief preventive antepartum group intervention focusing on psychoeducation, stress management, improving coping mechanisms, and the development of social support can be effective in reducing postpartum depressive symptomatology."}

In this study we compared platelet MAO activity with phospholipid composition in a group of normals and chronic paranoid schizophrenics. The phospholipids in platelets and erythrocytes were extracted and separated by high-performance liquid chromatography into major classes phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and PS. The paranoid subjects showed statistically significantly lower MAO activity as well as higher mean levels of PS and lower levels of PC in both platelets and erythrocytes, consistent with our hypothesis.

We used message levels of the growth-associated protein, GAP-43, as a marker of axonal plasticity to examine the hypothesis of defective neuronal plasticity in AD. When all AD cases are combined, the average level of GAP-43 message in area 9 of the AD frontal association cortex was not significantly different from the level in the comparably aged control cortex. Differentiation of AD cases on the basis of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) density revealed that in AD cases with high tangle density average GAP-43 message level was reduced fivefold relative to levels in AD cases with low NFT density. AD cases with low neurofibrillary tangle density had levels of GAP-43 message that were not significantly different from the levels of normal controls. Differentiation of AD cases on the basis of neuritic plaque density did not indicate as strong a relationship to GAP-43 message level. The association between neurofibrillary tangle density and GAP-43 message level suggests the hypothesis that neurofibrillary tangles may reduce GAP-43 expression. Data of others show a relationship between high NFT density and reduced levels of synaptophysin-like immunoreactivity and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism. These data combine to suggest a set of AD cases with high NFT density, reduced axonal plasticity, reduced synaptic density, and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism--all variables that may be directly related to the functioning of the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein is a consistent feature of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob at autopsy and has also been demonstrated in the pre-clinical phase. Immunohistochemical accumulation of prion protein in the lymphoreticular system remains the only technique that has been shown to predict neurological disease reliably in animal prion disorders. In this study, immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate the presence of prion protein, with monoclonal antibodies KG9 and 3F4, in surgically removed tonsillectomy and appendicectomy specimens. The samples were collected from histopathology departments across the UK and anonymised prior to testing. Samples were tested from 16 703 patients (14 964 appendectomies, 1739 tonsillectomies), approximately 60% of whom were from the age group 20-29 years at operation. Twenty-five per cent of the samples were excluded from the final analyses because they contained inadequate amounts of lymphoid tissue. Three appendicectomy samples showed lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein, giving an estimated prevalence of 3/12 674 or 237 per million (95% CI 49-692 per million). The pattern of lymphoreticular accumulation in two of these samples was dissimilar from that seen in known cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Although it is uncertain whether immunohistochemical accumulation of prion protein in the lymphoreticular system is specific for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, it has not been described in any other disease, including other forms of human prion disease or a range of inflammatory and infective conditions. These findings reinforce the importance of measures taken by the UK Department of Health to reduce the risk of spread of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob via blood products and surgical instruments, and of the urgency to proceed with large-scale screening of fresh tonsil specimens for the presence of prion protein."}

To investigate this apparent contradiction we analyzed spontaneous speech in 67 parent-child dyads from a longitudinal corpus (30 minutes of play activities at 6 visits over 2 years). We included 32 children with autism and 35 linguistically matched TD children (mean age at recruitment 32.76 and 20.27 months). We found a small number of exact repetitions in both groups (roughly 1% of utterances across visits), which increased over time in children with autism and decreased in the TD group. Partial repetitions were much more frequent: children reused caregivers' words at high rates regardless of diagnostic group (24% of utterances at first visit), and this increased in frequency (but not level) over time, faster for TD children (at final visit: 33% for autism, 40% for TD). The same happened for partial repetition of syntax and semantic alignment. However, chance alignment (as measured by surrogate pairs) also increased and findings for developmental changes were reliable only for syntactic and semantic alignment. Children with richer linguistic abilities also displayed a higher tendency to partially re-use their caregivers' language (alignment rates and semantic alignment). This highlights that all children commonly re-used the words, syntax, and topics of their caregivers, albeit with some quantitative differences, and that most repetition was at least potentially productive, with repeated language being re-contextualized and integrated with non-repeated language. The salience of echolalia in ASD might be partially explained by slight differences in frequency, amplified by lower semantic alignment, persistence over time, and expectations of echolalia. More in-depth qualitative and quantitative analyses of how repetitions are used and received in context are needed."}

In transient ischemia model, rats were subjected to a 1.5-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The administration of PF (2.5 and 5 mg kg(-1), s.c.) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both neurological impairment and the histologically measured infarction volume. Similar results were also obtained when PF (2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was given in permanent ischemia model. The neuroprotective effect of PF (10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was abolished by pretreatment of DPCPX (0.25 mg kg(-1), s.c.), a selective adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) antagonist. PF (10, 40, and 160 mg kg(-1), i.v.) had no effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rates (HR) in the conscious rat. Additionally, PF (10(-3) mol l(-1)) had no effect on noradrenaline- (NA-) or high K+ concentration-induced contractions of isolated rabbit primary artery. In competitive binding experiments, PF did not compete with the binding of [3H]DPCPX, but displaced the binding of [3H]NECA to the membrane preparation of rat cerebral cortex. This binding manner was distinguished from the classical A1R agonists. The results demonstrated that activation of A1R might be involved in PF-induced neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia in rat. However, PF had no 'well-known' cardiovascular side effects of classical A1R agonists. The results suggest that PF might have the potential therapeutic value as an anti-stroke drug."}

Recent studies revealed that Hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated glycolysis is one of the sources, as the association of chemoresistance and the expression of HK2 was confirmed in multiple cancers. However, there has been little knowledge of the functional contribution of HK2 to TMZ resistance in GBM. In our study, we found that HK2 expression is crucial for GBM proliferation and chemoresistance. In contrast to the healthy brain, HK2 expression is much higher in human GBM, especially in those patients with GBM recurrence. High HK2 expression is negatively related to the overall survival in GBM patients. HK2 depletion in GBM cells suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to TMZ-induced apoptosis. Both HK2-mediated glycolysis and mitochondria permeability transition pore opening (MPTP) were associated with its function in chemoresistance. Furthermore, we also revealed that the abnormal expression of HK2 was modulated by the expression of HOTAIR, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The absence of HOTAIR in GBM cells suppressed the HK2 expression in protein and mRNA level and, therefore, inhibited the cell proliferation and enhanced the cytotoxicity of TMZ both in vivo and in vitro. HOTAIR promoted the expression of HK2 by targeting mir-125, which suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased the TMZ-induced apoptosis. These findings shed light on a new therapeutic strategy in modulating HOTAIR/miR-125, which may interfere with the expression of HK2, and enhance the therapeutic sensitivity of GBM to TMZ."}

Accordingly, impairments in context processing are thought to underlie cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, a clinical disorder that has been linked to PFC dysfunction (Servan-Schreiber et al., 1996). However, task switching, a cognitive ability linked to PFC function, has not been consistently impaired in schizophrenia. In this experiment, we assessed whether task-switching performance would be selectively impaired for patients when context demands were high. In the rule-switching condition, a switch required the updating of the relevant task response rules whereas perceptual switching did not entail a switching of contextual information. Instead, a perceptual switch entailed a shift of visuospatial attention to the relevant feature. A second goal was to determine whether potential deficits in context switching would be observed in schizophrenia even in situations when these patients do not need to overcome a prepotent response. Studies of context processing have typically required patients with schizophrenia to use contextual rules to overcome prepotent response tendencies whereas our switching paradigm did not require the inhibition of a competing response. Patients were much slower to switch tasks than controls when contextual rules switched from one trial to the next whereas their performance was intact when the switch occurred between different feature sets and contextual demands were low. Our results demonstrate that context processing deficits are observable in schizophrenia even when there is no prepotent response tendency to inhibit. Moreover, our results suggest that PFC impairments influence performance primarily when patients are required to switch the application of one explicit rule to another."}

The sexual quality of life of spouses of elderly patients suffering from a major depressive disorder was significantly impaired. The patients' and spouses' depression and the caregivers' burden also had a negative impact on several aspects of the HRQoL of the spouses.

Between November 2013 and April 2014, 109 women in their third trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at Ghent University Hospital. Dyspareunia, sexual functioning and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated at enrolment and again 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Sexual functioning and QOL were assessed using validated self-report questionnaires: the Female Sexual Function Index and the Short Form-36 health survey. Dyspareunia was evaluated by a specific self-developed questionnaire.	One hundred and nine women were enrolled; respectively, 71 (65.1%), 66 (60.6%) and 64 (58.7%) women returned the questionnaires prepartum, and 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Sexual functioning at 6 weeks was predictive of sexual functioning at 6 months postpartum (rs = 0.345, p = .015). The prevalence of dyspareunia in the third trimester of pregnancy, and 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum was, respectively, 32.8%, 51.0% and 40.7%. The severity of pain decreased significantly between 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum (p = .003). In the first 6 weeks postpartum, the degree of dyspareunia was significantly associated with breastfeeding (p = .045) and primiparity (p = .020). At 6 months, only the association with primiparity remained significant (p = .022).	The impaired postpartum sexual functioning, the high prevalence of dyspareunia postpartum and their impact on QOL indicate the need for further investigation and extensive counselling of pregnant women, especially primiparous women, about sexuality after childbirth."}

Its pathophysiology remains unclear. PANDAS has been proposed to result from cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against GABHS with brain antigens, but the targets of these antibodies are unclear and may be heterogeneous. We developed an in vivo assay in mice to characterize the cellular targets of antibodies in serum from individuals with PANDAS. We focus on striatal interneurons, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of tic disorders. Sera from children with well-characterized PANDAS (n = 5) from a previously described clinical trial (NCT01281969), and matched controls, were infused into the striatum of mice; antibody binding to interneurons was characterized using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Antibodies from children with PANDAS bound to ∼80% of cholinergic interneurons, significantly higher than the <50% binding seen with matched healthy controls. There was no elevated binding to two different populations of GABAergic interneurons (PV and nNOS-positive), confirming the specificity of this phenomenon. Elevated binding to cholinergic interneurons resolved in parallel with symptom improvement after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Antibody-mediated dysregulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons may be a locus of pathology in PANDAS. Future clarification of the functional consequences of this specific binding may identify new opportunities for intervention in children with this condition."}

Galectin-1(Gal1) is a lectin that is expressed in damaged brain areas after ischemia. Here, we characterized the detailed Gal1 expression pattern in an animal model of brain ischemia. After brain ischemia, Gal1 was expressed in reactive astrocytes within and around the infarcted region, and its expression diminished over time. Previously, we showed that infusion of human Gal1 protein (hGal1) resulted in functional recovery after brain ischemia but failed to reduce the volume of the ischemic region. This prompted us to examine whether the combination of hNSPCs-transplantation and stable delivery of hGal1 around the ischemic region could reduce the ischemic volume and promote better functional recovery after brain ischemia. In this study, we transplanted hNSPCs that stably overexpressed hGal1 (hGal1-hNSPCs) in a model of unilateral focal brain ischemia using Mongolian gerbils. Indeed, we found that transplantation of hGal1-hNSPCs both reduced the ischemic volume and improved deficits in motor function after brain ischemia to a greater extent than the transplantation of hNSPCs alone. This study provides evidence for a potential application of hGal1 with hNSPCs-transplantation in the treatment of brain ischemia."}

Here we show that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of early diffusion-weighted lesion maps can be used to accurately predict long-term recovery of tactile object recognition (TOR) in 35 subjects with varying hand skill impairment and associated specific daily activity limitation after cortical sensori-motor stroke. Multiple regression analysis revealed the essentially dysfunctional subprocesses for object recognition in the specifically impaired subjects, i.e., grasping as determined by a subtest of Jebsen Taylor hand function test, and perception of macrogeometrical object properties. The Gaussian process regression of MVPA represents a function that relates a selection of lesioned voxels as input variables to TOR performance scores as target variables. On the behavioural level, patients fell into three recovery subgroups, depending on TOR performance over the observation period. Only baseline motor hand skill and shape discrimination were significantly correlated with the TOR trajectories. To define functionally meaningful voxels, we combined information from MVPA of lesion maps and a priori knowledge of regions of interest derived from a data bank for shape recognition. A high significance for the predicted TOR performances over nine months could be verified by permutation tests, leading us to expect that the model generalises to larger patient cohorts with first cortical ischemic stroke. The lesion sites of the persistently impaired subjects exhibited an overlap with critical areas related to the MVPA prediction map in the cytoarchitectonic areas PFt of inferior parietal lobule and OP1 of parietal operculum which are associated with higher order sensory processing. This ultimate check corroborated the significance of the MVPA map for the prediction of tactile object recognition. The clinical implication of our study is that neuroimaging data acquired immediately after first stroke could facilitate individual forecasting of post-stroke recovery."}

The cause and mechanisms underlying the demise of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons are ill-defined, but interactions between genes and environmental factors are recognized to play a critical role in modulating the vulnerability to PD. Current evidence points to reactive glia as a pivotal factor in PD pathophysiology, playing both protective and destructive roles. Here, the contribution of reactive astrocytes and their ability to modulate DAergic neurodegeneration, neuroprotection and neurorepair in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) rodent model of PD will be discussed in the light of novel emerging evidence implicating wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin signaling as a strong candidate in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic plasticity.

Here we use such a model, termed APPsi:tTA, to determine what phenotypes persist in mice with high amyloid burden after new production of APP/Aβ has been suppressed. We find that 12- to 13-month-old APPsi:tTA mice are impaired in cognitive tasks that assess short- and long-term memories. Acutely suppressing new APPsi/Aβ production produced highly significant improvements in performing short-term spatial memory tasks, which upon continued suppression translated to superior performance in more demanding tasks that assess long-term spatial memory and working memory. Deficits in episodic-like memory and cognitive flexibility, however, were more persistent. Arresting mutant APPsi production caused a rapid decline in the brain levels of soluble APP ectodomains, full-length APP, and APP C-terminal fragments. As expected, amyloid deposits persisted after new APP/Aβ production was inhibited, whereas, unexpectedly, we detected persistent pools of solubilizable, relatively mobile, Aβ42. Additionally, we observed persistent levels of Aβ-immunoreactive entities that were of a size consistent with SDS-resistant oligomeric assemblies. Thus, in this model with significant amyloid pathology, a rapid amelioration of cognitive deficits was observed despite persistent levels of oligomeric Aβ assemblies and low, but detectable solubilizable Aβ42 peptides. These findings implicate complex relationships between accumulating Aβ and activities of APP, soluble APP ectodomains, and/or APP C-terminal fragments in mediating cognitive deficits in this model of amyloidosis."}

As predicted, participants holding more-negative age stereotypes were more likely to develop the psychiatric conditions, and their engagement in active coping reduced the risk of their developing these conditions.	Our findings suggest that prevention and treatment efforts designed to reduce psychiatric conditions in later life may benefit from bolstering active coping as well as positive age stereotypes."}

Five males with tetraplegia (TP) and four males with paraplegia (PR) exercised 1) sitting, 2) supine, and 3) sitting with the addition of a) an anti-gravity suit (anti-G), b) elastic stockings and abdominal binder, and c) functional electrical stimulation of the leg muscles. Compared to sitting, the following significant changes were observed: in the supine position, heart rate (HR) decreased (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 76 vs 92 b/min) and stroke volume (SV) increased (PR: 132 vs 116 ml, TP: 96 vs 83 ml). The anti-G suit induced a decrease in heart rate (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 87 vs 92 b/min) and a decrease in oxygen uptake (VO2) in PR. Stockings only affected TP, i.e. a decrease in heart rate with 5 b/min and an increase in stroke volume with 13 ml/beat. Functional electrical stimulation produced an increase in VO2 (PR: 1.00 vs 0.95 l/min, TP: 0.68 vs 0.53 l/min) and a rise in stroke volume in TP. Results indicate that the methods employed to support the circulatory redistribution have different working mechanisms and, in addition, that the effects are different for TP and PR probably because of differences in active muscle mass, sympathetic impairment and blood pressure values."}

A recent study of 517 ASD families implicated DOCK4 by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association and a microdeletion in an affected sibling pair.	The DOCK4 microdeletion on 7q31.1 was further characterized in this family using QuantiSNP analysis of 1M SNP array data and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Extended family members were tested by polymerase chain reaction amplification of junction fragments. DOCK4 dosage was measured in additional samples using SNP arrays. Since QuantiSNP analysis identified a novel CNTNAP5 microdeletion in the same affected sibling pair, this gene was sequenced in 143 additional ASD families. Further polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis included 380 ASD cases and suitable control subjects.	The maternally inherited microdeletion encompassed chr7:110,663,978-111,257,682 and led to a DOCK4-IMMP2L fusion transcript. It was also detected in five extended family members with no ASD. However, six of nine individuals with this microdeletion had poor reading ability, which prompted us to screen 606 other dyslexia cases. This led to the identification of a second DOCK4 microdeletion co-segregating with dyslexia. Assessment of genomic background in the original ASD family detected a paternal 2q14.3 microdeletion disrupting CNTNAP5 that was also transmitted to both affected siblings. Analysis of other ASD cohorts revealed four additional rare missense changes in CNTNAP5. No exonic deletions of DOCK4 or CNTNAP5 were seen in 2091 control subjects.	This study highlights two new risk factors for ASD and dyslexia and demonstrates the importance of performing a high-resolution assessment of genomic background, even after detection of a rare and likely damaging microdeletion using a targeted approach."}

Baseline period from January 1 to March 8, 2020, was compared with the COVID period from March 9, to April 2, 2020. The variables included were total daily stroke alerts across the hospital emergency departments, thrombolysis, time to presentation, stroke severity, time from door-to-imaging, time from door-to-needle in thrombolysis, and time from door-to-puncture in thrombectomy. The 2 time periods were compared using nonparametric statistics and Poisson regression.	Nine hundred two stroke alerts during the period across the emergency departments were analyzed. Total daily stroke alerts decreased from median, 10 (interquartile range, 8-13) during baseline period to median, 8 (interquartile range, 4-10, P=0.001) during COVID period. Time to presentation, stroke severity, and time to treatment were unchanged. COVID period was associated with decrease in stroke alerts with rate ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.28).

In our research, we aimed to explore NPS use among these communities.	We conducted a mixed method research with convergent parallel design. Data collection took place in 2017 in marginalised communities in villages in two regions in Hungary, where 150 questionnaires were recorded and 50 interviews were conducted with current NPS users.	According to the survey results, NPS is very easy to access, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist (SCRA) are easily bought in marginalised rural communities (79% found SCRA easy to obtain). Both SCRA and synthetic cathinones are used regularly; 57% of SCRA users and 37% of synthetic cathinone users used the respective substance at least once a week in the past 30 days. Besides NPS, sedative use (without prescription) and alcohol consumption are common among the respondents. 17% of the sample has already injected NPS. The overwhelming majority of the respondents rated regular consumption of NPS as 'very dangerous' (SCRA: 75%, synthetic cathinones 72%). NPS users have limited knowledge of consequences and the social and health treatment options available. Most themes in the interviews are associated with surviving stress, crisis and anxiety, as well as the wish to escape from insecurity and chaotic life. Positive effects of substance use (community, joy, energy) are rarely present.	People who use drugs (PWUD) living in these rural communities face the consequences of the rural risk environment: easy access to NPS, inadequate access to services, poor labour market situation and attributions of marginalised groups, for example disaffiliation. NPS use is not a recreational activity in this population; individuals mainly use NPS to get away from reality, problems, pain, poverty and marginalisation. NPS use is a survival strategy.

Both domestic and foreign investments in the gaming sector bring in not only substantial revenues but also positive spillover effects on related sectors and even on the entire local economy. However, an over-expansion of commercial gambling may lead to deterioration in the terms of trade with an adverse impact on real income. If this situation persists, it would not be impossible for immiserizing growth to occur. As a highly profitable sector, casino gaming may enable its operators to diversify out of this risk if they invest retained profits in non-gaming sectors to cash in on the spillover effects it has created. The gaming-dominant economy can then be directed on a more balanced and sustainable growth path, and will become less susceptible to business cycles. Indeed, economic experiences in the world's major casino resorts are consistent basically with this argument for diversification. We believe that after the current global crisis fades away, economic growth and resulting surges in global demand for gambling services can provide further opportunities for the expansion of existing casino resorts and the development of new gaming markets."}

Preventing microglial activation to inhibit neuroinflammation may become a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Guizhi Fuling capsule (GZFL) has a strong repression on inflammatory responses. Here, the presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, a well-established mouse model of AD, were divided into: WT mice (WT), WT mice+GZFL (WT+GZFL), PS cDKO mice (cDKO), and PS cDKO mice+GZFL (cDKO+GZFL). Mice in the WT+GZFL and cDKO+GZFL group were fed standard chow containing 2000 ppm GZFL for 90 days. After 60 days of GZFL treatment, mice were given to behavioral tests for 30 days in order to explore the effects of GZFL on cognitive and motor function. Then, mice were sacrificed for examining the effects of GZFL on inflammation. Furthermore, primary microglia were obtained from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats and pretreated with or without GZFL (50 μg/ml) for 1 h in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) stimulation to speculate whether the underlying mechanism of GZFL's anti-inflammatory potential was closely associated with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that GZFL has the ability to alleviate memory deficits in PS cDKO mice, which attributes to the improvement of neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. In addition, GZFL could inverse the tau hyperphosphorylation and the lessened expression of synaptic proteins in hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Furthermore, GZFL prevented LPS-induced neuroinflammatory responses in primary microglia by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. It is noteworthy that therapeutic effects of GZFL on memory impairment are depended on the inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses by the blockage of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, GZFL may be an effective compound Chinese medicine for the improvement and postponement of neurodegenerative progression in AD."}

In this study, C57Bl/6J mice were injected intracerebrally with [3H]inositol, and poly-PI turnover in brain was assessed by determining the levels of labeled inositol monophosphates (IP1) accumulated after intraperitoneal injection of LiCl (6 meq/kg body weight) 4 hr before killing. Using this experimental protocol, acute ethanol administration (by gavage) resulted in time- and dose-dependent decreases in the levels of labeled IP1 in both cerebrum and cerebellum as compared with controls. The ethanol-induced decrease in labeled IP1 correlated well with the decrease in levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (as measured by the radioreceptor assay) and the increase in blood ethanol concentration. Despite a 4-fold higher accumulation of labeled IP1 in the cerebrum compared with the cerebellum, there were no major differences in the steady-state levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (based on tissue weight) in either brain region. Intraperitoneal injection of atropine (50 mg/kg) (a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist) to the lithium-treated mice resulted in a 34% decrease in labeled IP1 as compared with controls. This result suggests that a substantial proportion of the signals transduced were due to activation of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor. Administration of ethanol (5 g/kg) to the atropine-treated mice resulted in a further decrease in labeled IP1 and longer sleep time as compared with those given ethanol alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

AHF was surgically induced by portocaval shunting followed by hepatic artery ligation 48 hr later. In the infusion group the dose of NH4-Ac, initially 0.78 mmol/kg/hr, was increased every 2 hr by 0.13 mmole/kg/hr during a 10-hour period to simulate the arterial NH3 concentrations observed in AHF. Ammonia levels in rabbits administered the NH4-Ac infusion were identical to those observed in AHF, with the exception of the higher initial value in the AHF group. Moreover, the mean rates of increase in grade of encephalopathy in the two groups were similar, although the EEG grades in the infusion group were significantly less at all time points. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a more pathophysiological approach to identification of the putative toxins in hepatic encephalopathy is feasible. Some of the EEG abnormalities of acute hepatic encephalopathy in rabbits are presumably due to hyperammonemia; the encephalopathy observed in AHF at zero time is probably caused by the previously constructed portocaval shunt via an undefined, but possibly also ammonia-related, mechanism."}

We analyzed herein the role of MIF in the host control of toxoplasmosis using MIF(-/-) mice backcrossed to either the BALB/c or the C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds. Both, wild-type (WT) BALB/c and MIF(-/-) BALB/c mice were susceptible to infection with highly virulent RH as well as moderately virulent ME49 strains of T. gondii. MIF(-/-) mice, however, showed greater liver damage and more brain cysts, produced less proinflammatory cytokines, and succumbed significantly faster than WT mice. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from MIF(-/-) mice produced less interleukin-1beta, interleukin-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha than WT BMDCs after stimulation with soluble Toxoplasma antigen (STAg). Similar observations were made in CD11c(+) low-density cells isolated from the spleens of MIF(-/-) mice challenged with STAg. MIF(-/-) C57BL/6 mice succumbed to ME49 infection faster than their WT counterparts. C57BL/6 mice that succumbed to infection with the ME49 strain produced less MIF than resistant BALB/c mice similarly infected. Interestingly, an analysis of brains from patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis showed low levels of MIF expression. Together, these findings demonstrate that MIF plays a critical role in mediating host resistance against T. gondii."}
{"pmid": "35274469", "text": "Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research^\nAttribution of intentions in autism spectrum disorder: A study of event-related potentials.^\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social cognition deficits, including difficulties inferring the intentions of others. Although deficits in attribution of intentions (AI) have been consistently replicated in ASD, their exact nature remains unexplored. Here we registered the electrophysiological correlates of a nonverbal social cognition task to investigate AI in autistic adults. Twenty-one male autistic adults and 30 male neurotypical volunteers performed a comic strips task depicting either intentional action (AI) or physical causality with or without human characters, while their electroencephalographic signal was recorded. Compared to neurotypical volunteers, autistic participants were significantly less accurate in correctly identifying congruence in the AI condition, but not in the physical causality conditions. In the AI condition a bilateral posterior positive event-related potential (ERP) occurred 200-400 ms post-stimulus (the ERP intention effect) in both groups. This waveform comprised a P200 and a P300 component, with the P200 component being larger for the AI condition in neurotypical volunteers but not in autistic individuals, who also showed a longer latency for this waveform. Group differences in amplitude of the ERP intention effect only became evident when we compared autistic participants to a subgroup of similarly performing neurotypical participants, suggesting that the atypical ERP waveform in ASD is an effect of group, rather than a marker of low-task performance. Together, these results suggest that the lower accuracy of the ASD group in the AI task may result from impaired early attentional processing and contextual integration of socially relevant cues. LAY SUMMARY: To understand why autistic people have difficulties in inferring others' intentions, we asked participants to judge the congruence of the endings of comic strips depicting either intentional actions (e.g., fetching a chair to reach for something) or situations solely following physical rules (e.g., an apple falling on someone's head), while their electrical brain activity was recorded. Autistic individuals had more difficulties in inferring intentions than neurotypical controls, which may reflect impaired attention and contextual integration of social cues."}

In the present study the activity of plasmatic histaminase was analysed, with histamine and with cadaverine as substrates, in a group of 23 schizophrenic patients and compared with that of healthy controls (n = 32). Plasma histaminase activity was determined using Gordon and Peters spectrophotometric method, and the results were expressed in mumoles of H2O2 transformed/hour/litre of plasma at 25 degrees C. Plasmatic histaminase, using histamine as substrate, was significantly increased in schizophrenic patients as a whole compared with the healthy controls. On the other hand, when cadaverine was used as substrate plasma histaminase was significantly reduced in female schizophrenics but not in males. When patients were divided according to 17 clinical characteristics it was found that the following subgroups were significantly associated to high levels of plasma histaminase (using histamine as substrate): the non mentally deteriorated schizophrenic patients compared with mentally deteriorated schizophrenic patients and those with thymic symptoms as opposed to those without thymic symptoms. An extension of this series and a prospective analysis are required to further define the clinical and biological significance of the alteration of this biochemical parameter in schizophrenia, and particularly in relation with a subgroup of schizophrenia with a more favourable course."}

A multicenter prospective study was conducted on otherwise healthy newborns born at ≥35 weeks of gestation and hospitalized for only NNJ in 50 collaborator neonatal intensive care units across Turkey over a 1-year period. Patients were analyzed for their demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment options, and complications.	Of the 5,620 patients enrolled, 361 (6.4%) had a bilirubin level ≥25 mg/dL on admission and 13 (0.23%) developed acute bilirubin encephalopathy. The leading cause of hospital admission was hemolytic jaundice, followed by dehydration related to a lack of proper feeding. Although all infants received phototherapy, 302 infants (5.4%) received intravenous immunoglobulin in addition to phototherapy and 132 (2.3%) required exchange transfusion. The infants who received exchange transfusion were more likely to experience hemolytic causes (60.6% vs. 28.1%) and a longer duration of phototherapy (58.5 ± 31.7 vs. 29.4 ± 18.8 h) compared to infants who were not transfused (p < 0.001). The incidence of short-term complications among discharged patients during follow-up was 8.5%; rehospitalization was the most frequent (58%), followed by jaundice for more than 2 weeks (39%), neurological abnormality (0.35%), and hearing loss (0.2%).	Severe NNJ and bilirubin encephalopathy are still problems in Turkey.

Retrospective assessment was performed in 3 neurosurgical centers (2008-2013). All patients with primary GB, unilocular growth, and adjuvant radiochemotherapy in whom subtotal resection was intended were included. Imaging data were pseudonymized and volumetrically assessed by a central reviewer. Clinical outcome was evaluated based on complications, new permanent neurologic deficits, and survival. Based on subtraction of potential EOR (as defined by reviewer) from effective EOR, EOR change (ΔEOR) was calculated for each case. We calculated multivariate linear regressions to assess influence on effective EOR and ΔEOR, binary regressions to assess influence on complications and new permanent neurologic deficits, and Cox regression models to assess survival.	Assessment included 70 patients. In iMRI group, a significantly lower ΔEOR (4% vs. 22%, P = 0.008) was found. In linear regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, only iMRI influenced ΔEOR significantly (P = 0.03, odds ratio 0.27). In binary regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, effective EOR, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, none of the variables showed a significant difference concerning complications and new permanent neurologic deficits.

Because these disabling symptoms are generally not well tolerated by caregivers, patients with these symptoms tend to be institutionalized earlier than patients without them. The identification of protective and risk factors for neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD would facilitate the development of more specific treatments for these symptoms and thereby decrease morbidity and mortality in AD.

The exercised mice were treadmill run at speed of 12 m/min, 60 min/day, 5 days/week on a 0% gradient for 3 months. Treadmill exercised mice improved cognitive function in water maze test. Treadmill exercised mice significantly reduced the expression of Aβ-42, Cox-2, and caspase-3 in the hippocampus. In parallel, treadmill exercised Tg mice decreased the phosphorylation levels of JNK, p38MAPK and tau (Ser404, Ser202, Thr231), and increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK, PI3K, Akt and GSK-3α/β. In addition, treadmill exercised Tg mice up-regulated the expressions of NGF, BDNF and phospho-CREB, and the expressions of SOD-1, SOD-2 and HSP-70. Treadmill exercised Tg mice up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and down-regulated the expressions of cytochrome c and Bax in the hippocampus. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus in mice was significantly decreased after treadmill exercise. Finally, serum TC, insulin, glucose, and corticosterone levels were significantly decreased in the Tg mice after treadmill exercise. As a consequence of such change, Aβ-dependent neuronal cell death in the hippocampus of Tg mice was markedly suppressed following treadmill exercise. These results strongly suggest that treadmill exercise provides a therapeutic potential to inhibit both Aβ-42 and neuronal death pathways. Therefore, treadmill exercise may be beneficial in prevention or treatment of AD."}

AD is the most common cause of dementia, and neuroinflammation is one of the major contributing factors in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, low-dose RT may be used clinically for treating AD. However, the appropriate doses, effects, and underlying mechanisms of RT in AD have not been determined. In this study, we aimed to determine the appropriate RT dose and schedule for AD treatment and to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of low-dose RT in AD.	We first determined the proper dose and schedule for RT in late-stage AD using 8- to 9-month-old 5x Familial AD (5xFAD) mice, a well-known animal model of AD, by comparing the effects of a low total dose with low dose per fraction (LD-LDRT, 5 × 0.6 Gy) with those of a low moderate total dose with conventional dose per fraction (LMD-CDRT, 5 × 2 Gy).	LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT were found to reduce the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines CD54, IL-3, CXCL9/10, and CCL2/4 in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, increased microgliosis assessed using Iba-1 and CD68 dual immunostaining was significantly reduced by LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. Moreover, LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT decreased the amyloid plaque burden in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice and attenuated their cognitive impairment; these effects persisted for 4 to 5 weeks.	The present study showed that LD-LDRT alleviates cognitive impairments and prevents the accumulation of amyloid plaques by regulating neuroinflammation in the late stage of AD in 5xFAD mice, with an efficacy equivalent to that of LMD-CDRT.

Among participants, 37% screened positive for PTSD, 42% reported 4 or more ACEs, and 26% had elevated scores on both measures. Primary Care-PTSD and ACE scores were strongly positively correlated (r = 0.57, p < 0.001). Most patients agreed they were comfortable being asked about trauma directly or through screening questionnaires and did not oppose the inclusion of trauma-related information in their medical record. In addition, most patients perceived their clinician as comfortable asking questions about childhood trauma and able to address trauma-related problems.	Screening is acceptable to most primary care patients regardless of trauma exposure or positive PTSD screening. Findings may aid primary care clinicians to consider screening regularly for ACEs and PTSD to better serve the health care needs of trauma-exposed patients."}

Their levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease, but data concerning cerebrovascular disease are lacking. The objective of our study was to investigate the role of adrenal sex steroids in a female population suffering an acute stroke. We addressed the question of whether their levels are associated with disease severity and prognosis. A 2-year cohort study was performed in 2 tertiary hospitals, where we prospectively studied 302 consecutive postmenopausal female patients hospitalized for an acute stroke. Neurological severity on admission was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; and handicap 1 month after stroke, with the modified Rankin Scale. Δ4-androstenedione levels were positively and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was inversely associated with stroke severity (r = 0.142, P = .014 and r = -0.153, P = .008, respectively), and both parameters remained as significant determinants even after entering other confounders in the multivariate model (r = 0.118, P = .039 and r = -0.150, P = .011, respectively). Levels of Δ4-androstenedione were significantly associated with 1-month mortality in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals: 1.540 [1.107-2.138)], P = .010). Δ4-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were associated with poor outcome in the univariate analysis, that is, combined severe handicap (modified Rankin Scale ≥4) and death, 1 month poststroke, although this was not significant in the multivariate analysis. Adrenal sex steroids, and especially Δ4-androstenedione, are significantly associated with stroke severity on admission and short-term prognosis among female stroke subjects. Well-designed prospective studies will further clarify their role in cerebrovascular disease."}

Yet, the interpretation of PET scans is not clear-cut. The present study aimed at determining the best method to analyse PET/CT in a large, real-life cohort of patients presenting with suspicion of GCA.	One hundred and three patients with clinical suspicion of GCA undergoing PET/CT between 2006 and 2012 were included. Clinical data were retrieved from patients' charts. PET/CT was categorized by visual scoring of the uptake and by the artery/liver standardized uptake values (SUV) ratios. Diagnosis of GCA was confirmed in 68 patients and excluded in 35 patients, which served as the controls. GCA patients were older (median age 75 vs. 68 years), and presented more often with ischaemic symptoms. The best discrimination between GCA patients and controls was achieved for PET/CT findings within the supra-aortic arteries (sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.91 for a SUV/LE cut-off value of 1.0). Specificity of PET/CT for the aorta and the iliofemoral arteries was lower (<0.34). Visual scoring correlated poorly to SUV measurements (Kendall Tau-b 0.13-0.55) and had a lower diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.75). Prednisone treatment for ≥10 days significantly reduced PET/CT sensitivity (P = 0.009).	SUV based analysis of PET/CT enhances diagnostic accuracy with best discrimination in the supra-aortic region, particularly in steroid naïve patients. For discrimination based on the aorta and the iliofemoral region, higher cut-off values have to be applied, resulting in lower sensitivities for diagnosing GCA."}

Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of ASD and lack of a proper human cellular model system, the pathophysiological mechanism of ASD during the developmental process is largely unknown. However, recent progress in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology as well as in vitro neural differentiation techniques have allowed us to functionally characterize neurons and analyze cortical development during neural differentiation. These technical advances will increase our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of heterogeneous ASD and help identify molecular biomarkers for patient stratification as well as personalized medicine. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of iPSC generation, differentiation of specific neuronal subtypes from iPSCs, and phenotypic characterizations of human ASD patient-derived iPSC models. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of iPSC technology and future directions of ASD pathophysiology studies using iPSCs."}

Increased expression of the master regulator of ALP, transcription factor EB (TFEB), is hypothesized to promote the clearance of WT α-synuclein and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we explore the efficacy of targeted TFEB overexpression either in neurons or oligodendrocytes to reduce the pathological burden of α-synuclein in a PD rat model and a MSA mouse model. While TFEB neuronal expression was sufficient to prevent neurodegeneration in the PD model, we show that only TFEB oligodendroglial overexpression leads to neuroprotective effects in the MSA model. These beneficial effects were associated with a decreased accumulation of α-synuclein into oligodendrocytes through recovery of the ALP machinery. Our study demonstrates that the cell type where α-synuclein aggregates dictates the target of TFEB overexpression in order to be protective, paving the way for adapted therapies."}

American volume^\nThromboprophylaxis in patients with acute spinal injuries: an evidence-based analysis.^\nThe increased risk for venous thromboembolic events following spinal trauma is well established. The purpose of the present study was to examine the literature in order to determine the optimum thromboprophylaxis regimen for patients with acute spinal injuries with or without spinal cord injury.	EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched from the earliest available date to April 2008 for clinical trials comparing different methods of thromboprophylaxis in adult patients following acute spinal injuries (with or without spinal cord injury). Outcome measures included the prevalences of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treatment-related adverse events.	The search yielded 489 studies, but only twenty-one of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis was significantly lower in patients without spinal cord injury as compared with patients with spinal cord injury (odds ratio = 6.0; 95% confidence interval = 2.9 to 12.7). Patients with an acute spinal cord injury who were receiving oral anticoagulants had significantly fewer episodes of pulmonary embolism (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.01 to 0.63) than those who were not receiving oral anticoagulants (either untreated controls or patients managed with low-molecular-weight heparin). The start of thromboprophylaxis within the first two weeks after the injury resulted in significantly fewer deep-vein-thrombosis events than delayed initiation did (odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1 to 0.4). With regard to heparin-based pharmacoprophylaxis in patients with spinal trauma, low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduced the rates of deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding episodes in comparison with the findings in patients who received unfractionated heparin, with odds ratios of 2.6 (95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 5.6) and 7.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 58.4) for deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding, respectively.	The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis following a spine injury is higher among patients who have a spinal cord injury than among those who do not have a spinal cord injury. Therefore, thromboprophylaxis in these patients should start as early as possible once it is deemed safe in terms of potential bleeding complications. Within this population, low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis, with fewer bleeding complications, than unfractionated heparin is. The use of vitamin K antagonists appeared to be effective for the prevention of pulmonary embolism."}

Here, we examined the contribution of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 2 and 3 as well as novel fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) to such proliferation. Balloon catheter injury to the rat carotid artery stimulated the expression of two distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms, differing only by the presence or absence of the acidic box, and two distinctly spliced FGFR-3 isoforms containing the acidic box and differing only by the presence of either the IIIb or IIIc exon. Post-injury arterial administration of recombinant adenoviruses expressing dominant negative mutant forms of these FGFRs were used to assess the roles of the endogenous FGFR isoforms in neointimal SMC proliferation. Dominant negative FGFR-2 containing the acidic box inhibited such proliferation by 40%, whereas the dominant negative FGFR-3 forms had little effect. Expression of FGF-9, known to be capable of binding to all four neointimal FGFR-2/-3 isoforms, was abundant within the neointima. FGF-9 markedly stimulated both the proliferation of neointimal SMCs and the activation of extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2, effects which were abrogated by the administration of antisense FGF-9 oligonucleotides to injured arteries and the expression of the dominant negative FGFR-2 adenovirus in cultured neointimal SMCs. These studies demonstrate that, although multiple FGFRs are induced in neointimal SMCs following arterial injury, specific interactions between distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms and FGF-9 contribute to the proliferation of these SMCs."}

The objective of this study was to evaluate the motor, cognitive and emotional changes associated with dopaminergic and BDNF imbalance after DM exposure in rats. Sixty Wistar rats (9-10 months-old) were used, under Ethics Committee on Animal Research license (ID 19/2017). The animals were randomly divided into four groups: control (CTL, 0.9% saline), DM2 (2 mg DM in 1.6 mL 0.9% saline), DM4 (4 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline), and DM8 (8 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline). DM groups were submitted to 9 or 15 inhalations, one every 48 h. Half of the animals from each group were randomly selected and perfused 24 h after the 9th or 15th inhalation. Throughout the experiment, the animal's behavior were evaluated using catalepsy test, open field, hole-board test, Modified Elevated Plus Maze, and social interaction. At the end of the experiments, the rats were perfused transcardially and their brains were processed for Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) and Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunohistochemistries. The animals submitted to 9 inhalations of DM showed a reduction in immunoreactivity for TH in the Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and dorsal striatum (DS) areas, and an increase in BDNF in the DS and CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal areas. Conversely, the animals submitted to 15 inhalations of DM showed immunoreactivity reduced for TH in the SNpc and VTA, and an increase in BDNF in the hippocampal areas (CA3 and DG). Our results indicate that the DM inhalation at different periods induce motor and cognitive impairments in rats. Such alterations were accompanied by dopaminergic system damage and a possible dysfunction on synaptic plasticity."}

Histopathological hallmarks of AD include brain amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. Major depression is a frequent diagnosis in every gerontopsychiatric clinic that sees patients with both cognitive and affective disorders. Many depressed patients, in fact, are clinically characterized by cognitive impairments. Thus, an assay that excludes - or confirms - probable AD in cognitively impaired patients is desirable. Such assays may use protein markers that are derived from such histopathologically relevant molecules as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its derivatives including the amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta). To evaluate the differential diagnostic properties of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta and secreted soluble ectodomain (APPs), we quantitated CSF levels of these measures in AD patients and compared them to age-matched control patients with major depression. CSF levels of APPs and Abeta were similar in patients with AD or major depression, and the apolipoprotein E genotype had no influence on CSF levels of Abeta in AD patients. Measurement of Abeta peptide using a novel zinc/copper capture ELISA that detects aggregated Abeta peptides as well demonstrated similar levels in AD and major depression. In AD patients, CSF levels of total Abeta (Abeta1-40 plus Abeta1-42) were inversely correlated with a functional measure of dementia severity (NOSGER), suggesting that CSF levels of Abeta decrease with advancing severity of AD. Thus, CSF levels of Abeta are not useful for the differentiation of AD from major depression. However, CSF levels of Abeta reflect the severity of dementia and may be useful as biological markers of the stage of the disease."}

Histological analyses for testis morphology were performed in different rat cohorts at 1.5, 7 and 12 months of age whereas immunohistochemical analyses were carried out at 7 and 12 months of age to visualize the presence of mHTT in testicular tissue. Furthermore, western blot analyses were used to assess HTT and mHTT expression levels in striatum and testis at three months of age.	At 3 months, BACHD rats showed a decreased time exploring the female anogenital area (AGA), decreased latency to mount, increased number of intromissions and ejaculations and enhanced hit rate. At 7 months, all sexual parameters were comparable between genotypes with the exception that BACHD rats explored the AGA less than wild type rats. Testis analyses did not reveal any morphological alteration at any of the examined ages, but showed presence of mHTT limited to Sertoli cells in transgenic rats at both 7 and 12 months. BACHD rat HTT and mHTT expression levels in testis were lower than striatum at 3 months of age.	The testis phenotype in the BACHD rat model does not mimic the changes observed in human HD testis. The altered sexual behavior in BACHD rats at three months of age could be to a certain extent representative of and share common underlying pathways with some of the sexual disturbances in HD patients. Further investigating the biological causes of the sexual phenotype in BACHD rats may therefore contribute to clarifying the mechanisms at the base of sexual behavior changes in HD."}

Felbamate is an investigational antiepileptic drug with a preclinical profile that suggests it would be effective in patients with multiple types of seizures. In controlled clinical trials, felbamate was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of refractory partial-onset seizures.	We studied the efficacy of felbamate in 73 patients ranging in age from 4 to 36 years who had the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. During a 28-day base-line phase, the patients received their usual antiepileptic therapies. At the end of this phase, felbamate or placebo was administered for 70 days in addition to the current antiepileptic medications. The dosage of felbamate was titrated during the first 14 days of the treatment phase to a maximum of 45 mg per kilogram of body weight per day or 3600 mg per day, whichever was less. The primary efficacy variables were the total number of seizures counted during a four-hour period of video recording, parents' or guardians' global evaluations of the patients' quality of life, and the total number of atonic seizures, as reported by parents or guardians.	The patients treated with felbamate had a 34 percent decrease in the frequency of atonic seizures, as compared with a 9 percent decrease in the patients who received placebo (P = 0.01). The felbamate-treated patients had a 19 percent decrease in the total frequency of seizures, as compared with a 4 percent increase in the placebo group (P = 0.002). The global-evaluation scores were significantly higher in the felbamate group than in the placebo group from day 49 to the end of the study. There were no significant differences in the frequency of seizures occurring during video monitoring, but there was a significant reduction (P = 0.017) in the number of tonic-clonic seizures during the maintenance period in the felbamate group. The types and frequency of side effects were similar in the two treatment groups.	Felbamate is beneficial in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome."}

Our goal was to evaluate the reporting, inclusion, and analysis of sociodemographic variables in ED psychotherapeutic treatment randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the US through 2020.	We conducted a systematic review of ED psychotherapeutic treatment RCTs in the US and examined the reporting and inclusion of gender identity, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status (SES) of enrolled participants, as well as recruitment methods, power analyses, and discussion of limitations and generalizability.	Our search yielded 58 studies meeting inclusion criteria dating back to 1985. Reporting was at times incomplete, absent, or centered on the racial/gender majority group. No studies reported gender diverse participants, and men and people of color were underrepresented generally, with differences noted across diagnoses. A minority of papers considered sociodemographic variables in analyses or acknowledged limitations related to sample characteristics. Some progress was made across the decades, with studies increasingly providing full racial and ethnic data, and more men included over time. Although racial and ethnic diversity improved somewhat, progress appeared to stall in the last decade.	We summarize findings, consider context and challenges for RCT researchers, and offer suggestions for researchers, journal editors, and reviewers on improving representation, reporting, and analytic practices.	Randomized controlled trials of eating disorder psychotherapeutic treatment in the US are increasingly reporting full race/ethnicity data, but information on SES is inconsistent and sexual orientation absent. White women still comprise the overwhelming majority of participants, with few men and people of color, and no gender-diverse individuals.

We performed for the first time a large-scale analysis of sleep duration in children, and how this relates to psychiatric problems including depression, to cognition, and to brain structure. Structural MRI was analyzed in relation to sleep duration, and psychiatric and cognitive measures in 11,067 9-11-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, using a linear mixed model, mediation analysis, and structural equation methods in a longitudinal analysis. Dimensional psychopathology (including depression, anxiety, impulsive behavior) in the children was negatively correlated with sleep duration. Dimensional psychopathology in the parents was also correlated with short sleep duration in their children. The brain areas in which higher volume was correlated with longer sleep duration included the orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal and temporal cortex, precuneus, and supramarginal gyrus. Longitudinal data analysis showed that the psychiatric problems, especially the depressive problems, were significantly associated with short sleep duration 1 year later. Further, mediation analysis showed that depressive problems significantly mediate the effect of these brain regions on sleep. Higher cognitive scores were associated with higher volume of the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Public health implications are that psychopathology in the parents should be considered in relation to sleep problems in children. Moreover, we show that brain structure is associated with sleep problems in children, and that this is related to whether or not the child has depressive problems."}

Hsp70 and its co-chaperones disassemble and extract polypeptides from protein aggregates for refolding or degradation. The effectiveness of the chaperone system decreases with age and leads to accumulation rather than removal of neurotoxic protein aggregates. Therapeutic enhancement of the Hsp70 protein disassembly machinery is proposed to counter late-onset protein misfolding neurodegenerative disease that may arise. In the context of prion disease, it is not known whether stimulation of protein aggregate disassembly paradoxically leads to enhanced formation of seeding competent species of disease-specific proteins and acceleration of neurodegenerative disease. Here we have tested the hypothesis that modulation of Hsp70 disaggregase activity perturbs mammalian prion-induced neurotoxicity and prion seeding activity. To do so we used prion protein (PrP) transgenic Drosophila that authentically replicate mammalian prions. RNASeq identified that Hsp70, DnaJ-1 and Hsp110 gene expression was downregulated in prion-exposed PrP Drosophila. We demonstrated that RNAi knockdown of Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila enhanced neurotoxicity, whereas overexpression mitigated toxicity. Strikingly, prion seeding activity in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila was ablated or reduced by Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 overexpression, respectively. Similar effects were seen in scrapie prion-exposed ovine PrP Drosophila with modified Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression. These unique observations show that the metazoan Hsp70 disaggregase facilitates the clearance of mammalian prions and that its enhanced activity is a potential therapeutic strategy for human prion disease."}

Data was from the Japanese Schizophrenia Sib-pair Linkage Group (JSSLG), which is a multi-site collaborative study group established to create a national resource for genetic studies of schizophrenia in Japan. All subjects were Japanese, and the probands and their siblings had schizophrenia. Multipoint non-parametric linkage analysis and exclusion mapping were performed with GENEHUNTER software. Simulation studies suggested that in the absence of linkage we could expect one multipoint maximum LOD score (MLS) of 1.9 per genome scan. An MLS of 3.7 would be expected only once in every 20 genome scans and thus corresponds to a genome-wide significance of 0.05. No loci in the initial screen fulfilled the criteria for significant or suggestive evidence for linkage.

Here we investigated the effects of treadmill training (TMT) on regenerative responses of the corticospinal tract (CST) after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI). One week after injury of the low thoracic spinal cord, rats were given TMT or sedentary treatment for 1-4 weeks. Anterograde tracing of descending CST axons revealed that TMT enhanced collateral arborization of CST axons surrounding the injury cavity and promoted extension into the caudal spinal cord. The number of oligodendrocytes in the vicinity of the injury cavity was significantly increased at 2 or 4 weeks after TMT compared to sedentary controls. The data further showed that TMT increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in the motor cortex as well as the spinal cord injury area, and inhibition of Erk1/2 activity by administration of the MEK1 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 reduced collateral outgrowth of descending CST axons in TMT animals. TMT for 2-4 weeks significantly improved behavioral scores as assessed by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale, as well as on motor function and gridwalk testing.

A focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model on Macaca mulatta was performed with a modified middle cerebral artery occlusion method. Among the nearly 8000 genes, approximately 8% of the total number of genes examined were affected after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Major altered genes were downregulated. In EA-treated monkeys, approximately 10% of the total number of genes examined were affected. Major altered genes were upregulated, including signal transduction-, cell-cycle-, metabolism-, stress response-, DNA repair-related genes. One of the representative upregulated genes encodes insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was confirmed using in situ hybridization. Results showed that after ischemia/reperfusion injury, IGF-1 mRNA expression decreased in ipsilateral striatum, whereas increased in ipsilateral hippocampus. No expression changes were observed in cortex. EA treatment could obviously upregulate the IGF-1 mRNA expression in striatum, and further enhance its expression in hippocampus. Therefore, the data presented suggest a possible mediator underlying the mechanisms of anti-ischemic effect of acupuncture.

A quality improvement project was initiated at a nonpediatric community ED to implement an institution-specific, PECARN-based Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool. Baseline head CT use at the participating ED was determined for children with closed head injury through retrospective chart review from March 2014 through November 2015. Head injury patients were identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes for head injury, unspecified (959.01) and concussion with and without loss of consciousness (850-850.9) until October 2015, after which ICD-9 was no longer used. To identify eligible patients after October 2015, lists of all pediatric patients evaluated at the participating ED were reviewed, and patients were included in the analysis if they had a physician-assigned discharge diagnosis of head injury or concussion. Exclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, penetrating head trauma, history of brain tumor, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, bleeding disorder, or presentation > 24 hours postinjury. Medical history, injury mechanism, symptoms, head CT use, and disposition were recorded.

Patients were classified into low, intermediate, or high risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) by chart review. ED length of stay (LOS), disposition, and ED returns within 72 hours were recorded. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables, using Kruskal-Wallis test.	A total of 252 children with closed head injury were evaluated preimplementation (March 2014 through November 2015), 132 children were evaluated during implementation (December 2015 through August 2016), and 172 children were evaluated postimplementation (September 2016 through August 2017).

A total of 1,421 measurements in 15 epileptic patients (age: 28 ± 10) using a radiofrequency generator (50 kHz current injection) were analyzed. Each contact pair was classified as being from healthy (gray matter, n = 696; white matter, n = 530) or pathological (epileptogenic zone, n = 195) tissue using neuroimaging analysis of the local tissue environment and intracerebral EEG recordings. Brain tissue conductivities were obtained using numerical simulations based on conductivity estimates that accounted for the current flow in the local brain volume around the contact pairs (a cube with a side length of 13 mm). Conductivity values were 0.26 S/m for gray matter and 0.17 S/m for white matter. Healthy gray and white matter had statistically different median impedances (P < 0.0001). White matter conductivity was found to be homogeneous as normality tests did not find evidence of multiple subgroups. Gray matter had lower conductivity in healthy tissue than in the epileptogenic zone (0.26 vs. 0.29 S/m; P = 0.012), even when the epileptogenic zone was not visible in the magnetic resonance image (MRI) (P = 0.005). The present in-vivo conductivity values could serve to create more accurate volume conduction models and could help to refine the identification of relevant intracerebral contacts, especially when located within the epileptogenic zone of an MRI-invisible lesion.

We found that HGF coexpression is a key predictor of response to c-MET inhibition among the examined factors and identified an ERK/JAK/p53 pathway activation signature that differentiates c-MET inhibition in responsive and nonresponsive cells. Surprisingly, we also found that short pretreatment of cells and tumors with exogenous HGF moderately but statistically significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of c-MET inhibition.

In this report, the differentiation capacity in vivo of these cells was analysed following a standardized trauma. Before the trauma, the subependymal cells expressed nestin but not the astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament respectively. In response to injury, the majority of the subependymal cells coexpressed nestin and GFAP, but never nestin and neurofilament. Furthermore, cells coexpressing nestin and GFAP were found progressively further away from the subependyma and closer to the lesion at later time points after the injury, indicating that these cells migrate towards the lesion. Nestin was in addition re-expressed in reactive astrocytes near the lesion and in non-reactive astrocytes very far from the lesion throughout the ipsilateral cortex.

Forty-two cannabis users were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging while they encoded and retrieved face-profession associations.

How these biomarkers behave in patients with AD, compared to healthy elderly is well known, but determining these in subjects with preclinical AD is not and will add information related to the onset of AD. When found to be different in preclinical AD, these inflammatory biomarkers may be used to select preclinical AD subjects who are most likely to develop AD, to participate in clinical trials with new disease-modifying drugs.	Healthy elderly (n= 50; age 71.9; MMSE >24) and subjects with preclinical AD (n=50; age 73.4; MMSE >24) defined by CSF Aβ1-42 levels < 1000 pg/mL were included. Four neuroinflammatory biomarkers were determined in plasma, GFAP, YKL-40, MCP-1, and eotaxin-1. Differences in biomarker outcomes were compared using ANCOVA.

Least square means were calculated for all 4 inflammatory biomarkers using both the Aβ+/Aβ- cutoff and Ptau/Aβ1-42 ratio.	The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of the subjects (n=100) was 72.6 (4.6) years old with 62 male and 38 female subjects.

The number of subjects in the different APOE ε4 status categories differed significantly between the Aβ+ and Aβ- groups. Plasma GFAP concentration was significantly higher in the Aβ+ group compared to the Aβ- group with significant covariates age and sex, variables that also correlated significantly with GFAP.	GFAP was significantly higher in subjects with preclinical AD compared to healthy elderly which agrees with previous studies. When defining preclinical AD based on the Ptau181/Aβ1-42 ratio, YKL-40 was also significantly different between groups. This could indicate that GFAP and YKL-40 are more sensitive markers of the inflammatory process in response to the Aβ misfolding and aggregation that is ongoing as indicated by the lowered Aβ1-42 levels in the CSF.

Recent genomic studies have reported recurrent DDX3X mutations in numerous tumors including medulloblastoma (MB), but the physiological impact of these mutations is poorly understood. Here we show that a consistent feature of MB-associated mutations is SG hyper-assembly and concomitant translation impairment. We used CLIP-seq to obtain a comprehensive assessment of DDX3X binding targets and ribosome profiling for high-resolution assessment of global translation. Surprisingly, mutant DDX3X expression caused broad inhibition of translation that impacted DDX3X targeted and non-targeted mRNAs alike. Assessment of translation efficiency with single-cell resolution revealed that SG hyper-assembly correlated precisely with impaired global translation. SG hyper-assembly and translation impairment driven by mutant DDX3X were rescued by a genetic approach that limited SG assembly and by deletion of the N-terminal low complexity domain within DDX3X. Thus, in addition to a primary defect at the level of translation initiation caused by DDX3X mutation, SG assembly itself contributes to global translation inhibition. This work provides mechanistic insights into the consequences of cancer-related DDX3X mutations, suggesting that globally reduced translation may provide a context-dependent survival advantage that must be considered as a possible contributor to tumorigenesis."}

The development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for MS is dependent on a number of components of the immune system including complement and adhesion molecules. Previous studies in our lab have examined the role of C3, the central complement component, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) a key cell adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation including the CNS. In these studies we demonstrated that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE is markedly attenuated in both ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) mice.

In addition, the role of the visual system in relation to visual hallucinations was examined.	102 consecutive patients diagnosed with strictly defined Parkinson's disease were examined for the presence of hallucinations and delusions and assessed for visual acuity, cognition, depression using the geriatric depression scale, disease severity as measured by the UPDRS, and other clinical variables.	Of 102 consecutive patients, 29.4% (n=30) had hallucinations or delusions, four (3.9%) were determined to be psychotic due solely to delirium and were excluded from further analysis. Of the 98 remaining patients, 26.5% (n=26) had visual hallucinations. Among these, one patient also had delusions, two had auditory hallucinations, and one had gustatory hallucinations. Visual hallucinations were significantly associated with worse visual acuity, lower cognitive score, higher depression score, and worse disease severity. Hallucinations were not associated with history of psychiatric disease, dose or duration of levodopa or other antiparkinsonian medication treatment, or duration of illness.	Visual hallucinations are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease and are most likely of multifactorial origin. Although higher doses of levodopa are known to be related clinically to hallucinations in individual patients, the results suggest that several underlying characteristics of patients with Parkinson's disease (disease severity, dementia, depression, worse visual acuity) may be more important determinants of which patients experience hallucinations. The data also provide preliminary evidence that abnormality of the visual system may be related to visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, as has been found in other disorders with visual hallucinations."}

In rheumatic carditis, studies have investigated human monoclonal autoantibodies and T cell clones for their crossreactivity and their mechanisms leading to valve damage in rheumatic heart disease. Although studies of human and animal sera from group A streptococcal diseases or immunization models have been crucial in providing clues to molecular mimicry and its role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever, study of human monoclonal autoantibodies have provided important insights into how antibodies against the valve may activate the valve endothelium and lead to T cell infiltration. Passive transfer of anti-streptococcal T cell lines in a rat model of rheumatic carditis illustrates effects of CD4+ T cells on the valve. Although Sydenham chorea has been known as the neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever for decades, the combination of autoimmunity and behavior is a relatively new concept linking brain, behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders with streptococcal infections. In Sydenham chorea, human mAbs and their expression in transgenic mice have linked autoimmunity to central dopamine pathways as well as dopamine receptors and dopaminergic neurons in basal ganglia.

Several compounds are under development that address both underlying pathophysiological abnormalities and core ASD symptoms. This article reviews one of these treatments, d,l-leucovorin calcium (also known as folinic acid) for treatment of folate pathway abnormalities in children with ASD. Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that is essential for normal neurodevelopment and abnormalities in the folate and related pathways have been identified in children with ASD. One of these abnormalities involves a partial blockage in the ability of folate to be transported into the brain utilizing the primary transport mechanism, the folate receptor alpha. Autoantibodies which interfere with the function of the folate receptor alpha called folate receptor alpha autoantibodies have been identified in 58%-76% of children with ASD and independent studies have demonstrated that blood titers of these autoantibodies correlate with folate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Most significantly, case-series, open-label, and single and double-blind placebo-controlled studies suggest that d,l-leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the blockage at the folate receptor alpha by using the reduced folate carrier, an alternate pathway, can substantially improve particular symptoms in children with ASD, especially those positive for folate receptor alpha autoantibodies.

Paper-based measurement tools can be burdensome to the patient and clinician and lack the temporal resolution needed to accurately and objectively track changes in motor symptom severity throughout the day. Wearable sensor-based systems that continuously monitor PD motor disorders may help to solve this problem, although critical shortcomings persist in identifying multiple disorders at high temporal resolution during unconstrained activity. The purpose of this study was to advance the current state of the art by (1) introducing hybrid sensor technology to concurrently acquire surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer data during unconstrained activity and (2) analyzing the data using dynamic neural network algorithms to capture the evolving temporal characteristics of the sensor data and improve motor disorder recognition of tremor and dyskinesia. Algorithms were trained (n=11 patients) and tested (n=8 patients; n=4 controls) to recognize tremor and dyskinesia at 1-second resolution based on sensor data features and expert annotation of video recording during 4-hour monitoring periods of unconstrained daily activity. The algorithms were able to make accurate distinctions between tremor, dyskinesia, and normal movement despite the presence of diverse voluntary activity. Motor disorder severity classifications averaged 94.9% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity based on 1 sensor per symptomatic limb. These initial findings indicate that new sensor technology and software algorithms can be effective in enhancing wearable sensor-based system performance for monitoring PD motor disorders during unconstrained activities."}

The aim of the study was to determine whether increasing hydrocortisone (or equivalent) to 30 mg/d in ACTH-deficient patients increased cardiovascular risk and whether a reduction in insulin sensitivity and attenuation of insulin's hemodynamic effects was responsible for this effect.	We conducted an open interventional study between 2011 and 2013.	The study was performed in the Endocrine Research Unit, Repatriation General Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.	Seventeen ACTH-deficient subjects taking hydrocortisone (≤20 mg/d) for at least 6 months were studied.	Subjects were studied before and after a 7-day increase in hydrocortisone to 30 mg/d.

Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by microglia and astrocytes, plays a causative role in neurodegeneration in AD. Our group and others have reported early and dramatic losses of brain sulfatide in AD cases and animal models that are mediated by ApoE in an isoform-dependent manner and accelerated by Aβ accumulation. To date, it remains unclear if changes in specific brain lipids are sufficient to drive AD-related pathology.	To study the consequences of CNS sulfatide deficiency and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we developed a novel mouse model of adult-onset myelin sulfatide deficiency, i.e., tamoxifen-inducible myelinating glia-specific cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) conditional knockout mice (CST[fl/fl]/Plp1-CreERT), took advantage of constitutive CST knockout mice (CST[-/-]), and generated CST/ApoE double knockout mice (CST[-/-]/ApoE[-/-]), and assessed these mice using a broad range of methodologies including lipidomics, RNA profiling, behavioral testing, PLX3397-mediated microglia depletion, mass spectrometry (MS) imaging, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and Western blot.	We found that mild central nervous system (CNS) sulfatide losses within myelinating cells are sufficient to activate disease-associated microglia and astrocytes, and to increase the expression of AD risk genes (e.g., Apoe, Trem2, Cd33, and Mmp12), as well as previously established causal regulators of the immune/microglia network in late-onset AD (e.g., Tyrobp, Dock, and Fcerg1), leading to chronic AD-like neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment. Notably, neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment showed gender differences, being more pronounced in females than males. Subsequent mechanistic studies demonstrated that although CNS sulfatide losses led to ApoE upregulation, genetically-induced myelin sulfatide deficiency led to neuroinflammation independently of ApoE. These results, together with our previous studies (sulfatide deficiency in the context of AD is mediated by ApoE and accelerated by Aβ accumulation) placed both Aβ and ApoE upstream of sulfatide deficiency-induced neuroinflammation, and suggested a positive feedback loop where sulfatide losses may be amplified by increased ApoE expression. We also demonstrated that CNS sulfatide deficiency-induced astrogliosis and ApoE upregulation are not secondary to microgliosis, and that astrogliosis and microgliosis seem to be driven by activation of STAT3 and PU.1/Spi1 transcription factors, respectively.	Our results strongly suggest that sulfatide deficiency is an important contributor and driver of neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment in AD pathology."}

Because one-third of men over the age of 50 will develop LUTS and a recent study showed ED in 62% of patients presenting for LUTS, the importance of determining the mechanistic link between these two pathologies is clear. Using a rabbit model of partial bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO), a primary cause of LUTS, we have identified an increased basal corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM) tone associated with an elevated level of smooth muscle myosin (SMM) phosphorylation in PBOO compared with sham-operated control rabbits (sham). Results from in vitro kinase and phosphatase assays using purified smooth muscle myosin showed increased kinase and decreased phosphatase activities in cellular extracts from corpora cavernosa isolated from PBOO compared with sham rabbits. Increased Rho-kinase expression in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits was suggested by the observations that Rho-kinase inhibitors attenuated the increased kinase activity and were less effective in relaxing CCSM strips from PBOO vs. sham rabbits. This hypothesis was then confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, which demonstrated increased expression of both isoforms of Rho-kinase (ROKalpha and ROKbeta). Increased SMM basal phosphorylation (necessary for SM contraction) in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits, mediated via an increase in Rho-kinase expression/activity, would be expected to make the CCSM more difficult to relax (necessary for erection), which suggests that the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway as being involved in the mechanism for LUTS-associated ED."}

Recently a tissue-specific and selective upregulation of the multidrug efflux transporter ABCB1 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the spinal cord of both patients and the mutant SOD1-G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that prevalently kills motor neurons has been reported. Here, we extended the analysis of P-gp expression in the SOD1-G93A ALS mouse model and found that P-gp upregulation was restricted to endothelial cells of the capillaries, while P-gp expression was not detected in other cells of the spinal cord parenchyma such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Using both in vitro human and mouse models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we found that mutant SOD1 astrocytes were driving P-gp upregulation in endothelial cells. In addition, a significant increase in reactive oxygen species production, Nrf2 and NFκB activation in endothelial cells exposed to mutant SOD1 astrocytes in both human and murine BBB models were observed. Most interestingly, astrocytes expressing FUS-H517Q, a different familial ALS-linked mutated gene, also drove NFκB-dependent upregulation of P-gp. However, the pathway was not dependent on oxidative stress but rather involved TNF-α release. Overall, these findings indicated that nuclear translocation of NFκB was a converging mechanism used by endothelial cells of the BBB to upregulate P-gp expression in mutant SOD1-linked ALS and possibly other forms of familial ALS.

Tenecteplase is a thrombolytic agent that offers logistical advantages in cost and administration relative to alteplase. There is evidence that tenecteplase has at least similar efficacy and safety outcomes compared with alteplase for stroke. In this study, we compared tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute stroke in a large retrospective US database (TriNetX) regarding the following 3 outcomes: (1) mortality, (2) intracranial hemorrhage, and (3) the need for acute blood transfusions.	In this retrospective study using the US cohort of 54 academic medical centers/health care organizations in the TriNetX database, we identified 3,432 patients treated with tenecteplase and 55,894 patients treated with alteplase for stroke after January 1, 2012. Propensity score matching was performed on basic demographic information and 7 previous clinical diagnostic groups, resulting in a total of 6,864 patients with acute stroke evenly matched between groups. Mortality rates, the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage, and blood transfusions (as a marker of significant blood loss) were recorded for each group over the ensuing 7- and 30-day periods. Secondary subgroup analyses were conducted on a cohort treated from 2021 to 2022 in an attempt to determine whether temporal differences in acute ischemic stroke treatment would alter the results.	Patients treated with tenecteplase had a significantly lower mortality rate (8.2% versus 9.8%; risk ratio [RR], 0.832) and lower risk of major bleeding as measured by the frequency of blood transfusions (0.3% versus 1.4%; RR, 0.207) than alteplase at 30 days after thrombolysis for stroke. In the larger 10-year data set of patients with stroke treated after January 1, 2012, patients receiving tenecteplase were not found to have a statistically different incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (3.5% versus 3.0%; RR, 1.185) at 30 days after the administration of the thrombolytic agents in patients. However, a subgroup analysis of 2,216 evenly matched patients with stroke treated from 2021 to 2022 demonstrated notably better survival and statistically lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage than the alteplase group.	In our large retrospective multicenter study using real-world evidence from large health care organizations, tenecteplase for the treatment of acute stroke demonstrated a lower mortality rate, decreased intracranial hemorrhage, and less significant blood loss. The favorable mortality and safety profiles observed in this large study, taken together with previous randomized controlled trial data and operational advantages in rapid dosing and cost-effectiveness, all support the preferential use of tenecteplase in patients with ischemic stroke."}

We retrospectively reviewed the histories of patients who underwent surgery for consecutive 3-level CSM between C3-4 and C6-7 from June 2007 to August 2011. A total of 42 patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 19) underwent ACCF combined with 1-level C-ADR; group B (n = 23) underwent ACCF combined with 1-level ACDF. We compared perioperative parameters, clinical parameters, and radiological parameters.	There were no significant differences in the average age, sex ratio, the preoperative heights of the disc space or average blood loss between the 2 groups. Group A had longer operation times than group B (P < 0.05). During the follow-up period, group A showed a better Neck Dysfunction Index recovery (P < 0.05) at 24 months postoperatively, and less visual analogue scale scores at 12 and 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively).

In this study, we evaluated our AVM database of 129 patients seen over the past eight years at our institution: 73 were treated with microsurgery (57%) while 37 (29%) were treated with SRS. We reviewed angiographic obliteration rates, complication rates, and outcome data, excluding seven patients treated with SRS as they did not have at least two years of angiographic follow-up. Patients undergoing microsurgery had smaller AVM (mean 2.2 cm compared to 3.5 cm for SRS), a smaller proportion of eloquent AVM (53% compared to 83% for SRS), a greater proportion of AVM with superficial drainage only (75% compared to 40% for SRS), and more grade 1 and 2 AVM (78% compared to 17% for SRS). The overall obliteration rate was 80%: 92% for microsurgery and 50% for SRS. The latter increased to 92% for AVM <3 cm, but the obliteration rate was 18% for those AVM >3 cm.

The advent and use of antipsychotic drugs over the past 30 years stands out as the most significant change. Because it is well known that chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs can induce tardive dyskinesia and has been hypothesized to induce a supersensitivity psychosis, it is reasonable to believe that other behavioral changes may occur over time. We here describe a behavioral disorder that we have termed tardive dysmentia, involving changes in affect, activation level, and interpersonal interaction. A relationship between tardive dysmentia and tardive dyskinesia is suggested.

Drugs that inhibit the inactivation of NAAG by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) increase its extracellular concentration and its activation of its receptor, mGluR3. These drugs warrant attention, as they are effective in animal models of several clinical disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia. In inflammatory and neuropathic pain studies, GCPII inhibitors moderated both the primary and secondary pain responses when given systemically, locally or in brain regions associated with the pain perception pathway. The finding that GCPII inhibition also moderated the motor and cognitive effects of ethanol intoxication led to the discovery of their procognitive efficacy in long-term memory tests in control mice and in short-term memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. NAAG and GCPII inhibitors respectively reduce cocaine self-administration and the rewarding effects of a synthetic stimulant. Most recently, GCPII inhibition also has been reported to be efficacious in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. GCPII was first discovered as a protein expressed by and released from metastatic prostate cells where it is known as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). GCPII inhibitors with high affinity for this protein have been developed as prostate imaging and radiochemical therapies for prostate cancer. Taken together, these data militate in favor of the development and application of GCPII inhibitors in more advanced preclinical research as a prelude to clinical trials."}

PRKCA encodes the Protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme alpha (PKCα) and is mutated in a wide range of human cancers. However the hot spot PRKCA [D463H] mutation was not described in other tumors. PRKCA [D463H] is strongly associated with the activation of protein translation initiation (EIF2) pathway.

In addition, no data exist regarding the benefits of starting statins in patients with AAA not currently taking them.	We performed a registry-based study of all patients undergoing repair of AAAs in the Vascular Quality Initiative between 2003 and 2017 without documented statin intolerance. In our primary analysis, we evaluated the association between preoperative statin therapy and long-term mortality, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital myocardial infarction and stroke. As a secondary analysis, we studied the cohort of patients not taking a statin preoperatively and compared their long-term mortality on the basis of whether they were discharged on a statin. To account for nonrandom assignment to treatment, we constructed propensity scores and applied inverse probability weighting.	We identified 40,452 AAA repairs, of which 37,950 fit our entry criteria (29,257 endovascular and 8693 open). Overall, 25,997 patients (69%) were taking a statin preoperatively, with patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair more frequently taking a statin than those undergoing open repair (69% compared with 66%; P < .001). After propensity weighting, preoperative statin therapy was not associated with 30-day death or in-hospital stroke or myocardial infarction. However, patients taking statins preoperatively experienced higher adjusted 1-year (94% vs 90%) and 5-year (85% vs 81%) survival from the date of surgery compared with those who were not (P < .001 overall), although subgroup analysis showed that this applied only to intact or symptomatic aneurysms. Of the 11,941 patients not taking a statin preoperatively and discharged alive, 2910 (24%) started on a statin before discharge. In our secondary analysis of the subset of patients not taking statins preoperatively, those initiated on a statin before discharge experienced higher survival at 1 year (94% vs 91%) and 5 years (89% vs 81%; P < .001 overall) than those who remained off statin therapy, with the greatest absolute long-term survival difference in patients with rupture (87% vs 62%; P < .001 overall).	Preoperative statin therapy is associated with higher long-term survival but not perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing AAA repair, and initiating statin therapy in previously statin-naive patients is associated with markedly higher survival. All patients with AAAs without contraindications should receive statin therapy. In patients not taking a statin at the time of AAA repair, clinicians should consider initiating one before discharge."}

Using a retrospective cohort design, this study analysed data collected from patients with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia in 2003 (index hospitalisation) in order to evaluate prescription patterns of antipsychotic drugs.	Patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia, at least one year prior membership with the insurance fund and a follow-up period of one year were identified. Results were standardised by age and stratified by the severity of their illness, defined by the number of hospital bed days during the three years preceding the index hospitalisation.	A total of 3,121 patients with schizophrenia (male 56.4%, female 43.6%) received 56 692 single prescriptions of antipsychotics. Of these, 35.4% of the prescriptions were for typical and 64.6% for atypical antipsychotics; 55% were for high-potency, 45% for low-potency typical antipsychotics. The most frequently prescribed drugs were olanzapine (26.6%), clozapine (21.3%) and risperidone (19%). There were no relevant gender differences concerning prescription patterns. During a 12-month follow-up period after the first hospitalisation, 1 372 patients (43.9%) were treated exclusively with an atypical antipsychotic, another 499 patients (16%) had a combination of an atypical plus a low-potency typical antipsychotic. Thus, basal therapy with an atypical was observed in 59.9% of our study population. Only 327 patients (10.5%) were treated exclusively with a typical antipsychotic. A total of 645 patients (20.7%) were treated with a combination of atypical plus typical antipsychotic. Changes of medication within one substance group occurred more often with typical antipsychotics (50%) as compared to atypical antipsychotics (25%).	At 60%, the proportion of patients in this study treated with atypical antipsychotics was surprisingly high. Of significant interest is the frequent prescription of clozapine (14%). The results are discussed in comparison to comparable studies from other countries."}

At present, cognitive impairment after HIE has received increasing attention. Synaptic plasticity determines the development of cognitive function, so it is urgent to develop new drugs that can improve HIE-induced cognitive impairment. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced neuroinflammation affects synaptic plasticity. As a SIRT1 agonist, resveratrol has a powerful anti-inflammatory effect, but whether it has an effect on impaired synaptic plasticity in HIE and the potential mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, resveratrol was used to intervene in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) mice, and the effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and further mechanisms were explored through performing neurobehavioral, morphological observations, Golgi sliver staining, western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments. We first found that resveratrol improves HI-induced long-term cognitive and memory deficits, and then we found that resveratrol reduces hippocampal neuronal damage and increases dendritic spine density and the expression of synaptic proteins. Finally, we found that this effect may be exerted by regulating the neuroinflammatory response mediated by the SIRT1/NF-κB axis. This study provides a new theoretical basis for resveratrol to prevent long-term neurological dysfunction following HIBI."}

A 51-year-old Japanese woman, who was diagnosed with multiple brain metastatic tumors, was placed on oral phenytoin at a maintenance dose of 200 mg/d (3.8 mg/kg/d) to prevent seizures. The serum concentration of phenytoin was well controlled within the therapeutic range; no seizures occurred. Four months later, combination therapy with doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) 800 mg/d, cyclophosphamide 100 mg/d, and medroxyprogesterone acetate 800 mg/d was initiated because of further metastasis. Approximately 1 month after the start of concurrent treatment with the antineoplastic agents, the serum phenytoin concentration was elevated to fourfold of the original concentration. Staggering was observed at that time, but toxic symptoms gradually subsided with the decline in the serum phenytoin concentration after its withdrawal.	A probable explanation for the marked elevation of serum phenytoin concentration is a reduction of the capacity of CYP2C-dependent phenytoin metabolism, and the antineoplastic agents could be involved in this event. The interaction of fluorouracil and phenytoin is known in clinical practice, and it is reported that the expression of hepatic CYP2C enzymes is depressed by exposure of rats to fluorouracil. 5'-DFUR, a prodrug of fluorouracil, was considered the likeliest candidate responsible for the interaction. This interaction was of clinical significance because of the great extent of changes in the serum phenytoin concentration.

A comparison of the percent DNA synthesis inhibition (assayed by 3H-thymidine uptake 30 min after irradiation), and a 24 h post-irradiation G2 phase accumulation determined by flow cytometry placed the AT heterozygotes and the NHL patients in an intermediate position between the normal subjects (with maximum DNA synthesis inhibition and minimum G2 phase accumulation) and the AT homozygotes (with minimum DNA synthesis inhibition and maximum G2 accumulation). The similarity between AT heterozygotes and the NHL patients with respect to the two parameters studied after irradiation was statistically significant. The data indicating a moderate abnormality in the control of cell cycle progression after irradiation in the LCLs and fibroblasts from NHL patients may explain the enhanced cellular and chromosomal radiosensitivity in these patients reported by us earlier. In addition to demonstrating a link between cell cycle abnormality and radiosensitivity as a possible basis for cancer susceptibility, particularly in the NHL patients, the present studies emphasized the usefulness of the assay for 24 h post-irradiation G2 phase accumulation developed by Lavin et al.

However, past pharmacological approaches have failed to resolve whether activation or blockade of this receptor would have greater therapeutic benefit. To address this issue, we generated compound mice expressing a human amyloid precursor protein gene with familial AD mutations in combination with deficiency of amylin receptors produced by hemizygosity for the critical calcitonin receptor subunit of this heterodimeric GPCR. These compound transgenic AD mice demonstrated attenuated responses to human amylin- and Aβ-induced depression of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in keeping with the genetic depletion of amylin receptors. Both the LTP responses and spatial memory (as measured with Morris water maze) in these mice were improved compared to AD mouse controls and, importantly, a reduction in both the amyloid plaque burden and markers of neuroinflammation was observed. Our data support the notion of further development of antagonists of the amylin receptor as AD-modifying therapies."}

First, we found that the specific ethanol sensitivity hypothesis is not supported by the relevant literature. Second, we found that much of the ambiguity with respect to this hypothesis concerns just pentobarbital. Consequently, the major intent of this paper was to further explore what effect pentobarbital had on these two mouse lines. Additionally, we examined the effects of barbital and ethanol. Our results for each of these compounds clearly indicate that when these mouse lines can be differentiated by particular doses the long-sleep animals always displayed greater narcotic reactions. In this inquiry only one sex was employed, and testing was always initiated at the same time of day. It is our contention that many of the equivocal findings that have been reported concerning pentobarbital are due to combining data from both sexes, circadian rhythmicity, and similar procedural variables."}

In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of CBT4CBT as a virtual stand-alone treatment, delivered with minimal clinical monitoring, and clinician-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with treatment as usual in a heterogeneous sample of treatment-seeking outpatients with substance use disorders.	This was a randomized clinical trial in which 137 individuals who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for current substance abuse or dependence were randomly assigned to receive treatment as usual, weekly individual CBT, or CBT4CBT with brief weekly monitoring.	Rates of treatment exposure differed by group, with the best retention in the CBT4CBT group and the poorest in the individual CBT group. Participants who received CBT or CBT4CBT reduced their frequency of substance use significantly more than those who received treatment as usual. Six-month follow-up outcomes indicated continuing benefit of CBT4CBT (plus monitoring) over treatment as usual, but not for clinician-delivered CBT over treatment as usual. Analysis of secondary outcomes indicated that participants in the CBT4CBT group demonstrated the best learning of cognitive and behavioral concepts, as well as the highest satisfaction with treatment.	This first trial of computerized CBT as a virtual stand-alone intervention delivered in a clinical setting to a diverse sample of patients with current substance use disorders indicated that it was safe, effective, and durable relative to standard treatment approaches and was well-liked by participants.

Currently, detecting EGFRvIII requires postoperative tissue analyses, which are ex vivo and unable to capture the tumor's spatial heterogeneity. Considering the increasing evidence of in vivo imaging signatures capturing molecular characteristics of cancer, this study aims to detect EGFRvIII in primary glioblastoma noninvasively, using routine clinically acquired imaging.Experimental Design: We found peritumoral infiltration and vascularization patterns being related to EGFRvIII status. We therefore constructed a quantitative within-patient peritumoral heterogeneity index (PHI/φ-index), by contrasting perfusion patterns of immediate and distant peritumoral edema. Application of φ-index in preoperative perfusion scans of independent discovery (n = 64) and validation (n = 78) cohorts, revealed the generalizability of this EGFRvIII imaging signature.Results: Analysis in both cohorts demonstrated that the obtained signature is highly accurate (89.92%), specific (92.35%), and sensitive (83.77%), with significantly distinctive ability (P = 4.0033 × 10[-10], AUC = 0.8869). Findings indicated a highly infiltrative-migratory phenotype for EGFRvIII[+] tumors, which displayed similar perfusion patterns throughout peritumoral edema. Contrarily, EGFRvIII[-] tumors displayed perfusion dynamics consistent with peritumorally confined vascularization, suggesting potential benefit from extensive peritumoral resection/radiation.Conclusions: This EGFRvIII signature is potentially suitable for clinical translation, since obtained from analysis of clinically acquired images. Use of within-patient heterogeneity measures, rather than population-based associations, renders φ-index potentially resistant to inter-scanner variations. Overall, our findings enable noninvasive evaluation of EGFRvIII for patient selection for targeted therapy, stratification into clinical trials, personalized treatment planning, and potentially treatment-response evaluation.

After decades of intense studies, α-Synuclein physiology is still difficult to clear up due to its interaction with multiple partners and its involvement in a pletora of neuronal functions. Here, we looked at the remarkably neglected interplay between α-Synuclein and microtubules, which potentially impacts on synaptic functionality. In order to identify the mechanisms underlying these actions, we investigated the interaction between purified α-Synuclein and tubulin. We demonstrated that α-Synuclein binds to microtubules and tubulin α2β2 tetramer; the latter interaction inducing the formation of helical segment(s) in the α-Synuclein polypeptide. This structural change seems to enable α-Synuclein to promote microtubule nucleation and to enhance microtubule growth rate and catastrophe frequency, both in vitro and in cell. We also showed that Parkinson's disease-linked α-Synuclein variants do not undergo tubulin-induced folding and cause tubulin aggregation rather than polymerization. Our data enable us to propose α-Synuclein as a novel, foldable, microtubule-dynamase, which influences microtubule organisation through its binding to tubulin and its regulating effects on microtubule nucleation and dynamics."}

The developed program of the complex differentiated medical and psychological rehabilitation and suicidal behaviour prevention (MPRS BP) in patients with dementia is aimed at the preventive measures of the suicidal behaviour (SB) through the depressive symptoms reduction, patient's mind and cognitive status stabilization, self-aggression decreases, social functioning and independence increase in patients with dementia. The individual approach to the prevention of SB in patients with dementia considered the SB factors (extra- and intrapersonal), SB formation mechanisms (cognitive, depressive, and psychological), clinical psychopathological SB correlators (especially gender-based) in different types of dementia. Offered MPRS BP program is based on the complex approach to rehabilitation. It combines pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy (crisis therapy, rational psychotherapy, art therapy, family psychotherapy), psychoeducation, psychological training (cognitive, communicative and social skills training) keeping to the principles of systematicity, complexity, integrity, phasing, personal interventions, provision of assistance in time. According to the approbation results of the MPRS BP program in dementia, its high efficiency was demonstrated compared to the traditional treatment programs of this category of patients."}

In contrast, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, is associated with acute and neurodevelopmental propsychotic side effects through its interaction with central cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs). CB1R stimulation in the ventral hippocampus (VHipp) potentiates affective memory formation through inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, thereby altering emotional salience attribution. These changes in DA activity and salience attribution, evoked by dysfunctional VHipp regulatory actions and THC exposure, could predispose susceptible individuals to psychotic symptoms. Although THC can accelerate the onset of schizophrenia, CBD displays antipsychotic properties, can prevent the acquisition of emotionally irrelevant memories, and reverses amphetamine-induced neuronal sensitization through selective phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) molecular signaling pathway. This review summarizes clinical and preclinical evidence demonstrating that distinct phytocannabinoids act within the VHipp and associated corticolimbic structures to modulate emotional memory processing through changes in mesolimbic DA activity states, salience attribution, and signal transduction pathways associated with schizophrenia-related pathology."}

In a previous study (Vassileva et al., 2007) we have shown that psychopathic heroin addicts evidence more impulsive decision-making on the Iowa Gambling Task relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether the observed impulse-control deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts would generalize to other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity, such as delay discounting and behavioral inhibition among a group of relatively 'pure' heroin addicts in Bulgaria who participated in our previous study.	We tested 92 currently abstinent male heroin addicts, classified as psychopathic or non-psychopathic based on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R). We administered two neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity: (1) Delayed Rewards Discounting Task, a measure of temporal discounting of rewards; and (2) Passive Avoidance Learning Task, a measure of behavioral inhibition.	Psychopathic heroin addicts were not impaired relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts on the Delayed Rewards Discounting Task and the Passive Avoidance Learning Task, on the latter of which they showed better attentional capacity.	These results indicate that psychopathic heroin users are not uniformly impaired across neurocognitive domains of impulsivity. Combined with our previous findings, results suggest that the presence of psychopathy may exacerbate decision-making deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts, but it may not have significant effect on other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity in this population."}

In order to investigate olfactory perception in different depressive states, we carried out olfactory testing during a depressive episode (n=37) and in a remitted state (n=17). As expected, patients were significantly less depressed (p<0.001) and less anhedonic (p=0.001) in the remitted state. A comparison of olfactory perception between age- and gender-matched patients and healthy volunteers (n=37) controlled for intrinsic olfactory deficits in major depression. In the depressive episode, we applied regression analyses to investigate the relation of olfactory hedonics, severity of depression and anhedonia. The Sniffin' Sticks Test extended by analogue rating scales for intensity and hedonic estimates was employed for olfactory testing. Depression severity was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), anhedonia with the Snaith-Hamilton-Pleasure-Scale (SHAPS). Odour identification ability was significantly reduced during the depressive state. In contrast, no significant differences in hedonic and intensity estimates could be found between the depressive and the remitted state and healthy controls. During the depressive episode, we found a significant relation only between anhedonia and olfactory hedonics. We concluded that anhedonia has potential impact on olfactory hedonics in major depression.

The underlying mechanisms of the mental health benefits of green space are not fully understood, but different pathways have been suggested, such as the psychologically restoring capacities of green space, the ability to facilitate physical activity and social cohesion, and the mitigation of exposure to air pollution.	In this nationwide cohort study, we investigated associations between residential green space in early childhood and a clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	The cohort included individuals, who were born in Denmark between 1992 and 2007 (n=814,689) and followed for a diagnosis of ADHD from age 5, during the period 1997-2016. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of vegetation greenness surrounding each residential address in a quadratic area of 210m×210m in which the residence was located in the center of the quadrate. Individual exposure to green space was calculated as the average of NDVI surrounding each individual's residential address (or addresses if more than one) between birth and the fifth birthday. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ADHD, according to exposure level and adjusted for calendar time, age, sex, parental socioeconomic status, neighborhood level socioeconomic status, and urbanicity.	Individuals living in areas defined by sparse green vegetation (lowest decile of NDVI) had an increased risk of developing ADHD, compared with individuals living in areas within the highest decile of NDVI (IRR=1.55; 95% CI: 1.46, 1.65). Adjusting for the known confounders attenuated the result, but the association remained (IRR=1.20; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.28).

This trend is expected to worsen in the coming decades, with the number of cases possibly even tripling in the next 25 years. Therefore Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention is becoming a global health priority. Our knowledge of the pathophysiological process leading to the development of pathological brain lesions that characterize AD has increased exponentially in recent years. However, the phenotypic expression of AD not only depends on the development of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but other factors also play a role. Thus, over the last few decades, epidemiological studies have revealed several risk factors for developing AD, such as vascular or lifestyle related factors. Having the current knowledge on AD, two different strategies have been developed for the prevention of AD: one is based on primary prevention by acting on modifiable risk factors, the other is a pathophysiology-driven approach aimed to identify individuals in a preclinical stage of the disease and treating them with drugs purporting to act on molecular targets of the amyloid cascade. Several promising trials with these approaches are currently ongoing and results are expected in the next few years. The intrinsic limitations in the design of preventive trials should be overcome through a global effort involving healthy population, healthcare professionals, governments, industry, and scientific institutions. This exertion will be more than compensated if we can make AD a preventable disease."}

Coronal fat-saturated T2-weighted MRI of the orbit was performed in 15 patients with SIH fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for headache caused by low CSF pressure of the International Classification of Headache Disorders or the criteria for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks and intracranial hypotension. The size of the subarachnoid space in the ONS was measured in 2 slices behind the eyeballs. The images were compared before and after treatment. The CSF pressure was measured by lumbar puncture.	Before treatment, the diameter of the ONS subarachnoid space ranged from 2.58 to 4.21 mm (mean 3.34 mm) and the thickness from 0 to 0.48 mm (mean 0.15 mm). Both measurements showed significant correlations with CSF opening pressure, and 8 patients had no CSF space before treatment. The size of CSF space increased in many patients after effective treatment.	Disappearance of the CSF space in the ONS was frequently observed in patients with SIH.

Nevertheless, patients who report that they feel emotionally numb about their illness might encounter difficulties cognitively processing an EOL discussion.	We hypothesized that emotional numbness would modify the effect of EOL discussions on the receipt of less aggressive EOL care.	Data were derived from structured interviews with 290 participants in the federally-funded Coping with Cancer Study, a multisite, prospective cohort study of patients with advanced cancer followed-up till their death. Patients' reports of EOL discussions with their physician and emotional numbness were assessed at a median of 4.6 months before their death. Information about aggressive EOL care (i.e., ventilation, resuscitation in the last week of life, death in the intensive care unit) was obtained from postmortem caregiver interviews and medical charts. Main and interactive effects of EOL discussions and emotional numbness on aggressive EOL care, adjusting for potential confounds, were evaluated using multiple logistic regression.	The likelihood of aggressive EOL care associated with having EOL discussions increased by a factor of nine (adjusted odds ratio=9.02, 95% CI 1.37, 59.6, P=0.022) for every unit increase in a patient's emotional numbness score.	Emotional numbness diminishes a patient's capacity to benefit from EOL discussions.

Sertindole , first withdrawn from the market for cardiovascular safety concerns, is currently available in many countries. It has high affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and a1-adrenergic receptors, and a low potential for extrapyramidal symptoms.	The pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability, and cost-effectiveness of sertindole are covered in this article, based on a literature review (PubMed) from 1990 to 2014.	The reviewed studies suggest a beneficial effect of sertindole on positive, negative and cognitive symptoms, and on relapse prevention. Although generally well tolerated, sertindole is associated with a dose-related QT-interval prolongation; thus, its administration requires electrocardiogram screening and monitoring. The presence of congenital long QT syndrome, prolongated QTc at baseline, cardiac disease and drug interactions should be carefully considered before prescribing sertindole. Further direct 'head-to-head' comparisons with other second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), trials on special populations and further clarification on cardiac safety are needed to better define the role of sertindole in the treatment of schizophrenia."}

In addition, general and specific literature databases were searched and patient and therapist organizations contacted.	Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which a massage or touch intervention was given to persons suffering from dementia of any type, compared with other treatments or no treatment, and in which effect parameters included measures of behavioural problems, caregiver burden, emotional distress or cognitive abilities, were eligible for inclusion. Furthermore, we employed a set of minimal methodological quality criteria as a selection filter.	We identified 34 references in the initial searches. Of these, seven were actual or possible RCTs, but only two were found to meet the requirements of the set of minimal methodological criteria.	The very limited amount of reliable evidence available is in favour of massage and touch interventions for problems associated with dementia. However, this evidence addresses only two specific applications: hand massage for the immediate or short-term reduction of agitated behaviour, and the addition of touch to verbal encouragement to eat for the normalization of nutritional intake. The existing evidence does not support general conclusions about the effect or possible side effects of such interventions. No severe side effects were identified.	Massage and touch may serve as alternatives or complements to other therapies for the management of behavioural, emotional and perhaps other conditions associated with dementia.

It is a progressive and well recognized complex disease; therefore, it is very urgent to develop novel and effective anti-AD drugs. In this study, a series of novel isochroman-4-one derivatives from natural (±)-7,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-isochroman-4-one [(±)-XJP] were designed and synthesized, and their anti-AD potential was evaluated. Among them, compound 10a [(Z)-3-acetyl-1-benzyl-4-((6,7-dimethoxy-4-oxoisochroman-3-ylidene)methyl)pyridin-1-ium bromide] possessed potent anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as well as modest antioxidant activity. Further molecular modeling and kinetic investigations revealed that compound 10a was a dual-binding inhibitor that binds to both catalytic anionic site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the enzyme AChE. In addition, compound 10a exhibited low cytotoxicity and moderate anti-Aβ aggregation efficacy. Moreover, the in silico screening suggested that these compounds could pass across the blood-brain barrier with high penetration. These findings show that compound 10a was a promising lead from a natural product with potent AChE inhibitory activity and deserves to be further developed for the prevention and treatment of AD."}

We confirm and extend previous observations of virus persistence in the brain, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, thyroid and reticuloendothelial system. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time persistence of viral nucleic acid in specific cell types in the thymus, lymph nodes, testes and bladder, and the adrenal, parathyroid and salivary glands; the cell types infected were observed in several animals. In lymphoid tissue, viral nucleic acid was predominantly located in the T cell-dependent areas of the spleen and lymph nodes; it was also present in cells of the thymic medulla. This has important implications for the deficiency in T cell function observed in persistently infected mice. In the testes, viral nucleic acid was detected in spermatogonia but not differentiating spermatocytes and therefore, in this tissue at least, persistence is related to the state of differentiation of the cell. Endocrine and exocrine dysfunctions have been described in persistently infected mice and we report that the highest levels of viral nucleic acid were found in the adrenal gland. The infection of endocrine and exocrine tissue was not pantropic, specific cell types expressed viral nucleic acid in each tissue. In the adrenal cortex, cells of the zona reticularis and zona fasciculata but not the zona glomerulosa were positive, whereas in the adrenal medulla viral nucleic acid was predominantly localized to adrenalin-secreting cells.

Thus, this study examined which gait and balance parameters best correlate with periventricular LA to better understand the pathogenesis of mobility decline in MCI. High resolution MRI and detailed mobility assessment were performed in 61 subjects (72 years+/-5) with MCI. Cognitive assessment included Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and the Trail Making test part B (TMB). Mobility assessment included reports of falls in the previous 6-month period, the walking while talking test, the timed 'up and go test' (TUG), measurement of fast gait speed, the standing test and the one-leg standing test. There was an association between marked periventricular LA and slow postural changes, slow gait (TUG and gait speed), altered balance (standing test and one-leg standing test), altered walking while talking test. But after adjusting for age and ventriculomegaly on a logistic multiple regression model, performance on the TUG test was the only clinical predictor of periventricular LA (>10 s, P=0.002). Poorer TUG performances were more frequent with vascular than Alzheimer's disease-like profiles on the FCSRT and TMB tests (P=0.01).

While the former is caused by rare, highly penetrant, and pathogenic mutations, risk for sporadic ALS is probably the result of the combined effects of common polymorphisms with minor to moderate effect sizes. Owing to recent advances in high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies, genetic research in both fields is evolving at a rapidly increasing pace making it more and more difficult to follow and evaluate the most significant progress in the field. To alleviate this problem, our groups have created dedicated and freely available online databases, ALSoD (http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk/) and ALSGene (http://www.alsgene.org), which provide systematic and in-depth qualitative and quantitative overviews of genetic research in both familial and sporadic ALS. This review briefly introduces the background and main features of both databases and provides an overview of the currently most compelling genetic findings in ALS derived from analyses using these resources."}

Latent class analyses were used to characterize polysubstance abuse/dependence (AB/D) in 43 093 individuals who participated in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the association between the classes of life-time illicit drug AB/D and gender, age and race, as well as life-time Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV) alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia and antisocial personality disorder.	Five latent classes were identified: no AB/D (class 1: 92.5%), cannabis AB/D only (class 2: 5.8%), stimulants + hallucinogen AB/D (class 3: 0.6%), prescription drug AB/D (class 4: 0.6%) and polysubstance AB/D (class 5: 0.5%). Major depressive disorder and nicotine dependence were associated most strongly with class 5. Anxiety disorders were associated strongly with the prescription drug AB/D class while alcohol AB/D and ASPD were associated with classes 2, 3, 4 and 5 when compared to the reference class (class 1).	Significant heterogeneity exists in this US population for polysubstance AB/D patterns with evidence for a subgroup with high rates of sedative, tranquilizer and opiate AB/D and a history of anxiety disorders, a stimulant/hallucinogens group, a high-risk group with elevated rates of all psychiatric disorders and a milder cannabis AB/D only group.

While amyloid deposition has been noted within atrial appendages, the incidence and significance remains incompletely understood. More accurate amyloid typing methodologies and targeted pharmacotherapeutics have recently been developed, prompting pathologists to provide more detailed information about the type of amyloid identified in such samples. This study sought to fully characterize the morphologic characteristics of atrial amyloid as well as its incidence and clinical significance. Tissue archives were queried for atrial appendages removed during the cardiac surgeries (2010-2014). Patient demographics, imaging features, and salient clinical findings were recorded. Pattern and extent of amyloid deposition were recorded. Typing of the amyloid protein, when present, was performed on a subset of cases by laser capture microdissection with mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. A total of 383 atrial appendages from 345 consecutive patients were included in the study (mean age, 69 years; range, 26-92 years). Amyloid was present in 46% of patients. A linear relationship was observed between age and presence of atrial amyloidosis. Women were more likely to have atrial amyloidosis. Two distinct morphologies of amyloid were observed: filamentous and nonfilamentous, and correlated perfectly with amyloid type (filamentous = AANF-type amyloid; nonfilamentous = ATTR-type amyloid). Filamentous deposits were observed in 91% of those with amyloid. Amyloid was more likely to be found in the left atrial appendage than the right. Patients with atrial amyloid, irrespective of type, were more likely to have experienced stroke or TIA and more likely to have atrial arrhythmia preoperatively. Postoperatively, those with atrial amyloid are more likely to experience recurrence of arrhythmia than those who did not have atrial amyloid. Understanding the morphologic characteristics of AANF-type amyloid will allow for identification by the light microscopy and obviates the need for expensive ancillary typing techniques. The finding of nonfilamentous amyloid, should still prompt confirmation of amyloid type so that targeted therapy may be employed."}

Activity of sulfatases depends on post-translational modification catalyzed by formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), encoded by the SUMF1 gene. SUMF1 pathologic variants cause MSD, a syndrome presenting with a complex phenotype. We describe the first Polish patient with MSD caused by a yet undescribed pathologic variant c.337G>A [p.Glu113Lys] (i.e. p.E113K) in heterozygous combination with the known deletion allele c.519+5_519+8del [p.Ala149_Ala173del]. The clinical picture of the patient initially suggested late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy, with developmental delay followed by regression of visual, hearing and motor abilities as the most apparent clinical symptoms. Transient signs of ichthyosis and minor dysmorphic features guided the laboratory workup towards MSD. Since MSD is a rare disease and there is a variable clinical spectrum, we thoroughly describe the clinical outcome of our patient. The FGE-E113K variant, expressed in cell culture, correctly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum but was retained intracellularly in contrast to the wild type FGE. Analysis of FGE-mediated activation of steroid sulfatase in immortalized MSD cells revealed that FGE-E113K exhibited only approx. 15% of the activity of wild type FGE. Based on the crystal structure we predict that the exchange of glutamate-113 against lysine should induce a strong destabilization of the secondary structure, possibly affecting the folding for correct disulfide bridging between C235-C346 as well as distortion of the active site groove that could affect both the intracellular stability as well as the activity of FGE. Thus, the novel variant of the SUMF1 gene obviously results in functionally impaired FGE protein leading to a severe late infantile type of MSD."}

For future clinical trials quantitative data on disease progression rates are essential. Moreover, diagnosis can be challenging in ALD women, as the most important diagnostic biomarker is normal in 15-20%. Better biomarkers are needed. The purpose of this single centre cross-sectional follow-up study in women with ALD was to assess whether Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), AMC Linear Disability Scale (ALDS) and Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) can detect disease progression and to model the effect of age and duration of symptoms on the rate of progression. Moreover, we performed a pilot study to assess if a semi-targeted lipidomics approach can identify possible new diagnostic biomarkers.	In this study 46 women (baseline clinical data published by our group previously) were invited for a follow-up visit. Newly identified women at our center were also recruited. We analysed 65 baseline and 34 follow-up assessments. Median time between baseline and follow-up was 7.8 years (range 6.4-8.7). Mean age at baseline was 49.2 ± 14.2 years, at follow-up 55.4 ± 10.1. EDSS increased significantly (+ 0.08 points/year), but the other outcome measures did not. Increasing age and duration of symptoms were associated with more disability. For the pilot study we analysed plasma of 20 ALD women and 10 controls with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, which identified 100 potential biomarker ratios with strong differentiating properties and non-overlapping data distributions between ALD women and controls.	Progression of spinal cord disease can be detected with EDSS, but not with ALDS or SF-36 after a follow-up period of almost 8 years. Moreover, age and the duration of symptoms seem positively associated with the rate of progression. Although a significant progression was measurable, it was below the rate generally conceived as clinically relevant. Therefore, EDSS, ALDS and SF-36 are not suitable as primary outcome measures in clinical trials for spinal cord disease in ALD women. In addition, a semi-targeted lipidomics approach can identify possible new diagnostic biomarkers for women with ALD."}

We investigated this issue using cell lines from Friedreich's ataxia patients, homozygous for a GAA-repeat expansion in intron 1 of the Frataxin gene. By interphase, FISH we found that in comparison to the normal Frataxin sequence the replication of expanded alleles is slowed or delayed. According to molecular combing, origins never fired within the normal Frataxin allele. In contrast, in mutant alleles dormant origins are recruited within the gene, causing a switch of the prevalent fork direction through the expanded repeat. Furthermore, a global modification of the replication profile, involving origin choice and a differential distribution of unidirectional forks, was observed in the surrounding 850 kb region. These data provide a wide-view of the interplay of events occurring during replication of genes carrying an expanded repeat."}

Regardless of rat sex, with the disease development xanthine oxidase (XO) activity and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression increased in spinal cord, whereas glutathione levels decreased. This was accompanied by the rise in spinal cord malondialdehyde level. On the other hand, with EAE development superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased, while O2[-] concentration increased only in spinal cord of male rats. Consequently, SOD activity was lower, whereas O2[-] concentration was higher in spinal cord of male rats with clinically manifested EAE. XO activity and iNOS mRNA expression were also elevated in their spinal cord. Consistently, in the effector phase of EAE the concentration of advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) was higher in spinal cord of male rats, which exhibit more severe neurological deficit than their female counterparts. In as much as data obtained in the experimental models could be translated to humans, the findings may be relevant for designing sex-specific antioxidant therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the study indicated that the increased pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance in plasma may be an early indicator of EAE development. Moreover, it showed that plasma AOPP level may indicate not only actual activity of the disease, but also serve to predict severity of its course."}

The underlying pathophysiology of sleep abnormalities across neuropsychiatric disorders remains unclear, and may involve the inter-play of several clinical variables and mechanistic pathways. In this review, we propose a heuristic framework in which reciprocal interactions of immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and mitochondrial pathways may drive sleep abnormalities across potentially neuroprogressive disorders. Specifically, it is proposed that systemic inflammation may activate microglial cells and astrocytes in brain regions involved in sleep and circadian regulation. Activated glial cells may secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (for example, interleukin-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha), nitric oxide and gliotransmitters, which may influence the expression of key circadian regulators (e.g., the Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) gene). Furthermore, sleep disruption may further aggravate oxidative and nitrosative, peripheral immune activation, and (neuro) inflammation across these disorders in a vicious pathophysiological loop. This review will focus on chronic fatigue syndrome, bipolar disorder, and multiple sclerosis as exemplars of neuro-immune disorders. We conclude that novel therapeutic targets exploring immune and oxidative & nitrosative pathways (p.e. melatonin and molecular hydrogen) hold promise in alleviating sleep and circadian dysfunction in these disorders."}

She was successfully treated with systemic chemotherapy, without hysterectomy or irradiation. She remains in second complete remission 54 months after relapse.	Immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against cell surface antigens made the cytologic diagnosis of leukemic relapse in the uterine cervix possible. Systemic chemotherapy is the first treatment of choice for ALL recurrence in the genital tract in a patient without poor prognostic factors in order to spare gonadal function and reproductive potential."}

Older adults were recruited from the waiting rooms of 2 geriatrics outpatient clinics for face-to-face interviews regarding their interest in being screened for MCI. A short description of MCI adapted from The Alzheimer's Association's 'Fact Sheet' was presented before asking about MCI testing. Multivariable ordinal regression was used to account for heavily skewed outcome data showing very high levels of interest in screening for MCI. The strongest, most consistent correlate across all of the intention measures was the desire to know as early as possible if one has Alzheimer disease. Another robust correlate was having had normal memory testing in the past. Older adults appear to have psychologically connected MCI to Alzheimer disease, but how well they understand this connection is not known and requires further study."}

{"pmid": "15956992", "text": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology^\nConstitutively active micro opioid receptors mediate the enhanced conditioned aversive effect of naloxone in morphine-dependent mice.^\nNaloxone administration produces a robust conditioned place aversion (CPA) in opiate-naive rodents by blocking the action of enkephalins at mu opioid receptors. This aversive response is potentiated by prior exposure to morphine. In vitro studies indicate that morphine treatment may promote constitutive activity of mu opioid receptors. We hypothesized that such enhanced constitutive activity in vivo may underlie the increased aversive property of naloxone by uncovering the inverse agonist property of this drug. The CPA produced by naloxone was compared with that produced by the neutral antagonists 6-alpha- and 6-beta-naloxol in mice with and without prior morphine exposure. While all three drugs produced CPA, only naloxone CPA was enhanced by morphine given 20 h prior to each naloxone injection. Furthermore, only naloxone produced withdrawal jumping when given 20 h after morphine, even though 6-alpha-naloxol was able to produce jumping when given 4 h after morphine. These data suggest that morphine may enhance naloxone CPA by increasing levels of constitutively active mu receptors and further support the role of such constitutive activity in mediating naloxone-precipitated physical withdrawal. Such long-term changes in constitutive activity of the mu receptor induced by exogenous opiate exposure may thus be an important factor in hedonic homeostatic dysregulation proposed to underlie the addictive process."}

This study examines this relationship by applying network analysis to a large sample collected at 18-months follow-up in a longitudinal dataset.	One thousand four hundred and eighty-six college students were recruited and completed a set of self-reported questionnaires on empathy, schizotypy, depression, anxiety and stress. Networks were constructed by taking the subscale scores of these measures as nodes and partial correlations between each pair of nodes as edges. Network Comparison Tests were performed to investigate the differences between individuals with high and low schizotypy.	Cognitive and affective empathy were strongly connected with negative schizotypy in the network. Physical and social anhedonia showed high centrality measured by strength, closeness and betweenness while anxiety and stress showed high expected influence. Predictability ranged from 22.4% (personal distress) to 79.9% (anxiety) with an average of 54.4%. Compared with the low schizotypy group, the high schizotypy group showed higher global strength (S = 0.813, p < 0.05) and significant differences in network structure (M = 0.531, p < 0.001) and strength of edges connecting empathy with schizotypy (adjusted ps < 0.05).	Only self-rating scales were used, and disorganized schizotypy was not included.	Our findings suggest that the cognitive and affective components of empathy and dimensions of schizotypy are closely related in the general population and their network interactions may play an important role in individuals with high schizotypy."}

However, considerably less attention is devoted to the impact of exercise on health outcomes for people experiencing a mental illness. In response to the recognized paucity, a structured exercise program was developed and implemented for residents of a Community Care Unit in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Six residents participated in the program over a period of three months. This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study. A focus group interview was conducted with the resident participants (n=6), the exercise physiologists who developed and implemented the program (n=2), and nursing staff involved in implementing and supporting the program (n=4). Analysis of the data collected revealed that four main themes had emerged: the individual nature of the program, physical improvement, group dynamics, and future plans. The findings of this study suggest that involvement in the program produced very positive outcomes, most notably in the physical fitness of residents. The individual nature of the program which enabled gradual participation, and the cohesive approach of the group as a whole were considered very important factors contributing to the overall success. Furthermore, the participants planned to continue with some form of physical activity in the future. The potential value of regular exercise for patients experiencing a mental illness has significant implications for nursing and requires further research exploration."}

The EncephalApp Stroop test is validated for its screening. The aim of the study was to define Tunisian norms for the test based on healthy controls norms and to estimate the prevalence of CHE in cirrhotic Tunisian patients. Methods: A prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted. Ambulatory or hospitalized cirrhotic patients aged 40 years and over were recruited at 11 centers. Healthy subjects aged 40 years and over were recruited at 8 centers. We used a translated Arabic version of the streamlined EncephalApp Stroop test. The task has two components: 'Off' and 'On' state depending on the discordance or concordance of the stimuli. Results: 142 patients were included. The mean age was 57.26 years [40-86]. 40 (28.17%) of cirrhotic patients who were included were diagnosed as having a minimal hepatic encephalopathy or CHE. Among the ineligible patients, 22 had overt hepatic encephalopathy. If we consider these patients, the overall prevalence rate of CHE was around 24.39% in cirrhotic patients. It was more frequent in women (34.21% vs 25.96%), and in patients whose level of school education is between 6 and 13 years. Its prevalence does not appear to be affected by gender, MELD score, etiology of cirrhosis and age group of patients, as these variables were independent with respective p according to the chi-square test 0.413; 0.736; 0.663 and 0.1. The stroop times (On / Off and On + Off) correlated significantly with each other, are associated significantly and positively with age (respective Pearson coefficients: 0.578; 0.567 and 0.6). The more the age increases, the more the stroop response times increases (p > 10 [-3]). Conclusions: EncephalApp Stroop test was an efficient screening tool for CHE in Tunisian cirrhotic patients."}

Furthermore to study the consequences of pain and to identify pain-exacerbating and pain-relieving factors.	In a national survey, fifty-five adolescents with spinal muscular atrophy and dystrophinopathy completed a questionnaire assessing pain frequency, duration, location using a body map, intensity and discomfort using visual analogue scales, pain interference using a modified version of Brief Pain Inventory and factors exacerbating and relieving pain.	Sixty-nine per cent of the adolescents reported pain during the past three months and 50% reported chronic pain. The pain prevalence did not differ significantly between diagnostic groups or between ambulators and non-ambulators. The average pain intensity was graded as mild and the worst pain as moderate. The pain typically occurred weekly, most frequently in the neck/back or legs. General activity and mood were the areas that were most affected by pain. Common pain-exacerbating factors were sitting, too much movement/activity and being lifted or transferred.	Pain is a frequent problem in adolescents with spinal muscular atrophy and dystrophinopathy.

Despite growing efforts to understand associations between potential risk factors and outcomes after injury, prognosis is elusive and lacks the inclusion of genetic variables which may convey additional predictive power. This study assessed which factors contribute to pediatric QoL 6 and 18 months post-recruitment in 159 participants (mTBI = 52; orthopedic injury [OI] = 43; typically developing controls [TDC] = 64) aged 18 to 60 months at the time of injury (M = 37.50, SD = 11.69). Family environment, injury characteristics, and child cognitive-behavioral functioning were assessed at 6 months via parent questionnaires and socio-cognitive assessment. QoL was determined using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory at both time points. Genetic information (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] genotype) was collected using saliva samples. Hierarchical regression analyses testing biological, family-environmental, injury and cognitive-behavioral factors revealed that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was a significant independent predictor of better QoL 6 months post-injury in the mTBI group. Lower parental distress significantly and independently predicted higher QoL 18 months after mTBI, and 6 months post-recruitment in the TDC group. At 18 months, models were non-significant for both control groups. Genetic factors involved in neuroplasticity may play an important role in recovery 6 months after mTBI and contribute to outcome via their interplay with environmental factors. Over time, family factors appear to become the primary determinants of post-mTBI outcome."}

Several recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams. As telehealth technology advances and uptake expands, understanding the evidence for remote CoCM becomes increasingly crucial to inform CoCM practice and implementation.	The objective of this study was to systematically review randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams in treating common psychiatric conditions in primary care and medical settings.	Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to structure our review. Our search strategy and development of search terms was informed by knowledge and review of the CoCM literature. Articles were reviewed by 3 authors, and once selected, they were sent to 2 authors for further data extraction to describe various study characteristics and process measures relating to remote CoCM.	The literature search identified 13,211 articles, 9 of which met inclusion criteria. The 9 studies collectively demonstrate effectiveness of remote CoCM in treating a range of behavioral health conditions (depression [n = 7], anxiety [n = 2], and PTSD [n = 1]), across various populations and settings. Sample sizes ranged from 191 patients to 704 patients, publication dates from 2004 to 2018, and studies were conducted from 2000 to 2014. Various process measures were also reported.	As the 9 studies included in our systematic review demonstrate, remote CoCM can be effective in treating a range of behavioral health conditions in various primary care and specialty medical settings. These findings suggest organizations may have more flexibility in building their CoCM team and drawing upon wider workforces than previously recognized. As recent shifts in telehealth policy and practice continue to motivate telehealth approaches, further research that can inform best practices for remote CoCM will be useful and valuable to those making organizational decisions when implementing integrated care models."}

Early life stress (ELS), common in patients with psychiatric disorders, has independently been associated with memory biases, and confounds MDD versus control group comparisons. Furthermore, in most studies negative biases could have resulted from executive impairments rather than memory difficulties per se.	To investigate whether memory biases are relevant to MDD vulnerability and how they are influenced by ELS, we developed an associative recognition memory task for temporo-spatial contexts of social actions with low executive demands, which were matched across conditions (self-blame, other-blame, self-praise, other-praise). We included fifty-three medication-free remitted MDD (25 with ELS, 28 without) and 24 healthy control (HC) participants without ELS.	Only MDD patients with ELS showed a reduced bias (accuracy/speed ratio) towards memory for positive vs. negative materials when compared with MDD without ELS and with HC participants; attenuated positive biases correlated with number of past major depressive episodes, but not current symptoms. There were no biases towards self-blaming or self-praising memories.	This demonstrates that reduced positive biases in associative memory were specific to MDD patients with ELS rather than a general feature of MDD, and were associated with lifetime recurrence risk which may reflect a scarring effect. If replicated, our results would call for stratifying MDD patients by history of ELS when assessing and treating emotional memories."}

Wistar rats were subjected to BCCAo procedure under anaesthesia to induce VaD. The rats were subjected to Morris water maze (MWM) test (6th day onwards post-surgery). MWM test was employed to assess learning and memory of the animals whereby escape latency time, time spent in target quadrant and Path length (distance travelled) taken as important parameters. Serum nitrite level; Brain thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels; Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; brain Myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and neutrophil count were estimated as per standard procedures. BCCAo in rats produced a significant vascular endothelial dysfunction, as reflected by decrease in serum nitrite levels. Further, these animals showed poor performance on MWM, depicting impairment of learning and memory. There was a significant rise in brain oxidative stress level as indicated by increase in TBARS and decrease in GSH levels. An increase in brain AChE activity was also observed. Moreover, these rats also exhibited an increase in MPO activity and neutrophil infiltration in brain (as marker of inflammation). Treatment of Carnosine (200 and 400 mg/kg, i.p.)/Donepezil (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) ameliorated BCCAo-induced memory deficits; endothelial dysfunction; biochemical and histopathological changes. It is concluded that Carnosine has shown efficacy in rat model of BCCAo-induced VaD and can be considered as an important therapeutic agent for the treatment of VaD."}

The findings suggest continuity with both negative and positive aspects of institutional care described before the policy of community care was introduced. The attempts to 'normalize' institutional care by desegregating wards appear rather to have compounded problems faced by women. Women were clear about what they felt they wanted and needed. Women are dissatisfied about many aspects of care aside from the problems associated specifically with mixed sex wards. This suggests that sexual segregation of wards alone is a necessary but an insufficient measure to improve inpatient care.

We quantified a broad range of postmortem features (Purkinje cell [PC] counts, PC axonal torpedoes, a host of associated axonal changes [PC axonal recurrent collateral count, PC thickened axonal profile count, PC axonal branching count], heterotopic PCs, and basket cell rating) in 60 ET cases (11 childhood-onset and 49 adult-onset) and 30 controls. Compared to controls, childhood-onset ET cases had lower PC counts, higher torpedo counts, higher heterotopic PC counts, higher basket cell plexus rating, and marginally higher PC axonal recurrent collateral counts. The median PC thickened axonal profile count and median PC axonal branching count were two to five times higher in childhood-onset ET than controls, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Childhood-onset and adult-onset ET had similar PC counts, torpedo counts, heterotopic PC counts, basket cell plexus rating, PC axonal recurrent collateral counts, PC thickened axonal profile count and PC axonal branching count. In conclusion, we found that childhood-onset and adult-onset ET shared similar pathological changes in the cerebellum. The data suggest that pathological changes we have observed in the cerebellum in ET are a part of the pathophysiological cascade of events in both forms of the disease and that both groups seem to reach the same pathological endpoints at a similar age of death."}

A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth (ages 12-26) were recruited through the adolescent medicine trials network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. Participants completed a self-administered survey. Over half screened positive on the CRAFFT (i.e., ≥2). Among frequent substance users, those older in age, behaviorally infected, with history of incarceration or unstably housed were more likely to screen positive on the CRAFFT. Study findings suggest that the CRAFFT reliably identifies youth who use substances. Thus, screening measures such as the CRAFFT should be utilized routinely in HIV clinical settings for youth.

To detect differences in the whole brain topology among LGG patients before and after operation, a combined study of neurocognitive assessment and graph theoretical network analysis of fMRI data was performed. We collected resting-state fMRI data of 12 carefully selected frontal lobe LGG patients before and after operation. We calculated the topological properties of brain functional networks in the 12 LGG, and compared with 12 healthy controls (HCs). We also applied Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a subset of patients (n = 12, including before and after operation groups) and HCs (n = 12). The resulting functional connectivity matrices were constructed for all 12 patients, and binary network analysis was performed. In the range of 0.05 ≤ Kcos t ≤ 0.35, the functional networks in preoperative LGG and postoperative one both fitted the definition of small-worldness. We proposed Knet = 0.20 as small-world network interval, and the results showed that the topological properties were found to be disrupted in the two LGG groups, meanwhile the global efficiency increased and the local efficiency decreased. Lnet in the two LGG groups both were longer than HCs. Cnet in the LGG groups were smaller than HCs. Compared with the Hcs, MoCA in the two LGG groups were lower than HCs with significant difference, and the disturbed networks in the LGG were negatively related to worse MoCA scores.

Further, through immunohistochemical illumination, distinct classes of genes were found whose protein products localized to infiltrating macrophages, endothelial cells and resident glia, such as CD163, Glut5, and ISG15.

This molecular phenotyping in the infected brains revealed pathways promoting entry of macrophages into the brain and their subsequent detrimental effects on neurons.

Three clinical forms of Gaucher disease have been described: type 1 as non-neuronopathic, type 2 as acute neuronopathic, and type 3 as subacute neuronopathic. We recently identified a rare mutation (G-->A at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1604) [Choy et al., 1994a, Am J Med Genet 51:156-160] and a novel mutation (T-->G at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1366) in two type 1 Gaucher patients by sequence analysis of the entire glucocerebrosidase coding region [Choy et al., 1994a, 1994b, Hum Mol Genet 3:821-823]. To demonstrate that these are deleterious and not neutral mutations, we cloned the full-length glucocerebrosidase cDNA of patients and of a normal control in the plasmid vector pAcUW1, recombined the human gene into the Baculovirus genome downstream of its polyhedron p10 promoter, and expressed the inserted gene in cultured cells of Spodoptera frugiperda transfected by recombinant Baculovirus. The levels of residual glucocerebrosidase activity determined in transfected cells with the Gaucher G1604A and T1366G alleles are 6.9% and 2.9% of that expressed by the normal allele (normal = 352.0 nmol/hr/mg protein or 100%). By comparison, the enzyme-specific activity expressed in transfected cells by 2 known Gaucher alleles, A1226G and T1448C, that are prevalent in type 1 and type 2 Gaucher disease are 23.4% and 3.3% of normal. No endogeneous glucocerebrosidase activity was detected in cultured cells transfected by either the wild-type Baculovirus or Baculovirus with the pAcUW1 plasmid vector without the glucocerebrosidase cDNA insert. These findings show that the Baculovirus expression system in cultured Spodoptera frugiperda cells is a suitable system for the functional expression and characterization of the normal and mutant glucocerebrosidase alleles.

Three factors were derived by principal components factor analysis of the PBI (maternal and paternal care, overprotection and control). Maternal overprotection was associated with OCD in offspring with familial OCD (familial cases) but only if neither parent was affected with OCD, which suggests independent but additive environmental and genetic risk (OR = 5.9, 95% CI 1.2, 29.9, p = 0.031).

These studies were performed with ligands, such as ketanserin, altanserin and LSD, that may bind with high-affinity to different structural or functional conformations of the 5-HT(2A)R. Interpretation of results may also be confounded by chronic antipsychotic treatment and suicidal behavior in the schizophrenia group.

To begin the search for the gene-disease connection, both genes were mapped to human chromosomes by FISH. The PRRX1 locus maps to 1q23, whereas the PRRX2 locus maps to 9q34.1. This localization, along with the recently described phenotypes of the gene-targeted Prrx1, Prrx2 and double mutant mice, enabled us to search the human disease databases for similar malformations. This examination suggested that mutations at the PRRX1 and/or PRRX2 loci could result in Nager Acrofacial Dysostosis (NAFD) syndrome. We obtained DNA samples from eight patients with NAFD, as well as two patients with Miller syndrome, and analyzed them for mutations in the PRRX1 and PRRX2 genes. The data excludes mutations in the presumed coding sequences of these genes from causing NAFD."}

Clinical, imaging (five CT and 20 MR examinations), and MRS (six studies in five patients) findings in 19 patients with mitochondrial disorders were retrospectively reviewed. Results were critically analyzed and, when applicable, compared with results in the literature.	Patients included four with mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), two with myoclonus, epilepsy, and ragged red fibers (MERRF), two with Kearns-Sayre syndrome, seven with Leigh syndrome, one with progressive cerebral poliodystrophy (Alpers syndrome), and three with trichopoliodystrophy (Menkes disease). MELAS, MERRF, and Kearns-Sayre tended to occur in older children and adults, whereas Leigh syndrome, Alpers syndrome, and Menkes disease occurred in infants and young children. All diseases involved gray matter early in their course, manifest primarily as T2 prolongation, with the deep cerebral nuclei being involved more often than the cerebral cortex. When T2 prolongation was seen in the white matter (MELAS, MERRF, Kearns-Sayre, Leigh), the peripheral and retrotrigonal white matter showed early involvement. Patients with Menkes disease showed rapidly progressive atrophy accompanied by large subdural hematomas. Proton MRS showed an elevated lactate level in involved regions of the brain; the lactate peak disappeared in old areas of T2 prolongation.	Mitochondrial disorders have a wide range of both clinical and imaging findings. Although no one set of findings is diagnostic of these disorders, the combination of deep gray matter involvement and peripheral white matter involvement in young adults or children should suggest the diagnosis, especially when associated with an elevated lactate level on proton MRS."}

Neuroinflammation can also be induced by systemic influences (factors from outside the central nervous system). However, the role of systemic inflammation in AD pathophysiology is much less understood. Thus, our main objective in this study was to verify whether the presence of serum cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α) affects different AD biomarkers: Aβ1-42 and Tau protein levels, hippocampal volumes (HV), and default mode network functional connectivity (DMN FC) in healthy elderly controls, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients due to AD, and mild AD patients. To accomplish this, we acquired 3-T MRI, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 42 healthy controls, 55 aMCI patients due to AD, and 33 mild AD patients. Comparing the groups, we found that the mild AD patients presented smaller HV, disrupted DMN FC, and proportionally less IL-1β than the controls. The aMCI patients only differed from the controls in DMN FC. In intra-group comparison, aMCI and mild AD with detectable levels of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-12) had decreased DMN FC. On the other hand, patients with detectable levels of IL-10 and IL-12 presented a more favorable AD biomarkers profile (larger HV, more CSF Aβ1-42, and less p-Tau), indicating a possible protective role of these ILs. Our findings indicate a possible relationship between systemic inflammation with DMN FC disruption, hippocampal atrophy, and CSF protein levels in the subjects with mild AD and aMCI."}

Centrally administered NPY suppresses alcohol drinking in subpopulations of rats vulnerable to the development of high alcohol-drinking behavior. The purpose of the current study was to determine the role of NPY in the CeA on elevated alcohol drinking produced by alcohol dependence. Adult male Wistar rats were trained to respond for 10% w/v alcohol in an operant situation with the use of a supersaccharin fading procedure. Following stabilization of responding, rats were divided into two groups matched for intake and given daily access to either alcohol-containing (9.2% v/v) liquid diet or an isocaloric control diet. Following extended access to the diet and reliable separation of operant responding between dependent and non-dependent rats during 6-h withdrawal tests, all rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae aimed at the CeA. Rats were then infused with 4 NPY doses (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 microg/0.5 microl aCSF) in a within-subjects Latin-square design during acute withdrawal and tested for operant alcohol responding 30 min later. Alcohol-dependent rats exhibited higher operant alcohol responding than non-dependent rats when infused with vehicle, but responding was similar in the two groups following infusion of all doses of NPY. These results indicate that NPY abolishes dependence-induced elevations in alcohol drinking and implicate the recruitment of limbic NPY systems in the motivational drive to consume alcohol following the transition to dependence."}

This review shows that to improve their knowledge, caregivers needed at least multiple implementation strategies, only education is not enough. For increasing a more person-centered attitude, different types of knowledge transfer can be effective. Little consideration is given to the adoption of the method by caregivers and to the long-term sustainability (maintenance).

It is possible that ignorance and stigma prevent such persons from seeking appropriate help, and that community attitudes and beliefs play a role in determining the help-seeking behaviour and successful treatment of the mentally ill. Nevertheless, there is little research on the attitudes of lay persons toward mental illness within the South African community.	The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of the general South African public toward mental illness, specifically regarding the causes of illness and treatment options.	The study design employed a questionnaire survey. Structured interviews (n = 667) were conducted with members of the general public. One of eight vignettes, portraying depression, schizophrenia, panic disorder or substance abuse, with subtle or obvious symptoms, was presented to each respondent.	The main findings were that cases were most often conceptualised as stress-related or due to a lack of willpower rather than as medical disorders. Treatment advocated was more often to talk the problem over than to consult professional medical help. Psychotherapy was the preferred treatment option, particularly in vignettes where symptom presentation was subtle, and in cases of substance abuse.	These data suggest that stigma and misinformation regarding mental illness exist, influencing preferred treatment modality and help-seeking behaviour. More work needs to be done to educate the public about the psychobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and about the value of effective treatments. A better understanding of these disorders amongst the public would presumably lessen stigmatisation and encourage the use of currently available and effective interventions."}

Weight control thus seems to be important after stroke, and methods for monitoring nutritional status need to be simple and non-invasive. Here we aimed to assess if the nutritional intervention altered body composition in men and women in this study cohort, and also to examine the correlation between the methods for assessing body-, fat- and fat-free mass.	Acute stroke patients > 65 years at nutritional risk were randomized to either individualized, nutritional treatment with energy- and protein rich supplementation (intervention, n = 58) or routine, nutritional care (control, n = 66) while in hospital. Body composition was assessed with anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance. The follow-up period was three months.	During the first week while in hospital, weight loss was smaller in the intervention group compared with the controls (P = 0.013). After three months weight- and fat loss were significant in both men and women. Whereas no significant differences were found in changes in body composition between the male study groups, in the women both weight loss (P = 0.022) and fat loss (P = 0.005) was smaller in the intervention group compared with the controls. A high correlation (r = 0.87) between mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) and body mass index (BMI) was found.	Individualized nutritional support to older stroke patients in hospital was beneficial for maintaining an adequate body mass and body composition the first week and seemed to have a preventive effect on fat loss among women, but not among men after three months. Measurement of MUAC may be used in the assessment of nutritional status when BMI cannot be obtained.	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00163007."}

Participants were 448 patients referred to a private practice in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada for psychological or neuropsychological assessment, related to evaluation of impairment and disability resulting from a work-related or non-work related accident. All patients were involved in some form of compensation claim at the time of their evaluation. All patients completed two tests designed to detect exaggerated cognitive deficits, the Computerized Assessment of Response Bias (CARB) and the Word Memory Test (WMT) as part of their evaluation. The diagnostic groups included 322 head injury cases, varying from very minor to very severe. Normative data for the smell test were derived from 126 patients with orthopedic injuries who passed both the CARB and the WMT. Patients with more severe traumatic brain injuries were 10-12 times more likely to have olfactory deficits than persons with trivial to mild head injuries. In a subgroup of patients who failed either the CARB or the WMT, there was no relationship between injury severity and total scores on the smell test. Therefore, the dose-response relationship between brain injury severity and olfactory deficits is severely attenuated when patients who are probably exaggerating their cognitive deficits are included in the analyses. Those patients with trivial to mild head injuries who demonstrated adequate effort on both the CARB and the WMT were no more likely to show olfactory deficits than the non-head-injured orthopedic control subjects. Therefore, anosmia following mild traumatic brain injury should not be concluded from self-reports or from tests of smell unless tests of effort have been passed. Effort should also be controlled in group studies of olfaction."}

In recent times, methods of monitoring aspects of brain oxygenation continuously by the bedside have been evaluated in several experimental and clinical series and are potentially changing the way we manage head-injured patients. These monitors have the potential to alert the clinician to possible secondary injury and enable intervention, help interpret pathophysiological changes (e.g., hyperemia causing raised intracranial pressure), monitor interventions (e.g., hyperventilation for increased intracranial pressure), and prognosticate. This review focuses on jugular venous saturation, brain tissue oxygen tension, and near-infrared spectroscopy as practical methods that may have an important role in managing patients with brain injury, with a particular focus on the available evidence in children. However, to use these monitors effectively and to understand the studies in which these monitors are employed, it is important for the clinician to appreciate the technical characteristics of each monitor, as well as respective strengths and limitations of each.

A factor analysis was performed, based on the polychoric correlations matrix, between ZSDS items using promax oblique rotation in 1049 PC patients with a diagnosis of MDD (DSM-IV).	A clinical interpretable four-factor solution consisting of a core depressive factor (I); a cognitive factor (II); an anxiety factor (III) and a somatic factor (IV) was extracted.

Although several neurotransmitter systems dysfunction and neuroanatomical abnormalities have been implicated in RLS pathogenesis, dopamine dysfunction within basal ganglia pathways, iron deficiency and opioid system abnormalities have consistently been found to be involved. Their involvement is further strengthened by the therapeutic effectiveness of dopaminergic agents, iron supplementation and opioid medications.	Converging evidence from neuroimaging, autoptic and animal studies points towards dopamine dysregulation and iron metabolism alterations as the main contributors to RLS pathophysiology.

In data from 1017 participants from the Human Connectome Project, we show that early visual and connected areas have low temporal variability of their functional connectivity. We show that a low temporal variability of the connectivity of cortical areas is related to high mean functional connectivity between those areas, and provide an account of how these dynamics arise. We then investigate how these concepts help to understand brain dynamics in mental disorders. We find that in both first episode and long-term schizophrenia, reduced functional connectivity of early visual and related temporal cortex areas is associated with increased temporal variability of the functional connectivity, consistent with decreased stability of attractor networks related to sensory processing. In ADHD, we find these functional connectivities are increased and their temporal variability is decreased, and relate this to increased engagement with visual sensory input as manifest in high screen time usage in ADHD. We further show that these differences in the dynamics of the cortex in schizophrenia, and ADHD can be related to differences in the functional connectivity of the specific sensory vs. association thalamic nuclei. These discoveries help to advance our understanding of cortical operation in health, and in some mental disorders."}

Twelve months after surgery, voxel-based morphometry was used to identify voxels associated with higher reduction in headache load. Probabilistic tractography was used to identify the brain connectivity of the activation volumes in responders, defined as patients with a reduction of ≥30% in headache load.	There was no surgical morbidity. Average follow-up was 34 ± 14 months. Patients showed reductions of 76 ± 33% in headache load, 46 ± 41% in attack severity, 58 ± 41% in headache frequency, and 51 ± 46% in attack duration at the last follow-up. Six patients responded to treatment. Greatest reduction in headache load was associated with activation in an area cantered at 6 mm lateral, 2 mm posterior, and 1 mm inferior to the midcommissural point of the third ventricle. Average responders' activation volume lay on the trigeminohypothalamic tract, connecting the trigeminal system and other brainstem nuclei associated with nociception and pain modulation with the hypothalamus, and the prefrontal and mesial temporal areas.	We identify the optimal stimulation site and structural connectivity of the deep brain stimulation target for cluster headache, explicating possible mechanisms of action and disease pathophysiology."}

This specific arm swing pattern during walking has shown to have a beneficial effect on gait as it reduces walking energy cost and optimizes balance. In several patient populations the arm movements can be directly affected (e.g. in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI)), which in turn has a negative effect on their gait pattern, balance and energy cost of walking.	In December 2019, Kahn et al. published a paper in JNER concerning the quantification of upper limb associated reactions (ARs) during walking in people with ABI. ARs are defined as 'an effort-dependent phenomenon causing an involuntary increase in upper limb muscle tone, with awkward and uncomfortable postures'. These upper limb ARs appear often in patients with ABI and can have an important effect on their gait. The authors calculated kinematic measures using three-dimensional gait analysis relating to range of motion, variability and mean position over the gait cycle for the different upper limb joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist) during self-selected steady-state walking. Based on differences they found between an ABI cohort and healthy control cohort, the authors concluded that they were able to quantify ARs during walking in this population. This calculation, however, is not specific for upper limb ARs. In fact, the authors calculated general measures of arm posture (e.g. mean position over the gait cycle) or arm movement (e.g. range of motion and variability) during gait. Previous research has already indicated that other factors than ARs can influence the posture or movement of the arm during gait in patients with brain injury, such as voluntary compensations for gait instability and contractures or spasticity of upper arm muscles. Yet, it is not possible to disentangle the different causes of the altered arm posture during steady-state walking based on the proposed measures.	The kinematic arm measures proposed by Kahn et al. (J Neuroeng Rehabil 16(1):160, 2019) are not a direct measure of ARs, but provide a quantification of overall deviation of arm posture or movement during gait. Depending on the specific study design these measures may provide insights in ARs."}

Dietary (poly)phenols revert and prevent age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in model systems. However, only limited attempts were made to evaluate the impact of digestion on the bioactivities of (poly)phenols and determine their mechanisms of action.

In addition, LPDMs modulated pathways associated with aSyn toxicity, such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial impairment, and SIR2 expression. Overall, LPDMs reduced aSyn toxicity, enhanced the efficiency of ER-associated protein degradation by the proteasome and autophagy, and reduced oxidative stress.

Here, the inflammatory agonist bradykinin, a small nano-peptide, that induces PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 in fibroblasts, was applied to punch-biopsy-obtained human skin fibroblasts. Quantitative imaging of the phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 bands was then used in a ratio that is mathematically configured into an AD-Biomarker Index (AD-Index). In the population described here (N=264), there were 64 autopsy examinations. Demented individuals were clinically diagnosed as AD with an overall accuracy of 78%. Among the 42 autopsy-confirmed cases for which there were also AD-Biomarker measurements, the overall accuracy of the AD-Biomarker was 98%. Among both the autopsy-confirmed and the clinically diagnosed patients, the AD-Index values were inversely correlated with the duration of disease, i.e., the time from the onset of dementia symptoms. Among the autopsy-confirmed cases, the AD-Biomarker diagnosis showed remarkably high sensitivity (97%) and specificity (100%) compared to clinical diagnosis (sensitivity: 78% and specificity: 20%). Using autopsy validation, the clinical diagnosis was only accurate at 52% level vs. the AD-Biomarker accuracy of 100% for cases with dementia not larger than 4 years of duration. Finally, application of soluble Abeta(1-42) to the fibroblasts of normal controls induced the abnormal AD-Biomarker phenotype, suggesting the pathophysiologic relevance of this AD-Biomarker measurement. In summary, the AD-Biomarker, as confirmed by autopsy validation, showed significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than did clinical diagnosis, particularly at early stages of disease, and pathophysiological relevance was demonstrated for the mechanistic basis of the AD-Biomarker measurements."}

Recently, we showed that the CheB42a protein, which is expressed in only 10 pheromone-sensing taste hairs on the front legs of males, modulates progression to late stages of male courtship behavior in response to female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons. Here we report that expression of all 12 genes in the CheB gene family is predominantly or exclusively gustatory-specific, and occurs in many different, often non-overlapping patterns. Only the Gr family of gustatory receptor genes displays a comparable variety of gustatory-specific expression patterns. Unlike Grs, however, expression of all but one CheB gene is sexually dimorphic. Like CheB42a, other CheBs may therefore function specifically in gustatory perception of pheromones. We also show that CheBs belong to the ML superfamily of lipid-binding proteins, and are most similar to human GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP). In particular, GM2-AP residues involved in ligand binding are conserved in CheBs but not in other ML proteins. Finally, CheB42a is specifically secreted into the inner lumen of pheromone-sensing taste hairs, where pheromones interact with membrane-bound receptors. We propose that CheB proteins interact directly with lipid-like Drosophila pheromones and modulate their detection by the gustatory signal transduction machinery. Furthermore, as loss of GM2-AP in Tay-Sachs disease prevents degradation of GM2 gangliosides and results in neurodegeneration, the function of CheBs in pheromone response may involve biochemical mechanisms critical for lipid metabolism in human neurons."}

The inflammatory responses which induce cell apoptosis and necrosis after I/R brain injury lead to a limited process of neural repair. To further comprehend how these targets function in I/R state, we investigated the pathological changes and TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo models of I/R brain injury in this study. Meanwhile, we explored the roles of schisantherin A on I/R brain injury, and whether it exerted neuroprotective effects by regulating the TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways or not. The results showed that schisantherin A significantly reduced the neuronal apoptosis induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) injury in primary culture of rat cortical neurons. Also, schisantherin A alleviated neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume, attenuated oxidation stress, inflammation and apoptosis in ischemic parietal cortex of rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury. Moreover, the activated TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways were inhibited by schisantherin A treatment. In conclusion, TLR4 and C5aR1 played a vital role during I/R brain injury in rats, and schisantherin A exhibited neuroprotective effects by TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways.

Maximum resection of a GBM results in an improved prognosis and thus represents the aim of surgery in the majority of cases. Fluorescence-guided surgery using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is currently widely applied for improved intraoperative tumor visualization in patients with a GBM. Three intratumoral fluorescence levels (i.e., strong, vague, or no fluorescence) can usually be distinguished during surgery. So far, however, their exact histopathological correlates and their surgical relevance have not been clarified sufficiently. Thus, the aim of this study was to systematically analyze tissue samples from newly diagnosed GBMs with different fluorescence levels according to relevant histopathological parameters. METHODS This prospective study recruited patients who underwent 5-ALA fluorescence-guided resection of a newly diagnosed radiologically suspected GBM. Each patient received 5-ALA approximately 3 hours before surgery, and a modified neurosurgical microscope was applied for intraoperative visualization of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. During surgery, tissue samples with strong, vague, or no fluorescence were collected. For each sample, the presence of tumor tissue, quality of tissue (compact, infiltrative, or no tumor), histopathological criteria of malignancy (cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and presence of microvascular proliferation/necrosis), proliferation rate (MIB-1 labeling index [LI]), and microvessel density (using CD34 staining) were investigated. RESULTS Altogether, 77 patients with a newly diagnosed, histopathologically confirmed GBM were included, and 131 samples with strong fluorescence, 69 samples with vague fluorescence, and 67 samples with no fluorescence were collected. Tumor tissue was detected in all 131 (100%) of the samples with strong fluorescence and in 65 (94%) of the 69 samples with vague fluorescence. However, mostly infiltrative tumor tissue was still found in 33 (49%) of 67 samples despite their lack of fluorescence. Strong fluorescence corresponded to compact tumors in 109 (83%) of 131 samples, whereas vague fluorescence was consistent with infiltrative tumors in 44 (64%) of 69 samples. In terms of the histopathological criteria of malignancy, a significant positive correlation of all analyzed parameters comprising cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis with the 3 fluorescence levels was observed (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the proliferation rate significantly and positively correlated with strong (MIB-1 LI 28.3%), vague (MIB-1 LI 16.7%), and no (MIB-1 LI 8.8%) fluorescence (p < 0.001). Last, a significantly higher microvessel density was detected in samples with strong fluorescence (CD34 125.5 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) than in those with vague (CD34 82.8 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) or no (CD34 68.6 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) fluorescence (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Strong and vague 5-ALA-induced fluorescence enables visualization of intratumoral areas with specific histopathological features and thus supports neurosurgeons in improving the extent of resection in patients with a newly diagnosed GBM. Despite the lack of fluorescence, tumor tissue was still observed in approximately half of the cases. To overcome this current limitation, the promising approach of complementary spectroscopic measurement of fluorescence should be investigated further."}

BD patients showed less activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) extending to the precuneus during other-reflection compared to HCs (p = 0.028 FWE corrected on cluster-level within the regions of interest). In SZ patients, the level of activation in this area was in between BD patients and HCs, with no significant differences between patients with SZ and BD. There were no group differences in brain activation during self-reflection. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the PCC/precuneus activation during other-reflection and cognitive insight in SZ patients, but not in BD patients.	BD patients showed less activation in the PCC/precuneus during other-reflection. This may support an account of impaired integration of emotion and memory (evaluation of past and current other-related information) in BD patients. Correlation differences of the PCC/precuneus activation with the cognitive insight in patients with BD and SZ might reflect an important difference between these disorders, which may help to further explore potentially distinguishing markers."}
{"pmid": "30658131", "text": "Brain research bulletin^\nCerebral malaria.^\nMalaria remains of significant public health concern under the tropics, causing millions of deaths annually. The disease is caused by protozoans of the Plasmodium genus, of which harbors several distinct species. Human infection occurs during the blood meal of an infected female mosquito belonging to the Anopheles genus. It is estimated that around 1% of children infected with Plasmodium falciparum develops a more severe form of malaria, which may eventually lead to cerebral complications including cerebral malaria (CM). CM can be positively diagnosed in patients unable to localize a painful stimulus, with peripheral asexual P. falciparum parasitemia and no other identifiable causes of an encephalopathy. Unarousable comas along with the presence of asexual forms of the parasite on a peripheral blood smear are hallmarks of the disease. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CM have yet be fully elucidated, the pathology in itself indicates a clear disease of the vascular endothelium. It is characterized by parasite sequestration, inflammatory cytokine production and vascular leakage, eventually resulting in brain hypoxia. The condition requires systemic health management consisting of focused nursing practices, supportive care, and anti-malarial drugs. The continued understanding of pathogenic mechanisms leading to the onset of CM is fundamental and key for the expansion and development of appropriate neuroprotective interventions. Future research perspectives may also include the development of field-based and rapid diagnostic tests for CM, understanding of host-pathogen interactions to advance development of prevention tools and therapies, and antimalarial drug trials."}

Aggregation-prone truncated species of αSyn caused by aberrant cleavage of this fibrillogenic protein are hypothesized to participate in its sequestration into inclusions subsequently leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Here, we investigated the role of calpain cleavage of αSyn in vivo by generating two opposing mouse models. We crossed into human [A30P]αSyn transgenic (i) mice deficient for calpastatin, a calpain-specific inhibitor, thus enhancing calpain activity (SynCAST(-)) and (ii) mice overexpressing human calpastatin leading to reduced calpain activity (SynCAST(+)). As anticipated, a reduced calpain activity led to a decreased number of αSyn-positive aggregates, whereas loss of calpastatin led to increased truncation of αSyn in SynCAST(-). Furthermore, overexpression of calpastatin decreased astrogliosis and the calpain-dependent degradation of synaptic proteins, potentially ameliorating the observed neuropathology in [A30P]αSyn and SynCAST(+) mice. Overall, our data further support a crucial role of calpains, particularly of calpain 1, in the pathogenesis of PD and in disease-associated aggregation of αSyn, indicating a therapeutic potential of calpain inhibition in PD."}

Statistically significant alterations in the concentrations of both enzymes occurred in the olfactory, caudate, and neocortical regions at 5 days postinfection. No such alterations occurred in mice given cytoxan (150 mg/kg) 3 days postinfection and examined 5 days postinfection. At 10 days postinfection, however, the cytoxan-treated animals had significantly altered enzyme concentrations in the olfactory region, though not in the caudate or neocortex. This alteration appeared to be transitory, since it was not found in cytoxan-treated animals 60 days postinfection. A possible explanation is that virus production or interference in a brain region cycles over a period of hours or days.

Pretreatment (every 3 days from 1 h before immunization) with BVA was more effective than posttreatment (daily after immunization) with BVA with respect to clinical signs (neurological impairment and loss of body weight) of acute EAE rats. Treatment with BVA at the ST36 acupoint in normal rats did not induce the clinical signs. Pretreatment with BVA suppressed demyelination, glial activation, expression of cytokines [interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-17, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-1β], chemokines [RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α], and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB (p65 and phospho-IκBα) signaling pathways in the spinal cord of acute EAE rats. Pretreatment with BVA decreased the number of CD4(+), CD4(+)/IFN-γ(+), and CD4(+)/IL-17(+) T cells, but increased the number of CD4(+)/Foxp3(+) T cells in the spinal cord and lymph nodes of acute EAE rats. Treatment with BVA at six placebo acupoints (SP9, GB39, and four non-acupoints) did not have a positive effect in acute EAE rats. Interestingly, onset and posttreatment with BVA at the ST36 acupoint markedly attenuated neurological impairment in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(35-55)-induced chronic EAE mice compared to treatment with BVA at six placebo acupoints. Our findings strongly suggest that treatment with BVA with ST36 acupoint could delay or attenuate the development and progression of EAE by upregulating regulatory T cells and suppressing T-helper (Th) 17 and Th1 responses.

Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing were performed in families linked to SCA25, including the French family in which the SCA25 locus was originally mapped. Whole exome sequence data were interrogated in a cohort of 796 ataxia patients of unknown etiology.	The SCA25 phenotype spans a slowly evolving sensory and cerebellar ataxia, in most cases attributed to ganglionopathy. A pathogenic variant causing exon skipping was identified in the gene encoding Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase PNPase 1 (PNPT1) located in the SCA25 linkage interval. A second splice variant in PNPT1 was detected in a large Australian family with a dominant ataxia also mapping to SCA25. An additional nonsense variant was detected in an unrelated individual with ataxia. Both nonsense and splice heterozygous variants result in premature stop codons, all located in the S1-domain of PNPase. In addition, an elevated type I interferon response was observed in blood from all affected heterozygous carriers tested. PNPase notably prevents the abnormal accumulation of double-stranded mtRNAs in the mitochondria and leakage into the cytoplasm, associated with triggering a type I interferon response.

Mean symptom endorsement and individual symptom endorsement probabilities for each of the stable classes were similar across samples. Consistent with previous findings, there was substantial overlap between the DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes with the severe inattentive and severe combined latent classes. However, DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes were distributed over several latent classes in each sample, and a substantial proportion of individuals with no DSM-IV diagnosis were also assigned to these severe classes.

This study used the Morris water maze task to investigate the effect of high doses of the anabolic androgenic steroid nandrolone on spatial learning and memory in male rats. During the experiment, we observed a significantly impaired Morris water maze performance in the nandrolone-treated rats compared with controls. The hippocampus, a brain region associated with cognitive function, was analyzed for mRNA expression of prodynorphin, the precursor of dynorphinergic peptides. The results indicated that the transcription levels of prodynorphin were significantly elevated in the animals treated with nandrolone compared with controls. Thus, the findings suggest that administration of nandrolone to male rats impairs memory function, possibly via dynorphinergic actions."}

Five studies (four with ocular US and one with brain CT) were included. The ONSD had a pooled sensitivity of 0.91, pooled specificity of 0.77, and area under the HSROC curve of 0.92 for predicting raised ICP. More importantly, studies using ocular US found an almost equal sensitivity (0.91 vs. 0.90; p = .35) and higher specificity (0.82 vs. 0.58; p = .01) than those using brain CT.

The history of 'harm reduction' in New York City is characterized within changing historical periods and in relation to the actions of stakeholders. The expansion is traced over four periods: (i) 1984-1989: emergence, activism, and science; (ii) 1990-1994 reckoning: syringe exchange legislation and consolidation; (iii) 1995-1999: bureaucratization, opposition, and challenges to institutional control; and (iv) 2000-2010 revitalization: expansion of syringe access and harm reduction. It is clear from this review that the leadership of activism and the work of advocates catalyzed syringe access policy and practice. Without this 'push,' it is unlikely that New York City would have experienced the dramatic decline in HIV infection among drug injectors in the 1990s. Second, successful arguments for expanding syringe access in New York City were based on the high HIV/AIDS infection rates. Thus, program developments were advocated as HIV prevention interventions, rather than as expanded services for addressing broader health and social issues of injecting drug use."}

Parents and teachers were both accurate in their perceptions of children's academic achievement. Behavioural ratings by teachers indicated more adjustment difficulties for retained children, while parent ratings of behaviour showed a similar high level of problems for short children regardless of retention status. Although both groups of children possessed average intellectual abilities, the retained children obtained lower IQ scores than the never retained children.

Different Tnc isoforms can be generated by the insertion of variable combinations of one to seven (in rats) alternatively spliced distinct fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains to the smallest variant. Each spliced FnIII repeat mediates specific actions on neurite outgrowth, neuron migration or adhesion. Hence, different Tnc isoforms might differentially influence CNS repair. We explored the expression pattern of Tnc variants after cortical lesions and after treatment of astrocytes with various cytokines. Using RT-PCR, we observed a strong upregulation of Tnc transcripts containing the spliced FnIII domains B or D in injured tissue at 2-4 days post-lesion (dpl). Looking at specific combinations, we showed a dramatic increase of Tnc isoforms harboring the neurite outgrowth-promoting BD repeat with both the B and D domains being adjacent to each other. Isoforms containing only the axon growth-stimulating spliced domain D were also dramatically enhanced after injury. Injury-induced increase of Tnc proteins comprising the domain D was confirmed by Western Blotting and immunostaining of cortical lesions. In contrast, the FnIII modules C and AD1 were weakly modulated after injury. The growth cone repulsive A1A2A4 domains were poorly expressed in normal and injured tissue but the smallest isoform, which is also repellant, was highly expressed after injury. Expression of the shortest Tnc isoform and of variants containing B, D or BD, was strongly upregulated in cultured astrocytes after TGFbeta1 treatment, suggesting that TGFbeta1 could mediate, at least in part, the injury-induced upregulation of these isoforms. We identified complex injury-induced differential regulations of Tnc isoforms that may well influence axonal regeneration and repair processes in the damaged CNS."}

Recently, we reported that peucedanocoumarin III (PCiii) is a promising therapeutic compound with the ability to disaggregate α-synuclein inclusion and protect dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we found that trans-4'-acetyl-3'-tigloylkhellactone (racemic peucedanocoumarin IV [PCiv]), a structural isomer of PCiii with a higher synthetic yield presented a strong anti-aggregate activity to a degree comparable to that of PCiii. PCiv retained effective inhibitory function against β-sheet aggregate-mimic β23 cytotoxicities and potently prevented α-synucleinopathy in α-synuclein preformed fibril (PFF)-treated mice cortical neurons. In detailed pharmacokinetic profiling of PCiv, oral administration of PCiv in rats exhibited an approximately 97-min half-life and 10% bioavailability. Moreover, tissue distribution analysis revealed favorable profiles of brain penetration with a 6.4 brain-to-plasma concentration ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of PCiv was further evaluated in a sporadic PD mouse model with a combinatorial co-injection of α-synuclein preformed fibril and recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing α-synuclein. Motor dysfunctions induced in this combinatorial α-synucleinopathy PD mouse model was almost completely rescued by PCiv diet administration, and this therapeutic effect is consistent with the marked prevention of dopaminergic neuron loss and suppression of α-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our translational study suggests that PCiv is advantageous as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, especially with its good synthetic yield, high brain distribution, and anti-aggregate activity. PCiv may be useful in the management of α-synuclein inclusion formation and propagation at different stages of PD."}

The current study documented the prevalence of driving after alcohol and marijuana use in the past 2 weeks as well as the prevalence of riding with a driver who had used each substance during that time frame. We tested whether young adults who lived with family members (i.e., their parents or their children) were less likely to engage in these behaviors. Methods: Participants aged 18-25 who resided in nonmetropolitan areas in the United States (N = 1,131; 55% female, Mage = 22.6) completed an online survey. Multivariate logistic regressions examined alcohol- and marijuana-related driving and riding behaviors adjusting for demographic factors. Interactions tested whether associations varied by gender. Results: In the 2 weeks prior to the survey, 17% of participants drove after drinking alcohol and 21% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking. The prevalence of driving after marijuana use was 11%, and 16% of the sample had ridden with a driver who had been using marijuana. Participants who lived with their parents were less likely to ride with a driver who had been using alcohol or marijuana (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 0.71 and 0.55, respectively). Living with parents was also associated negatively with driving after both substances, but these associations were no longer significant when controlling for substance use frequency and driving frequency. Surprisingly, the odds of driving after marijuana use were over 2 times larger for young adults who lived with their children. For women, but not men, residing with children decreased the odds of driving and riding after alcohol use. Conclusions: Living with parents protects against riding after substance use among young adults. Prevention programs should target young adults who live independently or those transitioning away from the parental home. Furthermore, given the higher rates of driving after marijuana use among young adult parents, this group should be educated about the risks associated with this behavior."}

T835M mutation in netrin receptor UNC5C predisposes to the late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases neuronal cell death. However, it remains unclear how this receptor is molecularly regulated in AD. Here, we show that δ-secretase selectively cleaves UNC5C and escalates its proapoptotic activity, facilitating neurodegeneration in AD. Netrin deficiency activates δ-secretase that specifically cuts UNC5C at N467 and N547 residues and enhances subsequent caspase-3 activation, additively augmenting neuronal cell death. Blockade of δ-secretase cleavage of UNC5C diminishes T835M mutant's proapoptotic activity. Viral expression of δ-secretase-truncated UNC5C fragments into APP/PS1 mice strongly accelerates AD pathologies, impairing learning and memory. Conversely, deletion of UNC5C from netrin-1-depleted mice attenuates AD pathologies and rescues cognitive disorders. Hence, δ-secretase truncates UNC5C and elevates its neurotoxicity, contributing to AD pathogenesis."}

Method Data were collected by self-report from 1098 adolescents (mean age 13.6 years; 60.9% boys) at five separate time points, equally separated by 6 months, across a 24-month period. General growth mixture modelling identified three distinct trajectories of adolescents reporting psychotic experiences: elevated, increasing and low.	Controlling for cannabis use, bullying by peers significantly predicted change in psychotic experiences between Time 2 and Time 5 in adolescents belonging to the increasing group. No effect was found for the elevated or low groups. Controlling for bullying, an earlier age of cannabis use and cannabis use more than twice significantly predicted change in psychotic experiences in adolescents belonging to the increasing group. Cannabis use at any age was significantly associated with subsequent change in psychotic experiences in the low group. Reverse causal associations were examined and there was no evidence for psychotic experiences at Time 1 predicting a subsequent change in cannabis use between Times 2 and 5 in any trajectory group.	Bullying by peers and cannabis use are associated with adolescents' reports of increasing psychotic experiences over time. Further research into the longitudinal development of psychosis in adolescence and the associated risk factors would allow for early intervention programmes to be targeted more precisely."}

We examined 82 cases with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) as well as ambulatory (Holter) ECG and 12 leads ECG. Thirty-three patients had cerebral ischemic attack (CIA), including 14 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) and 19 patients with other heart disease or lone Af (NonMS). The CIA group of NonMS were older than other groups. Both the CIA and NonCIA groups had the same frequency of paroxysmal and chronic Af. In the CIA group, there was a tendency of small amplitude of f wave and longer RR interval than the NonCIA group with ambulatory ECG. The CIA group also had larger left atrial cavity size and aortic diameter with TTE. TEE revealed thrombus formation in 29 cases, and the CIA group had a higher occurrence rate of thrombus than NonCIA group. TEE also detected a fuzzy echo in the left atrium in 88% of the CIA group and 42% of the NonCIA group. The risk factors of cerebral embolism could not be made clear in this study, but a fuzzy echo and thrombus in the left atrium with TEE are specific findings of cerebral embolism. Therefore, older patients with paroxysmal Af, large LAD, AOD, small f wave or long RR interval need to be examined by TEE to detect LA thrombus or a fuzzy echo, which are probably major risk factors of cerebral embolism."}

The results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. The antiaggregating effect of clopidogrel is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of ADP binding to a purinergic receptor present at the platelet surface. Clopidogrel is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. The chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. Several purinergic receptors have been described on platelets; P2X (1), a calcium channel, and P2Y1 a Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor, have been found not to be antagonized by clopidogrel. Another Gi (2)-coupled receptor (named P2Y12) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells. These cells displayed a strong affinity for (33)P-2MeS-ADP, a stable analogue of ADP, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. The binding of (33)P-2MeS-ADP to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets. In these transfected CHO cells, as in platelets, ADP and 2MeS-ADP induced adenylyl cyclase downregulation, an effect that was inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel. These results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called 'P2t' platelet receptor and show that the active metabolite of clopidogrel binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of ADP on platelets."}

We retrospectively considered 17 patients who underwent PC-MR imaging to explore hydrocephalus, with the absence of CSF flow at the aqueductal level.

None of the usually reported direct or indirect signs of aqueductal obstruction were seen in 7 patients in whom the clinical suggestion of AS was confirmed by PC-MR imaging results.

All of these 7 patients had a positive postsurgical outcomes. The analysis of CSF and vascular dynamic data in this population was compared with an aged-matched population, and these data were found similar except for the fourth ventricular CSF flush flow latency.	PC-MR imaging supports the diagnosis of CSF flow blockage at the aqueductal level in a reliable, reproducible, and rapid way, which aids in the diagnosis of AS in patients with clinical and/or radiologic suggestion of obstructive hydrocephalus.

Amino acid composition and sequence analyses of purified FA2 revealed identity to the amino acid sequence of the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human type I procollagen. Gel filtration of AF as well as purified FA2 demonstrated two molecular forms of FA2, which during gel filtration were elucidated corresponding to MW of approximately 100 kDa and 30 kDa. The molecular forms were referred to as the high molecular component (FA2-HM) and low molecular component (FA2-LM), respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis (reducing and nonreducing conditions) showed a MW of 27 kDa for both FA2-HM and FA2-LM. Mass spectrometry analysis however revealed a MW of 14.343 +/- 3Da. Proteins with collagenous domains often reveal aberrant behaviour both in gel filtration and SDS-PAGE and this phenomenon may account for the apparent higher MW of FA2 observed using these techniques compared to mass spectrometry and amino acid composition/sequence analyses. A polyclonal, monospecific rabbit antibody raised against FA2 was used in immunohistochemical localization studies. Due to the obvious association of FA2 to the BM structure in adult and fetal skin, it was initially referred to as a BM associated component. However, FA2 was immunologically distinct from the well established BM components and moreover, the diffuse distribution of FA2 along the BM differed from linear localization of BM components (e.g. collagen type IV and laminin). The identification of FA2 as the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human procollagen type I has the implication that in the immunohistochemical investigations the anti-FA2 may not distinguish between the free propeptide and procollagen type I. In the papillary dermal region of human adult skin type I collagen are arranged in loose fibrils to which the aminoterminal propeptide is still attached. Anti-FA2 may recognize epitopes in the type I procollagen present in this region, giving rise to the diffuse FA2 distribution along the BM. However, whether FA2 also appear as a free component in this region is unknown. In fetal skin where collagen is vividly layed down in the mesenchymal compartment staining with anti-FA2 revealed a diffuse mesenchymal distribution.

The current study was based on the observation that transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) promoted the neurological function improvement in stroked mice and meanwhile enhanced angiogenesis in the stroked hemisphere. Grafted hUCMSCs secreted human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Notch1 signaling was activated after stroke and also in the grafted hUCMSCs. To address the potential mechanism that might mediate such pro-angiogenic effect, we established a hUCMSC-neuron co-culture system. Neurons were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) injury before co-culturing to mimic the in vivo cell transplantation. Consistent with the in vivo data, co-culture medium claimed from hUCMSC-OGD neuron co-culture system significantly promoted the capillary-like tube formation of brain-derived endothelial cells. Moreover, coincident with our in vivo data, Notch 1 signaling activation was detected in hUCMSCs after co-cultured with OGD neurons as demonstrated by the up-regulation of key Notch1 signaling components Notch1 and Notch1 intercellular domain (NICD). In addition, OGD-neuron co-culture also increased the VEGF-A production by hUCMSCs. To verify whether Notch1 activation was involved in the pro-angiogenic effect, γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) was added into the co-culture medium before co-culture. It turned out that DAPT significantly prevented the Notch1 activation in hUCMSCs after co-culture with OGD neurons. More importantly, the pro-angiogenic effect of hUCMSCs was remarkably abolished by DAPT addition as demonstrated by inhibited capillary-like tube formation and less VEGF-A production. Regarding how Notch1 signaling was linked with VEGF-A secretion, we provided some clue that Notch1 effector Hes1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated by OGD-neuron co-culturing and down-regulated after additional treatment of DAPT. In summary, our data provided evidence that the VEGF-A secretion from hUCMSCs after being triggered by OGD neurons is Notch1 signaling associated. This might be a possible mechanism that contributes to the angiogenic effect of hUCMSC transplantation in stroked brain."}

Forty service users and thirteen carers were recruited following an acute psychotic episode using typical case sampling. In-depth interviews explored illness and treatment experiences. Ethnicity was allowed to emerge in participants' narratives and was prompted if necessary.	Ethnicity was not perceived to impact significantly on therapeutic relationships, and nor were there ethnic differences in care pathways, or in the roles of families and friends. Ethnic diversity was commonplace among both service users and mental health professionals. This was tolerated in community settings if efforts were made to ensure high-quality care. Home Treatment was rated highly, irrespective of service users' ethnicity. In-patient care was equally unpopular and was the one setting where ethnicity appeared to mediate unsatisfactory care experiences. These findings highlight the risks of generalising from reports of (dis)satisfaction with care based predominantly on in-patient experiences.	Home treatment was popular but hard to deliver in deprived surroundings and placed a strain on carers. Interventions to enhance community treatments in deprived areas are needed, along with remedial interventions to improve therapeutic relationships in hospital settings."}

While glial scar formation by astrocytes has been extensively studied, much less is known about the fibrotic scar, in particular after stroke. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor ß-expressing (PDGFRß[+]) pericytes have been suggested as a source of the fibrotic scar depositing fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins after detaching from the vessel wall. However, to what extent these parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells contribute to the fibrotic scar and whether targeting these cells affects fibrotic scar formation in stroke is still unclear. Here, we utilize male transgenic mice that after a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model have a shift from a parenchymal to a perivascular location of PDGFRß[+] cells due to the loss of regulator of G-protein signaling 5 in pericytes. We find that only a small fraction of parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells co-label with type I collagen and fibronectin. Consequently, a reduction in parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells by ca. 50% did not affect the overall type I collagen or fibronectin deposition after stroke. The redistribution of PDGFRß[+] cells to a perivascular location, however, resulted in a reduced thickening of the vascular basement membrane and changed the temporal dynamics of glial scar maturation after stroke. We demonstrate that parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells are not the main contributor to the fibrotic ECM, and therefore targeting these cells might not impact on fibrotic scar formation after stroke."}

Stress factors play an important role in the etiopathology of both diseases, since increased corticosteroid levels caused by chronic stress indirectly induce neuronal damage. The aim of our experiments was to evaluate the changes induced by stress in the transcription of amyloid precursor protein (APP), mitogen activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1) and beta-actin, of which the latest plays a leading role in synaptic plasticity. Additionally we intended to examine how duloxetine - a serotonin-norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor type antidepressant - would modify the stress-induced changes. Wistar rats were exposed to immobilization stress for five hours daily through 21 days, while part of the animals received 45 mg/bwkg of duloxetine. At the end of the third week total RNA was purified from the cortex and hippocampus. The amount of beta-actin, APP and MAPK-1 mRNA was determined by real time PCR method. On protein level, semiquantitative measurement was performed by Western blot. The expression of beta-actin mRNA in the animals exposed to stress was four times as intense as in the control group. The increase in the beta-actin mRNA levels was repressed by the duloxetine treatment. In the case of APP and MAPK-1 no changes were detected. According to the Western blot results, the antidepressant treatment slightly, the drug along with the stress treatment strongly decreased the amount of the beta-actin protein. Our findings indicate that antidepressant treatment with duloxetine could play a protective role against the chronic stress-induced changes in the nervous system, such as disorders of synaptic plasticity, and the consequent cognitive dysfunctions in case of both affective disorders and AD."}

Its clinical use has expanded to control of seizures, by pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS), and is finding new purpose as an analgesic alternative and antidepressant. Ketamine brings hope for effective management of chronic pain in the absence of opioids and decreasing suicidal ideations; however, its persistence as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic properties remains. In the wake of expanding medicinal purposes, the diversity of New York City's population was explored to better understand its misuse. This retrospective study looks at the prevalence of ketamine in driver fatalities over a period of 18 years (2003-2020) and cases involving suspected driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) over a period of 6 years (2015-2020). Ketamine was identified in 6 driver fatalities and in 47 DUID cases. None of the driver fatalities were suspected of ketamine misuse, due to administration either in hospital or by EMS. In the DUID cases, an increasing trend was observed over the 6-year study period with 100% (n = 47) of the cases confirmed as non-hospital/non-EMS administered ketamine. Of the DUID cases, 94% were male with the majority between the age of 21 and 39 years (85%) and were predominantly Hispanic (36%) and Asian (34%). Blood concentrations of ketamine ranged from 27 to >2000 ng/mL with polydrug use prevalent. The most common drug classes detected in addition to ketamine were cannabinoids (38%), ethanol (32%), benzodiazepines (26%), cocaine (19%) and amphetamines/3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (15%). In 2019, 2-fluoro-deschloroketamine was identified in two cases for the first time. Despite its increased acceptance for mental health disorders, ketamine's persistence and misuse as a recreational drug remains and should continue to be monitored by relevant toxicological, clinical and law enforcement communities along with emerging illicit ketamine analogs."}

SULEHS is an ultra-rare disorder associated with biallelic loss-of-function variants of the TASP1 gene, and up-to-date, seven patients from five families have been reported in the literature. Loss of TASP1 function has been reported to alter H3K4 histone modifications and expression of TFIIA and HOX transcription factors in the SULEHS phenotype. In this report, a new patient molecularly diagnosed with SULEHS by a novel homozygous c.404-2A > G variant in the TASP1 gene is presented with the long-term follow-up. Although the majority of the patient's clinical characteristics were similar to those of previously reported SULEHS patients, this study was the first to describe some additional anomalies, such as cystic hygroma, increased nuchal thickness, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary sequestration anomaly, chronic constipation, encephalomalacia, and aggressive behavior. Because of the remarkable similarities between the clinical features of Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BRWS) and the patient, BRWS was considered the most likely diagnosis before the molecular diagnosis. Network analysis also supported that the interaction of the SULEHS-associated TASP1 gene with the BRWS-associated ACTB and ACTG1 genes through common intermediate molecules. Overall, despite the existence of differences in clinical features, inheritance patterns, and underlying pathophysiology between BRWS and SULEHS, both diseases could be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the high clinical similarities, including the dysmorphic features, growth parameters, neurodevelopmental phenotype, neurological problems, and multisystem involvement. Additionally, this report could contribute to a better understanding of the genotypic and clinical features of SULEHS by describing a novel pathogenic variant and new clinical features, such as prenatal manifestations."}

Dravet syndrome usually has three phases: (1) up to 1-1½ years: with episodes of febrile status epilepticus but normal development; (2) age 1½ to ~6-10 years: with frequent seizures of varying types, developmental stagnation, behavioural and sleep problems; (3) after ~10 years: improvement in seizures, deteriorating gait, intellectual disability but some developmental gains. Complete seizure control is rare-simply prescribing medication is inadequate to help families. Based on structured interviews with 24 families and confirmed by more informal discussions with other families, we suggest strategies for coping with this catastrophe. A child with Dravet syndrome usually means that one parent cannot work-financial pressures should be anticipated. In Stage 1, the approach to status should include a written protocol. An indwelling catheter for rapid venous access may be helpful. In Stage 2, assistance finding qualified babysitters is required, and the extended family needs encouragement to help. Appropriate equipment, rescue medication and protocols should travel with the child. Siblings may benefit from a system of one parent 'on call.' An internet support group provides an invaluable lifeline. In Stage 3, family isolation may be extreme-respite care and personal time for parents are important. Death from status, accidents and SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) occurs in 15%. Fear of SUDEP needs to be addressed. Moving from paediatric to adult care is frightening; an epilepsy transition clinic is useful. Attention to these realities may improve the quality of life for both child and family."}

The biochemical defect of ALD was found in 5 out of 24 patients. The small number of cases in our series led us to include in our analysis the published results of two other groups of investigators. This analysis indicates that the proportion of cases in which Addison disease is attributable to ALD is age dependent. It is highest when the adrenal insufficiency manifests before 15 years. This study clearly demonstrates that the proportion of ALD in patients presenting primary adrenal insufficiency has been under-estimated.	Addison disease manifesting during the first decade of life has a high likelihood of being the first sign of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy."}

The relationships between the initial changes of myocardial workload, hemodynamic deterioration, and myocardial histological changes caused by acute induction of brain death are unclear. Cats (n = 15) were submitted to brain death by rapid inflation of an intracranial balloon. A further 12 cats served as a sham-operated control group. The changes in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, LV dP/dtmax, rate-pressure product (RPP), and circulating noradrenaline and adrenaline were studied during 240 min after the induction of brain death. Central venous pressure was kept constant. The hearts were histologically examined afterward. Electrocerebral activity disappeared within 30 sec after balloon inflation. At 3 min, noradrenaline and adrenaline levels had increased 75- and 40-fold, respectively, compared to pre-induction levels. The hemodynamic response was characterized by an early and rapid increase of hemodynamic variables at 2.9 +/- 0.2 min. This was followed by a second phase of normalization or deterioration. Two distinct subgroups (n = 9) became hemodynamically unstable (HDU), characterized by a systolic arterial blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, at 108 +/- 29 min, and progressively deteriorated to 67 +/- 8 mm Hg at 240 min after inflation of the balloon. The hemodynamic variables of the other, hemodynamically stable (HDS), subgroup (n = 6) normalized at 60 min after inflation. Hemodynamic deterioration of the HDU subgroup compared to the HDS subgroup was significant at 10 min after induction of brain death. The maximum values of RPP were similar in the two subgroups. Respiratory and metabolic variables at the end of the experiment were not different in both subgroups. Histological evidence of myocardial damage was present in 73% (11/15) of the brain dead cats and absent in the control group. The histological changes were identified both in hearts of HDU (6/9) and HDS (5/6) cats. In the cat, no relationships were demonstrated between the acute increase of myocardial workload, the occurrence of hemodynamic deterioration, and myocardial histological changes after rapid induction of brain death. These results may contribute to the discussion whether hemodynamic instability of the donor is an appropriate exclusion criterion for heart transplantation."}

Although panic buying has a long history, there is a lack of literature to provide a psychological understanding of the phenomenon. During the early days of COVID-19 clients presented with fear and uncertainty. These negative emotions were, in part, a response to a real shortage of basic supplies. However, the panic response led to behaviors that, for some individuals, resulted in atypical buying patterns. From a therapeutic perspective, one can consider behavioral and psychodynamic explanations and interventions, and how this impacts the associated behaviors.

Conditioning of inflammatory cells reflects, at least in part, soluble mediators (such as transforming growth factor β and IL-4) that are released by cancer cells and alter the phenotype of cells of the innate immune system. Signaling pathways in cancer cells that potentiate this activity are incompletely understood. The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is a cell-signaling receptor known to promote cancer cell survival, proliferation, metastasis, and cancer stem cell-like properties. The present findings show that uPAR expression in diverse cancer cells, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma cells, promotes the ability of these cells to condition co-cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages so that the macrophages express significantly increased levels of arginase 1, a biomarker of the alternatively activated M2 macrophage phenotype. Expression of transforming growth factor β was substantially increased in uPAR-expressing cancer cells via a mechanism that requires uPA-initiated cell signaling. uPAR also controlled expression of IL-4 in cancer cells via a mechanism that involves activation of ERK1/2. The ability of uPAR to induce expression of factors that condition macrophages in the tumor microenvironment may constitute an important mechanism by which uPAR promotes cancer progression."}

Here, we present results from a longitudinal analysis of annual counts of six bird species, using North American Breeding Bird Survey data from ten states (1994 to 2010). We fit overdispersed Poisson models to annual counts. Counts from successive years were linked by an autoregressive process that depended on WNV transmission intensity (annual West Nile neuroinvasive disease reports) and was adjusted by El Niño Southern Oscillation events. These models were fit using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.	Model fit was mostly excellent, especially for American Crows, for which our models explained between 26% and 81% of the observed variance. The impact of WNV on bird populations was quantitatively evaluated by contrasting hypothetical count trajectories (omission of WNV) with observed counts. Populations of American crows were most consistently affected with a substantial cumulative impact in six of ten states. The largest negative impact, almost 60%, was found in Illinois. A regionally substantial decline was also seen for American Robins and House Sparrows, while the other species appeared unaffected.	Our results confirm findings from previous studies that single out American Crows as the species most vulnerable to WNV infection. We discuss strengths and limitations of this and other methods for quantifying the impact of WNV on bird populations."}

Although recent animal studies have tried to clarify the neural substrates of the MMN, the nature of schizophrenia-related deficits is unknown. In this study, we applied a novel paradigm developed from translational animal model studies to carefully deconstruct the constituent neurophysiological processes underlying MMN generation. Patients with schizophrenia (N = 25) and healthy comparison subjects (HCS; N = 27) underwent MMN testing using both a conventional auditory oddball paradigm and a 'many-standards paradigm' that was specifically developed to deconstruct the subcomponent adaptation and deviance detection processes that are presumed to underlie the MMN. Using a conventional oddball paradigm, patients with schizophrenia exhibited large effect size deficits of both duration and frequency MMN, consistent with many previous studies. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia showed selective impairments in deviance detection but no impairment in adaptation to repeated tones. These findings support the use of the many-standards paradigm for deconstructing the constituent processes underlying the MMN, with implications for the use of these translational measures to accelerate the development of new treatments that target perceptual and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia and related disorders."}

This study explored mediation of these links via trajectories of child conduct and emotional problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) from ages 4-16 years old in data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort (n = 13373). Through gender-specific structural equation models, a composite measure of exposure to early maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), predicted young adult depression at age 18 (Revised Clinical Interview Schedule - distal outcome). Mediational effects were then estimated by testing which parts of joint piecewise latent trajectory models for child/adolescent conduct and emotional problems were associated with both exposure and distal outcome. For girls, only conduct problems in early childhood were consistently indicated to mediate effects of early maternal depression on risk of young adulthood depression. Some evidence for a pathway via changing levels of childhood and adolescent emotional difficulties was also suggested. For boys, by contrast, the differing models gave less consistent findings providing some evidence for a small time-specific indirect effect via early childhood conduct problems. In addition to its practice implications the current methodological application offers considerable potential in exploratory longitudinal developmental mediation studies. © 2016 The Authors International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}

Hyperactive behaviour, sleep problems and epilepsy seem to be more common in AS than in other genetic conditions associated with severe intellectual disability. We hypothesised that both more sleep problems and earlier onset of epileptic seizures would predict more symptoms of hyperactivity. Hence, the aim of the project was to explore the association between hyperactive behaviour, sleep problems and age of epilepsy onset in individuals with AS.	All known parents/guardians (n = 115) of individuals with AS in Norway were invited to participate in this descriptive correlational study. Fifty-six individuals (49%) responded, and 42 people (25 male and 17 female; mean age 18.5 years, range 2-57 years) with genetically verified AS were included. Scores for 'hyperactivity' and 'sleep problems' were derived from questionnaire data. Information on epilepsy was obtained from medical records.	'Hyperactivity' was positively correlated with 'total sleep problems' (r = 0.46, P = 0.002) and negatively correlated with 'age of epilepsy onset' (r = -0.47, P = 0.01). 'Age of epilepsy onset' was not correlated with 'total sleep problems'. An overall multiple regression model with 'hyperactivity' as the dependent variable and 'age of epilepsy onset' and 'total sleep problems' as covariates was significant (R[2]  = 0.39, F = 8.16, P = 0.002). Hence, hyperactivity in AS could be predicted from both age of epilepsy onset and current sleep problems.	Sleep problems may increase hyperactivity symptoms in individuals with AS. The association between hyperactivity and sleep problems in AS indicates that both should be investigated together as part of routine clinical assessment and intervention for either area of difficulty. Younger age of epilepsy onset was associated with more hyperactivity in AS, which may be related to encephalopathic effects of seizures and epilepsy."}

[et al]^\nPositron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.^\nTo evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) on target volume delineation for radiation treatment planning.	The data of the literature concerning the use of PET in target volume delineation are summarized. The following points are discussed for each tumor entity: biological background for the PET investigation, sensitivity and specificity of PET (with different tracers) in comparison to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and impact of PET on target volume definition. New PET tracers, which could visualize biological pathways, such as hypoxia, proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression patterns, will also be discussed.	The results of clinical studies on the integration of PET in target volume definition for lung, head-and-neck, genitourinary and brain tumors were analyzed. Fluorodeoxyglucose-(FDG-)PET has a significant impact on GTV (gross tumor volume) and PTV (planning target volume) delineation in lung cancer and can detect lymph node involvement and differentiate malignant tissue from atelectasis. In head-and-neck cancer, the value of FDG-PET for radiation treatment planning is still under investigation. For example, FDG-PET could be superior to CT and MRI in the detection of lymph node metastases and unknown primary cancer and in the differentiation of viable tumor tissue after treatment. Therefore, it might play an important role in GTV definition and sparing of normal tissue. Choline PET and acetate PET are promising tracers in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but their validity in local tumor demarcation, lymph node diagnosis and detection of recurrence has to be defined in future clinical trials. FDG-PET seems to be particularly valuable in lymph node status definition in cervical cancer. In high-grade gliomas and meningiomas, methionine PET helps to define the GTV and differentiate tumor from normal tissue. For other entities like gastrointestinal cancer, lymphomas, sarcomas, etc., the data of the literature are yet insufficient. The imaging of hypoxia, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression leads to the identification of different areas of a biologically heterogeneous tumor mass that can individually be targeted using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In addition, a biological dose distribution can be generated, the socalled dose painting. However, systematic experimental and clinical trials are necessary to validate this hypothesis.	Regarding treatment planning in radiotherapy, PET offers advantages in terms of tumor delineation and the description of biological processes. To define the real impact of this investigation in radiation treatment planning, subsequent experimental, clinical and cost-benefit analyses are required."}

Cortical thickness alterations in relation to clinical features have not been adequately explored in CM. Assessment of this relationship can be useful to describe cortical substrates for disease progression in migraine and to identify clinical variables that warrant management emphasis.	Thirty CM cases (mean age 40 years; male-to-female 1:4) and 30 sex-matched healthy controls (mean age 40 years) were enrolled. Participants completed self-administered and standardized questionnaires assessing headache-related clinical features and common psychological comorbidities. T1-weighted brain images were acquired on a 3T MRI. A whole-brain cortical thickness analysis was performed. Additionally, correlations between all brain regions were assessed to examine interregional cortical thickness covariance. Interactions were analyzed to identify clinical variables that were significantly associated with cortical thickness.	The whole brain cortical thickness analysis revealed no significant differences between CM patients and controls. However, significant associations between clinical features and cortical thickness were observed for the patients only. These associations included the right superior temporal sulcus (R[2]  = 0.72, P = .001) and the right insula (R[2]  = 0.71, P = .002) with distinct clinical variables ie, longer history of CM, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep quality, pain self-efficacy, and somatic symptoms. Higher interregional cortical covariance was found in CM compared to controls (OR = 3.1, CI 2.10-4.56, P < .0001), such that cortical thickness between regions tended to be more correlated in patients, particularly in the temporal and frontal lobes.	CM patients have significantly greater cortical covariance compared to controls. Cortical thickness in CM patients was predominantly accounted for by CM duration, PTSD, and poor sleep quality, while improved pain self-efficacy buffered cortical thickness. While it is important to address all CM features and comorbidities, it may be useful to emphasize optimizing the management of certain clinical features that contribute to cortical abnormalities including managing PTSD, early management to shorten duration of CM, and improving pain self-efficacy and sleep quality."}

One primary intervention, Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) are limited in their ability to impact this epidemic due to federal law restricting Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) from sharing data to PDMPs, despite being a major source of Methadone dispensing.	This retrospective, observational study analyzed all prescription-related deaths occurring in San Diego County during the year 2013 with a specific focus on methadone-related deaths. All patients designated by medical examiner to have died by unintentional prescription were then referenced in the California PDMP, the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES).	As a whole, patients who died had a high number of average prescriptions, 21, and averaged 4.5 different providers, and three different pharmacies. Methadone-related deaths (MRD) accounted for 46 out of the 254 total patient deaths (18.1%). Methadone prescriptions were found in 14 patients with PDMP reports, 10 of who had methadone on toxicology report. Notably, 100% of methadone prescribed by primary care specialists. MRD patients were less likely to have toxicology reports matching PDMP data compared to other related drug deaths (20.6 vs. 61.2%, p<0.0001). Of the 46 methadone deaths, only 10 (29.4%) had prescriptions for methadone recorded in the database. Out of the 51 patients with only one drug recorded at death, methadone was most common (n=12; 23.5%). While all deaths had a notably high rate of chronic prescriptions at death (68.8% compared to 2% for all patients in CURES), there was no significant difference between MRD and other drug-related deaths (73.5 vs. 67.8%, p=0.68, respectively). MRD patients were less likely than other drug patients to have matching PDMP data without any illicit substance or alcohol (14.7 vs. 41.4%, p=0.003, respectively).	Methadone is a long-acting opioid that carries a higher risk profile than other opioids. In San Diego, the great majority of MRD had no data on methadone in the statewide PDMP database, bringing to question the restriction of OTP clinics from uploading information into the database. A risk-benefit analysis should be made to consider changing laws that would allow for OTP to input data into PDMP. OTP should make it standard of care to check PDMP data on their patients. Methadone prescribed for pain management should be limited to the most compliant patients."}

However, few studies have examined this topic in youth. Thus, we aimed to examine the association of lithium and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), the first-line antimanic medications for youth with BD, with neurocognition in a relatively large sample of youth with BD. Methods: Participants included 91 youth with BD-I, -II, or -Not Otherwise Specified, aged 13-20 years (n = 14 current lithium use, n = 51 current SGA use). We examined four tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery: Intra/Extra Dimensional Set-Shifting Task (IED), Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP), Stockings of Cambridge Test (SOC), and Affective Go/No-Go (AGN). Within-sample Z-scores were computed, and a global neurocognitive composite score and g factor derived from these tests comprised the primary outcomes. Multivariable analyses controlled for age, sex, and IQ. Results: Current lithium use was significantly associated with poorer cognitive flexibility/set-shifting (IED). After further controlling for lifetime comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and current depression symptoms in sensitivity analyses, the lithium finding was no longer significant. Current SGA use was significantly associated with greater affective processing bias (AGN). No significant findings survived correction for multiple comparisons. All other cognitive outcomes were not significantly associated with current lithium use, current SGA use, or total number of current medications. Conclusions: Treatment with lithium or SGAs was associated with minimal neurocognitive impairments, with small effect sizes in primary multivariable analyses. This study adds to the limited body of literature examining medication use in relation to neurocognition in youth with BD. While the current study cannot rule out associations of smaller effect size, present findings suggest that leading mood-stabilizing medications are not associated with frank neurocognitive impairments in youth with BD."}

When objects move, their opaque surfaces reflect light and produce both static image structure and dynamic optic flow. The static and dynamic optical information co-specify events. Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and amblyopia cannot identify static objects because of weakened image structure. However, optic flow is detectable despite blurry vision because visual motion measurement uses low spatial frequencies. When motion ceases, image structure persists and might preserve properties specified by optic flow. We tested whether optic flow and image structure interact to allow event perception with poor static vision. AMD (Experiment 1), amblyopic (Experiments 2 and 3), and normally sighted observers identified common events from either blurry (Experiments 1 and 2) or clear images (Experiment 3), when either single image frames were presented, a sequence of frames was presented with motion masks, or a sequence of frames was presented with detectable motion. Results showed that with static images, but no motion, events were not perceived well by participants other than controls in Experiment 3. However, with detectable motion, events were perceived. Immediately following this and again after five days, participants were able to identify events from the original static images. So, when image structure information is weak, optic flow compensates for it and enables event perception. Furthermore, weakened static image structure information nevertheless preserves information that was once available in optic flow. The combination is powerful and allows events to be perceived accurately and stably despite blurry vision."}

This study was designed to examine the discriminative validity of Interaction Anxiousness Scale (IAS) and Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS) for the screening of SAD through the compared and combined analysis. Firstly, 421 Chinese undergraduates were screened by the IAS and BSPS. Secondly, in the follow-up stage, 248 students were interviewed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used, and the related psychometric characters were checked.	The results indicated that the ROC in these two scales demonstrated discrimination is in satisfactory level (range: 0.7-0.8). However, the highest agreement (92.17%) was identified when a cut-off point of 50 measured by the IAS and a cut-off point of 34 by the BSPS were combined, also with higher PPV, SENS, SPEC and OA than that reached when BSPS was used individually, as well as PPV, SPEC and OA in IAS.

Recent studies revealed that the ferroptosis pathway is involved in the death process of dopaminergic neurons in PD. The aberrant endosomal sorting pathway, which results in aberrant iron level in eukaryotic cells, may serve a role in the ferroptosis pathway in PD condition. However, its specific molecular mechanisms remained unclear. In the present study, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, the rank ordering of super-enhancers (ROSE) algorithm, and RNA interference (RNAi) to explore the regulatory mechanism of PD-specific super-enhancer (SE) in the endosomal sorting pathway and ferroptosis pathway of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats and cells. The ChIP assay and ROSE algorithm results showed that there are specific SEs expression in 6-OHDA-lesioned SNc of PD rats, and the most significant expression gene is Sorting Nexin 5 (SNX5). SNX5 silencing by RNAi experiments significantly decreased the level of ferroptosis in 6-OHDA-lesioned PC12 cells, suggesting the correlation between the SNX5, ferroptosis, and PD. In conclusion, this study investigated the mechanism by which PD-specific SE driven SNX5 promoted the ferroptosis level in PD models. This study further improved the understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis during PD injury and provided potential therapeutic targets and clinical diagnostic markers in PD condition."}

Isotonitazene powder and purity determination was performed on the sample collected in the first death scene by NMR, HRMS, GC-FTIR, ATR-FTIR and GC-MS. Isotonitazene purity was determined by GC-MS analysis and proton NMR, and was defined to be above 95 % and 98 %, respectively. Quantification of isotonitazene in biological samples was performed using a targeted analysis based on SPE extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The isotonitazene median concentration in femoral whole blood was 1.20ng/mL. Isotonitazene concentration in hair was similar or even lower compared to that seen in fentanyl abusers. Isotonitazene distribution in tissues converges in the brain, lungs and heart, respectively. Surprisingly, isotonitazene concentration in liver is the lowest measured for all tissues and fluids analyzed. Based on circumstantial evidence, autopsy findings and the results of the toxicological analysis, the medical examiner concluded that the cause of all three deaths was an acute intoxication with isotonitazene. Since isotonitazene toxic concentration levels are very low, the consumption of this new psychoactive drug is a real hazard for human health."}

A prospective cohort study of 64 710 Swedish citizens whose fathers were conscripted for compulsory military training at ages 18-20 in 1969/70. Information on fathers' alcohol consumption, frequency of intoxication and apprehended for drunkenness, was collected during conscription.

Aneurysm excision, ligation, and radical debridement along with revascularization by axial reanastomosis were performed for all patients except one with chronic degenerative fusiform aneurysm, who received aneurysm resection and interposition reverse saphenous vein graft. Upper limb arterial flow was evaluated clinically and with hand-held Doppler in the perioperative period and during subsequent follow-up.

Two of them suffered from thromboembolic complications and were managed conservatively by heparinization. Seven patients (six male, one female), aged 32-53, were confirmed to have brachial artery pseudoaneurysms by duplex scan and recruited for data analysis. Pseudoaneurysms ranged 10-40 mm in size. One ex-heroin abuser, who presented with median nerve palsy, underwent aneurysm resection and reversed saphenous vein interposition. The other six patients presented with painful pulsatile cubital fossa swellings. They underwent aneurysm resection, extensive debridement, and primary axial reanastomosis. There were no perioperative procedure-related complications. With an average follow-up of 38.7 months, no recurrences or neurovascular complications were detected.

Currently, transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in experimental models of SCI shows promise as effective therapies. BMSCs secrete various factors that can regulate the microenvironment, which is called paracrine effect. Among these paracrine substances, exosomes are considered to be the most valuable therapeutic factors. Our study found that BMSCs-derived exosomes therapy attenuated cell apoptosis and inflammation response in the injured spinal cord tissues. In in vitro studies, BMSCs-derived exosomes significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PC12 cell apoptosis, reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL (interleukin)-1β and promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors including IL-10 and IL-4. Moreover, we found that LPS-induced protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) was significantly downregulated after treatment with BMSCs-derived exosomes. In in vivo studies, we found that hindlimb motor function was significantly improved in SCI rats with systemic administration of BMSCs-derived exosomes. We also observed that the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and pro-inflammatory factors was significantly decreased, while the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and anti-inflammatory factors were upregulated in SCI rats after exosome treatment. In conclusion, BMSCs-derived exosomes can inhibit apoptosis and inflammation response induced by injury and promote motor function recovery by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, which suggests that BMSCs-derived exosomes are expected to become a new therapeutic strategy for SCI."}

To overcome the overlapping phenomenology of the two diseases, specific diagnostic criteria have been developed for depression in this context. Mixed findings have come from neuropathological and neuroimaging studies, with some evidence linking the underlying neural substrate of AD and depression, suggesting an overlapping cause of primary depression and depression comorbid with AD. Few randomized controlled trials for depression associated with AD have been conducted, with rather poor results for the use of antidepressants.	Currently, depression associated with AD is not considered a separate disorder by regulatory authorities and is unlikely to be considered as such in the near future. Several obstacles remain to support such a specific position, including the heterogenous nature of depression in general and within AD itself, the lack of a distinct set of symptoms, and limited treatment."}

Nitrite was assayed in 'spot' morning urine samples in both the enuretics and normal controls. Enuretics were then given 50 mg indomethacin suppositories each night; urine volume, urinary osmolality and electrolytes, serum osmolality and electrolytes and urinary nitrite were assayed before indomethacin treatment and after 15 days of treatment.	The mean (sd) urinary nitrite excretion was 24.4 (19.6) micromol/L in normal children and 275.9 (111.2) micromol/L in enuretics (P<0.05). With indomethacin, the urinary nitrite concentration was significantly decreased to 141 (45.1) micromol/L (P<0.05) and associated with a significant reduction in bed-wetting episodes and voiding frequency. The functional bladder capacity was <70% of the predicted value for age in six of the patients; they had significant improvements on indomethacin, to values similar to those in patients with a nearly normal functional bladder capacity. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary volume by 41%, the night volume by 40%, clearance of free water by 46% and increased the day : night urinary volume ratio by 55%. The absolute amounts of urinary calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, urea, creatinine, and glucose were lower on indomethacin, although not statistically significantly so. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary and 'spot' morning osmolality and osmotic clearance. There were no significant changes in serum osmolality and electrolyte concentrations. Indomethacin also decreased the absolute amount of urinary sodium, chloride and potassium, fractional sodium and potassium excretion, and filtered sodium.

Urinary nitrite excretion increased significantly in patients with primary nocturnal enuresis; indomethacin markedly reduced bed-wetting episodes and decreased the frequency of voiding in enuretics with small or normal functional bladder capacity, which was associated with a significant decrease in urinary nitrite excretion. Indomethacin reduced bed-wetting by decreasing the urine volume, clearance of free water and urinary electrolytes, and through possible effects on bladder and urethral contraction, by inhibiting NO and prostaglandin synthesis.

Here, we show that endogenous neural precursor cells perform an anti-tumour response by specifically targeting stem-like brain tumour cells. In vitro, neural precursor cells predominantly express bone morphogenetic protein-7; bone morphogenetic protein-7 is constitutively released from neurospheres and induces canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells. Exposure of human and murine stem-like brain tumour cells to neurosphere-derived bone morphogenetic protein-7 induces tumour stem cell differentiation, attenuates stem-like marker expression and reduces self-renewal and the ability for tumour initiation. Neurosphere-derived or recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-7 reduces glioblastoma expansion from stem-like cells by down-regulating the transcription factor Olig2. In vivo, large numbers of bone morphogenetic protein-7-expressing neural precursors encircle brain tumours in young mice, induce canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells and can thereby attenuate tumour formation. This anti-tumour response is strongly reduced in older mice. Our results indicate that endogenous neural precursor cells protect the young brain from glioblastoma by releasing bone morphogenetic protein-7, which acts as a paracrine tumour suppressor that represses proliferation, self-renewal and tumour-initiation of stem-like glioblastoma cells."}

Burdenko^\n[Evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in acromegaly using different remission criteria].^\nFor a long time, surgical removal of somatotropinoma using the transsphenoidal approach has been the first stage of treatment in most acromegaly patients. For the past decades, the efficacy criteria for surgical treatment of acromegaly have significantly changed, which requires appropriate correction.	We aimed to evaluate the results of transsphenoidal adenomectomy in acromegaly patients using various criteria for disease remission.	The study included patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly who underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic adenomectomy performed by a single neurosurgeon. The surgical treatment outcomes were evaluated 6 months after operative intervention based on levels of IGF-1, OGTT, and GH. The obtained data were analyzed using different threshold values for the level of GH nadir during OGTT: criteria A <2.0 ng/ml, criteria B <1.0 ng/ml, and criteria C <0.4 ng/ml to assess acromegaly remission, along with matching of the IGF-1 level to the reference range for a given gender and age.	The study included 70 patients (52 females and 18 males) with a mean age of 52.2±11.5 years (29 to 73 years). The baseline IGF-1 level exceeded the upper limit of the reference range 3.3±1.4 (1.1-7.3)-fold, on average. The baseline mean basal GH level was 34.2±41.7 (1.2-192.0) ng/ml. The mean pituitary adenoma size was 16.7±8.6 (4.3-46.0) mm; 18 (26%) out of 70 patients had pituitary microadenoma, and 52 (74%) patients had macroadenoma. Six months after surgery, acromegaly remission met criteria A in 47 (67%) patients, criteria B in 28 (40%) patients, and criteria C in 18 (26%) patients.	Our findings demonstrate that evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in treatment of acromegaly patients depends on the criteria chosen for assessing remission. This feature should be considered when comparing outcomes of surgical treatment for acromegaly in different years. Probably, introduction of the 2010 criteria should be accompanied by revision of the previous remission indicators.	Уже давно первым этапом лечения пациентов с акромегалией в подавляющем большинстве случаев является хирургическое удаление соматотропиномы транссфеноидальным доступом. В течение последних десятилетий критерии эффективности хирургического лечения акромегалии значительно изменились, что требует сегодня соответствующей коррекции. Цель исследования - оценить результаты транссфеноидальной аденомэктомии у пациентов с акромегалией с использованием различных критериев ремиссии заболевания. Материал и методы. В исследование включили пациентов с впервые выявленной акромегалией, которым была выполнена трансназальная транссфеноидальная эндоскопическая аденомэктомия одним нейрохирургом. Результаты хирургического лечения оценили через 6 мес после оперативного вмешательства путем определения уровня ИФР-1 и ОГТТ с определением ГР. Полученные данные проанализировали, используя различные пороговые значения уровня ГР в ОГТТ: критерии А <2,0 нг/мл, критерии В <1,0 нг/мл, критерии С <0,4 нг/мл для оценки ремиссии акромегалии наряду с соответствием уровня ИФР-1 референсному диапазону для данного пола и возраста. Результаты. В исследование включены 70 пациентов (52 женщины и 18 мужчин), средний возраст которых составил 52,2±11,5 года (от 29 до 73 лет). Исходный уровень ИФР-1 превышал верхнюю границу референсного диапазона в среднем в 3,3±1,4 (1,1-7,3) раза. Исходно средний базальный уровень ГР составил 34,2±41,7 (1,2-192,0) нг/мл. Размер аденомы гипофиза - 16,7±8,6 (4,3-46,0) мм; 18 (26%) из 70 пациентов имели микроаденому гипофиза, 52 (74%) пациента - макроаденому. Через 6 мес после хирургического лечения критериям А ремиссии акромегалии соответствовали 47 (67%) пациентов, критериям В - 28 (40%) пациентов, критериям С - 18 (26%) пациентов. Выводы. Согласно данным нашего исследования, оценка результатов транссфеноидальной аденомэктомии при лечении больных акромегалией зависит от выбранных критериев оценки ремиссии. Эту особенность следует учитывать при сравнительном анализе результатов хирургического лечения акромегалии в разные годы. Очевидно, что с введением критериев 2010 г. прежние показатели ремиссии требуют пересмотра."}

Because cellular injury mechanisms and therapeutic approaches may depend on the severity of the initial insult, it is important to utilize a model in which outcomes are sensitive to injury severity. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized and subjected to sham injury (n = 23) or CCI injury at either 0.5 mm (n = 22) or 1.0 mm (n = 22) depth of impact at a velocity of 5 m/sec. At 2 days, brain-injured mice exhibited significant memory (p < 0.05) and motor function (p < 0.001) deficits compared to sham-injured mice; furthermore, mice subjected to an impact of 1.0 mm were significantly more impaired in both outcome measures than those injured at 0.5 mm (p < 0.05). The cortical lesion increased in size between 24 h and 7 days in both injury groups, but was significantly larger in the 1.0 mm group. Hippocampal cell loss was observed in the hilar and CA3 regions in both groups, and in the CA1 and dentate granule cell layers in the 1.0 mm group. Regional patterns of IgG extravasation and reactive astrocytosis were similar in the two injured groups, but changes were more persistent in the 1.0 mm group. Both levels of injury resulted in acute loss of neuronal MAP-2 immunoreactivity in the cortex and sub-region specific changes in the hippocampus. Thus, increasing the depth of impact led to similar structural alterations in neurons, astrocytes and the vasculature, but resulted in greater behavioral deficits and cortical and hippocampal cell death."}

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of magnolol on the proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and neointima formation in vivo, as well as the related cell signaling mechanisms.	Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induced proliferation ofVSMCs was assessed using colorimetric assay. Cell cycle progression and mRNA expression of cell cycle associated molecules were determined by flow cytometry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respectively. The signaling molecules such as ERK1/2,JNK, P38 and NF-kappaB were determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, rat carotid artery balloon injury model was performed to assess the effect of magnolol on neointima formation in vivo.	Oral administration of magnolol significantly inhibited intimal area and intimal/medial ratio (I/M). Our in vitro assays revealed magnolol dose dependently induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. Also, magnolol inhibited mRNA and protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK2 in vitro and in vivo. The cell cycle arrest was associated with inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB translocation.	Magnolol suppressed proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and attenuated neointima formation in vivo by inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 through modulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK2 expression.	Thus, the results suggest that magnolol could be a potential therapeutic candidate for the prevention of restenosis and atherosclerosis."}

High levels of ED related symptoms were associated with 'concretised' understanding of own emotions (i.e. a greater number of food related responses), but sophisticated understanding of same sex acquaintance's emotions. They were associated with fewer positive thoughts for self, fewer negative emotions about their own behaviour, and more food responses for same sex acquaintance's behaviour.

{"pmid": "29802210", "text": "Clinical science (London, England : 1979)^\nNeuroprotection via AT2 receptor agonists in ischemic stroke.^\nStroke is a devastating disease that afflicts millions of people each year worldwide. Ischemic stroke, which accounts for ~88% of cases, occurs when blood supply to the brain is decreased, often because of thromboembolism or atherosclerotic occlusion. This deprives the brain of oxygen and nutrients, causing immediate, irreversible necrosis within the core of the ischemic area, but more delayed and potentially reversible neuronal damage in the surrounding brain tissue, the penumbra. The only currently approved therapies for ischemic stroke, the thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and the endovascular clot retrieval/destruction processes, are aimed at restoring blood flow to the infarcted area, but are only available for a minority of patients and are not able in most cases to completely restore neurological deficits. Consequently, there remains a need for agents that will protect neurones against death following ischemic stroke. Here, we evaluate angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 (AT2) receptor agonists as a possible therapeutic target for this disease. We first provide an overview of stroke epidemiology, pathophysiology, and currently approved therapies. We next review the large amount of preclinical evidence, accumulated over the past decade and a half, which indicates that AT2 receptor agonists exert significant neuroprotective effects in various animal models, and discuss the potential mechanisms involved. Finally, after discussing the challenges of delivering blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeable AT2 receptor agonists to the infarcted areas of the brain, we summarize the evidence for and against the development of these agents as a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke."}

However, while the understanding of mechanisms underlying autophagy in SCI has progressed, there remain several controversial points: (1) temporal pattern results of autophagic activation after SCI are not consistent across studies; (2) effect of accumulation of autophagosomes due to the blockade or enhancement of autophagic flux is uncertain; (3) overall effect of enhanced autophagy remains undefined, with both beneficial and detrimental outcomes reported in SCI literature. In this review, the temporal pattern of autophagic activation, autophagic flux, autophagic cell death, relationship between autophagy and apoptosis, and pharmacological intervention of autophagy in TSCI (contusion injury, compression injury and hemisection injury) and IRSCI are discussed. Types of SCI and severity appear to contribute to differences in outcomes regarding temporal pattern, flux, and function of autophagy.

With this in mind, the authors constructed a new scale, the Post-Stroke Depression Scale (PSDS) which takes into account a series of symptoms and problems commonly observed in depressed stroke patients. The PSDS and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDS) were administered to a group of 124 patients, who had been classified, on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria, in the following categories: No depression (n = 32); Minor PSD (n = 47); Major PSD (n = 45). Scores obtained by these stroke patients on the PSDS and on the HDS were compared to those obtained on the same scales by 17 psychiatric patients also classified as major depression on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria. An analysis of the symptomatological profiles clearly showed that: (1) a continuum exists between the so-called 'major' and 'minor' forms of PSD; (2) in both groups of depressed stroke patients the depressive symptomatology seems due to the psychological reaction to the devastating consequences of stroke, since the motivated aspects of depression prevailed in depressed stroke patients, whereas the (biologically determined) unmotivated aspects prevailed in patients with a functional form of major depression; and (3) in stroke patients a DSM III-based diagnosis of major PSD could be in part inflated by symptoms (such as apathy and vegetative disorders) that are typical of major depression in a patient free from brain damage, but that could be due to the brain lesion per se in a stroke patient."}

If this is not the case the assumption could lead to bias, e.g. when men of different ages are compared in interventional studies on ED. Objective: To explore the risk of developing ED over time for men from different age groups. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was sent to a number of male residents in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1992 (n = 10,458). Men were randomly selected according to year of birth to obtain several cohorts at 5-year intervals of ages 45, 50, 55 years, etc., up to the age of 85 or older. In 2003 an analogous, slightly expanded, questionnaire was sent to a random sample of men from the age cohorts 46, 51 years, etc. (n = 10,845). A total of 4072 men received both surveys, thereby constituting a group of men followed longitudinally for 11 years. The future risk of developing ED in the different age cohorts, adjusted for a number of ED risk factors, was then assessed. Results: A total of 3257 men responded to both questionnaires (response rate = 80%, age range = 56-103 years). The risk of having ED increased substantially with increasing age, both within each survey and longitudinally between the surveys. The adjusted risk of developing ED within the next 11 years increased with a factor of 10, from 1.8% at the age of 45 years at baseline to as much as 11.4% at the age of 65 years. Conclusion: Age as a risk-factor for ED is a non-linear function and should be adjusted as such to avoid bias when including men of different ages in interventional studies on ED."}

Logistic regression results show that individual socio-economic status and all of the community socio-economic status measures predict the onset of stroke before controlling for individual risk factors. However, there is a high correlation between the various measures of community socio-economic status.

The results suggest that individual income and average household income are significant predictors of onset of stroke both independently and after controlling for behavioural and medical risk factors.

The aim of this review was to systematically and qualitatively review the literature on the efficacy of CBT for depression in PWE based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case series. We aim to determine patterns in the literature to inform the type of CBT, if any, that should be offered to PWE who are depressed. Databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane EBM Reviews were searched via OVID. Selection criteria included the following: (1) participants with epilepsy; (2) use of CBT; (3) valid depression outcome measure; and (4) published in peer-reviewed journal in English. Inclusions of studies were assessed by two independent researchers. We identified 14 outcome papers for 13 CBT trials including 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 case series. Positive effects of CBT on depression were reported in three of six RCTs. A review of their content revealed that all effective RCTs specifically tailored CBT to improve depression. Conversely, two of three RCTs that failed to find depression-related effects focused on improving seizure-control. This pattern was also observed in the case series. Although limited in number and having methodologic limitations, the treatment studies included in our review suggest that interventions tailored toward improving depression are possibly efficacious, whereas those that focus on improving seizure control do not appear to be. However, this review highlights that there is need for further RCTs in this area in order to confirm the possible efficacy of CBT for depression in PWE."}

Additionally, the relevant literature identified by means of a computerized MEDLINE research on the years 1997 - 2007 with the key words 'caregiver'/'relative', 'burden' and 'bipolar disorder', was analysed to describe the situation of the caregivers comprehensively. Related articles in the MEDLINE search were also viewed.	The burden of relatives of bipolar patients are manifold and partially specific. On the top of the list caregivers mentioned emotional burdens like: 'lack of understanding, helplessness and hopelessness' (90,6 %) and 'own concernment' (81,2 %). Specific burdens of these caregivers are 'repulsing and uncooperative behaviour of the patient' (78,1 %) and 'burdens due to the alternation between manic and depressive symptoms' (71,9 %).

A hallmark of brainstem gliomas are mutations in the histone H3.3 with the majority of cases expressing the mutation K27M on histone 3.3. Recent studies using whole genome sequencing have revealed other mutations associated with disease. Current standard clinical practice may merely involve radiation and/or chemotherapy with little hope for long term survival. Here we discuss the potential of new therapies.	Despite the lack of treatment options using frequently practiced clinical techniques, immunotherapeutic strategies have recently been developed to target brainstem gliomas. To target brainstem gliomas, investigators are evaluating the use of broad non-targeted therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Alternatively, others have begun to explore adoptive T cell strategies against these fatal malignancies."}

However, few studies have examined whether emotional stimuli capture attention to a normal degree in people with schizophrenia when attention is directed elsewhere. The current event-related potential study examined motivated attention to task-irrelevant emotional stimuli in 35 stabilized outpatients and 26 healthy controls with a modified visual P300 oddball detection task.

We separately evaluated the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) and Late Positive Potential (LPP) to emotional pictures and the P300 to target stimuli. Patients and controls showed similar patterns of EPN and LPP amplitude to the emotional stimuli, such that the EPN and LPP were larger for both pleasant and unpleasant versus neutral pictures. Although patients performed worse than controls on the target counting task, both groups showed comparable P300 differentiation between target versus non-target stimuli.

However, postoperative progressive spinal deformity complicates outcome in a subset of patients after surgery. We set out to determine whether the use of laminoplasty (LP) vs laminectomy (LM) has reduced the incidence of subsequent spinal deformity following intradural tumor resection at our institution.	We retrospectively reviewed the records of 238 consecutive patients undergoing resection of intradural tumor at a single institution. The incidence of subsequent progressive kyphosis or scoliosis, perioperative morbidity, and neurological outcome were compared between the LP and LM cohorts.	One hundred eighty patients underwent LM and 58 underwent LP. Patients were 46 +/- 19 years old with median modified McCormick score of 2. Tumors were intramedullary in 102 (43%) and extramedullary in 102 (43%). All baseline clinical, radiographic, and operative variables were similar between the LP and LM cohorts. LP was associated with a decreased mean length of hospitalization (5 vs 7 days; P = .002) and trend of decreased incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak (3% vs 9%; P = .14). Following LP vs LM, 5 (9%) vs 21 (12%) patients developed progressive deformity (P = .728) a mean of 14 months after surgery. The incidence of progressive deformity was also similar between LP vs LM in pediatric patients < 18 years of age (43% vs 36%), with preoperative scoliosis or loss of cervical/lumbar lordosis (28% vs 22%), or with intramedullary tumors (11% vs 11%).	LP for the resection of intradural spinal tumors was not associated with a decreased incidence of short-term progressive spinal deformity or improved neurological function. However, LP may be associated with a reduction in incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak. Longer-term follow-up is warranted to definitively assess the long-term effect of LP and the risk of deformity over time."}

For such situations the clinical application of a new technique is presented.	For treatment planning a modern 3D planning system was necessary. Patient's positioning was done by using a vacuum-form body immobilizer and an integrated head mask. Radiation fields were placed only by table movements being calculated by the planning system in relation to a reference point at the patient's surface.

The specific neuroprosthetic or 'functional' applications reviewed in this article include upper- and lower-limb motor movement for self-care tasks and mobility, respectively, bladder function, and respiratory control. Specific therapeutic applications include motor relearning, reduction of hemiplegic shoulder pain, muscle strengthening, prevention of muscle atrophy, prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis, improvement of tissue oxygenation and peripheral hemodynamic functioning, and cardiopulmonary conditioning. Perspectives on future developments and clinical applications of NMES are presented."}

In the RECOS group, participants were directed towards one of five training modules (verbal memory, visuo-spatial memory and attention, working memory, selective attention or reasoning) corresponding to their key cognitive concern whereas the CRT group received a standard program. The main outcome was the total score on BADS (Behavioural Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome) and the secondary outcomes were: cognition (executive functions; selective attention; visuospatial memory and attention; verbal memory; working memory) and clinical measures (symptoms; insight; neurocognitive complaints; self-esteem). All outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), week 12 (posttherapy, T2), and follow-up (week 36, i.e., 6months posttherapy, T3).	No difference was shown for the main outcome. A significant improvement was found for BADS' profile score for RECOS at T2 and T3, and for CRT at T3. Change in BADS in the RECOS and CRT arms were not significantly different between T1 and T2 (+0.86, p=0.108), or between T1 and T3 (+0.36, p=0.540). Significant improvements were found in several secondary outcomes including cognition (executive functions, selective attention, verbal memory, and visuospatial abilities) and clinician measures (symptoms and awareness to be hampered by cognitive deficits in everyday) in both treatment arms following treatment.

Sensitivity, specificity and the corrected predictive values of DST nonsuppression (50 or more ng/ml at 0800 hr, 1600 hr, or 2300 hr), adjusted to a 50% prevalence of endogenous and nonendogenous depression, varied considerably depending on the diagnostic definition used. The highest predictive value (89.9%) was found with the Taylor-Abrams criteria (sensitivity = 43.9%, specificity = 95.0%), and the lowest predictive value (53.3%) with DSM-III (sensitivity = 37.7%, specificity = 68.1%). Eliminating the patients with dexamethasone levels of less than 2000 pg/ml improved the diagnostic specificity of the DST for most of the eight definitions of endogenous depression. This further indicates that plasma dexamethasone levels should be analyzed in studies designed to explore the diagnostic utility of the DST. A significant, chance-corrected association between DST nonsuppression and the diagnosis of endogenous depression was found with clinical diagnosis (according to the International Classification of Diseases), and for four out of eight operational diagnoses (Newcastle Scale I, Newcastle Scale II, Taylor-Abrams Criteria, and Vienna Research Criteria).

Accumulating evidence has shown that TLE is a disorder of abnormal epileptogenic networks, rather than focal sources. Graph theory allows for a network-based representation of TLE brain networks, and has potential to illuminate characteristics of brain topology conducive to TLE pathophysiology, including seizure initiation and spread. We review basic concepts which we believe will prove helpful in interpreting results rapidly emerging from graph theory research in TLE. In addition, we summarize the current state of graph theory findings in TLE as they pertain its pathophysiology. Several common findings have emerged from the many modalities which have been used to study TLE using graph theory, including structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, surface EEG, intracranial EEG, magnetoencephalography, functional MRI, cell cultures, simulated models, and mouse models, involving increased regularity of the interictal network configuration, altered local segregation and global integration of the TLE network, and network reorganization of temporal lobe and limbic structures. As different modalities provide different views of the same phenomenon, future studies integrating data from multiple modalities are needed to clarify findings and contribute to the formation of a coherent theory on the pathophysiology of TLE."}

AWD 140-190 was active at nontoxic doses after oral and intraperitoneal administration in rats and mice in a range of anticonvulsant tests. The compound was active against electrically-induced seizures (MES, ED50 rat p.o. = 2.47 mg/kg), in a genetic animal model the DBA/2 mouse, and in corneally kindled rats. It was not active against seizures induced chemically by pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline and strychnine. Effective doses in mice following both oral and intraperitoneal administration are similar indicating good oral absorption. During 14 days chronic oral treatment of mice with 10 mg/kg, no development of tolerance was observed. The protective indices (TD50/MES ED50) in rats and mice following oral administration are favorable when compared to phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. No motor impairment, evaluated with the rotarod test and by observation in the open field test, was observable following oral administration of doses up to 500 mg/kg. There was no influence on spontaneous motility and learning performance in rats and no interaction with ethanol in mice after administration of doses which are above anticonvulsant effective doses indicating the absence of central side effects.

Alcoholic men (n = 43) and women (n = 21) who responded to notices about a research study were screened, clinically assessed and administered Wechsler Memory and Intelligence tests after 3 months of sobriety, on average. Cognitive performance was compared with that of an age-matched sample of healthy controls (n = 51).	As a group, the alcoholics achieved significantly lower scores than controls on summary indices of the Wechsler Memory and Adult Intelligence Scales and showed greater decline from estimated premorbid intelligence levels than controls. Almost 60% of the alcoholics had at least one additional psychiatric (mood or anxiety) or past substance-dependence comorbidity. There were no marked sex differences in patterns of comorbidity. Comorbid alcoholics were younger, had consumed less alcohol over their lifetime and performed between noncomorbid alcoholics and controls on all tests.	Mood and anxiety comorbidity did not necessarily compound poor cognitive test performance associated with chronic alcohol misuse.

Here, we show that miR-25 is overexpressed in 91% of examined human glioma tissues and 4 out of 6 human glioma cell lines. MiR-25 increases cell proliferation in two independent glioma cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-25 was found to reduce CDKN1C protein levels by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Notably, ablation of endogenous miR-25 rescued CDKN1C expression and significantly decreased glioma cell proliferation by facilitating normal cell cycle progression.

These changes may be linked to changes in symptoms as fluctuations in self-esteem have been linked to symptom fluctuations.	We aimed to determine the relationship between these three factors - group cohesion, self-esteem, and symptoms - during group cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (GCBTp). We hypothesized that group cohesion would precede changes in symptoms and self-esteem and that improvements in self-esteem would precede improvements in symptoms.	This is an uncontrolled longitudinal study recruiting from a convenience sample within two early psychosis clinics.	Sixty-six individuals from first episode of psychosis treatment programmes participated in this study and received 24 sessions of a validated GCBTp protocol. Participants answered a brief questionnaire at the end of each session, measuring their group cohesion, self-esteem, and perception of their symptoms as worse, same, or better than usual.	Orthogonal polynomial contrasts for time effects were estimated with a mixed model for repeated measures with a random cluster effect and revealed a quartic trend regarding changes in symptoms over the 24 sessions. Self-esteem, symptoms, and group cohesion were strongly linked during a given session. Also, self-esteem changes predicted changes in symptoms up to two sessions later, and symptoms changes predicted self-esteem changes at the next session. Group cohesion preceded improvements in both self-esteem and symptoms; self-esteem also predicted improvements in group cohesion.	These results suggest that self-esteem and symptoms influence each other during therapy, with improvements in one leading to improvements in the other. Group cohesion also appears to be an essential prerequisite to positive changes in self-esteem and symptoms during GCBTp.	This study emphasizes the interrelation between self-esteem improvements and symptom improvements, with improvements in one leading to improvements in the other, during group CBT for psychosis. Group cohesion, in this study, is a predictor of self-esteem and symptom improvements, suggesting that a special attention should be given to developing a strong alliance and group cohesion early on during CBT for psychosis."}

Promoter methylation status of the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is the most important clinical biomarker in glioblastoma, predicting for therapeutic response. However, it does not always correlate with response. This may be due to intratumoral heterogeneity, with a single biopsy unlikely to represent the entire lesion. Aberrations in other DNA repair mechanisms may also contribute. This study investigated intratumoral heterogeneity in multiple glioblastoma tumors with a particular focus on the DNA repair pathways. Transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity was identified in 40% of cases with variability in MGMT methylation status found in 14% of cases. As well as identifying intratumoral heterogeneity at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, targeted next generation sequencing identified between 1 and 37 unique sequence variants per specimen. In-silico tools were then able to identify deleterious variants in both the base excision repair and the mismatch repair pathways that may contribute to therapeutic response. As these pathways have roles in temozolomide response, these findings may confound patient management and highlight the importance of assessing multiple tumor biopsies."}

Ethanol vapor inhalation offers an advantage over liquid diet consumption in that the onset of withdrawal can be temporally controlled more precisely, allowing studies of the development of withdrawal symptoms.	The purpose of the current study was to induce ethanol dependence in mice using an inhalation procedure and to assess withdrawal anxiety symptoms behaviorally in the elevated zero maze and in the light/dark box. Male and female mice were exposed to 3 days of ethanol vapors. Anxiety-like behavior was measured on the elevated zero maze and light/dark box at multiple time points during withdrawal.	Mice experiencing ethanol withdrawal demonstrated increased anxiety-like behaviors relative to control animals in both apparatuses. However, this finding was specific to the procedure used with the elevated zero maze and was strongly influenced by sex in the light/dark box.

Interestingly, some lymphoma cells form characteristic spindle shapes; these cells are found in some variants of malignant lymphoma, such as primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma, but they have not been reported in PCNSL or LC. Here, we provide an autopsy case report of LC in a 69-year-old immunocompetent man who developed rapidly progressive cognitive decline and died on day 68 after the episode despite treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone administration. MRI revealed high signal intensities on T2-weighted images of the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord without gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted images. On autopsy, diffuse infiltrative atypical cells were seen; these cells were positive for CD20 and CD79a and negative for GFAP, CD3, and CD5 on immunohistochemistry, resulting in a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, specifically LC. We found characteristic spindle-shaped cells, especially in the cerebral cortex. This is the first report showing that lymphoma cells in PCNSL can take on a spindle-shaped form. It is difficult to recognize these spindle-shaped cells as lymphoma cells on hematoxylin and eosin staining and diagnose them correctly with small biopsy specimens without immunohistochemistry. This case suggests that we should add atypical, spindle-shaped cells to the differential diagnosis of PCNSL."}

Both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels have been reported to decrease with age, and treatment with either GH or IGF-I can ameliorate age-related cognitive decline. Interestingly, acute GH and IGF-I treatments enhance glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus of juvenile animals. However, whether this enhancement also occurs in old rats, when cognitive impairment is ameliorated by GH and IGF-I (des-IGF-I), remains to be determined. To address this issue, we used an in vitro CA1 hippocampal slice preparation and extracellular recording techniques to study the effects of acute application of GH and IGF-I on compound field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), as well as AMPA- and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs, in young adult (10 months) and old (28 months) rats. The results indicated that both GH and IGF-I increased compound-, AMPA-, and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs to a similar extent in slices from both age groups and that this augmentation was likely mediated via a postsynaptic mechanism. Initial characterization of the signaling cascades underlying these effects revealed that the GH-induced enhancement was not mediated by the JAK2 signaling element in either young adult or old rats but that the IGF-I-induced enhancement involved a PI3K-mediated mechanism in old, but not young adults. The present findings are consistent with a role for a GH- or IGF-I-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission in mitigating age-related cognitive impairment in old rats."}

Recent neuroimaging studies support the contention that depression, as well as pain distress and rejection distress, share the same neurobiological circuits. In a recently published study, we confirmed the hypothesis that perception of increased pain during treatment-refractory depression, predominantly unipolar, was related to increased rejection sensitivity. In the present study, we aimed to test this same hypothesis for bipolar depression.	The present study analysed data from 67 patients presenting to the Black Dog Institute Bipolar Disorders Clinic in Sydney, Australia. The patients all met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder and had completed a self-report questionnaire regarding perceived pain and rejection sensitivity during depression.	A significant increase in the experience of headaches (p=0.003) as well as chest pain (p=0.004) during bipolar depression was predicted by a major increase in rejection sensitivity when depressed, i.e., state rejection sensitivity. Being rejection sensitive in general, i.e., trait rejection sensitivity, did not predict pain during depression.	The experience of increased headaches and chest pain during bipolar depression is related to increased rejection sensitivity during depression. Research to further elucidate this relationship is required."}

The degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases is thought to be one of the most important steps in the process of tumor invasion. However, the activity of most matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can be modulated by simultaneously secreted inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs). We have previously shown that an imbalance between the levels of MMPs and TIMPs may be essential in the determination of the invasiveness of certain human malignant astrocytoma cell lines. To determine if the up-regulation of TIMP genes and gene products could modulate the invasiveness of human malignant astrocytoma cells, in the present study we have transfected a highly invasive astrocytoma cell line, SF-188, with an expression vector carrying a full-length TIMP-1 cDNA. The parental SF-188 astrocytoma cell line overexpresses the 72-kDa and 92-kDa type IV collagenases with little expression of TIMPs-1 and -2. Following transfection with TIMP-1, SF-188 astrocytoma clones expressed the 0.9 kb TIMP-1 message by northern analysis, and produced a 21 kDa metalloproteinase inhibitor by reverse zymography. The stable TIMP-1 SF-188 transformants demonstrated morphological changes and diminished growth rates in soft agar when compared to controls. The invasion of successfully TIMP-1 transfected astrocytoma cells across matrigel-coated filters was significantly decreased over controls. These results suggest that upregulation of TIMP-1 expression in SF-188 astrocytoma cells has decreased their in vitro invasive potential."}

Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large heterogeneous mass in the right frontal lobe, with mild post-Gd enhancement. A gross-total resection was obtained.

However, postischemic angiogenesis is short-lived and may be completely terminated within a few weeks after ischemic insult. The molecular mechanism underlying the dissolution of postischemic angiogenic processes is poorly understood. Although the expression of angiogenic genes has been studied in ischemic stroke models, the activation of angiostatic genes after cerebral ischemia has not been investigated. Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and TSP-2 are naturally occurring angiostatic factors, which inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. The aim of the present study was to explore the expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2 in relation to the evolution of angiogenic process in a focal ischemia model in rats.	Rats underwent cortical ischemia in the middle cerebral artery territory for 60 minutes and reperfusion for up to 2 weeks. Northern and Western blot analysis were used to study the temporal profile of TSP-1 and TSP-2 expression at the mRNA and protein level, respectively. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies were used to examine the spatial expression patterns. Double immunostaining was applied to define the cellular origins of TSP-1 and TSP-2.	A biphasic expression of TSP-1 was noted after ischemia, peaking at 1 and 72 hours. Endothelial cells in the leptomeninges were the only source of the first TSP-1 peak, whereas endothelial, glial, neuronal, and macrophage cells contributed to the second peak of TSP-1 expression. TSP-2 expression occurred much later and in a monophasic manner, peaking 2 weeks after ischemia. TSP-2 immunoreactivity was observed in endothelial, neuronal, and macrophage, but not glial, cells. TSP-1 was expressed before the peak of angiogenesis, whereas robust TSP-2 expression occurred at the peak of angiogenesis and continued into the period when angiogenesis had completely resolved.	Robust expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2, 2 major angiostatic factors, was noted in the ischemic brain with different temporal expression profiles from different cellular origins. The expression of these angiostatic factors, especially TSP-2, likely contributes to the spontaneous resolution of postischemic angiogenesis. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance of angiogenic and angiostatic factors in the ischemic brain."}

In 2005, 47 laboratory-confirmed and probable clinical cases of SLEV infection were reported in Córdoba, Argentina. Although the causes of 2005 outbreak remain unknown, they might be related not only to virological factors, but also to ecological and environmental conditions. We hypothesized that one of the factors for SLE reemergence in Córdoba, Argentina, was the introduction of a new SLEV genotype (SLEV genotype III), with no previous activity in the area. In order to evaluate this hypothesis we carried out a molecular characterization of SLEV detections from mosquitoes collected between 2001 and 2004 in Córdoba city. A total of 315 mosquito pools (11,002 individuals) including 12 mosquitoes species were analyzed. Overall, 20 pools (8 mosquitoes species) were positive for SLEV. During this study, genotypes II, V and VII were detected. No mosquito pool infected with genotype III was detected before the 2005 outbreak. Genotype V was found every year and in the 8 sampled sites. Genotypes II and VII showed limited temporal and spatial activities. We cannot dismiss the association of genotype II and V as etiological agents during the outbreak. However, the silent circulation of other SLEV strains in Córdoba city before the 2005 outbreak suggests that the introduction of genotype III was an important factor associated to this event. Not mutually exclusive, other factors such as changes in avian hosts and mosquitoes vectors communities, driven by climatic and environmental modifications, should also be taken into consideration in further studies."}

We report here a simple and rapid strategy to detect the precise number of the CAGs. After the DNA fragment containing the CAG repeats is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, a primer extension is carried out; the extension of the end-labelled reverse primer adjacent to 3' end of CAG repeats stops at the first T after CAG repeats with the incorporation of dideoxy ATP in the reaction mixture. The resultant primer products are analysed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. This method could be quite useful to detect not only CAG repeats in SBMA but also other polymorphic dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats."}

However, clinical studies of neural grafting in Parkinson's disease have produced only modest improvements. One of the main reasons for this is the low survival rate of transplanted neurons. The inadequate supply of critical neurotrophic factors in the adult brain is likely to be a major cause of early cell death and restricted outgrowth of fetal grafts placed into the mature striatum. Glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor that is crucial to the survival, outgrowth and maintenance of dopamine neurons, and so is a candidate for protecting grafted fetal dopamine neurons in the adult brain. We found that implantation of adeno-associated virus type 2 encoding GDNF (AAV2-GDNF) in the normal monkey caudate nucleus induced overexpression of GDNF that persisted for at least 6 months after injection. In a 6-month within-animal controlled study, AAV2-GDNF enhanced the survival of fetal dopamine neurons by 4-fold, and increased the outgrowth of grafted fetal dopamine neurons by almost 3-fold in the caudate nucleus of MPTP-treated monkeys, compared with control grafts in the other caudate nucleus. Thus, the addition of GDNF gene therapy to neural transplantation may be a useful strategy to improve treatment for Parkinson's disease."}

The neuropathological study revealed that many amyloid plaques and widespread Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) appeared in the cerebral cortex. Characteristically, the plaques reacted with anti-prion protein and none of them reacted with anti-beta protein, and they were made of many components, including amyloid cores, macrophages laden with lipid granules and/or degenerated neurites. Neuropil threads were seen mainly in amyloid plaques. Moreover, plaques appeared which were confluent and laminar in arrangement in the fifth and sixth cortical layers and had a close relationship to the neuronal loss. There was no spongiform change in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. The cerebellum was almost intact except for a few amyloid plaques. Ultrastructurally, some of the plaques simulated kuru plaques and others had many degenerated neurites possessing paired helical filaments and other accumulated organelles. GSS has been proposed to include cases with progressive ataxia, dementia and massive multifocal plaques in the brain with or without cerebral spongiform changes.

The current definitions for remission (e.g. a score of </=7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), however, allow for the presence of residual symptoms of depression even if remission is attained. The focus now is on the quality of remission, that is, ensuring a minimum of such residual symptoms, because the consequences of low-quality remission also include impairment in psychosocial functioning. The most common residual symptoms are sleep disturbances, fatigue, and disinterest. Sleep-associated residual symptoms are particularly common, and are a major concern because most current treatments fail to adequately address sleep disturbances and may even aggravate them. Other side effects of current treatments, such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction, may also reduce the quality of remission. A novel approach to the treatment of depression with agomelatine, a melatonergic MT1 and MT2 receptor agonist and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, may be an effective treatment that improves the quality of remission, as it combines good efficacy with positive effects on sleep, neutral effects on sexual function, and a favorable side effect profile."}

Hence the data appeared as 'pairwise' observations for any of the three scales above. The results of the analysis, arising from a rather strict statistical reasoning, can be summarized as follows: (1) The rank correlation coefficient r(s) between: (i) RLS85 and GCS sum score, (ii) RLS85 and E2CS(M), was found to be at a satisfactory level meaning that all three scales indicate almost the same 'ranking order of severity'.

Identifying the problem: Stakeholders unanimously agreed that screening is important, and that universal screening is preferred to targeted approaches. Adapting to the local context: PCPs and MAs agreed that screening should be done annually. Views were mixed regarding the delivery of screening; patients preferred self-administered, tablet-based screening, while MAs and PCPs were divided between self-administered and face-to-face approaches. Assessing barriers: For patients, barriers to screening centered around a perceived lack of rapport with providers, which contributed to concerns about trust, judgment, and privacy. For PCPs and MAs, barriers included lack of comfort, training, and preparedness to address screening results and offer treatment.	Though stakeholders agree on the importance of implementing universal screening, concerns about the patient-provider relationship, the consequences of disclosure, and privacy appear heightened by the rural context.

Susceptibility-weighted imaging research revealed a controversial association of deep medullary veins and LA in vivo, regarding which there are no standard criteria currently. Nevertheless, retinal venous changes had been reported to increase the risk of LA development, providing a novel way for in vivo evaluation. As for the internal jugular vein, jugular venous reflux could double the LA score in aging and modulate circulation of cerebral spinal fluids. Key Messages: Disruption of the venous system was notably associated with LA in aging, AD, and Parkinson's disease post-mortem and in in vivo models. The venous pathological changes may induce cerebral hypoperfusion, drainage system disruption, and vasogenic oedema in the veins around the periventricular white matter. The clarification of VC in LA may provide an early prevention and early treatment strategy for LA patients."}

A 36-year-old man presented with posterior neck pain and myelopathic symptoms. A radiograph demonstrated congenital fusion of the vertebral bodies at C2-3, C4-5 and C5-6. On MRI, the spinal cord was compressed by a protruding cervical disc and bony spurs at C6-7. After anterior discectomy and decompression of the spinal cord at the C6-7 level, the disc was replaced with the Bryan cervical disc system (Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Memphis, TN, USA) to restore normal motion. The absence of adjacent segment degeneration and the preservation of cervical motion were noted 2 years after surgery. Arthroplasty may be performed in selected patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome in order to restore motion and to prevent degeneration of the adjacent segment by reducing hypermobility."}

Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinoma (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one). Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS. We conclude that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of pial spread of metastatic disease in patients with a known primary malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms."}

To explore people with swallowing disorders post-stroke experiences of and acceptability regarding the bolus modification treatment of thickened liquids.	A qualitative, descriptive study exploring the experiences of individuals given TL after their stroke. A purposive sample of 14 adults was obtained with data collection and generation through the medium of individual semi-structured interviews. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.	Three overarching themes of 'uncertainty', 'an unpleasant experience' and 'a trade-off' were identified. These themes highlight that participants disliked TL and this dislike may have impacted clinically in terms of adherence, hydration and quality of life. Lack of sensory appeal was important in framing patient dislike. Participants' involvement in and understanding of reasons for prescription of TL was poor leading to uncertainty regarding the treatment. Notwithstanding, some participants felt it was necessary for their stroke recovery.	TL can be considered a burdensome treatment from multiple perspectives including product palatability, treatment uncertainty and treatment adherence issues. Despite intensely disliking this treatment, some patients ultimately understand why the treatment is prescribed. Improvements in product palatability are required in order to improve adherence and patient quality of life. Consideration of other treatment options and newer products to manage aspiration post-stroke is also warranted."}

However, specific understanding of the roles played, especially the mechanistic and functional roles, by long ncRNAs in AD is still elusive. Using mouse tissue qPCR assays we observe changes in the expression levels of 41 lncRNAs in AD mice of which only 7 genes happen to have both human orthologs and AD associations. Post validation of these 7 human lncRNA genes, MEG3 and MALAT1 shows consistent and significant decrease in AD cell, animal models and human AD brain tissues, but MALAT1 showed a more pronounced decrease. Using bioinformatics, qRT-PCR, RNA FISH and RIP techniques, we could establish MALAT1 as an interactor and regulator of miRs-200a, -26a and -26b, all of which are naturally elevated in AD. We could further show that these miRNAs target the RTK EPHA2 and several of its downstream effectors. Expectedly EPHA2 over expression protects against Aβ1-42 induced cytotoxicity. Transiently knocking down MALAT1 validates these unique regulatory facets of AD at the miRNA and protein levels. Although the idea of sponging of miRNAs by lncRNAs in other pathologies is gradually gaining credibility, this novel MALAT1- miR-200a/26a/26b - EPHA2 regulation mechanism in the context of AD pathophysiology promises to become a significant strategy in controlling the disease."}

Human corpus cavernosum (HCC) tissue was cut into strips of approximately 2 cm and suspended in a cascade bioassay. The strips were then superfused with oxygenated and warmed Krebs solution and precontracted with noradrenaline (3 microM). Glyceryl trinitrate, acetylcholine and histamine were injected as a single bolus in the absence or in the presence of mepyramine and cimetidine. For the in vivo studies, histamine (30-60 micrograms) was injected intracavernously as a single bolus into the right corpus cavernosum 1 cm from the balamo-preputial sulcus. Similar protocols were carried out for papaverine (50 mg). The erectile response was divided into four grades: no response, tumescence, partial and full erection.	In vitro studies demonstrated that histamine (3-100 micrograms) caused dose-dependent relaxation of the HCC strips which was significantly inhibited by cimetidine (5-10 microM). The histamine H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine (1 microM) potentiated histamine-induced relaxation. The co-infusion of both mepyramine and cimetidine did not abolish histamine-induced relaxation. When injected intracavernously in humans, histamine (30 micrograms) caused full erection in 13% of the patients, whereas 87% had partial erection or tumescence. A higher dose of histamine (60 micrograms) caused full erection in 26% of the patients and 74% had partial erection or tumescence. Papaverine induced full erection in the majority of patients (66%). In contrast to papaverine, the duration of erection induced by histamine was markedly shorter (mean 200 and 6.5 min, respectively). The penile erections induced by papaverine were associated with complications such as pain, haematoma and priapism. Histamine did not induce any complications. Treatment of eight male patients with psychogenic impotence with the histamine H1 receptor antagonist astemizol (10 mg orally once daily for 1 week) did not affect histamine-induced erectile responses.	These results indicate that histamine may play a role in human penile erection. The erection-promoting action of histamine is probably due to H2 receptor activation, although another histamine receptor, possibly H3, also seems to be involved. This study suggests that histamine could be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction."}

TBI poses significant risk to the pituitary gland, leading to elevated risks of diabetes, hypopituitarism and other endocrinopathies. Signs and symptoms associated with hypopituitarism often mimic the sequellae of TBI, although the severity of symptoms is not necessarily related to the severity of the injury. Patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may benefit both physically and psychologically from appropriate hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Participants at this unique consensus meeting attempted to define and spearhead an approach to increase awareness of the risks of TBI-induced endocrinopathies, in particular growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and to outline necessary and practical objectives for managing this condition.	Systematic screening of pituitary function is recommended for all patients with moderate-to-severe TBI at risk of developing pituitary deficits. Patients with hypopituitarism benefit from appropriate hormonal replacement and prospects for rehabilitation of patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may be enhanced by appropriate HRT.

However, both share as major genetic risk factor a C9orf72 locus intronic hexanucleotide expansion. The pathogenic pathways associated with the expansion-dependent neuronal toxicity are still poorly understood. Recent efforts to identify common threads of neuronal dysfunction have pointed towards deficits of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis and loss of nucleolar integrity, a condition known as nucleolar stress that is an emerging shared feature among neurodegenerative diseases. Intriguingly, the C9orf72 mutation in ALS-FTD interferes with the function of the nucleolus by transcripts and dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced by the hexanucleotide expansion. Experimental discrepancies have given rise to different hypotheses with regard to the connection of C9orf72 and nucleolar activity. In this review, we present and discuss emerging concepts concerning the impact of C9orf72 expansion on nucleolar biology. Moreover, we discuss the 'nucleolar stress hypothesis,' according to which nucleolar malfunction accompanies, exacerbates, or potentially triggers a degenerative phenotype. Upcoming awareness of the involvement of nucleolar stress in C9orf72 ALS-FTD could shed light into its pathogenesis, enabling potential treatment options aimed at shielding an 'Achilles' heel' of neurons."}

In previous studies, we demonstrated that human brain tumors such as meningiomas, astrocytomas, medulloblastomas, and ependymomas expressed the messenger ribonucleic acid for the PDGF subunits and their receptors. In the present study, we investigated the expression of the messenger ribonucleic acid PDGF A and B chains and the PDGF alpha and beta receptors in 17 cases of oligodendrogliomas.	Measurements of messenger ribonucleic acid levels were obtained using radioactive complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probes. Protein expression was analyzed with specific antibodies.	Sixteen of 17 tumors expressed the PDGF A subunit and all the PDGF alpha receptors. Furthermore, all the tumors expressed PDGF B and PDGF beta receptor subunits.	The results of this study suggest that oligodendrogliomas may have an autocrine loop stimulated by the interaction of PDGF and its receptor simultaneously produced by these tumors."}

Analyses were completed in 2 stages. First, 3 types of variables (screening variables, alcohol-related cognitions, mandated student profile) were examined in a logistic regression model as putative predictors of lower risk drinking (defined as 3 or fewer heavy episodic drinking [HED] episodes and/or 4 or fewer alcohol-related consequences in the past month) 6 weeks following the BA session. Second, we used generalized estimating equations to examine putative moderators of BMI effects on HED and peak blood alcohol content compared with assessment only (AO) control over the 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups.	Participants reporting lower scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, more benefits to changing alcohol use, and those who fit the 'Bad Incident' profile at baseline were more likely to report lower risk drinking 6 weeks after the BA session. Moderation analyses revealed that Bad Incident students who received the BMI reported more HED at 9-month follow-up than those who received AO.

Treatment with stents may be an effective method to treat VADA involving the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and dissection of the dominant vertebral artery (VA). In this article, our personal experience of the treatment of VADAs by using stents and coils is reported.	Since 1998, 26 cases of VADA have been treated by endovascular surgery by the first author. Of these cases, 6 cases were treated using stents, 3 of which were treated using stent and coils, 2 patients were treated using double overlapping stents, and the remaining one patient was treated using a single stent.	In all patients, dissection aneurysms were successfully covered by stents. There was one complication: an intraprocedural rupture during additional coil insertion without neurological deterioration. Follow-up angiography was performed in all 5 surviving patients except for one patient who died due to the severity of his original subarachnoid hemorrhage (mean duration of follow-up angiography 22.8 months, range 15-57 months). Total or subtotal disappearance of the VADA was achieved in all 5 cases. At one year after the treatment, all 5 surviving patients remained clinically stable without any neurological deficit.	Treatment using stents is an effective alternative for the treatment of VA dissecting aneurysms, especially for lesions of the dominant VA or involving the PICA. However, additional coil insertion should be performed very carefully and may be avoided if stagnation of contrast material is achieved after overlapping stenting."}

Yet, it remains unknown whether blood pressure pulsatility (pulse pressure [PP]) causally affects stroke risk independently of the steady pressure component (mean arterial pressure [MAP]). It is further unknown how the effects of MAP and PP on stroke risk vary with age and stroke cause. Using data from UK Biobank (N=408 228; 38-71 years), we selected genetic variants as instruments for MAP and PP at age ≤55 and >55 years and across age deciles. We applied multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses to explore associations with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and their subtypes. Higher genetically predicted MAP was associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage across the examined age spectrum. Independent of MAP, higher genetically predicted PP only at age >55 years was further associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio per-SD-increment, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.13-1.34]). Among subtypes, the effect of genetically predicted MAP on large artery stroke was attenuated, whereas the effect of genetically predicted PP was augmented with increasing age. Genetically predicted MAP, but not PP, was associated with small vessel stroke and deep intracerebral hemorrhage homogeneously across age deciles. Neither genetically predicted MAP nor PP were associated with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Beyond an effect of high MAP at any age on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, our results support an independent causal effect of high PP at older ages on large artery stroke. This finding warrants further investigation for the development of stroke preventive strategies targeting pulsatility in later life."}

However, because of the lack of comprehensive data on the spontaneous background neuropathology of the C57BL/6J strain, discriminating between naturally occurring changes and lesions caused by experimental mutations can be challenging. In this context, this study aims at defining the spectrum and frequency of spontaneous brain changes in a large cohort of C57BL/6J mice and their association with specific biological variables, including age and sex. Brains from 203 experimentally naive and clinically unremarkable C57BL/6J mice were collected and analyzed by means of histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Mice ranged in age from 3 to 110 weeks with 89 females, 111 males, and 3 unknowns. Sixteen different spontaneous lesion categories were described in this cohort. Age-related neurodegenerative and/or neuroinflammatory findings represented the most common pathologic changes and included (1) Hirano-like inclusions in the thalamic neurons, (2) neuroaxonal dystrophy in the medulla oblongata, (3) periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular deposits in the neuropil of the hippocampus, and (4) progressive neuroinflammation characterized by microgliosis and astrogliosis. Neoplastic conditions, developmental abnormalities, and circulatory disorders were rarely observed incidental findings. In conclusion, this study describes spontaneous age-related brain lesions of the C57BL/6J mouse and provides a reference for evaluating and interpreting the neuropathological phenotype in genetically engineered mouse models developed and maintained on this congenic background."}

Results suggested that fewer hours of sleep per night predicted overall autism scores and social skills deficits. Similarly, stereotypic behavior was predicted by fewer hours of sleep per night and screaming during the night. Increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli in the bedroom and screaming at night predicted communication problems. Finally, sensitivity to environmental stimuli in the bedroom also predicted fewer developmental sequence disturbances.

The patient's intolerance of the analyst's efforts to think (reflect upon and interpret) renders the usual psychoanalytic maneuvers employed to stimulate reflective thought ineffective with such patients. Such patients have to learn to tolerate multiple perspectives before they can allow the analyst, or themselves, to think in the other's presence. The author presents two clinical vignettes that illustrate how the analyst's efforts to think about the patient were experienced by the patient as both intolerably distancing and as rejecting of an aspect of the patient's subjective reality. Working psychoanalytically with such patients requires the analyst to forego the use of narrow interpretations that elucidate unconscious meanings and motives in favor of alternate technical maneuvers capable of facilitating the development of symbolic thinking and reflective thought (insightfulness). These maneuvers include a demonstration of the analyst's willingness and ability to withstand (rather than 'interpret away') how he is being psychically represented by the patient, without becoming destroyed by, or lost within, the patient's characterization of him. Beside modeling a tolerance of alternate perspectives of one's self, other non-interpretive maneuvers that help facilitate the development of self-reflective thought include: stimulating the patient's curiosity about the workings of his own mind by identifying incompletely understood behaviors or reactions worthy of greater psychological understanding, and insinuating doubt about the adequacy of the patient's explanations of such phenomena."}

The present work studied the temporal variation of three key antioxidant enzymes in cortex and hippocampus during the development of behavioral and cognitive symptoms in 3xTg-AD mice, and as compared to age-matched controls. At 2 months of age, when no intraneuronal Aβ immunoreactivity has been reported, increased neophobia shown as a delayed and reduced rearing, evidenced the onset of BPSD-like symptoms at premorbid stages of disease. In these animals, NQO1 was found increased in both the hippocampus (800%) and cortex (400%) and progressively diminished at older ages. SOD1 was increased in the hippocampus at 4 months of age, when neuronal Aβ accumulation has been established. These hippocampal increases of antioxidants before the prodromal emergence of cognitive symptoms support their role as defense mechanisms. SIRT1 levels showed opposite age-dependent changes in cortex (increase) and hippocampus (decrease) relative to controls. Prodromal cognitive deficits emerged at 6 months of age, concomitantly to cortical overexpression of SIRT1 but down-regulation of NQO1 and SIRT1 in the hippocampus, suggesting inadequate antioxidative protection to prevent or delay the subjacent neuronal damage.

We review limitations of available research, and discuss novel approaches to overcome previous methodological barriers.	Mechanistic studies suggest a possible association between excess lead, manganese, cadmium, arsenic, or copper, and zinc deficiency, and several biochemical disturbances related to psychosis, such as altered neurotransmitters levels, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Furthermore, studies suggest that some metals (lead, manganese, cadmium excess, and zinc deficiency) are associated with schizophrenia or psychosis-related phenotype. However, previous studies had multiple methodological limitations. Importantly, metal exposure was often measured after disease development and seldom determined during critical developmental periods. Most studies fell short of depicting the exact timing of exposure and the change in exposure over time. Here, we propose several methods to overcome these methodological limitations.	There is a plausible role of early life exposure to metals in the cause of psychosis. Owing to methodological limitations in exposure measurement, this has not been well characterized. Considering the wide exposure to metals and the high cost of psychosis to society, this hypothesis should be rigorously examined."}

Despite significant overlap of symptoms between posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders, the latter has received less attention. Given that dysregulated fear levels characterize anxiety disorders, examining the neural correlates of fear and extinction learning may shed light on the pathogenesis of underlying anxiety disorders.	To investigate the psychophysiological and neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction recall in anxiety disorders and to document how these features differ as a function of multiple diagnoses or anxiety severity.	This investigation was a cross-sectional, case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study at an academic medical center. Participants were healthy controls and individuals with at least 1 of the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder. The study dates were between March 2013 and May 2015.	Two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm.	Skin conductance responses, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses, trait anxiety scores from the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Form, and functional connectivity.	This study included 21 healthy controls (10 women) and 61 individuals with anxiety disorders (36 women). P values reported for the neuroimaging results are all familywise error corrected. Skin conductance responses during extinction recall did not differ between individuals with anxiety disorders and healthy controls (ηp2 = 0.001, P = .79), where ηp2 is partial eta squared. The anxiety group had lower activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction recall (ηp2 = 0.178, P = .02). A similar hypoactive pattern was found during early conditioning (ηp2 = 0.106, P = .009). The vmPFC hypoactivation was associated with anxiety symptom severity (r = -0.420, P = .01 for conditioning and r = -0.464, P = .004 for extinction recall) and the number of co-occuring anxiety disorders diagnosed (ηp2 = 0.137, P = .009 for conditioning and ηp2 = 0.227, P = .004 for extinction recall). Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the fear network connectivity differed between healthy controls and the anxiety group during fear learning (ηp2 range between 0.088 and 0.176 and P range between 0.02 and 0.003) and extinction recall (ηp2 range between 0.111 and 0.235 and P range between 0.02 and 0.002).	Despite no skin conductance response group differences during extinction recall, brain activation patterns between anxious and healthy individuals differed. These findings encourage future studies to examine the conditions longitudinally and in the context of treatment trials to improve and guide therapeutics via advanced neurobiological understanding of each disorder."}

Conventionally, the assessment process relies heavily on clinical experience and lacks quantitative analysis. In order to objectively quantify the upper-limb motor impairments in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis, this study proposes a novel assessment approach based on motor synergy quantification and multi-modality fusion. Fifteen post-stroke hemiparetic patients and fifteen age-matched healthy persons participated in this study. During different goal-directed tasks, kinematic data and surface electromyography(sEMG) signals were synchronously collected from these participants, and then motor features extracted from each modal data could be fed into the respective local classifiers. In addition, kinematic synergies and muscle synergies were quantified by principal component analysis (PCA) and k weighted angular similarity (k WAS) algorithm to provide in-depth analysis of the coactivated features responsible for observable movement impairments. By integrating the outputs of local classifiers and the quantification results of motor synergies, ensemble classifiers can be created to generate quantitative assessment for different modalities separately. In order to further exploit the complementarity between the evaluation results at kinematic and muscular levels, a multi-modal fusion scheme was developed to comprehensively analyze the upper-limb motor function and generate a probability-based function score. Under the proposed assessment framework, three types of machine learning methods were employed to search the optimal performance of each classifier. Experimental results demonstrated that the classification accuracy was respectively improved by 4.86% and 2.78% when the analysis of kinematic and muscle synergies was embedded in the assessment system, and could be further enhanced to 96.06% by fusing the characteristics derived from different modalities. Furthermore, the assessment result of multi-modality fusion framework exhibited a significant correlation with the score of standard clinical tests (R = - 0.87, P = 1.98e - 5). These promising results show the feasibility of applying the proposed method to clinical assessments for post-stroke hemiparetic patients."}

The main reason for pharmacological treatment of FASD children is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and methylphenidate (MPH) is the drug of choice. The aim of the study was to assess whether children born of hPAE with ADHD, with or without morphological FASD, differ in terms of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene polymorphisms, and if genetic predisposition affects response and safety of MPH treatment. The polymorphisms of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) were analyzed in DNA samples.

NTD is associated with impaired folate metabolism. We investigated whether schizophrenia is also linked with a dysfunctional folate metabolism. In addition to the prevalence of the 677C-->T mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, we compared plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations of 35 schizophrenic patients with those of 104 unrelated controls. Schizophrenic patients had significantly lower plasma folate concentrations after adjustment for Hcy levels, and elevated RBC folate levels compared to controls. Vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and Hcy levels did not differ from control values. Plasma folate levels below the 10th percentile of controls were associated with an approximate 4-7-fold (before and after adjustment of folate levels for Hcy, respectively) risk of having schizophrenia. In addition, a significant dose-response relation between plasma folate concentrations and risk for schizophrenia suggested a protective effect by high plasma folate concentrations. Elevated Hcy levels and, in line with this finding, homozygosity for the 677C-->T mutation in the MTHFR gene were not associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia. Evidence is presented suggesting that folate metabolism is disturbed in schizophrenic patients, independently of Hcy."}

The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 112 consecutive patients (53 boys, 59 girls; mean age 10.9 years, range 10 months-21.7 years) with medically intractable epilepsy who underwent invasive monitoring at the Pediatric Epilepsy Center at St. Louis Children's Hospital between January 1994 and July 2005. There were 122 implantation procedures (85 grids and strips, 32 strips only, five grids only, four with additional depth electrodes), with a mean monitoring period of 7.1 days (range 2-21 days). Operative complications included the need for repeated surgery for additional electrode placement (5.7%); wound infection (2.4%); cerebrospinal fluid leak (1.6%); and subdural hematoma, symptomatic pneumocephalus, bone flap osteomyelitis, and strip electrode fracture requiring operative retrieval (one patient [0.8%] each). There were four cases of transient neurological deficit (3.3%) and no permanent deficit or death associated with invasive monitoring.	Placement of subdural grid and strip electrodes for invasive video electroencephalographic monitoring is generally well tolerated in the pediatric population. The authors found that aggressive initial electrode coverage was not associated with higher rates of blood transfusion or perioperative complications, and reduced the frequency of repeated operations for placement of supplemental electrodes."}

Patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery were compared with two different populations used as controls: In comparison with hypertensive patients without stenosis of the internal carotid artery, both arterial diameter and blood flow velocity were reduced, leading to a more pronounced decrease in blood flow; and in comparison with normotensive patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery, common carotid blood flow was more reduced at any degree of stenosis. In a subset of patients, blood flow returned toward normal ranges after endarterectomy. The study suggested that in patients with hypertension without stenosis of the internal carotid artery, the decrease in blood flow is due to a decrease in blood flow velocity with normal arterial diameter despite the elevated blood pressure, and in patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery, blood flow was more reduced than in the normotensive patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery, suggesting that caution must be taken with indications of antihypertensive treatment."}

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether chronic unpredicted stress (CUS) mediated neurological alterations are associated with impaired hippocampal insulin signaling or not, and studied the effect of quercetin in this scenario. Male Swiss albino mice were subjected to 21day CUS, during which 30mg/kg quercetin treatment was given orally. After 21days, behavioral functions were evaluated in terms of locomotor activity (Actophotometer), muscle coordination (Rota-rod), depression (Tail Suspension Test (TST), Forced Swim Test (FST)) and memory performance (Passive-avoidance step-down task (PASD)). Further, hippocampal insulin signaling was evaluated in terms of protein expression of insulin, insulin receptor (IR) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) and neurogenesis was evaluated in terms of doublecortin (DCX) expression. 21day CUS significantly impaired locomotion and had no effect on muscle coordination. Stressed animals were depressed and showed markedly impaired memory functions. Quercetin treatment significantly improvement stress-mediated behavior dysfunction as indicated by improved locomotion, lesser immobility time and greater frequency of upward turning in TST and FST and increased transfer latency on the day 2 (short-term memory) and day 5 (long-term memory) in PASD test. We observed significantly higher IR expression and significantly lower GLUT-4 expression in the hippocampus of stressed animals, despite of nonsignificant difference in insulin levels. Further, chronic stress impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, as indicated by the significantly reduced levels of hippocampal DCX expression. Quercetin treatment significantly lowered insulin and IR expression and significantly enhanced GLUT-4 and DCX expression in the hippocampus, when compared to CUS. In conclusion, quercetin treatment efficiently alleviated stress mediated behavioral dysfunction by modulating hippocampal insulin signaling and neurogenesis."}

While the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) expresses AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8, the lack of SLC6A8 in astrocytes around the blood-brain barrier limits the brain capacity to import creatine from the periphery, and suggests that the CNS has to rely mainly on endogenous creatine synthesis through AGAT and GAMT expression. This seems contradictory with SLC6A8 deficiency, which, despite AGAT and GAMT expression, also leads to creatine deficiency in the CNS. We present novel data showing that in cortical grey matter, AGAT and GAMT are expressed in a dissociated way: e.g. only a few cells co-express both genes. This suggests that to allow synthesis of creatine within the CNS, at least for a significant part of it, guanidinoacetate must be transported from AGAT- to GAMT-expressing cells, possibly through SLC6A8. This would explain the creatine deficiency observed in SLC6A8-deficient patients. By bringing together creatine deficiency syndromes, AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8 distribution in CNS, as well as a synthetic view on creatine and guanidinoacetate levels in the brain, this review presents a comprehensive framework, including new hypotheses, on brain creatine metabolism and transport, both in normal conditions and in case of creatine deficiency."}

Trends for higher risks of brain metastasis were observed with younger age (P = 0.09), and poor performance status (P = 0.07). Brain metastasis risk was highest during the first 10 months, progressively declining thereafter.	Stage III NSCLC patients treated with CRT have high risks of brain metastasis which persist during the first 10 months after diagnosis.

{"pmid": "25380591", "text": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD^\nDownsizing of lean body mass is a key determinant of Alzheimer's disease.^\nLean body mass (LBM) encompasses all metabolically active organs distributed into visceral and structural tissue compartments and collecting the bulk of N and K stores of the human body. Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma protein mainly secreted by the liver within a trimolecular TTR-RBP-retinol complex revealing from birth to old age strikingly similar evolutionary patterns with LBM in health and disease. TTR is also synthesized by the choroid plexus along distinct regulatory pathways. Chronic dietary methionine (Met) deprivation or cytokine-induced inflammatory disorders generates LBM downsizing following differentiated physiopathological processes. Met-restricted regimens downregulate the transsulfuration cascade causing upstream elevation of homocysteine (Hcy) safeguarding Met homeostasis and downstream drop of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) impairing anti-oxidative capacities. Elderly persons constitute a vulnerable population group exposed to increasing Hcy burden and declining H2S protection, notably in plant-eating communities or in the course of inflammatory illnesses. Appropriate correction of defective protein status and eradication of inflammatory processes may restore an appropriate LBM size allowing the hepatic production of the retinol circulating complex to resume, in contrast with the refractory choroidal TTR secretory process. As a result of improved health status, augmented concentrations of plasma-derived TTR and retinol may reach the cerebrospinal fluid and dismantle senile amyloid plaques, contributing to the prevention or the delay of the onset of neurodegenerative events in elderly subjects at risk of Alzheimer's disease."}

Aetiology, post-operative seizure frequency, pre and post-operative cognitive function, long-term complications and re-operation rates were analysed by retrospective examination of clinical records.	Forty-two children were included in our cohort with a median age at surgery of 20 months (range 3-36 months). Surgical procedures comprised 25 functional hemispherectomies, two anatomical hemispherectomies, four multilobar resections, seven lobar resections and four focal resections. 7/42 (17%, 95% CI 8-31%) children underwent re-operation. 20/42 (48%, 95% CI 33-62%) children achieved seizure freedom. 18/42 (43%, 95% CI 29-58) demonstrated an improvement in seizure frequency and no children had an increase in seizure frequency. Post-operative complications included subsequent shunt procedure in 5/25 (20%, 95% CI 9-39%) children undergoing hemispherectomy. There were no mortalities. In 23 children pre- and post-operative DQ or IQ was determinable allowing longitudinal comparison. Five children had a decrease in DQ/IQ >15 and two children had an increase DQ/IQ >15.	Epilepsy surgery in children under 3 years of age offers suitable candidates a good chance of significantly improved seizure outcome which compares with rates in older cohorts."}

Since CARP is induced by pressure overload to the heart, it is proposed to be a genetic marker for cardiac hypertrophy. We recently identified a novel protein, ankyrin repeat protein with PEST and proline-rich region (ARPP), which is homologous to CARP and is preferentially expressed in type 1 skeletal muscle fibers (cf. slow fibers). We also found that both ARPP and CARP expression is induced in experimentally denervated skeletal muscles in mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that their expression may be induced in skeletal muscles in neurodegenerating disease. This work aimed to determine the expression pattern of ARPP and CARP in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).	In this study, we immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of ARPP and CARP in skeletal muscles of 9 ALS cases.	We found that CARP was aberrantly expressed in atrophic skeletal muscle fibers in ALS. Although ARPP-positive fibers were randomly scattered in a checkerboard-like pattern in normal skeletal muscle, this pattern was absent in ALS muscles. Furthermore, we also found that ARPP was expressed in fast myosin heavy chain-positive fibers (cf. type 2 fiber).	These findings suggest that type-specific expression patterns of ARPP and CARP are altered in skeletal muscles of ALS."}

At present, this population demonstrates decreased participation in physical activities and sport compared to peers due to barriers ranging from body function to accessibility challenges. Sport provides culturally relevant opportunities for social integration, community participation and physical activity and has been shown to improve the fitness, self-esteem, confidence and quality of life of children with disabilities.

This randomised, waitlist controlled, assessor blinded, superiority trial with two parallel groups will aim to compare the effectiveness of Sports Stars to standard care across all ICF domains. Children in the Sports Stars group are expected to demonstrate greater improvement in their individually-selected, sports related goals measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. This study will aim to assess sixty ambulant children aged six to 12 years with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Children will be excluded if they have had recent Botox or neurological/orthopaedic surgery.

VFC starts in the precapillaries/capillaries in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) and expands to the granule cell and polymorphic cell layer of the DG, and to the stratum lacunosum/molecular in the CA1 sector. Vasculopathy spreads from the tail to the body and, in a few cases, to the head of the hippocampal formation. Light and electron microscopy reveal thickening of the vascular wall with fibrosis, calcification, and enforcement of the astrocyte interface with vessels with anchorage densities associated with hemidesmosome-like structures. In moderately and severely affected cases, fragmentation and removal of calcified and occluded vessels result in local reduction of vascular network. In two AD subjects, severe vascular calcification extending from the tail to the head of the hippocampal formation was associated with loss of almost all neurons in the CA1 sector and in the subiculum proper, corresponding to hippocampal sclerosis. The topography of affected vessels and the patterns of neuronal loss reflect the middle hippocampal artery distribution with its precapillary/capillary network. The similar prevalence of vasculopathy in the AD group and in the age-matched control group, and the presence of hippocampal VFC in only one subject in the DS cohort, 96% of which is affected by Alzheimer-type pathology, oppose the link between AD and this form of vasculopathy. However, severe VFC affects the pattern of AD pathology locally by deletion of neurofibrillary degeneration and beta-amyloidosis in the CA1 sector, subiculum proper, and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal VFC appears to be a form of vascular pathology with a unique predilection for the middle hippocampal artery and corresponding capillary network, which results in patchy neuronal loss in moderately affected subjects and in almost total neuronal loss in the area of impaired blood supply in severely affected subjects. These observations suggest an etiologic link between hippocampal VFC and hippocampal sclerosis."}

Based on the literature and our earlier findings, we believe that the impairments of overall (not emotion specific) facial expression recognition is associated with a more general, non-specific psychiatric distress. Thus, first it was hypothesized that overall facial expression recognition would be correlated negatively with SCL-90 global severity index (GSI). Our second hypothesis was that the severity of the impairment in facial expression recognition would be correlated with symptom severity measured by the BECK Depression Inventory (BDI).	One hundred and six depressed subjects participated in the study. We used a 'Virtual Human' for presenting the 35 emotional and neutral facial expressions. Subjects filled in the BDI and SCL-90 questionnaires after the facial expression recognition task.	Significant negative association was found between the GSI of SCL-90 and the overall facial expression recognition. Furthermore, significant negative correlation was found between the recognition of happy facial expressions and the depression severity measured by the BDI questionnaire and the SCL-90 depression subscale.	The negative association found between overall facial expression recognition and the GSI score provide empirical support to our first hypothesis, which states that the impairment of not emotion specific, overall facial expression recognition may correlate with a general psychiatric distress. Our findings indicate that those depressed subjects who had higher scores on BDI could recognize happy facial expression at a significantly lower rate. Abnormalities in reward sensitivity may explain this association between happy face recognition difficulties and the severity of depressive symptoms among depressive patients. Consequently, we can conclude that the recognition of happy facial expressions can be a useful tool for monitoring the severity of depression."}

Hereditary polyneuropathy of different types was diagnosed in 28 patients (62%); nine showed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and two showed vasculitic neuropathy. In two more cases polyneuropathy was attributed to toxic agents, while among the rest, one was diagnosed as metachromatic leucodystrophy (juvenile type), one as adrenoleucodystrophy, one as porphyric neuropathy and one as Fabry disease. The high incidence of hereditary neuropathies in teenagers differs from that in adults, but is similar to that encountered in children. In our study, CIDP appears to be a frequent cause of neuropathy in teenagers, while the other causes are broadly similar to those found in studies concerning children rather than adults."}

At least two of the diseases are believed to exhibit a common ground of pathophysiological mechanisms. These are granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). ANCA directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) are preferentially associated with GPA, and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA are associated mainly with MPA and eosinophilic GPA (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). Anti-MPO and anti-PR3 antibodies can activate neutrophils in vitro. In vivo data are available for humans and mice on the pathogenicity of anti-MPO but it is more controversial for PR3-ANCA. A recent genome-wide association study of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitides confirmed the genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of these conditions, with significant association of PR3-ANCA and human leukocyte antigen-DP and the genes encoding α1-antitrypsin and PR3. MPO-ANCA were significantly associated with human leukocyte antigen-DQ. Thus, recent results from epidemiological studies, genome-wide association study and therapeutic trials have suggested that these entities are, in fact, distinct. We have summarised these results and discuss the idea that these two entities should be studied separately as the nature of the two auto-antigens suggests at a molecular level despite shared ANCA involvement."}

Its protective effect has been investigated in oxidative stress related diseases such as cerebral ischemia in recent years. However, experimental evidence also shows that ebselen causes cell death in several different cell types. Whether ebselen will have a beneficial or detrimental effect on cells under ischemic condition is not known. Herein, we studied the effect of ebselen on C6 glioma cells under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro ischemic model. We found that ebselen significantly enhanced cell death after 3 h of OGD as observed by lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cellular morphological changes. Further studies revealed that depletion of cellular glutathione level by the combined action of ebselen and OGD played a role in enhanced cell death as demonstrated by the following evidence: (1) cellular GSH was significantly depleted by the combined effort of ebselen and OGD, compared to that of ebselen or OGD insult alone; (2) exogenous addition of N-acetyl cysteine completely diminished the cell damage induced by ebselen and OGD; (3) supplement of glucose, which provides cellular reducing agents and thus maintains cellular GSH level, to the OGD medium diminished C6 cell damage induced by ebselen. We conclude that depleting cellular glutathione plays an important role in ebselen-induced cell death with OGD. Our results suggest that ebselen can have a beneficial or toxic effect, depending on the availability of GSH."}

Previous studies focused on the relationship between suicide attempts and metabolism in elderly patients with MDD, while ignore the young people. The aim of this study is to find the potential relationship between suicide attempts and metabolism in young patients with MDD to find a way to prevent and ultimately reduce suicide in young patients with MDD.	Cross-sectional design was employed in the study.740 patients aged between 18 and 45 years old with MDD had been consecutively recruited in this study between 2011 and 2017, 128 of whom had suicide attempts. Their serum samples used to monitor fasting blood glucose, serum lipids as well as socio-demographic characteristics were collected. Besides, some clinical scales were also employed to measure symptoms of anxiety, depression and other conditions.	This study indicated that compared with non-suicide attempters, suicide attempters in young patients with MDD showed higher levels of FBG, TC, LDL-C (all p <  0.05) and lower levels of HDL-C(p <  0.001). Further logistic regression analysis suggested that suicide attempts were associated with increased FBG, decreased HDL-C, the course of disease, HAMD scores and obvious anxiety.	Suicide attempts in young patients with MDD may be predicted by metabolic levels in the future. And our findings suggested that the level of FBG and HDL-C can be promising biomarkers to predict the occurrence of this event."}

All patients were studied at the time of the first observation (T0) and after a long follow-up period (T1). At both T0 and T1, each patient underwent: 1) traditional and specific activation techniques during prolonged video-EEG monitoring to detect possible inducing factors; 2) neuropsychological evaluations during video-EEG monitoring either with eyes closed or eyes open to detect any transient cognitive impairment (TCI); 3) detailed neuropsychological assessment without simultaneous EEG recording, to detect any stable cognitive impairment (SCI).	EEG recordings showed transient, generalized paroxysms in one case and a continuous epileptic activity triggered by eye closure in the other two cases, at both T0 and T1. In all patients, no particular epileptiform discharge-induced factors were identified except for eye blinking (spontaneous, voluntary or induced by corneal reflex). The results of neuropsychological assessment while eyes were closed as compared to performances with eyes open, showed no significant differences at T0 or at T1 in two cases, thus possibly indicating the absence of TCI. Wechsler Intelligence Scales showed a decrease in performance at T1 in the two patients with eye closure-induced, continuous epileptiform activity. Detailed neuropsychological assessment without EEG recordings demonstrated an impairment of facial recognition ability in all three patients at T1.	The lack of any differences between the results of neuropsychological tests performed with eyes open and eyes closed in two patients might suggest that not all eye-closure-triggered paroxysms are associated with TCI. On the other hand, our data highlight that EC-triggered, EEG epileptic discharges can produce long-lasting neuropsychological and behavioural effects, and also indicate that EEG discharges recurring over time might exert a disruptive effect on cognitive functions. Our three patients showed extreme variability across the neuropsychological tasks except for a facial recognition deficit that was evident in all cases, thus suggesting a possible dysfunction of temporo-occipital brain structures and/or of the fusiform face area as recently demonstrated by combined fMRI/EEG studies in patients with fixation-off sensitivity."}

We evaluated the association of general obesity measured by BMI, and abdominal obesity measured by WHtR with 1-year all-cause mortality, recurrence of stroke and combined vascular events of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients in a cohort -- the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III). Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were performed to investigate the association between obesity and clinical outcomes.	A total of 14,146 patients with ischemic stroke were included. When BMI was used as a measure of obesity, compared to the normal weight patients, mortality decreased in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.91], P = 0.0035) and obese patients (HR 0.54 [0.40-0.73], P < 0.0001); and increased in underweight patients (HR 2.55 [1.75-3.73], P < 0.0001). After adjustment for confounding factors, the protective effect of obesity and overweight disappeared. BMI had no association with recurrence of stroke or combined vascular events.

CART analyses suggested interactions with several clinical predictors. Haplotype analyses further supported a contribution of this polymorphism in TESI. The TPH2 rs1386494 (C/T) polymorphism might contribute to the genetic background of TESI. This polymorphism has been previously associated with committed suicide and major depressive disorder.

When injected into C57BL/6J mice, MPTP penetrates into the brain and is converted to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP[+]) by monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B in astrocytes. MPP[+] has high affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) on dopaminergic neurons, and is taken up into the cell to cause cell death. There have been relatively few researches on the acute MPTP toxicity to embryonic or newborn mice. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the influence of MPTP and MPP[+] on embryonic and newborn mice by measuring sequential changes in major indexes of MPTP toxicity and MPTP metabolism; levels of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), DAT, MAO-A and MAO-B. In addition, we measured the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in the brain of newborn mice. A single injection of MPTP and MPP[+] reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, in the brain of newborn mice about 6-12 hr after the injection. Similarly the levels of mRNAs and proteins of DAT and TH were lowered in the brain of embryonic and newborn mice as well. The levels of these indexes were generally recovered at 24 hr after injection, indicating that the neurotoxicity induced by a single injection of MPTP or MPP[+] is temporary and recoverable in embryonic and newborn mice. By contrast, no significant changes in the expression levels of MAO-A and MAO-B were observed in either MPTP- or MPP[+]-treated mice."}

Two probes are activated intermittently, recording eight averaged Doppler-shifted spectra from each probe sequentially. Concurrent recordings of blood velocity in both middle cerebral arteries were performed during 25 selective iohexol carotid angiography runs in 13 patients with near normal cerebral vasculature. The technique permitted the differentiation between the specific responses confined to the recipient vascular bed, and the general responses occurring in remote brain areas as well. The specific response to iohexol was biphasic; a significant decrease in blood velocity occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, probably due to the high viscocity of iohexol. Between 4 and 12 s. blood velocity was significantly increased, reflecting the cerebrovascular response to hypertonic solutions. The blood velocity on the opposite side increased from less than 4 s through 45 s after iohexol. This concurs with studies using electromagnetic flowmetry, and suggests that these general responses are elicited by anxiety, discomfort and pain. Thus, no general responses were seen during angiography under general anaesthesia. Eight patients investigated during catheter flushing with normal saline showed a biphasic specific response reciprocal to that due to iohexol. A significant blood velocity peak occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, followed by a decrease between 4 and 60 s.

Consensus on the term cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) has been reached. The exact pathogenesis of CMS remains unclear. Recently, attention was drawn to the hypothesis that thermal injury might be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of CMS. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography was found to visualize the damage to relevant pathways that are associated with persistent impairments after recovery of CMS. There is still no established treatment for CMS to date.	By reaching a consensus on terminology and description of CMS, a firm basis has been created for future research. The pathogenesis of CMS seems multifactorial and important risk factors have been found. However, CMS cannot be effectively prevented yet and no established or specific treatment is available, apart from very general rehabilitation and cognitive interventions."}

LRRK2 encodes a large multi-domain protein with GTPase and kinase activity. Initial data indicates that an intact functional GTPase domain is critically required for LRRK2 kinase activity. PD-associated mutations in LRRK2, including the most common G2019S variant, have variable effects on enzymatic activity but commonly alter neuronal process morphology. The mechanisms underlying the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of LRRK2 GTPase and kinase activity, and the pathogenic effects of familial mutations, are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a novel functional interaction between LRRK2 and ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 1 (ArfGAP1). LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 interact in vitro in mammalian cells and in vivo in brain, and co-localize in the cytoplasm and at Golgi membranes. PD-associated and functional mutations that alter the GTPase activity of LRRK2 modulate the interaction with ArfGAP1. The GTP hydrolysis activity of LRRK2 is markedly enhanced by ArfGAP1 supporting a role for ArfGAP1 as a GTPase-activating protein for LRRK2. Unexpectedly, ArfGAP1 promotes the kinase activity of LRRK2 suggesting a potential role for GTP hydrolysis in kinase activation. Furthermore, LRRK2 robustly and directly phosphorylates ArfGAP1 in vitro. Silencing of ArfGAP1 expression in primary cortical neurons rescues the neurite shortening phenotype induced by G2019S LRRK2 overexpression, whereas the co-expression of ArfGAP1 and LRRK2 synergistically promotes neurite shortening in a manner dependent upon LRRK2 GTPase activity. Neurite shortening induced by ArfGAP1 overexpression is also attenuated by silencing of LRRK2. Our data reveal a novel role for ArfGAP1 in regulating the GTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of LRRK2; reciprocally, LRRK2 phosphorylates ArfGAP1 and is required for ArfGAP1 neuronal toxicity. ArfGAP1 may represent a promising target for interfering with LRRK2-dependent neurodegeneration in familial and sporadic PD."}

Drawing from a growing, but limited, literature on the topic, we outline a process map for identifying and troubleshooting barriers to care in this at-risk population.	Young adults with ADHD frequently lack the organizational skills, time management, prioritization, and persistence to manage their health care at an expected level of adult independence. These difficulties are compounded by a health-care system that has less time or fewer resources for supporting young adult patients.	Recommendations for easing the transition from pediatric to adult care for late adolescents with ADHD include heavily leveraging the doctor-patient relationship, and capturing the young adult's attention through technologies that already absorb them."}

We used human Tau purified from yeast models to generate new monoclonal antibodies, of which three were further characterized. The first antibody, ADx201, binds the Tau proline-rich region independently of the phosphorylation status, whereas the second, ADx215, detects an epitope formed by the Tau N terminus when Tau is not phosphorylated at Tyr(18). For the third antibody, ADx210, the binding site could not be determined because its epitope is probably conformational. All three antibodies stained tangle-like structures in different brain sections of THY-Tau22 transgenic mice and Alzheimer patients, and ADx201 and ADx210 also detected neuritic plaques in the cortex of the patient brains. In hippocampal homogenates from THY-Tau22 mice and cortex homogenates obtained from Alzheimer patients, ADx215 consistently stained specific low order Tau oligomers in diseased brain, which in size correspond to Tau dimers. ADx201 and ADx210 additionally reacted to higher order Tau oligomers and presumed prefibrillar structures in the patient samples. Our data further suggest that formation of the low order Tau oligomers marks an early disease stage that is initiated by Tau phosphorylation at N-terminal sites. Formation of higher order oligomers appears to require additional phosphorylation in the C terminus of Tau. When used to assess Tau levels in human cerebrospinal fluid, the antibodies permitted us to discriminate patients with Alzheimer disease or other dementia like vascular dementia, indicative that these antibodies hold promising diagnostic potential."}

Before entering the ciliary compartment, IFT complexes and transported cargoes accumulate at or near the base of the cilium. The spatial organization of IFT proteins at the cilia base is key for understanding cilia formation and function. Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and computational averaging, we show that seven TZ, nine IFT, three Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and one centrosomal protein, form 9-clustered rings at the cilium base of a ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In the axial dimension, analyzed TZ proteins localize to a narrow region of about 30 nm while IFT proteins dock approximately 80 nm proximal to TZ. Moreover, the IFT-A subcomplex is positioned peripheral to the IFT-B subcomplex and the investigated BBS proteins localize near the ciliary membrane. The positioning of the HA-tagged N- and C-termini of the selected proteins enabled the prediction of the spatial orientation of protein particles and likely cargo interaction sites. Based on the obtained data, we built a comprehensive 3D-model showing the arrangement of the investigated ciliary proteins."}

For the commercial capsule, a complex formulation is used to maintain the acidic microenvironment required for maximal absorption. Consequently, its efficacy and safety are similar with or without concomitant intake of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). A simplified DE tablet formulation was developed and tested in two studies. One investigated bioequivalence (BE) of the novel DE tablet versus the commercial DE capsule. The other investigated DE bioavailability (BA) under pretreatment with the PPI rabeprazole and assessed the effect of elevated pH on exposure to dabigatran.	BE of the novel DE tablet versus the DE capsule was assessed in a randomized two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence crossover study (NCT03070171). The effect of rabeprazole on the BA of the DE tablet was assessed in an open-label, single-arm study (NCT03143166). Both studies were conducted at sites in Japan. Participants were healthy male volunteers, aged ≥ 20-40 years. In the BE study, participants received the DE tablet or capsule (single oral dose, 110 mg); primary endpoints were area under the concentration-time curve from baseline to the last quantifiable data point (AUC0-tz) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of unconjugated dabigatran. In the relative BA study, participants received the DE tablet (single oral dose, 110 mg) with or without rabeprazole pretreatment (once daily for 5 days, 20 mg); primary endpoints were AUC0-tz and Cmax of total dabigatran.	In total, 160 participants were randomized in the BE study; 36 participants were enrolled in the BA study. The 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean (gMean) ratios for AUC0-tz (101.4-116.0%) and Cmax (101.8-116.6%) of unconjugated dabigatran were within pre-defined acceptance criteria for BE. In the relative BA study, the gMeans of AUC0-tz (667 to 192 ng h/mL) and Cmax (83.1 to 21.8 ng/mL) were decreased by approximately 70% when the tablet was administered under rabeprazole pretreatment. The reduction in BA was observed at a mean gastric pH of 5.3. Treatment was well tolerated; no deaths, serious adverse events (AEs) or significant AEs were reported in either study.	The DE tablet demonstrated BE to the capsule; however, at high gastric pH, BA of the tablet was reduced by approximately 70%, which may lead to reduced efficacy. Data indicate the importance of examining not only BE under standard conditions, but relative BA at elevated gastric pH. Such investigations may avoid the reduced BA at elevated pH that is quite common in the target population (the elderly and/or patients treated with gastric-acid modifying co-medications), and therefore reduce treatment failure with DE.

A measure of state anxiety is essential in some clinical and experimental research and it is often very useful in clinical practice. Whilst existing measures are satisfactory for some purposes, none adequately assesses the psychological, somatic and behavioural components of anxiety. The measurement of trait anxiety is also important in some clinical research and as part of the assessment of selected patients. In some circumstances, self report measures of trait anxiety should be used in conjunction with a measure of social desirability. Patients who score low both on trait anxiety and social desirability may respond differently to experimental stressors from those who score low on trait anxiety and high on social desirability. This may have a number of implications, for example in the area of psychoimmunology.

During early brain development 5-HT modulates morphogenetic activities, such as neural differentiation, axon outgrowth, and synaptic modeling. In the adult brain, midbrain raphe serotonergic neurons project to a variety of brain regions and modulate a wide range of physiological functions. Several lines of evidence indicate that genetically determined variability in serotonergic gene expression, as it has been documented for the 5-HT transporter, influences temperamental traits and may lead to psychopathological conditions with increased anxiety, depression, and aggression. Investigation of the regulation of serotonergic gene transcription and its impact on neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis spur interest to identify serotonergic gene-related molecular factors underlying disease states and to develop more effective antidepressant treatment strategies. Gene targeting strategies have increasingly been integrated into investigations of brain function and along with the fading dogma of a limited capacity of neurons for regeneration and reproducibility, it is realized that gene transfer techniques using efficient viral vectors in conjunction with neuron-selective transcriptional control systems may also be applicable to complex disorders of the brain. Given the fact that the 5-HT system continues to be an important target for drug development and production, novel strategies aiming toward the modification of 5-HT function at the level of gene expression are likely to be exploited by enterprises participating actively in the introduction of alternative therapeutic approaches."}

It has been suggested that in those cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) could be an option. This review summarizes the scientific literature on ECT for agitation and aggression in dementia.	We performed a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Two reviewers extracted the following data from the retrieved articles: number of patients and their age, gender, diagnoses, types of problem behavior, treatments tried before ECT, specifications of the ECT treatment, use of rating scales, treatment results, follow-up data, and adverse effects.	The initial search yielded 264 articles, 17 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, one was a prospective cohort study, one was a case-control study, and the others were retrospective chart reviews, case series, or case reports. Clinically significant improvement was observed in the majority (88%) of the 122 patients described, often early in the treatment course. Adverse effects were most commonly mild, transient, or not reported.	The reviewed articles suggest that ECT could be an effective treatment for severe and treatment-refractory agitation and aggression in dementia, with few adverse consequences.

Since impaired striatal maturation has been implicated in several mouse models for NDDs, we studied the importance of UBE3A in striatal maturation. We used inducible Ube3a mouse models to investigate the maturation of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from dorsomedial striatum. MSNs of mutant mice matured properly till postnatal day 15 (P15) but remained hyperexcitable with fewer excitatory synaptic events at later ages, indicative of stalled striatal maturation in Ube3a mice.

HD patients develop progressive motor dysfunction and psychiatric disturbances with gradual dementia. HD is caused by a pathological expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene that codifies for a protein called huntingtin (Htt), which principal function is not completely understood. Accumulative evidence shows that this pathological expansion modifies Htt function affecting different neuronal targets, including mitochondrial function which is an important factor that contributes to HD. Interestingly, several groups have shown mitochondrial disturbances including calcium handling defects, depolarization, decrease of mitochondrial transport, ATP reduction, and increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cellular and murine HD models. Systematic analysis of this evidence indicates that a mitochondrial structure, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), could be responsible for these changes that affect mitochondria. The mPTP plays an important role in apoptosis and neurodegeneration. It has also been reported to have some physiological functions in heart development and synaptic communication. In HD, the presence of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) activates this mechanism producing a significant compromise of mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetics. Considering these findings this review explores the evidence that suggests the important role of mPTP in the mitochondrial impairment induced by mHtt, which leads to calcium derangement and contributes to neuronal dysfunction in HD."}

In the first follow-up series, borderline psychopathology was associated with higher levels of psychiatric service use (emergency, daycare, and inpatient). Markov analyses indicated that the transition between levels of psychiatric service use followed a stationary, second order process (i.e. the immediate past and current service use, predicted use on the next follow-up, and the relationship did not depend on the point in time examined in the follow-up series). Further, the transition probabilities generated from this model did not depend significantly on diagnosis.

An open-label, conversion study was conducted, consisting of a 2-week LTG-IR Baseline Phase, followed by a 2-week LTG-XR Treatment Phase and a 1-week LTG-IR Phase. Forty-four subjects (> or =13 years of age) were enrolled and grouped as metabolically neutral (15), induced (15), or inhibited (14) based on the effects of the concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the clearance of LTG. The primary outcome was LTG PK parameters upon conversion. Secondary outcomes included seizure frequency, adverse events, and subject's preference.	LTG-XR and LTG-IR regimens were similar with respect to area under curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC (0-24)), apart from the induced group, where the AUC (0-24) of LTG-XR was on average 21% lower than for LTG-IR. A reduction in the LTG Cmax was observed for LTG-XR compared to LTG-IR resulting in a decrease in the peak-to-trough fluctuation in serum LTG concentrations. The steady-state, dose-normalized, trough concentrations for LTG-XR were similar to those of LTG-IR. The median time to peak concentration (Tmax) following administration of LTG-XR ranged from 4 to 6 h, 6 to 10 h, and 9 to 11 h in the induced, neutral, and inhibited groups, respectively. In comparison, the median Tmax following administration of LTG-IR was between 1 and 1.5 h.	Trough concentrations of LTG can be maintained on conversion from twice-daily LTG-IR to once-daily LTG-XR at the same total daily dose."}

For each study, we processed and analyzed transcriptomic data to obtain a functional profile of pathways and biological functions and then integrated the resulting data by meta-analysis to characterize any sex-based transcriptomic differences associated with AUD. Global results of the transcriptomic analysis revealed the association of decreased tissue regeneration, embryo malformations, altered intracellular transport, and increased rate of RNA and protein replacement with female AUD patients.

As such, onabotulinumtoxinA is the only prophylactic therapy specifically approved for chronic migraine. Most headache clinicians would agree that acute episodic migraine and chronic migraine differ in their pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and response to pharmacological as well as nonpharmacological therapies. Of the 7 botulinum neurotoxin serotypes, botulinum neurotoxin type A (onabotulinumtoxinA) has been the most thoroughly investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. Based on preclinical studies, onabotulinumtoxinA is known to inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from both motor and sensory neurons by preventing vesicle fusion to the cell membrane. In addition to the well-documented myorelaxant effects of this neurotoxin, onabotulinumtoxinA can exert a direct analgesic effect that likely involves inhibition of primary and secondary nociceptive neurons. The inhibitory effects of onabotulinumtoxinA are also likely to involve suppressing the activity of myogenic trigger points and decreasing the persistent nociceptive barrage that promotes and maintains central sensitization. This article describes possible mechanisms to explain how onabotulinumtoxinA functions as a therapy for chronic migraine and considers why treatment with the neurotoxin is not effective in some chronic migraineurs."}

Although neuronal primary cilia are not directly involved in synaptic communication, their pathophysiological impacts on obesity and mental disorders are well recognized. In contrast, research on astrocytic primary cilia lags far behind. Currently, little is known about their functions and molecular pathways in the mature brain. Unlike neurons, postnatal astrocytes retain the capacity of cell division and can become reactive and proliferate in response to various brain insults such as epilepsy, ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative β-amyloid plaques. Since primary cilia derive from the mother centrioles, astrocyte proliferation must occur in coordination with the dismantling and ciliogenesis of astrocyte cilia.

It was hypothesized that DVP in combination with quetiapine would be more effective than DVP alone for treating mania associated with adolescent bipolar disorder. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that quetiapine would be well tolerated.	Thirty manic or mixed bipolar I adolescents (12-18 years) received an initial DVP dose of 20 mg/kg and were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of combination therapy with quetiapine, which was titrated to 450 mg/day (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15). Primary efficacy measures were change from baseline to endpoint in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score and YMRS response rate. Safety and tolerability were assessed weekly.	The DVP + quetiapine group demonstrated a statistically significantly greater reduction in YMRS scores from baseline to endpoint than the DVP + placebo group (F(1,27) = 5.04, p =.03). Moreover, YMRS response rate was significantly greater in the DVP + quetiapine group than in the DVP + placebo group (87% versus 53%; Fisher exact test, p =.05). No significant group differences from baseline to endpoint in safety measures were noted. Sedation, rated as mild or moderate, was significantly more common in the DVP + quetiapine group than in the DVP + placebo group.	The findings of this study indicate that quetiapine in combination with DVP is more effective for the treatment of adolescent bipolar mania than DVP alone. In addition, the results suggest that quetiapine is well tolerated when used in combination with DVP for the treatment of mania."}

However, there are reasons to believe that TDM may play a useful role in maximising the therapeutic potential of new anticonvulsants. In fact, these drugs have a narrow therapeutic index, careful individualisation of dosage to optimise response is required, and inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic variability may translate into differences in dosage requirements. The wide interindividual variability in the serum concentrations at which therapeutic and toxic effects of these drugs are observed does not necessarily imply that TDM cannot be useful: indeed, a marked pharmacodynamic variability has also been reported for all the currently monitored older anticonvulsants. The new anticonvulsants which, based on their properties, are particularly attractive candidates for TDM include lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, zonisamide and felbamate. However, in the absence on sound information on the target concentration ranges of these drugs, the routine concentration monitoring of these drugs cannot be recommended. Despite this, serial measurements of serum drug concentrations may be useful in selected patients, especially those suspected of poor compliance and those in whom pharmacokinetic changes caused by disease or administration of concomitant medication are anticipated. Even in the presence of marked interindividual pharmacodynamic variability, it is often possible to empirically determine the concentration at which each patient exhibits the best response, and apply that information in subsequent management. Prospective studies, using preferably a randomised concentration-controlled design, are necessary to better characterise concentration-effect relationships for these agents."}

Uncertainties remain whether there is a single underlying mechanism for visual hallucinations or they have different disease-dependent causes. However, irrespective of mechanism, visual hallucinations are difficult to treat. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded a research programme to investigate visual hallucinations in the key and high burden areas of eye disease, dementia and Parkinson's disease, culminating in a workshop to develop a unified framework for their clinical management. Here we summarise the evidence base, current practice and consensus guidelines that emerged from the workshop.Irrespective of clinical condition, case ascertainment strategies are required to overcome reporting stigma. Once hallucinations are identified, physical, cognitive and ophthalmological health should be reviewed, with education and self-help techniques provided. Not all hallucinations require intervention but for those that are clinically significant, current evidence supports pharmacological modification of cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic systems, or reduction of cortical excitability. A broad treatment perspective is needed, including carer support. Despite their frequency and clinical significance, there is a paucity of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial evidence where the primary outcome is an improvement in visual hallucinations. Key areas for future research include the development of valid and reliable assessment tools for use in mechanistic studies and clinical trials, transdiagnostic studies of shared and distinct mechanisms and when and how to treat visual hallucinations."}

Overall, medication non-adherence explained a large amount of how violently participants behaved toward others. Since non-adherence was independent of poor insight, it may be more worthwhile for clinicians to develop treatment strategies to target medication adherence without directly addressing an elusive target such as insight into illness. Treatment addressing medication adherence needs to concomitantly target substance use behaviors since the latter was responsible for a substantial increase in ODV."}

The work presented here extends studies of spontaneous cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury to the role of rehabilitative strategies on cortical reorganization. We use a complete spinal transection model to focus on cortical reorganization in response to serotonergic (5-HT) pharmacotherapy without any confounding effects from spared fibers left after partial lesions. 5-HT pharmacotherapy has previously been shown to improve behavioral outcome after SCI but the effect on cortical organization is unknown. After a complete spinal transection in the adult rat, 5-HT pharmacotherapy produced more reorganization in the sensorimotor cortex than would be expected by transection alone. This reorganization was dose dependent, extended into intact (forelimb) motor cortex, and, at least in the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex, followed a somatotopic arrangement. Animals with the greatest behavioral outcome showed the greatest extent of cortical reorganization suggesting that the reorganization is likely to be in response to both direct effects of 5-HT on cortical circuits and indirect effects in response to the behavioral improvement below the level of the lesion."}

The ICICLE-PD study was established to define the characteristics and prevalence of cognitive change soon after diagnosis, in a representative cohort of patients, using a multimodal approach. Specifically, we tested the 'Dual Syndrome' hypothesis for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, which distinguishes an executive syndrome (affecting the frontostriatal regions due to dopaminergic deficits) from a posterior cortical syndrome (affecting visuospatial, mnemonic and semantic functions related to Lewy body pathology and secondary cholinergic loss). An incident Parkinson's disease cohort (n = 168, median 8 months from diagnosis to participation) and matched control group (n = 85) were recruited to a neuroimaging study at two sites in the UK. All participants underwent clinical, neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments. The three neuroimaging tasks (Tower of London, Spatial Rotations and Memory Encoding Tasks) were designed to probe executive, visuospatial and memory encoding domains, respectively. Patients were also genotyped for three polymorphisms associated with cognitive change in Parkinson's disease and related disorders: (i) rs4680 for COMT Val158Met polymorphism; (ii) rs9468 for MAPT H1 versus H2 haplotype; and (iii) rs429358 for APOE-ε2, 3, 4. We identified performance deficits in all three cognitive domains, which were associated with regionally specific changes in cortical activation. Task-specific regional activations in Parkinson's disease were linked with genetic variation: the rs4680 polymorphism modulated the effect of levodopa therapy on planning-related activations in the frontoparietal network; the MAPT haplotype modulated parietal activations associated with spatial rotations; and APOE allelic variation influenced the magnitude of activation associated with memory encoding. This study demonstrates that neurocognitive deficits are common even in recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease, and that the associated regional brain activations are influenced by genotype. These data further support the dual syndrome hypothesis of cognitive change in Parkinson's disease. Longitudinal data will confirm the extent to which these early neurocognitive changes, and their genetic factors, influence the long-term risk of dementia in Parkinson's disease. The combination of genetics and functional neuroimaging provides a potentially useful method for stratification and identification of candidate markers, in future clinical trials against cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease."}

Semi-structured interviews of between 40 and 60 min were conducted with three men and one woman, with spinal injuries at C7 or higher, within 6 months of discharge from inpatient spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. Data were subject to an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).	Participants described their injuries as more than a biological impairment that limited certain functional abilities. For them, SCI was a sudden event that also disrupted one's 'life biography'. Interviews uncovered three key themes essential to an individual's ability to restore feelings of self-agency and biographical continuity: The importance of information, regaining control, and restoring a sense of personal narrative.	Findings from studies using IPA have much to contribute to discussion and debate at the level of rehabilitation theory and can guide future research directions. The findings of the present study support a growing body of literature that argues that rehabilitation research needs to focus more intensely on the biographical disruption caused by SCI. Implications for Rehabilitation Participants in the present study experienced a significant disruption to their biographical narratives following a SCI as they entered an unknown and uncertain world. The findings from the present study provide an evidence-base that is best applied to discussion regarding psychosocial adjustment at the level rehabilitation theory. The concepts of identity and biographical disruption are appearing more frequently in qualitative literature and both merit further investigation to assess their prevalence among the wider SCI populations."}

However, the specific contribution of the cerebellum to the DMN abnormalities remains unclear in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients. Forty-six unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients and 46 healthy controls were recruited for a resting-state scan. The images were analyzed using the functional connectivity (FC) method. The siblings showed significantly increased FCs between the left Crus I and the left superior medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), as well as between the lobule IX and the bilateral MPFC (orbital part) and right superior MPFC compared with the controls. No significantly decreased FC was observed in the siblings relative to the controls. The analyses were replicated in 49 first-episode, drug-naive patients with schizophrenia, and the results showed that the siblings and the patients shared increased FCs between the left Crus I and the left superior MPFC, as well as between the lobule IX and the left MPFC (orbital part) compared with the controls. These findings suggest that increased cerebellar-DMN connectivities emerge earlier than illness onset, which highlight the contribution of the cerebellum to the DMN alterations in unaffected siblings.

In families without access to paid help with childcare, the child's ordinal position, maternal employment, the mother's recall of parenting by her own mother and the reasons for choosing the type of childcare were also associated with variations in grandparent care. Grandparent care was associated with some elevated rates of hyperactivity and peer difficulties at age 4, but these were largely attributable to variations in the types of families using grandparent care.

However, it is unknown whether a caspase-1 inhibitor can modify apoptotic neuronal damage incurred during transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) and whether intranasal administration of a caspase-1 inhibitor is an effective treatment following GCI. The present study was conducted to examine the potential efficiency of post-ischemic intranasal administration of the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK in a 4-vessel occlusion model of GCI in the rat. Herein, we show that intranasal Boc-D-CMK readily penetrated the central nervous system, subsequently inhibiting caspase-1 activity, decreasing mitochondrial dysfunction, and attenuating caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway in ischemia-vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region. Further investigation regarding the mechanisms underlying Boc-D-CMK's neuroprotective effects revealed marked inhibition of reactive gliosis, as well as reduction of the neuroinflammatory response via inhibition of the downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal Boc-D-CMK post-treatment also significantly enhanced the numbers of NeuN-positive cells while simultaneously decreasing the numbers of TUNEL-positive and PARP1-positive cells in hippocampal CA1. Correspondingly, behavioral tests showed that deteriorations in spatial learning and memory performance, and long-term recognition memory following GCI were significantly improved in the Boc-D-CMK post-treated animals. In summary, the current study demonstrates that the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK coordinates anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions to attenuate neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region following GCI. Furthermore, our data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 is a promising neuroprotective strategy to target ischemic neuronal injury and functional deficits following transient GCI."}

A similar but less pronounced decrease was registered in the clinically unaffected parents of the sick children and in their siblings but never in any genetically unrelated control. Results consistent with these observations were obtained in the blood, hypothalamus and sperm of two of the established mouse models of ASD: valproic acid-treated animals and Cc2d1a[+/-] heterozygotes. In both instances, the same characteristic miRNA profile was evidenced in the affected individuals and inherited together with disease symptoms in the progeny of crosses with healthy animals. The consistent association of these genetic regulatory changes with the disease provides a starting point for evaluating the changes in the activity of the target genes and, thus, the underlying mechanism(s). From the applied societal and medical perspectives, once properly confirmed in large cohorts, these observations provide tools for the very early identification of affected children and progenitors."}

Antemortem hippocampal and amygdalar volumes increased from low to intermediate to high likelihood DLB (p < 0.001, trend test). Smaller hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were associated with higher Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage (p < 0.001).

To evaluate suspected abnormal events, primary care physicians must first be familiar with normal behaviors, movements and breathing patterns. Abnormal nocturnal events can then be categorized as nocturnal seizure, parasomnia, sleep-related movement disorder or sleep-related breathing disorder. Diagnoses in the above categories can be made clinically; however, it is important to know when to refer for additional evaluation. Comprehensive literature review was undertaken of nocturnal and sleep-related disorders. This guide reviews nocturnal seizures, normal and abnormal nonepileptic movements and behaviors, discusses broad indications for referral for electroencephalography (EEG) or polysomnography (PSG), and guides counseling and management for patients and their families, ultimately aiding in interpretation of both findings and prognosis. Epilepsy syndromes can result in seizures during sleep or adjacent periods of wakefulness. Parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders tend to also occur in childhood and may be distinguished clinically. Referral to additional specialists for specific studies including EEG or PSG can be necessary, while other times a knowledgeable and vigilant clinician can contribute to a prompt diagnosis based on clinical features. Nocturnal events often can be managed with parental reassurance and watchful waiting, but treatment or evaluation may be needed. Sleep-related breathing disorders are important to recognize as they present very differently in children than in adults and early intervention can be life-saving. This review should allow both primary and subspecialty non-neurologic pediatric and adolescent health care providers to better utilize EEG and PSG as part of a larger comprehensive clinical approach, distinguishing and managing both epileptic and nonepileptic nocturnal disorders of concern while fostering communication across providers to facilitate and coordinate better holistic long-term care of pediatric and adolescent patients."}

Overall, 33 patients with organic erectile dysfunction underwent penile implant surgery during the study period. The Titan OTR inflatable penile implants were inserted using a penoscrotal approach. Patient and partner satisfaction was assessed with the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) questionnaire.	One implant was removed because of infection, and three patients underwent revision surgery due to problems with autoinflation, deflation, and a displaced reservoir, respectively. In all cases the problems were solved and the implants were salvaged. Further complications included one patient with haematoma and sustained scrotal pain, one patient with meatal stenosis, and four patients with infections not related to the implant. In total, 30 EDITS questionnaires were administered and 26 (87%) were completed. Twenty-two patients (85%) reported being satisfied with the implant and two (8%) were dissatisfied. Twenty-four patients (92%) would recommend a penile implant to someone with a similar medical condition. Eighteen patients (72%) believed that their partner was satisfied with the implant.

In addition, ocular pain following corneal injury is frequently observed in clinic. The aim of the study was to characterize the peripheral and central neuroinflammatory process in the trigeminal pathways in response to cornea alteration induced by chronic topical instillations of 0.2% benzalkonium chloride (BAC) in male C57BL/6J mice. In vitro BAC induced neurotoxicity and increases neuronal (FOS, ATF3) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6) markers in primary mouse trigeminal ganglion culture. BAC-treated mice exhibited 7days after the treatment reduced aqueous tear production and increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the cornea. Hypertonic saline-evoked eye wipe behavior was enhanced in BAC-treated animals that exhibited increased FOS, ATF3 and Iba1 immunoreactivity in the trigeminal ganglion. Ocular inflammation is associated with a significant increase in IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA expression in the trigeminal ganglion. We reported a strong increase in FOS and Iba1 positive cells in particular in the sensory trigeminal complex at the ipsilateral interpolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) transition and Vc/upper cervical cord (Vc/C1) regions. In addition, activated microglial cells were tightly wrapped around activated FOS neurons in both regions and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was markedly enhanced specifically in microglial cells during ocular inflammation. Similar data were obtained in the facial motor nucleus. These neuroanatomical data correlated with the increase in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2) and neuronal (FOS and ATF3) markers. Interestingly, the suppression of corneal inflammation 10days following the end of BAC treatment resulted in a marked attenuation of peripheral and central changes observed in pathological conditions. This study provides the first demonstration that corneal inflammation induces activation of neurons and microglial p38 MAPK pathway within sensory trigeminal complex. These results suggest that this altered activity in intracellular signaling caused by ocular inflammation might play a priming role in the central sensitization of ocular related brainstem circuits, which represents a significant factor in ocular pain development."}

The effect of the triglyceride form of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (TG-DHA) was assayed in vitro and in vivo to assess the protective and anti-inflammatory activity of this compound. In the in vitro study, BV-2 microglia cells were previously treated with TG-DHA and then activated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). TG-DHA treatment protected BV-2 microglia cells from oxidative stress toxicity attenuating NO production and suppressing the induction of inflammatory cytokines. When compared with DHA in the ethyl-ester form, a significant difference in the ability to inhibit NO production in favor of TG-DHA was observed. TG-DHA inhibited significantly splenocyte proliferation but isolated CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation was unaffected. In a mice model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 250 mg/kg/day oral TG-DHA treatment was associated with a significant amelioration of the course and severity of the disease as compared to untreated animals. TG-DHA-treated EAE mice showed a better weight profile, which is a symptom related to a better course of encephalomyelitis.

Facial emotions are hierarchically organized patterns comprising (1) structural surface features, (2) discrete (primary) emotional categories and (3) secondary dimensions, such as valence and arousal. Categorical decoding was measured using (1) selection of category labels and selection of the named emotion category; (2) matching one facial expression with two choice expressions. Dimensional decoding was assessed by matching one face with two different expressions with regard to valence or arousal. 70 patients with well documented cerebral lesions and 15 matched hospital controls participated in the study. 27 had left brain damage (LBD; 10 frontal, 10 temporal, 7 parietal); 37 had right brain damage (RBD; 15 frontal, 11 temporal, 11 parietal). Six additional patients had lesions involving both frontal lobes. Right temporal and parietal lesioned patients were markedly impaired in the decoding of primary emotions. The same patients also showed a reduced arousal decoding. In contrast to several patients with frontal and left hemisphere lesions, emotional conceptualization and face discrimination was not independent in these groups. No group differences were observed in valence decoding. However, right frontal lesions appeared to interfere with the discrimination of negative valence. Moreover, a distraction by structural features was noted in RBD when facial identities were varied across stimulus and response pictures in matching tasks with differing conceptual load. Our results suggest that focal brain lesions differentially affect the comprehension of emotional meaning in faces depending on the level of conceptual load and interference of structural surface features."}

{"pmid": "23095594", "text": "L'Encephale^\n[Acute catatonia: Questions, diagnosis and prognostics, and the place of atypical antipsychotics].^\nAcute catatonia is a non-specific, relatively frequent syndrome, which manifests itself through characteristic motor signs that enables its diagnosis. It occurs in association with mood disorders, psychotic disorders and several somatic or toxic diseases. Its short-term prognosis is of paramount importance. Without effective treatment, it is associated with high mortality. Despite the vital risk inherent in this disorder, it is not recognized as an independent diagnostic category by international rankings, which makes its diagnostic detection difficult and consequently does not allow adequate therapeutic care. However, if benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy have proved effective in the treatment of acute catatonia, the role of atypical antipsychotics remains controversial. In fact, despite the progress made by the DSM-IV-TR and CIM 10 by the recognition of the etiologic diversity of catatonia, we deplore the absence to date of a consensus on clinical management and therapy of catatonia, which constitutes a source of confusion for practitioners in their approach to catatonic patients. To illustrate the difficulty in supporting these patients, we report here a clinical vignette.	Mr. M. aged 21, without psychiatric history, has shown a functional acute psychotic episode involving a delirious and hallucinatory syndrome associated with a marked catatonic dimension. Olanzapine was initiated at a dose of 10mg/d on the nineth day of hospitalization; the clinical picture was complicated by a malignant catatonia justifying the halt of olanzapine and the institution, in intensive units, of 15mg per day of lorazepam. After 72hours, the patient has not responded to this treatment. ECT was expected, but the patient died on the 12th day.	This case raises a threefold question: the crucial issue of immediate vital prognosis, that of the truthfulness of the positive diagnosis of this psychotic table and finally the issue of therapeutic care, primarily the well-founded or otherwise use of an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of this type of psychotic disorder. For Mr. M., the clinical diagnosis that he has shown, according to the DSM IV-TR, is brief psychotic disorder 'temporary diagnosis'. This diagnosis - brief psychotic disorder - does not actually allow for a specific clinical approach to this type of psychotic table. The immediate vital prognosis inherent in the catatonic dimension may not be properly evaluated and the therapeutic conduct may miss the application of the specific treatment of the catatonic syndrome. The proper diagnosis for this type of psychotic disorder would be 'catatonia' as proposed by Taylor and Fink, instead of 'brief psychotic disorder' if the international rankings have included this disorder as a separate and independent diagnosis. The identification by international rankings of the catatonic syndrome as an independent diagnostic category seems essential for clinicians to allow: its clinical detection, the establishment of a syndromic diagnosis of catatonic disorder, appropriate prognostic evaluation and finally, the application of a suitable therapeutic strategy. Conventional treatment, benzodiazepine- and/or ECT-based, can solve the catatonic episode in a few days, irrespective of its etiology and its severity. Moreover, while all authors agree that conventional antipsychotics may induce a catatonic state or worsen a preexisting catatonia into a malignant catatonia and should thus be avoided for catatonic patients or with prior catatonic episodes, recent data from the literature emphasize the frequent and successful use of atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, in various clinical forms of benign catatonia. However, our patient did not respond to treatment with olanzapine and got even more complicated. Was the malignant catatonia that this patient has shown induced by olanzapine ? The answer to this question seems difficult since some authors report the efficacy of olanzapine in malignant catatonia. We wonder if we should have kept olanzapine and strengthen its dosage like Cassidy et al. in 2001 and Suzuki et al. in 2010 for the treatment of the malignant form constituted in this patient rather than having stopped it and used lorazepam as indicated by Taylor and Fink in 2003.	The non-recognition of catatonia as an independent entity, the lack of a therapeutic consensus and the pending issue on the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of catatonia are at the origin of the difficulties of therapeutic support of catatonic patients."}

Hyperperfusion in the basal ganglia (BGH) was seen in 11 of the 15 patients with temporal and frontal hyperperfusion (73.3%) and in 11 of the 18 with only temporal hyperperfusion (61.1%). In 17 patients with unilateral BGH (13 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 4 contralateral), CH contralateral to the BGH was observed in 14 (82.5%), CH ipsilateral to the BGH was found in 2 (11.8%), and CH bilateral to the BGH was found in 1 (5.9%).	During TLE seizures, hemispheric CH occurred not only in contralateral but also in ipsilateral or bilateral cerebellar hemispheres to the side of seizure origin. Although temporal lobe origin seizures associated with additional frontal hyperperfusion produced more frequent hemispheric CH, seizures showing only temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion could produce BGH and CH. To determine the side of hemispheric CH, the most important factor appears to be the side of BGH, not the side of seizure origin."}

Treatment-induced pericystic inflammation and its association with blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, as determined by Evans blue (EB) extravasation, was studied in infected untreated and anthelmintic-treated pigs. We compared the magnitude and extent of the pericystic inflammation, presence of EB-stained capsules, the level of damage to the parasite, expression of genes for proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue remodeling by quantitative PCR assays between treated and untreated infected pigs and between EB-stained (blue) and non stained (clear) cysts. Inflammatory scores were higher in pericystic tissues from EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts from untreated pigs and also from anthelmintic-treated pigs 48 hr and 120 hr after treatment. The degree of inflammation correlated with the severity of cyst wall damage and both increased significantly at 120 hours. Expression levels of the proinflammatory genes for IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α were higher in EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts and unaffected brain tissues, and were generally highest at 120 hr. Additionally, expression of some markers of immunoregulatory activity (IL-10, IL-2Rα) were decreased in EB-stained capsules. An increase in other markers for regulatory T cells (CTLA4, FoxP3) was found, as well as significant increases in expression of two metalloproteases, MMP1 and MMP2 at 48 hr and 120 hr post-treatment. We conclude that the increase in severity of the inflammation caused by treatment is accompanied by both a proinflammatory and a complex regulatory response, largely limited to pericystic tissues with compromised vascular integrity. Because treatment induced inflammation occurs in porcine NCC similar to that in human cases, this model can be used to investigate mechanisms involved in host damaging inflammatory responses and agents or modalities that may control damaging post treatment inflammation."}

DHEA is a neuroactive corticosteroid hormone synthesized both in the adrenal cortex and in the brain. Its antioxidant properties are well known. As oxidative stress seems to play a major role in epileptogenesis in the iron-induced model of posttraumatic epilepsy, it was of interest to examine whether DHEA would exert antiepileptic activity. DHEA at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day administered intraperitoneally for 7, 14, and 21 days to iron-induced epileptic rats prevented epileptiform electrophysiological activity. Morris water maze and open-field tests on iron-induced epileptic rats revealed that DHEA also prevented behavioral alterations related to epileptiform activity. Thus, DHEA attenuated the cognitive defects produced by epileptic activity. Moreover, alterations in epileptogenesis-related biochemical parameters-lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase (sodium pump) activity--were also countered by DHEA."}

One male patient died of suicide (1.1%) and 18 (19.6%) individuals repeated parasuicide using self-poisoning. The rate of repeated parasuicidal behaviour in this investigation was considerably higher than that reported in comparable studies from developing countries but similar to that from a number of western European cities. The data indicated that the probability of further episodes of parasuicidal behaviour increased in the few months after the index episode. Although the repeaters and non-repeaters were essentially similar in most of their sociodemographic characteristics, the former were a distinctive group in many respects. The factors found to be significantly associated with subsequent parasuicide included self-poisoning by prescribed drugs at the index parasuicide, previous parasuicidal behaviour prior to the index, occupational status of a housewife, past history of depression and/or dependence and precipitating life events in the family environment. Contrary to our hypothesized theory, none of the types of attitudes received by the patients from their family members at the index parasuicide related to outcome. The global level of social readjustment of non-repeaters was about three times higher than that of repeaters of parasuicide. The implications of these findings for future policy making were discussed with respect to prevention of parasuicide."}

Recent evidence indicates that PPA can cause behavioral abnormalities and a neuroinflammatory response in rats. Social behavior was examined in similarly-treated pairs of adult male Long-Evans rats placed in an open field following intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of PPA (4 microl of 0.26 M solution) or control compounds. Behavior was analyzed using both the EthoVision behavior tracking system and by blind scoring of videotapes of social behaviors. Compared to controls, rats treated with PPA displayed social behavior impairments as indicated by significantly greater mean distance apart, reduced time spent in close proximity, reduced playful interaction, and altered responses to playful initiations. Treatment with another short chain fatty acid, sodium acetate, produced similar impairments, but treatment with the alcohol analog of PPA, 1-propanol, did not produce impairments. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue taken from rats treated with PPA revealed reactive astrogliosis, indicating a neuroinflammatory response. These findings suggest that PPA can change both brain and behavior in the laboratory rat in a manner that is consistent with symptoms of human ASD."}

Recently, several genetic variants of its key components, which may be clinically relevant and thus prove to be useful in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, have been described. We therefore investigated the association between ACE I/D, AGT M235T, and AT1 A1266C gene polymorphisms and early signs of target organ damage in 215 untreated patients with essential hypertension (EH).	Genotyping was based on the polymerase chain reaction technique, with further restriction analysis when required. Albuminuria was measured as the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed by echocardiography (LVH = LVMI > or = 125 g/m2), carotid wall thickness (IMT) by an ultrasonographic (US) scan, and retinal vascular changes by direct ophthalmoscopy (Keith-Wagener classification).	The prevalence of microalbuminuria (Mi), LVH, and retinal vascular changes was 14, 46, and 74%, respectively. ACE, AGT, and AT1 genotype distribution was in agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no difference in age, duration of disease, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipid profile when data were analyzed on the basis of genotype. Serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were related to the ACE genotype (10.2 +/- 0.5, DD; 8.2 +/- 0.3, ID; 6.5 +/- 0.4 IU/mL, II; P < 0. 0001 by analysis of variance). The ACE genotype independently influences serum ACE levels and accounts for approximately 14% of its variations (F = 26.7, r2 = 0.1393, df 1 to 214, P < 0.0001). Patients with DD and ID genotypes showed higher levels of ACR (1.59 +/- 0.2, DD + ID; 0.8 +/- 0.2 mg/mmol, II; P < 0.006 by ANOVA) and bigger LVMI (124.1 +/- 2.3, DD + ID vs. 117.8 +/- 3.6 g/m2, II; P < 0.01 by ANOVA). No differences in the prevalence and degree of target organ damage (TOD) were found when data were analyzed on the basis of the AGT and AT1 genotypes, respectively. Potentially unfavorable combinations of genotypes were also investigated by K-means cluster analysis. Two subgroups of patients were identified (cluster 1, N = 70; cluster 2, N = 57), and each differed significantly with regards to the presence and degree of TOD and patterns of RAAS gene polymorphisms (F, 15.97 for ACR; F, 7.19 for IMT; F, 217.03 for LVMI; F, 3.91 for ACE; F, 4.06 for AGT; and F, 5. 22 for AT1; df 1 to 214, P < 0.02, for each one of the variables examined).	The D allele of the ACE gene may be an independent risk factor for the development of target organ damage, and evaluating it could be useful for assessing cardiovascular risk in EH. Unfavorable patterns of RAAS genotypes seem to predispose patients to subclinical cardiovascular disease in EH."}

The great majority of AD cases arise sporadically with a late onset after 65 years of age (LOAD). However, rare familial cases of AD can occur due to dominant mutations in a small number of genes that cause an early onset prior to 65 years of age (EOfAD). As EOfAD and LOAD share similar pathologies and disease progression, analysis of EOfAD genetic models may give insight into both subtypes of AD. Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) is genetically associated with both EOfAD and LOAD and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between both forms of AD. Currently, the role of SORL1 mutations in AD pathogenesis is unclear. To understand the molecular consequences of SORL1 mutation, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the orthologous gene in zebrafish. We generated an EOfAD-like mutation, V1482Afs, and a putatively null mutation, to investigate whether EOfAD-like mutations in sorl1 display haploinsufficiency by acting through loss-of-function mechanisms. We performed mRNA-sequencing on whole brains, comparing wild type fish with their siblings heterozygous for EOfAD-like or putatively loss-of-function mutations in sorl1, or transheterozygous for these mutations. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small number of differentially expressed genes due to the sorl1 genotypes. We also performed enrichment analysis on all detectable genes to obtain a more complete view on changes to gene expression by performing three methods of gene set enrichment analysis, then calculated an overall significance value using the harmonic mean p-value. This identified subtle effects on expression of genes involved in energy production, mRNA translation and mTORC1 signalling in both the EOfAD-like and null mutant brains, implying that these effects are due to sorl1 haploinsufficiency. Surprisingly, we also observed changes to expression of genes occurring only in the EOfAD-mutation carrier brains, suggesting gain-of-function effects. Transheterozygosity for the EOfAD-like and null mutations (i.e. lacking wild type sorl1), caused apparent effects on iron homeostasis and other transcriptome changes distinct from the single-mutation heterozygous fish. Our results provide insight into the possible early brain molecular effects of an EOfAD mutation in human SORL1. Differential effects of heterozygosity and complete loss of normal SORL1 expression are revealed."}

Hippocampal transection (HT) has been developed to overcome this problem. In HT the hippocampus is not removed; rather, the longitudinal hippocampal circuits of epileptic activities are disrupted by transection of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus.

Recent studies have demonstrated that several antagonists of NMDA receptors have important cardiovascular effects. In this study, we examined whether the cardiovascular effects of ACPC involve the role of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its antioxidant effect in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Male SHRSP were divided into two groups: a control group and an ACPC group administered ACPC at 50 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks by peritoneal injection. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mortality of stroke were significantly lower in the ACPC group than in the control group. Urinary Na(+) and Cl(-) excretion and plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were increased in the ACPC group. Western analysis detected proteins that were immunoreactive to anti-nitrotyrosine antibody and showed lower levels of expression in the cerebral cortex compared to that in the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was reduced in the ACPC group. Quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that administration of ACPC also significantly decreased the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA in the hippocampus and endotherial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA in the cerebral cortex, and drastically increased HO-1 mRNA in the cerebral cortex. Enhanced HO-1 staining on sections from the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was observed in the ACPC group. These data suggest that the normalization by ACPC of blood pressure elevation and mortality of stroke involves induction of the expression of HO-1, which exerts antioxidant and vascular relaxation effects, in SHRSP."}

Adenoma tissues examined included 18 clinically non-functioning adenomas, 14 GH-secreting adenomas and 7 PRL-secreting adenomas. The expression of the following genes were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): DAX-1, Adrenal-4-binding protein/steroidogenic factor-1 (Ad4BP/SF-1), Pit-1, LH beta, FSH beta, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R), GH, PRL, and TSH beta, as well as beta-actin as a control.	Eleven clinically non-functioning adenomas expressed DAX-1, 10 of which also expressed Ad4BP/SF-1. Nine out of the 11 DAX-1 expressing adenomas also expressed LH beta, FSH beta and GnRH-R as well, indicating that these adenomas possessed gonadotrophic properties. Nine clinically non-functioning adenomas expressed Pit-1 as well as GH, PRL and/or TSH beta, thus having somatomammotrophic or thyrotrophic properties, 3 of which overlapped with the above DAX-1-expressing adenomas. One non-functioning adenoma expressed Ad4BP/SF1 and FSH beta but not DAX-1, and another one expressed DAX-1 and Ad4BP/SF-1 with PRL. On the other hand, all GH-secreting and PRL-secreting adenomas expressed Pit-1 and GH and/or PRL, but neither DAX-1 nor Ad4BP/SF-1.

The complex intermittent multisensory rehabilitation consisted of currently used major therapeutic procedures targeted at the improvement of cognitive functions; including multisensory and motor stimulation and enriched environment. We have confirmed this positive effect of early multisensory rehabilitation on the recovery of motor functions after traumatic brain injury. However, we have been able to prove a positive effect on the recovery of cognitive functions only with respect to the frequency of efficient search strategies in a Barnes maze test, while results for search time and travelled distance were not significantly different between study groups. We have concluded that the positive effects of an early treatment of functional deficits are comparable with the clinical results in early neurorehabilitation in human patients after brain trauma.

We investigated earliest temporo-spatial dynamics within ischemic tissue, measured with quantitative T2* imaging in the histologically defined infarct core and surrounding surviving tissue. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced by a filament model in mice. Serial multiple gradient-echo T2* sequences and diffusion-weighted images were acquired for 60min after MCAO and repeated for 60min after recanalization.

Within the histologically defined infarct core, relative T2* values decreased significantly by -10.8±2.8% (P=0.003) compared to the contralateral hemisphere within 3.5±0.7min after MCAO. Relative T2* values in volume exceeding the histologically determined infarct core were significantly less decreased (-6.7±2.1%; P=0.02) and increased after recanalization (+3.9±1.9%; P=0.045).

Amplification of chromosome 12q13-q15 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) amplicon) is frequently observed in numerous human cancers including GBM. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE) is a group of GTP-binding proteins that belong to the subgroup of centaurin GTPase family, encoded by CENTG1 located in CDK4 amplicon. However, the pathological significance of CDK4 amplicon in GBM formation remains incompletely understood. In the current study, we show that co-expression of PIKE-A and CDK4 in TP53/PTEN double knockout GBM mouse model additively shortens the latency of glioma onset and survival compared to overexpression of these genes alone. Consequently, p-mTOR, p-Akt and p-ERK pathways are highly upregulated in the brain tumors, in alignment with their oncogenic activities by CDK4 and PIKE-A stably transfected in GBM cell lines. Hence, our findings support that PIKE amplification or overexpression coordinately acts with CDK4 to drive GBM tumorigenesis."}

Some associations, although sporadic, can be particularly challenging both in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management and in terms of theoretical perspective. Here, we report a child affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). The child was diagnosed with classical T1DM at 15 months of age, with a tendency toward hypoglycemia. A few months later, during an acute intercurrent infective episode, the child displayed acute hypotonia of the lower limbs and limbs dystonia. A brain MRI showed bilateral striatal necrosis, suggesting GA1 diagnosis. Treatment with a low-lysine dietary regimen and carnitine supplementation was started and resulted in an improvement in metabolic control and a reduction of hypoglycemic episodes along with an increasing in insulin daily dose. After 2 years, the neurological outcome consisted of a reduction in dystonic movements and a metabolic stability of both diseases.	This case provides some insight into the reciprocal interconnections between the two metabolic disorders. Similar pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the neuronal injury might have impacted each other, and a strict relationship between a specific aspect of GA1-impaired metabolism and glucose homeostasis might explain how the tailored management of GA1 was not only effective in controlling the disease, but it also resulted in an improvement in the control of the glycemic profile. What in known: • Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) usually presents in childhood with severe and possibly irreversible neuronal damage, triggered by a catabolic stress • The association of GA1 with other diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), is a rare event, complicating the treatment management What is new: • Insulin treatment has a role in preventing GA1 metabolic decompensation, even in the catabolic condition of hypoglycemia • Promoting GA1 metabolic equilibrium by tailoring drug and dietary treatment in our patient affect by T1DM has a positive impact also in improving glycemic balance."}

Loss-of-function mutations in GEMIN5 lead to a neurodevelopmental syndrome among patients presenting with developmental delay, motor dysfunction, and cerebellar atrophy by perturbing SMN complex protein expression and assembly. Currently, molecular determinants of GEMIN5-mediated disease have yet to be explored. Here, we identified SMN as a genetic suppressor of GEMIN5-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo. We discovered that an increase in SMN expression by either SMN gene therapy replacement or the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), Nusinersen, significantly upregulated the endogenous levels of GEMIN5 in mammalian cells and mutant GEMIN5-derived iPSC neurons. Further, we identified a strong functional association between the expression patterns of SMN and GEMIN5 in patient Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)-derived motor neurons harboring loss-of-function mutations in the SMN gene. Interestingly, SMN binds to the C-terminus of GEMIN5 and requires the Tudor domain for GEMIN5 binding and expression regulation. Finally, we show that SMN upregulation ameliorates defective snRNP biogenesis and alternative splicing defects caused by loss of GEMIN5 in iPSC neurons and in vivo. Collectively, these studies indicate that SMN acts as a regulator of GEMIN5 expression and neuropathologies."}

Prospective study.	This study was hospital-based and included 62 inpatients with stroke.	The primary outcome was swallowing ability at discharge. The swallowing ability was assessed using the Food Intake Level Scale (FILS). The FILS change was calculated by subtracting FILS at admission from FILS at discharge. Ultrasound images were acquired at admission using B-mode ultrasound imaging.

The mean muscle thickness and echo intensity of the right and left quadriceps were used in the analysis. A multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors independently associated with the FILS at discharge and FILS change. The independent variables were the muscle thickness and echo intensity of the quadriceps, FILS at admission, age, sex, body mass index, days from stroke onset, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index, number of medications, unit number of rehabilitation therapy, and Barthel Index score at admission.	Muscle thickness of the quadriceps was significantly and independently associated with FILS at discharge (β = 0.27) and FILS change (β = 0.40).

At the same time, inpatient pharmacy budget increases and uncertainty in guiding the use of novel antipsychotics have influenced the availability of these agents in state hospitals.	State hospital services have, by and large, embraced the developments in pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. Optimal use of these new agents in this population requires additional information on their relative efficacy in specific patient subgroups."}

Because previous studies have largely been in chronic patients, it is not known whether these membrane abnormalities also occur early in illness. In the present study, red blood cell membrane fatty acid levels were determined by capillary gas chromatography from 24 neuroleptic-naive patients with first episode schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 31 age-matched normal controls. Relative to normal subjects, patients had significant reductions in total PUFA (-13%) but not in monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids. Specifically, significant reductions were found in arachidonic acid (-18%), docosapentaenoic acid (-36%), and docosahexaenoic acid (-26%) concentrations. These reductions were not related to age, gender, smoking status, or cotinine levels. These results confirm previous findings of membrane deficits in schizophrenia and show that significant PUFA reductions occur early in the illness, prior to initiation of treatment, raising the possibility that these deficits are trait related. The findings also suggest that membrane fatty acid losses are quite specific to the highly unsaturated fatty acids."}

A prospective assessment of untreated anxiety symptoms and disorders among primary care patients.	Approximately 10% of eligible patients screened in clinic waiting rooms of a mixed-model health maintenance organization reported elevated symptoms and/or disorders of anxiety that were unrecognized and untreated.

These networks can be characterized using structural (via diffusion MRI) and functional (via resting state-functional MRI) neuroimaging techniques. Advances in neuroimaging have led to expanded application of these approaches to study term- and prematurely-born infants, providing improved understanding of cerebral development and the deleterious effects of early brain injury. Across both modalities, neuroimaging data are conducive to analyses ranging from characterization of individual white matter tracts and/or resting state networks through advanced 'connectome-style' approaches capable of identifying highly connected network hubs and investigating metrics of network topology such as modularity and small-worldness. We begin this review by summarizing the literature detailing structural and functional connectivity findings in healthy term and preterm infants without brain injury during the postnatal period, including discussion of early connectome development. We then detail common forms of brain injury in term- and prematurely-born infants. In this context, we next review the emerging body of literature detailing studies employing diffusion MRI, resting state-functional MRI and other complementary neuroimaging modalities to characterize structural and functional connectivity development in infants with brain injury. We conclude by reviewing technical challenges associated with neonatal neuroimaging, highlighting those most relevant to studying infants with brain injury and emphasizing the need for further targeted study in this high-risk population."}

Group differences in cortical thickness and the age-by-group effects were assessed using vertex-by-vertex and multivariate linear models. The discriminatory ability of MRI variables in distinguishing patients from controls was estimated using the Concordance Statistics (C-statistic) within logistic regression analyses. Correlations between cortical thickness measures and disease progression rate were tested using the Pearson coefficient. Relative to controls, ALS patients showed a bilateral cortical thinning of the primary motor, prefrontal and ventral frontal cortices, cingulate gyrus, insula, superior and inferior temporal and parietal regions, and medial and lateral occipital areas. There was a significant age-by-group effect in the sensorimotor cortices bilaterally, suggesting a stronger association between age and cortical thinning in ALS patients compared to controls. The mean cortical thickness of the sensorimotor cortices distinguished patients with ALS from controls (C-statistic ≥ 0.74). Cortical thinning of the left sensorimotor cortices was related to a faster clinical progression (r = -0.33, p = 0.03). Cortical thickness measurements allowed the detection and quantification of motor and extramotor involvement in patients with ALS.

A 3D-fast asymmetric spin echo MR imaging sequence and the region-growing method were used to extract the CSF space from MR images. Ventricular volume (VV) and intracranial CSF volume (ICV) were measured and the VV/ICV ratio was calculated in each case. In NPH patients, the CSF volume was measured again after shunting.	The mean VV and VV/ICV ratio in the NPH group (91.1 mL and 45.2%, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those in the NV group (26.5 mL and 13.7%) and in the CVD group (44.5 mL and 17.8%). On the other hand, mean ICV values were not significantly different among the three groups. The VV was markedly decreased postoperatively (mean -40.7%), whereas the ICV was unchanged, resulting in a marked reduction in the VV/ICV ratio (mean -39.3%).	These results suggest that patients with NPH have a unique intracranial CSF distribution, with an enlarged VV and a slightly increased ICV, resulting in a high VV/ICV ratio. Shunting led to dramatic improvement in our patients. It is likely that CSF measurement can provide valuable information in the management of patients with NPH."}

It has been shown to produce medicinal effects against hyperactivity, agitation and mania, as well as schizophrenia. Long-term usage of haloperidol raises the risk of acquiring a neurological condition like Parkinson's disease. Haloperidol causes drug-induced Parkinsonism (DIP) by blocking central dopamine receptors and causing extrapyramidal symptoms during long-term treatment. Quercetin has been shown to reduce the loss of striatal neurons, which may enhance motor capabilities and protect against agents that cause the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a result, present study intended to evaluate the efficacy of quercetin on haloperidol-related motor abnormalities.

We used standard costing of antidepressants, sildenafil, and unit costs for physician visits within a managed care environment and cost-of-illness methodology to calculate the annualized cost of depression for different treatment outcomes. After 6 months of SSRI treatment, the sildenafil add-on group had the lowest cost estimates compared with groups that discontinued SSRIs, substituted another SSRI (switching), or added a non-SSRI to the existing SSRI (augmentation). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the physician visit was the single most important cost component in this hypothetical population and relapse/remission the most costly outcome.

Most of these syndromes are relatively subtle and have to be ascertained using recordings, because other brain areas may largely take over the function of a damaged area. Anterior cortical, posterior cortical, large and bilateral cortical, subcortical and degenerative cerebral lesions are successively reviewed. In the anterior part of the cerebral hemisphere, the frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), i.e. area 46 of Brodmann, control eye movements. The FEF appears to be principally involved in the control of intentional saccades, in particular those made with a retinotopic reference system, and in smooth pursuit. The SEF could control saccades made with a spatiotopic reference system, and sequences of saccades (requiring a temporal working memory). The PFC could control the inhibition of unwanted reflexive saccades, and be involved in spatial memory used for programming all types of memory-guided saccades. In the posterior part of the cerebral hemisphere, the parietal eye field (PEF) is involved in the triggering of reflexive visually guided saccades, and the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas in smooth pursuit. Acute and large unilateral lesions usually result in transitory ipsilateral conjugate eye deviation. Bilateral lesions affecting both the FEF and the PEF result in severe saccade and smooth-pursuit paresis, whereas bilateral posterior temporoparietal lesions result in Balint's syndrome, consisting of both eye movement and visual-attention abnormalities. Subcortical lesions also result in various eye movement abnormalities, which have been little documented to date. Lastly, degenerative cerebral diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration result in more or less severe eye movement disturbances.

These studies describe application of simultaneous high-speed video kinematics with multichannel electromyography (EMG) to characterize the movement disorder exhibited by tottering mutant mice. These mice provide a uniquely valuable model, because they exhibit paroxysmal dystonia superimposed on mild baseline ataxia, permitting the examination of these two different problems within the same animals. At baseline with mild ataxia, the mutants exhibited poorly coordinated movements with increased variation of stance and swing times, and slower spontaneous walking velocities. The corresponding EMG showed reduced mean amplitudes of biceps femoris and vastus lateralis, and poorly modulated EMG activities during the step cycle. Attacks of paroxysmal dystonia were preceded by trains of EMG bursts with doublets and triplets simultaneously in the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis followed by more sustained coactivation. These EMG characteristics are consistent with the clinical phenomenology of the motor phenotype of tottering mice as a baseline of mild ataxia with intermittent attacks of paroxysmal dystonia. The EMG characteristics of ataxia and dystonia in the tottering mice also are consistent with EMG studies of other ataxic or dystonic animals and humans.

Although there is increasing evidence for significant changes in the structure and function of synapses on motor neurons, there is a need for a systematic investigation of the role of each synapse subtype in the course of the disease. Here, we focus on large cholinergic synapses on motor neurons, known as C boutons, and investigate their role during ALS progression. We implement a genetic strategy for inactivation of the cholinergic output of C boutons in the SOD1[G93A] transgenic mouse model of ALS. We demonstrate that although C bouton cholinergic inactivation does not alter mouse survival, it exerts a beneficial effect on motor performance in the rotarod motor task, as evidenced by an increased latency to fall in SOD1[G93A] mice lacking C bouton cholinergic output. Our results suggest that C bouton cholinergic transmission exerts a negative effect on motor neuron function in ALS, possibly via aberrant excitation, and render C boutons a potential target for future pharmacological intervention."}

These two cases should be classified within the infantile and early forms of Niemann-Pick disease type C. Antenatal diagnosis was performed during a third pregnancy. Enzyme activity assays on a specimen of trophoblast taken at the tenth week of gestation showed the fetus was not affected. This diagnosis was confirmed by a normal clinical evaluation at two months of life, and normal sphingomyelinase activity of cultured skin fibroblasts."}

The experiments were carried out on hippocampal slices of guinea pigs. EFP were elicited by omission of Mg2+ from the perfusate and recorded from stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum in the CA1 subfield. Single electrical stimuli were applied to the Schaffer collateral pathway. Verapamil was added to the bath solution in concentrations of 40 and 60 mumol verapamil/l at normal (4 mmol/l) and elevated (8 mmol/l) K+ levels. After omission of Mg2+ from the perfusate, spontaneously occurring EFP appeared in all trials. These spontaneously occurring EFP were suppressed dose-dependently upon addition of verapamil to the perfusate. At elevated K+ levels, the latencies to suppression were significantly reduced and the dose dependency was abolished for the two doses of verapamil used. Triggered EFP reappeared upon stimulation after spontaneously occurring EFP had been suppressed, except for trials with 60 mumol verapamil/l bath solution with elevated K+ levels. The stimulus-evoked EFP were abolished with continuing perfusion of verapamil except for trials with 40 mumol/l at normal extracellular K+ concentrations. This effect was again dose dependent and enhanced by elevating the K+ level. In all experiments, stimulus-evoked EFP reappeared upon wash-out of verapamil. A primary action of verapamil on pacemaker functions in epileptogenic tissue is assumed."}

In recent years, numerous experiences and indications for the use of FUS in clinical and preclinical studies have rapidly expanded. Focused ultrasound-mediated BBB opening induces cognitive enhancement and neurogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated.	Here, we investigate the effects of FUS-mediated BBB opening on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive function in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We applied FUS with microbubble to the hippocampus and LTP was measured 6 weeks after BBB opening using FUS. Field recordings were made with a concentric bipolar electrode positioned in the CA1 region using an extracellular glass pipette filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Morris water maze and Y-maze was performed to test cognitive function.	Our results demonstrated that FUS-mediated BBB opening has a significant impact on increasing LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 synapses and rescues cognitive dysfunction and working memory. These effects persisted for up to 7 weeks post-treatment. Also, FUS-mediated BBB opening in the hippocampus increased PKA phosphorylation.	Therefore, it could be a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases as it remarkably increases LTP, thereby improving working memory."}

Approximately 30% of patients fail to respond to present therapies. Therefore, the search for novel antidepressant drugs continues.	The most prescribed antidepressants are serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, which only indirectly affect dopaminergic neurotransmission. As a consequence, residual symptoms remain, including impaired motivation and impaired pleasure. This article reviews the development of new broad-spectrum antidepressants, the triple reuptake inhibitors, which also increase brain dopamine levels.	In this review, a distinction is made between the subtypes of melancholic and atypical depressions and their associated brain abnormalities and dysfunctions in neurotransmitter systems. Subsequently, we propose a hypothetical model: 'the monoamine hypothesis revisited' to predict what kind of pharmacological treatment will be effective in the different subtypes of depression. It is expected that the triple reuptake inhibitors, inhibiting the reuptake of all three monoamines, can produce a greater efficacy than traditional antidepressants especially in atypical depression. Since triple reuptake inhibitors may also dampen states of hyperglutamatergic activity and subsequent excitotoxicity, it is suggested that these new drugs have a considerable neuroprotective potential in major depression, especially in melancholic depression."}

Here, we investigate the neuroprotective role of Xe in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced white matter damage (WMD) model.	Three-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham group (group A, n = 24), an LPS + HI group (group B, n = 24), and an LPS + HI + Xe group (group C, n = 72). The onset of Xe inhalation started at 0, 2, and 5 h in subgroups C1, C2, and C3, respectively. Next, we performed TUNEL and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining; and examined the expression of CLIC4 and Bcl-2 in brain tissues.	HE staining revealed distorted cytoarchitecture, tangled nerve fibers, and pyknosis in group B, while Xe treatment improved these histological alterations in the group C pups. Following LPS and HI insult, the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased in group B at 48 and 72 h (p < 0.05), and Xe significantly alleviated apoptosis (p < 0.001) at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Similarly, CLIC4 mRNA expression was significantly increased in group B (p < 0.05), and Xe produced a marked reduction in CLIC4 mRNA expression in group C subgroups (p < 0.05). Western blotting demonstrated enhanced Bcl-2 expression in group C when compared to group B (p < 0.05).	These results demonstrate that LPS and HI successfully induced WMD, and Xe decreased neuronal apoptosis via Bcl-2- and CLIC4-mediated pathways. Moreover, the therapeutic time window of Xe extended for up to 5 h. These findings suggest that Xe can be used as a protective treatment for WMD in premature infants."}

During the 3-year follow-up, 4 of the patients with both MRI abnormalities and neurological sequelae improved in both clinical features and MRI findings. One of the 6 asymptomatic patients with MRI abnormalities developed a progressive cognitive impairment 2 months after acute intoxication, with a concomitant severe worsening of the MRI lesions. Among the 10 patients with neither MRI abnormalities nor neurological sequelae, only 1 developed neurological sequelae after a clear period of 4 months. In the group of patients who experienced chronic CO intoxication, only 1 presented with a neuropsychiatric syndrome which improved at follow-up. Brain MRI showed white matter lesions which remained unchanged at control scan after 1 year. In conclusion, we observed that some patients with severe CO poisoning and neurological sequelae may fully regain normal functions after approximately 1 year.

KCS1 and KCS2 are caused by pathogenic variants in TBCE and FAM111A, respectively. Clinically the phenotypes are difficult to distinguish.	The objective was to determine and expand the phenotypic spectrum of KCS1 and KCS2 in order to anticipate complications that may arise in these disorders.	We clinically and genetically analyzed 10 KCS2 patients from 7 families. Because we found unusual phenotypes in our cohort, we performed a systematic review of genetically confirmed KCS cases using PubMed and Scopus. Evaluation by 3 researchers led to the inclusion of 26 papers for KCS1 and 16 for KCS2, totaling 205 patients. Data were extracted following the Cochrane guidelines and assessed by 2 independent researchers.	Several patients in our KCS2 cohort presented with intellectual disability (3/10) and chronic kidney disease (6/10), which are not considered common findings in KCS2. Systematic review of all reported KCS cases showed that the phenotypes of KCS1 and KCS2 overlap for postnatal growth retardation (KCS1: 52/52, KCS2: 23/23), low parathyroid hormone levels (121/121, 16/20), electrolyte disturbances (139/139, 24/27), dental abnormalities (47/50, 15/16), ocular abnormalities (57/60, 22/23), and seizures/spasms (103/115, 13/16). Symptoms more prevalent in KCS1 included intellectual disability (74/80, 5/24), whereas in KCS2 bone cortical thickening (1/18, 16/20) and medullary stenosis (7/46, 27/28) were more common.	Our case series established chronic kidney disease as a new feature of KCS2.

We have previously reported that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression is necessary for ischemia-stimulated neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus. Here, we show that mice subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) significantly increased the number of new neurons and up-regulated iNOS expression in the dentate gyrus. Blockade of the L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (L-VGCC) prevented neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone (SVZ), and down-regulated iNOS expression in the dentate gyrus after cerebral ischemia.

When chronically abused, ketamine users display deficits in cognition and information processing, even following long-term abstinence from the drug. While animal studies have shown evidence of behavioral changes and cognitive deficits that mimic those seen in humans within the period immediately following subchronic ketamine, a few animal studies have assessed long-term changes following cessation of ketamine exposure. To this end, the present study assessed event related potentials (ERPs) and EEG oscillations in mice exposed to subchronic ketamine following a 6month period of abstinence from the drug. Ketamine-treated mice showed no change in P20, but did show marked reductions in amplitude of the later N40 and P80 components, consistent with previous studies of acute ketamine exposure. Additionally, ketamine-treated animals showed a significant reduction in stimulus evoked theta oscillations. To assess the functional significance of these changes, mice were also assessed on a series of behavioral and cognitive tests, including progressive ratio (motivation), extinction (behavioral flexibility) and win-shift radial maze (spatial memory). Subchronic ketamine produced marked disruptions in reversal learning and spatial memory. Analysis of brains from ketamine-treated mice failed to show evidence of neuronal degeneration as determined by NueN immunohistochemistry, but did show increased astrocyte proliferation and decreased expression of the glial specific glutamate transporter, GLT-1. These results strongly suggest: 1) that subchronic ketamine induces significant changes in brain function that long exceed exposure to the drug; 2) that ketamine exposure in mice induces lasting cognitive impairments closely resembling those observed in human ketamine abusers; 3) that ERP and EEG measures are highly sensitive to alterations in brain function associated with reduced cognitive function; and 4) that the brain changes induced by chronic ketamine treatment are suggestive of long-term adaptive or plastic, rather than degenerative, changes."}

When a trial has collected data on many potential genetic markers, a first step in analysis is to screen for evidence of pharmacogenetic effects by testing for treatment-by-marker interactions in a statistical model for the outcome of interest. This approach is potentially problematic because (i) individual significance tests can be overly sensitive, particularly when sample sizes are large; and (ii) standard significance tests fail to distinguish between markers that are likely, on biological grounds, to have an effect, and those that are not. One way to address these concerns is to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests [Berger (1985) Statistical decision theory and Bayesian analysis. New York: Springer; Kass and Raftery (1995) J Am Stat Assoc 90:773-795], which are typically more conservative than standard uncorrected frequentist tests, less conservative than multiplicity-corrected tests, and make explicit use of relevant biological information through specification of the prior distribution. In this article we use a Bayesian testing approach to screen a panel of genetic markers recorded in a randomized clinical trial of bupropion versus placebo for smoking cessation. From a panel of 59 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on 11 candidate genes, we identify four SNPs (one each on CHRNA5 and CHRNA2 and two on CHAT) that appear to have pharmacogenetic relevance.

The availability of this material, whether fresh, frozen or fixed, makes it possible to develop methodologies for studying the neuroanatomical and neurochemical aspects of the human brain. It has also become possible in recent years to correlate functional changes with neurochemical changes and with neuroanatomical abnormalities in disease states. Some compounds and structures are damaged irreversibly within minutes after death and some brain components are known to disintegrate within seconds. This led to the widespread idea that autopsy material would not be suitable for basic research purposes and would not supply the necessary answers on the various fundamental questions regarding processes occurring in normal or diseased brain. However, from data published in recent years in which autopsy material has been routinely used, it becomes more and more evident that this is a misconception. There is an increasing number of reports based on the use of normal and pathological human brain tissue obtained by autopsies in spite of the fact that there is a worrying continuous decline in autopsy rate which causes serious concern among scientists world-wide (Anderson and Hill, 1989). It also became evident that when using the proper fixation procedures, sufficient structural integrity is retained in the tissue to allow morphological and morphometrical studies (Swaab and Uylings, 1988). Electron microscopic examination of synaptosomal preparations from post-mortem human brain showed them to be only slightly less pure than preparations from fresh tissue although there was some degree of damage (Hardy et al., 1982). Agonal state effects the stability of brain compounds and causes brain hypoxia. This again forms a tremendous difficulty for the study of human neurological and psychiatric diseases as one of the frequent causes of death is bronchopneumonia which leads to brain hypoxia and results in pronounced lactic acidosis. The Netherlands Brain Bank has succeeded to partly circumvent some of the serious problems encountered in providing human tissue for research by performing rapid autopsies with an average post-mortem delay of 2-4 h. This has become possible by a close collaboration of numerous nursing homes in Amsterdam and its vicinity and with the neuropathologists of the Free University in Amsterdam. We also measure the pH of the tissue as indicator of agonal state in order to reveal unsuitable specimens.

Thus, hypoxia imaging would be a valuable tool for pre-therapeutic assessment of tumor malignancy. However, there is no standard validated technique for clinical application available yet. Therefore, we performed a study in 12 patients with high-grade glioma, where we directly compared the two currently most promising techniques, namely the MR-based relative oxygen extraction fraction (MR-rOEF) and the PET hypoxia marker H-1-(3-[[18] F]-fluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)-2-nitroimidazole ([[18] F]-FMISO). MR-rOEF was determined from separate measurements of T2 , T2 * and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) employing a multi-parametric approach for quantification of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect. With respect to [[18] F]-FMISO-PET, besides the commonly used late uptake between 120 and 130 min ([[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min), we also analyzed the hypoxia specific uptake rate [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , as obtained by pharmacokinetic modeling of dynamic uptake data. Since pharmacokinetic modeling of partially acquired dynamic [[18] F]-FMISO data was sensitive to a low signal-to-noise-ratio, analysis was restricted to high-uptake tumor regions. Individual spatial analyses of deoxygenation and hypoxia-related parameter maps revealed that high MR-rOEF values clustered in (edematous) peritumoral tissue, while areas with high [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min concentrated in and around active tumor with disrupted blood-brain barrier, i.e. contrast enhancement in T1 -weighted MRI. Volume-of-interest-based correlations between MR-rOEF and [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min as well as [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , and voxel-wise analyses in individual patients, yielded limited correlations, supporting the notion that [[18] F]-FMISO uptake, even after 2 h, might still be influenced by perfusion while [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 was severely hampered by noise. According to these results, vascular deoxygenation, as measured by MR-rOEF, and severe tissue hypoxia, as measured by [[18] F]-FMISO, show a poor spatial correspondence. Overall, the two methods appear to rather provide complementary than redundant information about high-grade glioma biology."}

This study investigated whether ME10092 regulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)-mediated signal transduction in vivo. The effect of ME10092 treatment (1-100 pmol/mouse) on nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, activation of expression of inflammatory mediators and production of nitric oxide were measured in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced brain inflammation model in mice in vivo. The antinociceptive activity of ME10092 was tested in the formalin-induced paw licking test. ME10092 dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, transcription of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements showed that ME10092 inhibited the LPS-induced increase in nitric oxide content in mouse brain tissue in a dose-dependent manner. In the formalin-induced paw licking test, ME10092 (at the dose of 3mg/kg, p.o. twice daily for eight days) significantly reduced nociceptive response. In conclusion, above results indicate that ME10092 inhibits NF-kappaB activation and suppresses the up-regulation of inflammatory mediators in experimental models in vivo."}

However, there is a lack of literature in quantitative measures of motor control, which may potentially characterize the nature of the speech impairments in these children. This study investigated speech motor control in children with cerebral palsy (CP) using kinematic analysis.	We collected 10 children with mild spastic CP, aged 4.8 to 7.5 years, and 10 age-matched children with typical development (TD) from rehabilitation department at a tertiary hospital. All children underwent analysis of percentage of consonants correct (PCC) and kinematic analysis of speech tasks: poly-syllable (PS) and mono-syllable (MS) tasks using the Vicon Motion 370 system integrated with a digital camcorder. Kinematic parameters included spatiotemporal indexes (STIs), and average values and coefficients of variation (CVs) of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity. An ANOVA was conducted to determine whether PCC and kinematic data significantly differed between groups.	CP group had relatively lower PCCs (80.0-99.0%) than TD group (p = 0.039). CP group had higher STIs in PS speech tasks, but not in MS tasks, than TD group did (p = 0.001). The CVs of utterance duration for MS and PS tasks of children with CP were at least three times as large as those of TD children (p < 0.01). However, average values of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity and CVs of other kinematic data for both tasks did not significantly differ between two groups.	High STI values and high variability on utterance durations in children with CP reflect deficits in relative spatial and/or especially temporal control for speech in the CP participants compared to the TD participants. Children with mild spastic CP may have more difficulty in processing increased articulatory demands and resulted in greater oromotor variability than normal children. The kinematic data such as STIs can be used as indices for detection of speech motor control impairments in children with mild CP and assessment of the effectiveness in the treatment."}

MDD is characterized by marked sadness or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, and is accompanied by weight change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, physical impairment and a high suicide rate.

The disorder is common in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence rate of 17 percent and a recurrence rate of more than 50 percent.	MDD may be associated with extensive dental disease, and people may seek dental treatment before becoming aware of their psychiatric illness. MDD frequently is associated with a disinterest in performing appropriate oral hygiene techniques, a cariogenic diet, diminished salivary flow, rampant dental caries, advanced periodontal disease and oral dysesthesias.

Recombinant human erythropoietin was administered at a dose of 1,000 U/kg intraperitoneally after the induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage and continued every 8 h up to 72 h. Darbepoetin alpha was administered at a single intraperitoneal dose of 30 μg/kg. Animals were killed 72 h after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Basilar artery cross-sectional areas, arterial wall thicknesses, hippocampal degeneration scores and biochemical analyses were measured in all groups.	Both erythropoietin and darbepoetin alpha treatments were found to attenuate cerebral vasospasm and provide neuroprotection after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits. Darbepoetin alpha revealed better morphometric and histopathological results than erythropoietin among experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm.	Our findings, for the first time, showed that darbepoetin alpha can prevent vasospasm and provides neuroprotection following experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Moreover, darbepoetin alpha showed better results when compared with erythropoietin."}

A systematic review of approaches to benzodiazepine discontinuation in general practice and out-patient settings was undertaken. Routine care was compared with three treatment approaches: brief interventions, gradual dose reduction (GDR) and psychological interventions. GDR was compared with GDR plus psychological interventions or substitutive pharmacotherapies.	Inclusion criteria were met by 24 studies, and a further eight were identified by future search. GDR [odds ratio (OR) = 5.96, confidence interval (CI) = 2.08-17.11] and brief interventions (OR = 4.37, CI = 2.28-8.40) provided superior cessation rates at post-treatment to routine care. Psychological treatment plus GDR were superior to both routine care (OR = 3.38, CI = 1.86-6.12) and GDR alone (OR = 1.82, CI = 1.25-2.67). However, substitutive pharmacotherapies did not add to the impact of GDR (OR = 1.30, CI = 0.97-1.73), and abrupt substitution of benzodiazepines by other pharmacotherapy was less effective than GDR alone (OR = 0.30, CI = 0.14-0.64). Few studies on any technique had significantly greater benzodiazepine discontinuation than controls at follow-up.	Providing an intervention is more effective than routine care. Psychological interventions may improve discontinuation above GDR alone. While some substitutive pharmacotherapies may have promise, current evidence is insufficient to support their use."}

For this retrospective analysis, 42 women and 42 men from the Innsbruck RLS database matched by age and therapy were included. Demographic data as well as different severity scales (IRLS, RLS-6 and CGI) were evaluated. Laboratory parameters included several indicators of serum iron status. In all patients, polysomnography was performed according to the AASM guidelines, and periodic leg movements during sleep were scored according to the AASM criteria. IRLS, RLS-6 and CGI revealed more severe symptoms in women (IRLS median [range]: 17.5 [0-35] versus 13.5 [0-32], p = 0.028; RLS-6 median [range]: 18 [0-39] versus 12 [1-42], p = 0.014). Women had lower serum ferritin levels than men (median [range] in μg L[-1] : 74 [9-346] versus 167 [15-389], p < 0.001). Twenty-two women and eight men (53.7% versus 22.2%, p = 0.003) had ferritin values below 75 μg L[-1] .

Dementia is most prevalent of all. In general scenario, a dementia patient lacks proper guidance in searching out the way to return back at his/her home. Thus, increasing the risk of getting damaged at individual-health level. Therefore, it is important to track their movement in more sophisticated manner as possible. With emergence of wearables, GPS sensors and Internet of Things (IoT), such devices have become available in public domain. Smartphone apps support caregiver to locate the dementia patients in real-time. RF, GSM, 3G, Wi-Fi and 4G technology fill the communication gap between patient and caregiver to bring them closer. In this paper, we incorporated 7 most popular wearables for investigation to seek appropriateness for dementia tracking in recent times in systematic manners. We performed an in-depth review of these wearables as per the cost, technology wise and application wise characteristics. A case novel study i.e. IoT-based Force Sensor Resistance enabled System-FSRIoT, has been proposed and implemented to validate the effectiveness of IoT in the domain of smarter dementia patient tracking in wearable form factor.

Neurocognitive dual-process models attribute substance use disorders and risk behaviours during adolescence to an imbalance between an overactivated affective-automatic system (involved in motivational and affective processing) and a reflective system (involved in cognitive inhibitory control). The aim of the present study was to investigate at the electrophysiological level the degree to which the motivational value of alcohol-related stimuli modulates the inhibition of a prepotent response in binge drinkers. First-year university students (n = 151, 54 % females) classified as binge drinkers (n = 71, ≥6 binge drinking episodes, defined as 5/7 standard drinks per occasion in the last 180 days) and controls (n = 80, <6 binge drinking episodes in the last 180 days) performed a beverage Go/NoGo task (pictures of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks were presented according to the condition as Go or NoGo stimuli; Go probability = 0.75) during event-related potential recording. In binge drinkers but not controls, the amplitude of the anterior N2-NoGo was larger in response to nonalcohol than in response to alcohol pictures. No behavioural difference in task performance was observed. In terms of dual-process models, binge drinkers may require increased activation to monitor conflict in order to compensate for overactivation of the affective-automatic system caused by alcohol-related bias."}

In experiments on rodents, hypothermia in the postischemic period that is introduced up to several hours after reperfusion and is maintained for one day followed by a slow rewarming, significantly protects hippocampal neurons against damage. The mode of action of hypothermia is apparently non-specific and multi-focal in widely progressing cascade reactions in ischemic cells; namely, suppressing: (1) glutamate surge followed by; (2) intraneuronal calcium mobilization; (3) sustained activation of glutamate receptors; (4) dysfunction of blood brain barrier; (5) proliferation of microglial cells; and (6) production of superoxide anions and nitric oxide. In addition, mild hypothermia modulates processes in ischemic condition at the level of cell nucleus, such as the binding of transcription factor AP-1 to DNA, and ameliorates the depression of protein synthesis. This non-specific and widely affecting manner might explain why hypothermia is superior to any medicine developed. Recent clinical trials of mild hypothermia in various individual institutions have revealed significantly beneficial outcomes in some cases, along with an accumulation of practical knowledge of techniques and treatments. Large scale randomized studies involving multiple institutions as well as exchange of informations and ideas are needed for further development of hypothermia treatment."}

Here, we examine the relationship between the motor neuron disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is caused by reduced levels of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein, and the actin-bundling protein Plastin 3 (PLS3). Increased PLS3 levels suppress symptoms in a subset of SMA patients and ameliorate defects in SMA disease models, but the functional connection between PLS3 and SMN is poorly understood.	We provide immunohistochemical and biochemical evidence for large protein complexes localized in vertebrate motor neuron processes that contain PLS3, SMN, and members of the hnRNP F/H family of proteins. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) SMA model, we determine that overexpression of PLS3 or loss of the C. elegans hnRNP F/H ortholog SYM-2 enhances endocytic function and ameliorates neuromuscular defects caused by decreased SMN-1 levels. Furthermore, either increasing PLS3 or decreasing SYM-2 levels suppresses defects in a C. elegans ALS model.	We propose that hnRNP F/H act in the same protein complex as PLS3 and SMN and that the function of this complex is critical for endocytic pathways, suggesting that hnRNP F/H proteins could be potential targets for therapy development."}

Under general anesthesia, we performed the BASC procedure to treat five patients with traumatic CCF. Percutaneous access was obtained via the right femoral artery, and a 7F sheath was inserted, or alternatively, a bifemoral 6F approach was accomplished. A microcatheter was inserted into the cavernous sinus over a 0.014-inch microwire through the fistulous point; the microcatheter was placed distal from the fistula point, and a 'U-turn' maneuver was performed. Through the same carotid access, a compliant balloon was advanced to cross the point of the fistula and cover the whole carotid tear. Large coils were inserted using the microcatheter in the cavernous sinus. Coils filled the adjacent cavernous sinus, respecting the balloon. Immediate complete angiographic resolution was achieved, and an early angiographic control (mean = 2.6 months) indicated complete stability without recanalization. The clinical follow-up has been uneventful without any recurrence (mean = 15.2 months). An endovascular approach is optimal for direct CCF. Because the detachable balloon has been withdrawn from the market, covered stenting requires antiplatelet therapy and its patency is unconfirmed, but cavernous sinus coiling remains an excellent treatment option. Currently, there is no detailed description of the BASC procedure. We provide detailed angiograms with suitable descriptions of the exact fistula point, and venous drainage pathways.

The objectives of this study were to investigate patients' participation rate in the discussion of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) / Do-Not-Attempt-Resuscitation (DNAR) order, and in the discussion that the patient is at his/her EOL stage (EOL disclosure), and to explore their associated factors.	This is a retrospective chart review study. The participants were all the patients who were hospitalized and died in a university-affiliated teaching hospital (tertiary medical facility) in central Tokyo, Japan during the period from April 2018 to March 2019. The following patients were excluded: (1) cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival; (2) stillbirth; (3) under 18 years old at the time of death; and (4) refusal by their bereaved family. Presence or absence of CPR/DNAR discussion and EOL disclosure, patients' involvement in those discussions, and their associated factors were investigated.	CPR/DNAR discussions were observed in 336 out of the 358 patients (93.9%). However, 224 of these discussions were carried out without a patient (patient participation rate 33.3%). Male gender (odds ratio (OR) = 2.37 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-4.25]), living alone (OR = 2.51 [1.34-4.71]), and 1 year or more from the date of diagnosis (OR = 1.78 [1.03-3.10]) were associated with higher patient's participation in CPR/DNAR discussions. The EOL disclosure was observed in 341 out of the 358 patients (95.3%). However, 170 of the discussions were carried out without the patient (patient participation rate 50.1%). Patients who died of cancer (OR = 2.41[1.45-4.03]) and patients without mental illness (OR=2.41 [1.11-5.25]) were more likely to participate in EOL disclosure.	In this clinical sample, only up to half of the patients participated in CPR/DNAR discussions and EOL disclosure. Female, living with family, a shorter period from the diagnosis, non-cancer, and mental illness presence are risk factors for lack of patients' participation in CPR/DNAR or EOL discussions. Further attempts to facilitate patients' participation, based on their preference, are warranted."}

Serum from 9 of 19 patients with the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and from 2 of 6 patients with the familial form caused a reduction in the proportion of sprouting terminal axons, as compared with that found in muscles treated with serum from controls or diabetic patients. Immunoglobulin from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, when tested on immunoblots, recognized a 56-kilodalton protein secreted by denervated rat diaphragm muscle; rabbit antiserum raised against this protein also suppressed terminal axonal sprouting. Thus, we have detected an antibody in the serum of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that inhibits sprouting of neurons and subsequent reinnervation of skeletal muscle. Whether this antibody is of primary pathogenic importance or represents a secondary response to neuromuscular destruction is not known. In either case, serum from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may provide reagents for studies of the trophic communications between muscle and motor neurons."}

We aim to resolve these activation changes using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings.	Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings from 9 patients with epilepsy were used in the analysis. Our method employed the whole scalp EEG data to generate regressors for the analysis of fMRI data using the general linear model.	We were able to resolve, with milliseconds temporal resolution, changes in activation patterns involving suspected epileptic foci and other brain regions in the epileptic network during spike and slow wave. Using summary maps (called SSWAS maps) which show the activation frequency of voxels, we found that suspected epileptic foci tend to be significantly active during this interval. SSWAS maps also enabled the detection of the epileptic foci in 4 of 5 patients where the conventional event-timing-based analysis failed to identify.	These findings demonstrated the efficacy of the method and the potential application of SSWAS maps to identify epileptic foci.	The method could help resolve activation changes during epileptic spike and could provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology of these changes."}

Although the six most predominant bacterial groups/genera/species covered on average 71.3% of total intestinal bacteria, our analysis was not comprehensive compared to metagenome analysis or 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.	In PD, the number of Lactobacillus was higher, while the sum of analyzed bacteria, Clostridium coccoides group, and Bacteroides fragilis group were lower than controls. Additionally, the sum of putative hydrogen-producing bacteria was lower in PD. A linear regression model to predict disease durations demonstrated that C. coccoides group and Lactobacillus gasseri subgroup had the largest negative and positive coefficients, respectively. As a linear regression model to predict stool frequencies showed that these bacteria were not associated with constipation, changes in these bacteria were unlikely to represent worsening of constipation in the course of progression of PD. In PD, the serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein levels were lower than controls, while the levels of serum diamine oxidase, a marker for intestinal mucosal integrity, remained unchanged in PD.	The permeability to LPS is likely to be increased without compromising the integrity of intestinal mucosa in PD. The increased intestinal permeability in PD may make the patients susceptible to intestinal dysbiosis. Conversely, intestinal dysbiosis may lead to the increased intestinal permeability. One or both of the two mechanisms may be operational in development and progression of PD."}

The surgical modality was most often opted for in the following cases: patients with hematomas exceeding 4 cm in diameter; patients with hematomas causing a pronounced dislocation of cerebral structures; patients with multiple hematomas that can be accessed through a bone flap. Hematomas smaller than 4 cm in diameter as well as those located in several brain regions were found to tend easily to resorption at the control computer tomography due to which we preferred treating them using conservative therapeutic methods. This therapeutic approach to the patients with hematomas is supported by the statistical analysis. Comparison of the groups of survivors and nonsurvivors shows that the former predominated in cases of hematomas located in the frontal lobe; the latter are predominant when the hematomas are located in the temporal lobe of the brain. There was no difference between the groups of surgically and conservatively treated patients with respect to the outcome of the disease if it is improvement or death. In the group of patients who underwent conservative treatment there was a predominance of those patients that showed no improvement of the initial state. The following conclusions can be made: 1. Surgical treatment is most often administered to patients with hematomas greater than 4 cm in diameter and hematomas causing dislocation of the cerebral structures. 2.

Thirty-two patients (mean age 47 years) with histologically proven or suspected high grade glioma (n = 12) or metastatic brain lesions (n = 20) were prospectively examined by MR imaging. After the administration of gadolinium dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) the lesions were imaged with a T1-weighted MT-fast low angle shot (FLASH) pulse sequence and with a conventional T1-weighted SE sequence without MT saturation.	The mean CNR of enhancing lesions on T1-weighted MT-FLASH was 15 +/- 5 compared to 11 +/- 4 on SE images, representing a significant (p < .01) improvement. The mean tumor diameter of malignant gliomas was significantly (p < .01) larger measured on T1-weighted MT-FLASH images compared to those obtained from T1-weighted SE images and were comparable for metastatic lesions.

However, few studies have clearly discussed the protective effects and potential mechanism of PIP in different neurological diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of PIP against 3-nitropropioninc acid (3-NP) induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in animals.Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered control group, received normal saline (p.o.). Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg.b.wt., i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received PIP (10 mg/kg.b.wt., p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP injection. Upon termination of treatment schedule, behavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes. The brain striatal tissue was used for the estimation of monoamine oxidase activity and serotonin level. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by GFAP immunostaining.Results: Our results showed that 3-NP induced behavioral impairments are attenuated by PIP co-treatment. Next, the extent of neuronal loss and astrocytes activation was reduced in the striatal brain region in PIP treated rats. Finally, it was observed that PIP alleviated the behavioral, biochemical, immunohistochemical and histological alterations.Conclusion: The results of the current study reveal the neuroprotective competency of PIP against Huntington disease like symptoms in rats."}

Transient global ischemia was produced by four vessel-occlusion, the occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries following the electrocautherization of the vertebral arteries. 3mg/kg of PPS or 300IU/kg of dalteparin was administered i.v. immediately after 7min-occlusion/reperfusion. Seven days after the operation, the animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and paraffinized coronal brain sections measuring 6microm in thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Neuronal damage was then estimated as a ratio of the number of degenerated neurons to that of both the surviving and degenerated neurons in three distinct area of the CA1 subfield. The ratio of neuronal death increased with the length of the occlusion-time, at 5, 7 and 10min. Both PPS and dalteparin significantly inhibited the neuronal damage induced by 7min-occlusion.

They denounced the inadequacies of an extramural service conceived of as an out-patient clinic filling the void left by the shutting down of asylums. The positions elaborated by these associations focus on four main themes: the distribution of the 'burden of care' for the ill between services and families; the ill-conceived interpretation of the families' needs owing to the professional's alleged tendency to 'point the finger of guilt' at the families themselves; the demand for greater power in regard to decisions made by the services; the interaction with the rights and liberties of the mentally ill. Two different ranges of problems are discussed. First, there is the conflict within the family between the interests and rights of its income-producing and its 'dependent' members. This conflict points not to a loss but to an overload of functions shifted to the family at a time of rising expectations for the satisfaction of needs. It therefore calls for services of a new kind, i.e. services capable of making these conflicting interests and rights compatible. Second, extramural services either reject or misinterpret the asylum's labour-saving function. These services thus ascribe care for the material life of the mentally ill to the family's own resources alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Medial septal lesions resulted not only in selective cholinergic denervation of hippocampus (Medial septal lesion + ganglionectomy; SAP + Gx) but also in hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth (IG) of adrenergic fibers (Medial septal lesion + sham ganglionectomy; SAP + IG). Saporin-induced septal lesions produced a significant reduction in hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity in all tested groups (SAP + IG +/- DSP-4 and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4), and an increase in noradrenaline concentration in the SAP + IG group. Visualization of noradrenergic fibers by histofluorescence revealed a mixture of fine and thick varicosities in the SAP + IG but only fine fibers in control and SAP + Gx animals. SAP + IG + DSP-4 lesions produced significant reduction in noradrenaline concentration in all groups with a concomitant decrease in visualization of central noradrenergic fibers in dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Treatment of SAP + IG animals with DSP-4 left mostly thick fibers, probably derived from peripheral sympathetic ingrowth. No fluorescence was seen in either the control + DSP-4 or SAP + Gx + DSP-4 animals. Apoptotic-like changes, using in situ oligonucleotide ligation techniques, were also assessed. Proapoptotic changes were seen in the SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 group as compared to CON +/- DSP-4 groups. SAP + IG regardless of DSP-4 treatment protected hippocampal cells from apoptotic cell death when compared to positive control and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 groups. In summary, elevated noradrenaline concentration following specific cholinergic denervation probably reflects compensatory hippocampal ingrowth originating from the peripheral sympathetic system which may be responsible for neuroprotective effects, i.e., antiapoptosis-like effect. Since cholinergic and noradrenergic systems are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive function, knowing how these neurotransmitters work after specific lesions may be of importance as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease and as a potential target for Alzheimer's disease drug therapies."}

It is a complex condition that develops over many decades in the human brain. For such apparently intractable diseases, mathematical models can offer an additional means of investigation. As a contribution to this process, the authors have developed an ordinary differential equation model of the most important cellular processes that have been associated with PD. The model describes the following processes: (i) cellular generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species; (ii) the possible damage and removal of the protein -synuclein and, (iii) feedback interactions between damaged α-synuclein and reactive oxygen species. Simulation results show that the Parkinsonian condition, with elevated oxidative stress and misfolded α-synuclein accumulation, can be induced in the model by known PD risk factors such as ageing, exposure to toxins and genetic defects. The significant outcome of the paper is the demonstration that it is possible to reproduce in silico the multi-factorial interactions that characterise the pathogenesis of PD. As such, the model provides a systematic explanation of the variability and heterogeneity of PD and provides the basis for computational studies of further facets of this complex multi-factorial condition.

We train a deep learning based segmentation model using 2D image patches and image slices in following steps: 1) training FCNNs using image patches; 2) training CRFs as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) using image slices with parameters of FCNNs fixed; and 3) fine-tuning the FCNNs and the CRF-RNN using image slices. Particularly, we train 3 segmentation models using 2D image patches and slices obtained in axial, coronal and sagittal views respectively, and combine them to segment brain tumors using a voting based fusion strategy.

We enrolled Japanese spinal cord injury patients with cystometrically confirmed neurogenic detrusor overactivity who experienced urinary incontinence at least once a week either because they were refractory to anticholinergics or had to discontinue treatment because of adverse events. Patients received 200 units of onabotulinumtoxinA injected into the bladder wall after a 2-week washout of anticholinergics, and urodynamic variables were assessed before and 1 month after injection. Catheterization and urinary incontinence data, as well as International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form scores, were assessed before injection and every month thereafter until the cessation of treatment effects.	The study enrolled 19 patients (13 men, six women, age range 22-67 years). One month after injection, the mean number of urinary incontinence episodes decreased from 4.3 to 1.5 times/day (P = 0.004), and the maximum cystometric capacity increased from 100 mL to 296 mL (P = 0.0004).

The remaining 14 low-risk neonates did not receive AMICAR, and for purposes of analysis were combined with the 1990 group. AMICAR was administered just prior to or after cannulation (100 mg/kg, intravenously) and was infused continuously at 30 mg/kg/h until decannulation.

To mitigate the accumulation of misfolded proteins, an endoplasmic reticulum stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) occurs in the AD hippocampus. However, chronic UPR activation can lead to apoptosis and the upregulation of beta-amyloid and tau production. Therefore, UPR activation in the olfactory system could be one of the first changes in AD. In this study, we investigated whether two proteins that signal UPR activation are expressed in the olfactory system of AD cases with low or high amounts of aggregate pathology. We used immunohistochemistry to label two markers of UPR activation (p-PERK and p-eIF2α) concomitantly with neuronal markers (NeuN and PGP9.5) and pathology markers (beta-amyloid and tau) in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex and the CA1 region of the hippocampus in AD and normal cases. We show that UPR activation, as indicated by p-PERK and p-eIF2α expression, is significantly increased throughout the olfactory system in AD cases with low (Braak stage III-IV) and high-level (Braak stage V-VI) pathology. We further show that UPR activation occurs in the mitral cells and in the anterior olfactory nucleus of the olfactory bulb where tau and amyloid pathology is abundant. However, UPR activation is not present in neurons when they contain NFTs and only rarely occurs in neurons containing diffuse tau aggregates. We conclude that UPR activation is prevalent in all regions of the olfactory system and support previous findings suggesting that UPR activation likely precedes NFT formation. Our data indicate that chronic UPR activation in the olfactory system might contribute to the olfactory dysfunction that occurs early in the pathogenesis of AD."}

Responses in the frontoparietal network correlated with and mirrored these behavioral effects, with greater responses to positive than negative feedback in non-anxious controls but not in participants with SAD. Responses to social feedback in the anterior insula and other areas mediated the effects of negative versus positive feedback on changes in self-evaluation. In non-anxious participants, frontoparietal brain areas may contribute to a positive social learning bias. In SAD, frontoparietal areas are less recruited overall and less attuned to positive feedback, possibly reflecting differences in attention allocation and cognitive regulation. More negatively biased brain responses and social learning could contribute to maintaining a negative self-image in SAD and other internalizing disorders, thereby offering important new targets for interventions."}

This framework is used to review literature from the past decade on access to health care and health promotion for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Review of the literature indicates an emerging evidence base for health promotion programs for persons with IDD. Research in health care and health promotion access requires improvements in surveillance and measurement of quality of life, as well as increased participation of persons with IDD and their families in its implementation. While international guidelines for primary health care have been developed for people with IDD, US guidelines are specialty focused and address specific conditions. Despite its recognized importance, there is surprisingly little information on training programs for health care providers to improve care of persons with IDD. Financing of health care continues to threaten access to comprehensive care for persons with IDD, particularly regarding coordination of care and availability of providers who accept Medicaid patients. Community-based sources of health care have been slow to emerge, and there is clear need for assumption of responsibility for providing care to persons with IDD. Future US policy should include consideration of environmental factors in health care access."}

However, although this issue is one of the most important aspects to further understanding the cell biology of AD, no quantitative examination of microtubule diminution in AD and its relationship with PHFs has been performed. To examine this issue directly, we undertook a morphometric study of brain biopsy specimens from AD and control cases. Ultrastructural analysis of neurons was performed to compare the microtubule assembly state in neurons of diseased and control cases and to examine the effect of PHF accumulation. We found that both number and total length of microtubules were significantly and selectively reduced in pyramidal neurons from AD in comparison to control cases (P = 0.000004) but that this decrement in microtubule density was surprisingly unrelated to PHFs (P = 0.8). Further, we found a significant age-dependent decrease in microtubule density with aging in the control cases (P = 0.016). These findings suggest that reduction in microtubule assembly is not dependent on tau abnormalities of AD and aging."}

We investigated an A --> G substitution polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of exon 8 (E8) of DRD2 with allele frequencies of f(G) = 0.295 - 0.329.

However, the frequent homozygous E8 A/A genotype with f(AA) = 0.47 - 0.48 was associated with increased anxiety and depression scores in alcoholics during the follow up after clinical detoxification treatment. In addition, E8 A/A was associated with increased suicide attempts and showed a tendency towards more severe withdrawal symptoms, early relapse and reduced responsiveness to the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine. Regression analysis revealed the DRD2 E8 genotype as the only significant factor determining withdrawal severity in female alcoholics. The findings suggest an influence of the DRD2 genotype on the neuropharmacological effects of chronic alcohol exposure and the clinical course of alcoholism."}

We characterized the occurrence of psychosis in relation to dementia severity and determined if subjects with Alzheimer disease and psychosis had a greater neurofibrillary tangle or senile plaque burden than subjects with Alzheimer disease and no psychosis.	One hundred nine subjects with Alzheimer disease were followed longitudinally with semistructured assessments in order to assign a Clinical Dementia Rating and determine whether psychosis was present. After the subjects died, their brains were obtained for histological examination. Analysis of variance was used to compare the densities of neurofibrillary tangles, total senile plaques, and cored senile plaques in subjects with psychosis vs subjects without psychosis, in several neocortical regions, the hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex.	Psychosis occurred commonly in Alzheimer disease, affecting 63% of subjects. The frequency of psychosis increased with increasing dementia severity. More importantly, we found that subjects with psychosis had a 2.3-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.9) greater density of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles than did subjects without psychosis. The increase was independent of dementia severity. No similar relationship with psychosis was seen for total senile plaques or cored senile plaques.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included a total of 79 patients with ADHD or ASDs and controls in the Van region of Turkey. The control group included subjects of matching age and sex with no ADHD, ASDs, or chronic disease and taking no vitamins. The hematological parameters of the patients, including MPV, vitamin B12, and vitamin D, were assessed. RESULTS The study included a total of 79 children and adolescents aged 2-18 years (32 females and 47 males). Of the patients, 36 were in the ADHD group, 18 in the ASDs group, and 25 in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in hematological parameters between the groups, but there were significant differences in terms of vitamin D and vitamin B12. The patient groups showed lower levels of vitamin B12 and vitamin D. In the ADHD group, there was a negative correlation between both vitamins and MPV (p<0.05). Partial correlation analysis of the ADHD group showed that MPV in particular was negatively correlated to vitamin D, and not to vitamin B12 (p: 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Both ADHD and ASDs may accompany increased risk for cardiovascular disease due to the presence of vitamin B12 and D deficiency and their own characteristics. Therefore, these disorders should be closely followed up."}

Human control and AD postmortem brain tissues were homogenized and sedimented by ultracentrifugation in the presence of sarkosyl to enrich detergent-insoluble protein aggregates including pathologic phosphorylated tau, the core component of neurofibrillary tangles in AD. Western blotting demonstrated the differential solubility of aggregated phosphorylated-tau and the detergent-soluble protein, Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA1) in control and AD brain. Proteomic analysis also revealed enrichment of β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, snRNP70 (U1-70K), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of AD brain compared to those of control, consistent with previous tissue fractionation strategies.

However, how the activity and neuroplasticity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) change after contextual morphine withdrawal conditioning and what factors determine this change remain to be determined. In this paper, using immunohistochemical and single-cell microinjection techniques, combining behavioral assay, we found that (1) contextual withdrawal conditioning increases the expression of c-Fos, but not Arc, in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (2) at the first day after conditioning, conditioned context has no influence on the expression of c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (3) at the 14th day after conditioning, conditioned context increases the expression of both c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (4) the inhibition of dendritic spines of the ACC or projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC attenuates the conditioned context-induced increase of Arc expression in the ACC and abolishes the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning. These results suggest that the ACC may exhibit a change in neuroplasticity at the 14th day after conditioning, and the dendritic spines of the ACC and the projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC are key determinants for conditioned context induced-increase in Arc expression in the ACC and the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning."}

The angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R) is distributed in brain regions responsible for the control of stress response through peripheral and central sympathetic hyperactivation as well as in the hypothalamic paraventricular region, areas known for the release of several neurotransmitters related to inflammatory response facilitation. This relationship leads to the assumption that AT1R might be the receptor most related to the central deleterious actions of angiotensin II. New evidences from clinical studies have shown a possible role for RAS in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BD), a multifactorial disorder with acknowledged presence of neuronal damage via oxidative stress in brain areas such as hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum. Given the studies highlighting AT1R activation as a central pro-inflammatory pathway and, conversely, the involvement of inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of BD; this paper hypothesizes the use of AT1R antagonists for BD management and prevention of its neuroprogression, due to their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects."}

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of disgust-inducing visual stimuli in OCD have suggested disorder specific alterations in brain activation during these tasks.	Subjects with OCD and healthy controls (HC) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) brain scanning after injection of H(2) (15)O.

Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to analyze regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data.	Comparison of OCD subjects with controls on differences in rCBF across the disgust-inducing and resting tasks showed that OCD was characterized by greater rCBF in the left insula.

Anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal activity increased during anticipatory anxiety in both groups, and comparison of rCBF in OCD subjects with controls in anticipatory anxiety versus resting state also found no significant differences.	OCD may be characterized by a disruption in disgust processing, such that there is a decrease in appropriate disgust (such as that evoked by observing disgust in others) and an increase in inappropriate disgust (such as that evoked by contamination stimuli). The insula may play a particularly important role in mediating such putative disruptions. The sample studied here was small, and further work is required to determine whether disgust-induced activation patterns in OCD are more apparent in specific subtypes of this disorder, whether they are specific to OCD, and whether they are normalized by treatment."}

Optical Express, London, United Kingdom.	Retrospective case series.	The study analyzed data from 5 years of follow-up of amblyopic eyes that were implanted with iris-fixated pIOLs and had a preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 6/15 or worse. Visual acuity, refraction, endothelial cell count, and complications were assessed.	Data for 103 eyes were analyzed as 2 groups. Group 1 comprised 82 eyes with myopia or myopic astigmatism, and Group 2 contained 21 eyes with hyperopia or hyperopic astigmatism. The mean preoperative sphere in Group 1 was -13.42 diopters (D) ± 5.62 (SD) with a mean cylinder of -2.35 ± 1.75 D. In Group 2, the mean sphere and cylinder were +6.77 ± 1.91 D and -2.63 ± 2.43 D, respectively. The mean CDVA improved from 0.51 ± 0.15 logMAR to 0.34 ± 0.16 logMAR (P<.001) in Group 1 and from 0.54 ± 0.17 logMAR to 0.46 ± 0.14 logMAR in Group 2 (P<.005). The safety index was 1.48 in Group 1 and 1.19 in Group 2. The efficacy index was 1.21 in Group 1 and 1.00 in Group 2. The mean gain in CDVA was statistically significantly greater in Group 1 (0.17 ± 0.14 logMAR) than in Group 2 (0.08 ± 0.11 logMAR). Two or more lines of CDVA were gained by 48.8% of eyes in Group 1 and by 19.0% of eyes in Group 2.	The iris-fixated pIOL was a safe and effective option for improving visual acuity in adult amblyopic eyes.	Dr. Schallhorn is a consultant to Abbott Medical Optics, Inc.

The clinic sample included 181 children (ages 3 to 8) and their mothers and fathers who were participating in a parenting treatment study for children with behavioral problems. Mother-father agreement for ratings of internalizing problems was found to be moderate and consistent with previous research. Regression analyses revealed that parental stress, but not depression, predicted some of the variance associated with mother-father rating discrepancies. A gender effect was also found such that parent discrepancies were larger for girls than for boys. Much of the variance associated with rating discrepancies was left unexplained. Implications for both research and practice are discussed."}

We studied cognitive functioning in four domains at baseline and change over time in fifty-seven cognitively intact individuals from the EMIF-AD 90+ study. Predictors were Aβ status determined by [[18] F]-flutemetamol PET (normal = Aβ - vs. abnormal = Aβ+), cortical thickness in 34 regions and hippocampal volume. Mediation analyses were performed to test whether effects of Aβ on cognitive decline were mediated by atrophy of specific anatomical brain areas.	Subjects had a mean age of 92.7 ± 2.9 years, of whom 19 (33%) were Aβ+. Compared to Aβ-, Aβ+ individuals showed steeper decline on memory (β ± SE = -0.26 ± 0.09), and processing speed (β ± SE = -0.18 ± 0.08) performance over 1.5 years (P < 0.05). Furthermore, medial and lateral temporal lobe atrophy was associated with steeper decline in memory and language across individuals. Mediation analyses revealed that part of the memory decline observed in Aβ+ individuals was mediated through parahippocampal atrophy.	These results show that Aβ abnormality even in the oldest old with initially normal cognition is not part of normal aging, but is associated with a decline in cognitive functioning. Other pathologies may also contribute to decline in the oldest old as cortical thickness predicted cognitive decline similarly in individuals with and without Aβ pathology."}

Therefore, maintaining the quality of life (QoL) of caregivers is an integral part of dementia care.	To explore the relationship between the QoL of people with dementia and their caregivers in Indonesia.	This is a cross-sectional study using binary correlations to analyze the relationship between people with dementia and caregivers' QoL. Conducted in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, the subjects were 42 people diagnosed with dementia according to the PPDGJ-III (adapted from the ICD 10) and 42 primary caregivers with at least 6 hours duration of caregiving per day. The QoL of people with dementia was measured by EuroQol-5D and VAS EQ-5D, while severity of dementia was measured by MMSE. Caregivers underwent an interview using WHO Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) and NPI.	Most caregivers were women, aged 40-70 years old. The study found caregivers' QoL environmental domain strongly correlated with people with dementia's QoL (r = 0.839). Severity of dementia had a strong correlation with caregivers' QoL physical domain (r = 0.946). Age, duration of caregiving per day, period of care provided by caregivers, and caregiver's distress had a strong correlation with caregiver QoL for specific domains.	There was a strong correlation between people with dementia's QoL and caregiver QoL, so in managing dementia, clinicians should consider caregivers' wellbeing as an essential part significantly affecting the quality of elderly care improvement."}

Nevertheless, these modalities are often insufficient for achieving a definite diagnosis. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the combination of these tools.	The SPECT radiotracers [I]-N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) and meta-[I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) were used to research presynaptic dopaminergic projections (DAT SPECT) and myocardial adrenergic innervation (MIBG scintigraphy), respectively. PD patients (n=15; age: 61.5±13.6 years) and non-PD patients (n=19; age: 62.6±14.2 years) who underwent both tests were enrolled in this study. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were used to set the cutoff values of the specific binding ratio in DAT SPECT and the heart to mediastinum ratio in delayed scan in MIBG scintigraphy for differentiating PD from non-PD. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and test accuracy of the individual methods and also the combination of these two modalities.	When DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy were used individually, they showed mild accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD (DAT, 67.6%; MIBG, 67.6%). The combination of the two approaches using cutoff values of less than 3.24 for the specific binding ratio and less than 2.745 for the delayed heart to mediastinum ratio enabled more accurate differentiation between PD and non-PD. The accuracy of these indices in distinguishing PD from non-PD was 79.4%.	These results suggested that the combination of DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy may improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD."}

However, little research has focused on the association between sleep and obesity in this population. The present study examined the association between reported time in bed (TIB) and body mass index (BMI) in YAs. Participants were 250 18-25 year-olds who completed an online survey assessing several factors associated with weight control. After controlling for significant covariates, TIB was significantly associated with BMI. Specifically, 'less than 6 hours/night' TIB was associated with increased BMI compared to the referent category (7 to <8 hours/night) (p = .01). Findings demonstrate that young adults who report shorter TIB are more likely to be classified as having higher BMI."}

Whether that assumption is valid, and how it might impact assessment of PTSS, is unknown.	Survivors in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort study completed an assessment of PTSS without cancer orientation, global psychological functioning, perceived stress, and cancer-related anxiety.	Participants (n = 2969; Mage = 32.5 ± 8.5 years, 24.1 years since diagnosis, 49.1% female) obtained a mean score on the PTSD Checklist of 27.7, which is comparable to a normative population. Using established cutoffs, 11.8% obtained scores in the at-risk range. Multivariable modeling indicated that psychological factors [global distress (p < 0.0001), perceived stress (p = 0.001), cancer-related anxiety (p < 0.0001)] and demographic variables [female gender (p < 0.0001), survivors with less than a college education (p = 0.002)] were risk factors for increased PTSS. Only 14.5% identified a cancer-related traumatic event, and there was no difference in PTSS scores between those who identified cancer vs. non-cancer events as most stressful (28.4 ± 12.6 vs. 28.5 ± 12.7, p = 0.93).	One in eight adult long-term survivors of childhood cancer had PTSS above the cutoff, though subgroups (e.g., females and those with lower education) report more distress symptoms. Most adult survivors do not identify cancer as their most stressful event.	Screening for distress in survivorship clinics should not assume that distress is directly related to the survivor's cancer experience."}

Although almost never malignant and rarely clinically expressed, pituitary tumors may cause significant morbidity in affected patients. First, given the critical location of the gland, large tumors may lead to mass effects, and, second, proliferation of hormone-secreting pituitary cells leads to endocrine syndromes. Acromegaly results from oversecretion of growth hormone (GH) by the proliferating somatotrophs. Despite the significant efforts made over the last decade, still little is known about the genetic causes of common pituitary tumors and even less is applied from this knowledge therapeutically. In this review, we present an update on the genetic syndromes associated with pituitary adenomas and discuss the related genetic defects. We next review findings on sporadic, non-genetic, pituitary tumors with an emphasis on pathways and animal models of pituitary disease. In conclusion, we attempt to present an overall, integrative approach to the human molecular genetics of both familiar and sporadic pituitary tumors."}

During weeks 4 to 7 these two groups were each randomly split into treatment by relaxation or by exposure in vivo, and during weeks 7 to 10 all patients had exposure in vivo. Double blind assessments were made at weeks 4, 7, 10, 18, 36, 62 and 114. Results are reported to one year. Clomipramine produced significant improvement in rituals, mood and social adjustment, but only in those patients who initially had depressed mood. The clomipramine effect was maximum from weeks 10 to 18 and diminished thereafter. On stopping clomipramine patients often relapsed and improved again on restarting the drug. Relaxation produced little change. Exposure produced significant lasting improvement in rituals, but less change in mood; improvement generalized to social adjustment at follow-up. Clomipramine plus exposure had a slight additive but not interactional effect. Clomipramine enhanced compliance both with exposure and with relaxation. Clomipramine is useful for compulsive ritualizers with depressed mood, but may need continuation for over a year and combination with exposure in vivo. Exposure in vivo remains the treatment of choice for rituals without depressed mood."}

Immunoblotting studies confirmed the presence of NF-H and NF-M. Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting also demonstrated the presence of NSE, but not of glial fibrillary acidic protein or other glial markers. Immunocytochemical studies also indicated the presence of proline hydroxylase, an enzyme found in fibroblasts but not neurons.

Longitudinal and experimental training studies are examined in detail, as these are considered most appropriate for exploring a causal hypothesis of this nature. A particular focus of our analysis is the degree to which studies to date have controlled for existing literacy skills in their participants and the influence that these skills might have on performance on phonological awareness tasks. We conclude that no study has provided unequivocal evidence that there is a causal link from competence in phonological awareness to success in reading and spelling acquisition. However, we believe that such a study is possible and outline some ideas for its design and implementation."}
