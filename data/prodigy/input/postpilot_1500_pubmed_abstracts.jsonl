The recombinant plasmid pcDNA3-beta-NGF was transfected into BMSC, and NGF expression and its biological activity in vitro were detected. BMSC modified by the NGF gene were then grafted into the corpus striatum of PD rats, and the rotation behavior was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-transplantation. A significant improvement in rotation behavior was observed in PD rats subjected to cell transplantation, especially in PD rats receiving NGF-modified BMSC. The genetically modified BMSC survived and expressed beta-NGF but did not differentiate into tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in vivo. The present findings suggested that genetically modified BMSC could be effective for PD treatment, and the mechanisms might involve the neuroprotective effects of beta-NGF."}

The effect of dominant mutations in K8 or K18 during embryonic development and tissue homeostasis has not been examined so far. Here we demonstrate that the dominant mutation hK18 R89C, that is highly similar to hK14 R125C, causing EBS in humans, leads to cell type-specific lethality in mice, depending on the ratio of mutant to endogenous keratins. Mice expressing hK18 R89C in the absence of endogenous K19 and K18 died at mid-gestation from defects in trophoblast giant cells, accompanied by haematomas. A single, endogenous K18 allele rescued embryonic lethality but caused aggregation of keratins in all adult internal epithelia, surprisingly without spontaneous cell fragility. Closer analysis revealed that both filaments and aggregates coexisted in the same cell, depending on the ratio of mutant to endogenous keratins. Our results demonstrate that balanced overexpression of a wild-type keratin rescued the lethal consequences of a dominant-negative mutation. This has important implications for therapy approaches of keratinopathies, suggesting that suppressing the mutant allele is not necessary in vivo."}

The pathogenesis of hydrocephalus remains unclear; however, recent reports suggest the possible involvement of abnormal osmotic gradients. Here we explore the kinetics associated with manipulating CSF osmolarity on ventricle volume (VV) in the normal rat brain.	CSF was made hyper-osmotic by introducing 10KD dextran into the lateral ventricle, either by acute injection at different concentrations or by chronic infusion at a single concentration. The induction and withdrawal kinetics of dextran infusion on VV were explored in both contexts.	Acute intraventricular injection of dextran caused a rapid increase in VV which completely reversed within 24 hours. These kinetics are seemingly independent of CSF osmolarity across a range spanning an order of magnitude; however, the magnitude of the transient increase in VV was proportional to CSF osmolarity. By contrast, continuous intraventricular infusion of dextran at a relatively low concentration caused a more gradual increase in VV which was very slow to reverse when infusion was suspended after five days.	We conclude that hyperosmolar CSF is sufficient to produce a proportional degree of hydrocephalus in the normal rat brain, and that this phenomenon exhibits hysteresis if CSF hyperosmolarity is persistent. Thus pathologically-induced increases in CSF osmolarity may be similarly associated with certain forms of clinical hydrocephalus. An improved understanding of this phenomenon and its kinetics may facilitate the development of novel therapies for the treatment of clinical hydrocephalus."}

This part III of the review discusses the possibility to induce adaptive antigen-specific T regulatory cells (Tregs) in the clinical situation by harnessing donor- and recipient-derived tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs) as inducers for alloantigen-specific adaptive Tregs, an effort that follows current trends to harnessing DCs for immunotherapy. This challenge is based on accumulating evidence from basic immunological work in support of the notion that presentation of antigens, including weak transplantation antigens under subimmunogenic conditions within a noninflammatory microenvironment, promotes generation of tolDCs. With respect to these basic immunological studies, which are expressively reviewed, prevention of oxidative allograft injury can be regarded as an efficient tool in the clinical situation to present alloantigens under subimmunogenic conditions within an intragraft noninflammatory milieu, thereby potentially generating tolDCs able to induce Tregs-mediated innate allotolerance. Various therapeutic strategies to prevent oxidative allograft injury occurring in both the brain-dead donor before/during organ removal and the recipient during/after donor organ reperfusion as well as therapeutic options to inhibit injury-induced molecular and cellular consequences are finally discussed."}

C57BL/6 male mice were divided into five groups: Cuprizone only (Cup-O), cuprizone undergoing depression (Cup-Dep), cuprizone housed in EE (Cup-EE), cuprizone housed in EE and undergoing depression (Cup-ED) and the control (n=9-10 per group). Depression was induced by repeated open-space forced swim. Neurobehavioral tests were conducted following a 6-week period of 0.2% cuprizone-enriched diet. The Cup-EE group performed significantly better in terms of cognition and motor functions, when compared with the Cup-O group, as evidenced by the Morris water maze (MWM; P<0.001) and rotarod performance test (P<0.05) results. Conversely, the Cup-Dep group exhibited a significant decline in performance in the MWM (P<0.001) and rotarod performance test (P<0.05), when compared with the Cup-O group. The Cup-ED group had comparable results to those of the Cup-O group, indicating a reversal of the induced depression effects. Open field test results failed to show an anxiety-like behavior in the cuprizone mouse model. It was therefore concluded that EE can improve MS-associated cognitive and motor deficits. Insights gained from these results facilitate the exploration of non-medical modes of intervention as an emerging adjuvant therapy in MS."}

However, hypoxic postconditioning (HPC) has never been reported in transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI) adult rat model. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of neuroprotection by delayed HPC against tGCI in adult rats and investigate underlying mechanisms involving the Akt/Forkhead transcription factor, class O (FoxO) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Postconditioning with 60-120 min hypoxia significantly reduced cell death in hippocampal CA1 subregion after 10 min of tGCI. Postconditioning was effective only when applied 1-2 days after tGCI. Nevertheless, the combination of hypoxic preconditioning and postconditioning provided no additive protection. Additionally, postconditioning increased phosphorylation of Akt and FoxOs after tGCI. Inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and FoxOs with LY294002 suppressed the postconditioning-induced neuroprotection. In addition, postconditioning blocked the increase of MEK and ERK phosphorylation after tGCI. Inhibiting phosphorylation of MEK and ERK with U0126 attenuated neuronal damage after tGCI. These results suggest that delayed HPC exerts neuroprotection against tGCI-induced injury in adult rats. The activation of Akt/FoxO and inactivation of MEK/ERK pathways by postconditioning contributed to the induction of neuroprotection against tGCI."}

However, trehalose is digested into glucose by trehalase and which reduced its efficacy in the disease target tissues. Therefore, searching trehalase-indigestible analogs of trehalose is a potential strategy to enhance therapeutic effect. In this study, two trehalase-indigestible trehalose analogs, lactulose and melibiose, were selected through compound topology and functional group analyses. Hydrogen-bonding network analyses suggest that the elimination of the hydrogen bond between the linker ether and aspartate 321 (D321) of human trehalase is the key for lactulose and melibiose to avoid the hydrolyzation. Using polyQ-mediated spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) cell and slice cultures, we found the aggregation was significantly prohibited by trehalose, lactulose, and melibiose, which may through up-regulating of autophagy.

A one-month treatment with dihydroprogesterone, the 5alpha-reduced derivative of progesterone, is able to partially restore the fall in Po gene expression occurring in the sciatic nerve of aged male rats, without significantly modifying the gene expression of the myelin basic protein. In cultures of neonatal Schwann cells (the peripheral nervous system elements involved in the synthesis of myelin), the addition of progesterone and of dihydroprogesterone significantly increases Po gene expression; the 3alpha-reduced metabolite of dihydroprogesterone, tetrahydroprogesterone proved to be even more effective. These data suggest that the effect of progesterone is linked to its conversion into dihydroprogesterone and especially into tetrahydroprogesterone, since Schwann cells possess the 5alpha-reductase-3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system. The data provide the first demonstration that ageing decreases the gene expression of two major components of the peripheral myelin in the sciatic nerve; they also show that this phenomenon may be partially reversed by progesterone derivatives, which might act by stimulating Po gene expression in the Schwann cells."}

Furthermore, a series of recent studies have found that DS persons display elevated levels of age biomarkers, thus supporting the notion that DS is a progeroid trait. Nowadays, due to the progressive advancements in social inclusion processes and medical assistance, DS persons live much longer than in the past; therefore, the early-onset health problems of these persons are becoming an urgent and largely unmet social and medical burden. In particular, the most important ailment of DS persons is the accelerated cognitive decline that starts when they reach about 40 years of age. This decline can be at least in part counteracted by multi-systemic approaches including early-onset cognitive training, physical activity, and psychosocial assistance. However, no pharmacological treatment is approved to counteract this decline. According to the most advanced conceptualization of Geroscience, tackling the molecular mechanisms underpinning the aging process should be a smart/feasible strategy to combat and/or delay the great majority of age-related diseases, including cognitive decline.

Experimental animal models that more closely resemble human disease are essential for the identification of effective novel therapies. We report here an extensive analysis of the 4C8 glioma model to assess its suitability for evaluating novel type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) therapies of malignant glioma. We first determined that expression of major histocompatibility complex I and II and of alphavbeta3 in the 4C8 model was comparable to that seen in human glioma cells. Next, using a panel of Delta(gamma1)34.5 HSVs, we demonstrated that, in vitro, 4C8 cells were as sensitive as human glioma cells to both infection and lysis and that the 4C8 cells supported the production of foreign gene products. Replication competence of HSV was demonstrated in vitro. Finally, 4C8 intracranial gliomas were established in immunologically competent syngeneic B6D2F1 mice, treated by intratumoral injection of selected engineered HSVs, including the interleukin-12-expressing virus, M002. Survival data from these studies demonstrated that 4C8 cells in vivo are sensitive to both direct oncolysis and HSV-mediated interleukin-12 expression. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses of immune-related infiltrating cells supported the concept that survival was prolonged in part because of antitumor actions of these cells. We conclude that the 4C8/B6D2F1 syngeneic glioma model is suitable for preclinical evaluation of HSV-based therapies and that M002 is a superior virus for the treatment of murine glioma in this model."}

Based on novel methods, including inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) and dedicated SC probabilistic atlas post-processing, the present study focuses on the in vivo characterization of the healthy SC tissue in terms of regional microstructure differences between (i) upper and lower cervical vertebral levels and (ii) sensory and motor tracts, as well as differences attributed to normal aging. Forty-eight healthy volunteers aged from 20 to 70 years old were included in the study and scanned at 3 T using axial high-resolution T2 *-w imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and ihMT, at two vertebral levels (C2 and C5). A processing pipeline with minimal user intervention, SC segmentation and spatial normalization into a reference space was implemented in order to assess quantitative morphological and structural parameters (cross-sectional areas, scalar DTI and MT/ihMT metrics) in specific white and gray matter regions of interest. The multi-parametric MRI metrics collected allowed upper and lower cervical levels to be distinguished, with higher ihMT ratio (ihMTR), higher axial diffusivity (λ∥) and lower radial diffusivity (λ⊥) at C2 compared with C5. Significant differences were also observed between white matter fascicles, with higher ihMTR and lower λ∥ in motor tracts compared with posterior sensory tracts. Finally, aging was found to be associated with significant metric alterations (decreased ihMTR and λ∥).

As such, gene therapy paradigms have been developed. Initial progress in rodent models using in situ introduction of retroviral vector producer cells to transfer a cytotoxic gene product led to phase I clinical trials with limited success, due in part to immune responses to murine producer cells along with low level gene transfer. We and others have initiated studies to determine the effectiveness of adenoviral vectors to deliver cytotoxic and/or immuno-stimulatory gene products directly to tumor. Adenoviral vectors can be purified to high titers, are relatively stable upon formulation and storage, and can infect both dividing and non-dividing tumor cells. Also, they can be introduced in situ without helper virus or producer cells. However, gene transfer to glioma tissue with recombinant adenoviruses is not efficient, with multiplicities of infection greater than 50 infectious units/cell required for efficacy. At these doses the virus induces a potent immune response that further reduces gene transfer following re-administration. The inflammatory response to low doses of recombinant adenoviral vectors is less robust and does not preclude re-administration. Thus, strategies to increase efficiency coupled to low dose administration are desirable. To accomplish low dose administration we have developed a method to formulate recombinant adenoviral vectors in biodegradable microspheres. Poly (lactic-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microspheres containing recombinant adenovirus were prepared using a double emulsion technique, and viable virus released for greater than 10 days."}

Herein we provide further evidence for IL-6 neuroprotection against NMDA-induced apoptosis and explore the signal-transduction mechanisms underlying the anti-apoptotic action of IL-6. Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) from postnatal 8-day infant rats were chronically exposed to IL-6 (40 or 120 ng/ml) for 8 days, and stimulated with NMDA (100 μM) for 30 min. To observe the signaling pathways, we employed AG490 (5 or 10 μM), an inhibitor of Janus kinases (JAKs), or LY294002 (5 or 10 μM), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), to pretreat the CGNS together with IL-6. The levels of phosphorylation for the downstream effectors of JAKs and PI3K, i.e., phosphorylated STAT3 and Akt, were quantified by Western blot assay. In the cultured CGNs with various drug exposures, the expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 were measured by real-time PCR and Western blot, and the percentage of apoptotic nuclei was tested by Hoechst 33342 staining. After the CGNs were chronically exposed to IL-6, NMDA stimulation led to an increase in the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA and a decrease in the expression of Bax and caspase-3 mRNAs and proteins when compared with those neurons lacking IL-6 exposure. IL-6 pretreatment of the neurons without NMDA stimulation concentration-dependently enhanced the expressions of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein while attenuating the expressions of Bax and caspase-3 mRNAs and proteins in comparison with control lacking any treatment. Furthermore, IL-6 prevented the increase in the percentage of apoptotic neurons induced by NMDA. The combined pretreatment of the CGNs with AG490 and IL-6 or with LY294002 and IL-6 reduced these anti-apoptotic effects of IL-6. Neither AG490 nor LY294002 exposure alone altered the expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins. IL-6 up-regulated the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and Akt, and this was blocked by AG490 and LY294002, respectively. These results suggest that IL-6 protects neurons against NMDA-induced apoptosis, and that the IL-6 neuroprotection is jointly mediated by JAK-STAT3 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways."}

Similar mutations/deletions in the Abcd1 gene often result in diagonally opposing phenotypes of mild adrenomyeloneuropathy and severe neuroinflammatory cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), which suggests involvement of downstream modifier genes. We recently documented the first evidence of loss of AMP-activated protein kinase α1 (AMPKα1) in ALD patient-derived cells. Here, we report the novel loss of AMPKα1 in postmortem brain white matter of patients with ALD phenotype. Pharmacological activation of AMPK can rescue the mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibit the pro-inflammatory response. The FDA approved anti-diabetic drug Metformin, a well-known AMPK activator, induces mitochondrial biogenesis and is documented for its anti-inflammatory role. We observed a dose-dependent activation of AMPKα1 in metformin-treated X-ALD patient-derived fibroblasts. Metformin also induced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ATP levels in X-ALD patient-derived fibroblasts. Metformin treatment decreased very long chain fatty acid levels and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expressions in X-ALD patient-derived cells. Abcd2 [adrenoleukodystrophy protein-related protein] levels were increased in metformin-treated X-ALD patient-derived fibroblasts and Abcd1-KO mice primary mixed glial cells. Abcd2 induction was AMPKα1-dependent since metformin failed to induce Abcd2 levels in AMPKα1-KO mice-derived primary mixed glial cells. In vivo metformin (100 mg/Kg) in drinking water for 60 days induced Abcd2 levels and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation protein levels in the brain and spinal cord of Abcd1-KO mice.

Numerous inflammatory biomarkers including cell adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines, and acute-phase reactants such as fibrinogen, serum amyloid A, and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been shown to predict cardiovascular (CVD) events. Several prospective studies have shown a consistent and robust relationship between levels of high-sensitivity CRP and the risk of future CVD events. Toll-like receptors are pattern recognition receptors and members of the innate immune system that contribute to inflammation and appear to play key roles in atherosclerosis. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 may also be an independent CVD risk factor. Psoriasis has been associated with an increasing risk for atherosclerosis, including coronary artery disease and stroke. Patients with psoriasis have a 5-year shorter life expectancy, most frequently due to CVD. Psoriasis is associated with a chronic inflammatory state and with elevated levels of CRP and other inflammatory cytokines and these may play a causative role in the increased risk of psoriatic patients for CVD. Patients with psoriasis may represent an emerging risk population and patients with moderate to severe psoriasis should be screened and aggressively treated for CVD risk factors."}

Similar deficits are observed in some patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and incidence of problem gambling is higher in both these populations. Anticonvulsant drugs are widely used in the treatment of epilepsy, but also as mood stabilizers and prophylaxis for the management of BD. Unfortunately, little is still known about the precise mechanisms of action underlying their efficacy, and the specific behavioral aspect targeted by these drugs. This project explored the effect of the three anticonvulsant drugs currently also used as mood stabilizers- carbamazepine, valproate and lamotrigine on aspects of decision-making using a rat analogue of the IGT, the rat Gambling Task (rGT). In this task, rats choose between four distinct, probabilistic reinforcement schedules. Sugar pellet profits are maximized by adopting a conservative strategy, avoiding tempting high-risk, high-reward options. Effects of the anticonvulsant agents were assessed on baseline performance and also in conjunction with amphetamine administration, in order to approximate a 'mania-like' state. Carbamazepine appeared to slow processing speed, decreasing premature responses and increasing choice latency, whereas valproate and lamotrigine had no effect. When administered prior to amphetamine, lamotrigine was the only drug that failed to attenuate the pro-impulsive effect of the psychostimulant. Further studies looking at chronic administration of anticonvulsants may help us understand the impact of this medication class on decision-making and impulsivity in healthy rats and disease models."}

Despite the central role of mast cells in allergic disease little is known about the effect of lactobacilli on the function of these cells. To address this we assessed changes in rat mast cell activation following oral treatment with a strain of Lactobacillus known to attenuate allergic responses in animal models. Sprague Dawley rats were fed with L. rhamnosus JB-1 (1×10(9)) or vehicle control for 9 days. Mediator release from peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) was determined in response to a range of stimuli. Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) was used to assess mast cell responses in vivo. The Ca(2+) activated K(+) channel (KCa3.1) current, identified as critical to mast cell degranulation, was monitored by whole cell patch-clamp. L. rhamnosus JB-1 treatment lead to significant inhibition of mast cell mediator release in response to a range of stimuli including IgE mediated activation. Furthermore, the PCA response was significantly reduced in treated rats. Patch-clamp studies revealed that RPMC from treated animals were much less responsive to the KCa3.1 opener, DCEBIO. These studies demonstrate that Ingestion of L. rhamnosus JB-1 leads to mast cell stabilization in rats and identify KCa3.1 as an immunomodulatory target for certain lactobacilli. Thus the systemic effects of certain candidate probiotics may include mast cell stabilization and such actions could contribute to the beneficial effect of these organisms in allergic and other inflammatory disorders."}

Currently, there are no clinical therapies for treatment of the underlying alpha-synuclein dysfunction and accumulation, and the standard of care for patients with Parkinson's disease focuses only on symptom management, creating an immense therapeutic gap that needs to be filled. Defects in autophagy have been strongly implicated in Parkinson's disease. Here, we review evidence from human, mouse, and cell culture studies to briefly explain these defects in autophagy in Parkinson's disease and the necessity for autophagy to be carefully and precisely tuned to maintain neuron survival. We summarize recent experimental agents for treating alpha-synuclein accumulation in α-synuclein Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. Most of the efforts for developing experimental agents have focused on immunotherapeutic strategies, but we discuss why those efforts are misplaced. Finally, we emphasize why increasing autophagy flux for alpha-synuclein clearance is the most promising therapeutic strategy. Activating autophagy has been successful in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease and yields promising results in clinical trials."}

The majority of cats with OA do not show signs of overt lameness, yet cats with orthopaedic disease are known to redistribute their body weight from the affected limb. OA can cause changes in the cat's behaviour, which is often misinterpreted as signs of aging. The aim of the present study was to investigate if cats with a previous cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) injury perform differently on the pressure mat and exhibit different behaviour compared to sound cats according to the owner´s subjective assessment. Ten cats with a previous CCL injury were assessed with a pressure mat system and their owners were asked to complete an assessment questionnaire. The results were compared to those of 15 sound cats, matched to have the same weight and body condition score.	The front/hind limb index for peak vertical force (PVF) was significantly higher for CCL cats, and there was a decreased PVF and vertical impulse (VI) on the affected hindlimb compared to the unaffected one. The results indicate that cats with a previous CCL injury put less weight, on the affected hindlimb but for a longer time. There was a significantly higher owner assessment questionnaire score for the group of cats with CCL injury compared to sound cats.	Cats with a previous CCL injury have a different gait pattern compared to sound cats and a different behaviour according to owner subjective assessment. It is of great importance that further studies are performed to investigate the long term effects of CCL injury as a cause of pain and physical dysfunction, and its role in the development of OA in cats. Improved assessment tools for chronic pain caused by OA in cats are needed, both to facilitate diagnosis and to evaluate pain-relieving treatment."}

These observations suggest a pathogenic role for alpha-synuclein in PD. Thus far, however, little is known about the importance of alpha-synuclein in the nigral dopaminergic pathway in either normal or pathological situations. Herein, we studied this question by assessing the expression of synuclein-1, the rodent homologue of human alpha-synuclein, in both normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mice. In normal mice, detectable levels of synuclein mRNA and protein were seen in all brain regions studied and especially in ventral midbrain. In the latter, there was a dense synuclein-positive nerve fiber network, which predominated over the substantia nigra, and only few scattered synuclein-positive neurons. After a regimen of MPTP that kills dopaminergic neurons by apoptosis, synuclein mRNA and protein levels were increased significantly in midbrain extracts; the time course of these changes paralleled that of MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. In these MPTP-injected mice, there was also a dramatic increase in the number of synuclein-immunoreactive neurons exclusively in the substantia nigra pars compacta; all synuclein-positive neurons were tyrosine hydroxylase-positive, but none coexpressed apoptotic features. These data indicate that synuclein is highly expressed in the nigrostriatal pathway of normal mice and that it is up-regulated following MPTP-induced injury. In light of the synuclein alterations, it can be suggested that, by targeting this protein, one may modulate MPTP neurotoxicity and, consequently, open new therapeutic avenues for PD."}

The basis for this assumption is that altered physiological responses are seen in migraineurs and that differences in cell signaling are detected biochemically in various cell types isolated from peripheral blood. Levels of three G-protein mRNAs--Gs alpha, Gi alpha, and Gq alpha, were quantified in lymphocytes from clinically well-defined migraine and cluster headache patients and correlated with headache type and influence of drug treatment. Gi alpha mRNA was reduced by 50% in all migraine patients compared with control subjects; similarly in patients with or without aura, in patients with a migraine headache at the time of sampling, and patients in a quiescent state. No reduction in the levels of Gs alpha of Gq alpha mRNA were seen in migraine patients. A smaller reduction was seen in cluster headache patients, most marked in those without medication. Levels of Gs alpha mRNA were significantly reduced in cluster headache patients compared with migraine patients. The marked down-regulation of Gi alpha mRNA in migraine, whether quiescent or acute, indicates either an adaptive response to headache in this group of patients or that low levels of Gi alpha mRNA make individuals more susceptible to migraine."}

TLR9 overexpression is regulated by STAT3, which is required for GSC maintenance. Stimulation of TLR9 with a CpG ligand (CpG ODN) promoted GSC growth, whereas silencing TLR9 expression abrogated GSC development. CpG-ODN treatment induced Frizzled4-dependent activation of JAK2, thereby activating STAT3. Targeted delivery of siRNA into GSC was achieved via TLR9 using CpG-siRNA conjugates. Through local or systemic treatment, administration of CpG-Stat3 siRNA to silence STAT3 in vivo reduced GSC along with glioma growth.

These include adenosine A(2A) receptor-dopamine D(2) receptor heteromers, which are most probably localized in the dendritic spines of the striatopallidal GABAergic neurons, where they are in a position to modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission. The discovery of A(2A) receptor-dopamine D(2) receptor heteromers gives a frame for the well-known antagonistic interaction between both receptors, which is the bases for a new therapeutic approach for neuro-psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and schizoprenia. The present review deals mainly with the biochemical and molecular aspects of A(2A) receptor-dopamine D(2) receptor interactions. Recent results at the molecular level show that A(2A) receptor-dopamine D(2) receptor heteromers represent the first example of epitope-epitope electrostatic interaction underlying receptor heteromerization. Most probably A(2A) receptor-D(2) receptor heteromerization is not static, but subject to a dynamic regulation, related to the phosphorylation dependence of the A(2A) receptor epitope and to the ability of the D(2) receptor epitope to bind different partners.

Previous evidence has shown that relaxin pretreatment reduces cortical infarct size in anesthetized, male rats receiving permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Therefore, the current study was designed to determine if estrogenic mechanisms or nitric oxide production are involved in mediating this relaxin-induced neuroprotection. In separate groups of rats (n=4-6), the following drugs were injected directly into the cortex 30 min prior to MCAO: (a) relaxin, (b) relaxin and estrogen, and (c) relaxin and an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780). To investigate the involvement of nitric oxide, relaxin or relaxin and an inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (L-NIO) were injected i.v. 30 min prior to MCAO. Saline-treated rats (both intracortical (i.c.) and intravenously (i.v.)) served as controls. Brains were harvested 4h post stroke, coronally sectioned using a brain matrix and stained using 2,3,5-triphenoltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Digital photographs were taken of brain sections and the ratio comparing the area of the infarct to the area of the ipsilateral hemisphere was calculated. Mean ratios were compared using ANOVA and Tukey's test. Intracortical and intravenous relaxin pretreatment significantly reduced the infarct area in the cortex by 33.7 and 58.6%, respectively compared to saline-treated controls. This effect was not dependent on an interaction with estrogenic receptors as co-injection of relaxin and ICI 182,780 did not reverse this effect. However, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase significantly reduced the relaxin-mediated neuroprotection suggesting that relaxin may induce the endothelin-NOS cascade in cerebral vasculature causing vasodilation and improved perfusion of neural tissue."}

The aim of this study was to examine the involvement of the pattern-recognition-receptor toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in the expression of the cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) and to characterise the participating signal transduction pathways. In primary TLR9 deficient and wildtype mice astrocytes as well as microglia cells, the expression of CRAMP after treatment with the TLR9 agonist unmethylated cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide motifs (CpG-DNA) was examined in vitro. In vivo CRAMP expression after intraventricular infusion of CpG-DNA in TLR9 deficient and wildtype mice as well as in mice with pneumococcal meningitis localised in glial cells was determined. Furthermore, the regulation of different signal transduction pathways involved in CpG-DNA-induced CRAMP expression in glial cells was analysed. An in vitro and in vivo CpG-DNA-induced increase of CRAMP expression in astrocytes and microglia cells using real time RT-PCR and immunofluorescence was demonstrated. Different signal transduction pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinases and inflammatory mediated pathways are involved in the expression of CRAMP in primary glial cells. Interestingly, TLR9-deficient glial cells showed a reduced but not completely abolished CRAMP mRNA expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to CpG-DNA treatment. On the other side in vivo, TLR9 deletion did not change CRAMP expression after bacterial infection. In conclusion, our results show that TLR9 can induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides such as CRAMP in response to bacterial DNA motifs in primary glial cells. Additional findings suggest also that CpG-DNA-induced effects are not only mediated by TLR9, but also mediated by other pattern recognition receptors."}

Several authors have shown mainly in behavioral pain models that crotoxin induces antinociceptive effects, supposed to be mediated by actions on the central nervous system. The antinociceptive effects of crotoxin (45 μg/kg ip) in rats were verified in this study by increased response latencies in a Hargreaves test and tail flick test. In addition, it was demonstrated that crotoxin does not lead to motor impairments during a rotarod test and open field test. The main objective, carried out by blood oxygen level dependent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (BOLD fMRI) in anesthetized rats, was to determine which specific brain structures are involved in these antinociceptive effects.

Therefore, antinociceptive effects (right paw) and antihyperalgesic effects (left paw) of crotoxin were able to be differentiated. As a result, crotoxin exhibited dominant antihyperalgesic but also antinociceptive effects during pain stimulation. Reductions of BOLD signal already occurred in brain input structures but were most prominent in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices.

This report investigates the effect on the balance between VEGF-A and sVR-1 that occurs after ocular infection with HSV, which causes prominent neovascularization, an essential step in the pathogenesis of the vision-impairing lesion, stromal keratitis. We demonstrate that HSV-1 infection causes increased production of VEGF-A but reduces sVR-1 levels, resulting in an imbalance of VEGF-A and sVR-1 levels in ocular tissues. Moreover, the sVR-1 protein made was degraded by the metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes MMP-2, -7, and -9 produced by infiltrating inflammatory cells that were principally neutrophils. Inhibition of neutrophils, inhibition of sVR-1 breakdown with the MMP inhibitor marimastat, and the provision of exogenous recombinant sVR-1 protein all resulted in reduced angiogenesis. Our results make the novel observation that ocular neovascularization resulting from HSV infection involves a change in the balance between VEGF-A and its soluble inhibitory receptor.

Since the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a regulator of oxidative stress, a pathophysiologic process that contributes to the development of aPL, this study was undertaken in a mouse model of SLE to examine the involvement of liver mitochondria in lupus pathogenesis.	Mitochondria were isolated from lupus-prone MRL/lpr, C57BL/6.lpr, and MRL mice, age-matched autoimmunity-resistant C57BL/6 mice as negative controls, and transaldolase-deficient mice, a strain that exhibits oxidative stress in the liver. Electron transport chain (ETC) activity was assessed using measurements of oxygen consumption.

Anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β2 -glycoprotein I (anti-β2 GPI) autoantibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in mice treated with rapamycin or mice treated with a solvent control.	Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was increased in the livers of 4-week-old, disease-free MRL/lpr mice relative to age-matched controls. Levels of the mitophagy initiator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) were depleted while the activity of mTORC1 was increased in MRL/lpr mice.

To investigate, male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single mTBI using the diffuse impact-acceleration model to generate ∼100G of force. Sham animals underwent surgery only. At 5days following surgery, rats were given either the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1mg/kg), or saline via an intraperitoneal injection. mTBI animals showed an exaggerated response to LPS, with an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the hippocampus at 24h post-dose, an effect not seen in sham animals. This was associated with the development of persistent behavioral deficits in the mTBI:LPS animals at 3 months post-injury. These behavioral deficits consisted of increased time spent immobile on the forced swim-test, indicative of depressive like behavior, impaired cognitive performance on the Barnes Maze and decreased anxiety on the Elevated Plus Maze.

Due to its high drug resistance, dopamine agonist, such as bromocriptine, has limited effect on the treatment of patients with prolactinoma. Recent discoveries have revealed that multiple miRNAs were involved in regulating drug resistance. In this research, we explored the relationship between miR-145-5p expression as well as bromocriptine sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo.	To study the role of miR-145-5p in drug resistance of prolactinoma, the expression levels of miR-145-5p in bromocriptine-resistant prolactinoma cell line MMQ/BRC and its parental cell line MMQ cells, 24 bromocriptine-resistant as well as eight sensitive clinical samples were measured by qRT-PCR. Moreover, CCK8, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were performed to identify the biological characteristics of MMQ/BRC and MMQ. TPT1 was predicted as a direct target gene of miR-145-5p by bioinformatic methods. In addition, qRT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression level of TPT1 in clinical specimens and cell lines. Xenograft mouse model was constructed to analyze whether miR-145-5p could reverse bromocriptine resistance in prolactinoma in vivo.	In our study, bromocriptine-resistant prolactinoma clinical samples and cell line had decreased miR-145-5p levels and expressed high levels of TPT1 compared with their sensitive counterparts. Bioinformatic methods and our preliminary dual luciferase reporter assay were utilized to elucidate that TPT1 was a direct target gene of miR-145-5p. Furthermore, introducing miR-145-5p mimic into MMQ cells led to a decrease of IC50 along with upregulation of TPT1; nevertheless, transfecting the corresponding inhibitor into MMQ cells resulted in an upregulation of IC50 as well as reduction of TPT1.	Collectively, our findings elucidated the role of miR-145-5p as an important regulator of drug resistance in prolactinoma by controlling TPT1, and implicated the potential application of miR-145-5p in cancer therapy as well."}

Relatively little research has focused on blood flow in the cerebellum of patients with bipolar disorder. Furthermore, the significance of metabolic changes in the brains of psychiatric patients may be confounded by the effects of various pharmacotherapies. Having previously found differences in cerebellar blood volume in patients with bipolar disorder compared to healthy control subjects, this study examined whether some variability in the patient population may be an effect of medication.	In this study, we have examined the association between medication status and cerebellar blood volume. Thirteen healthy comparison subjects and 21 bipolar patients underwent dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging. Nine cerebellar regions were identified, and the absolute cerebellar blood volume data from each was compared to medication status measures.	Patients on conventional antipsychotics had the lowest mean absolute blood volume measures for all cerebellar regions, whereas those on atypical antipsychotics had the highest blood volume measures. Comparison subjects had cerebellar blood volume measures in the middle, with results closer to subjects in the atypical group.	This evidence suggests that antipsychotic treatment may influence cerebellar blood volume. This effect will be important in considering imaging studies on medicated patients with bipolar disorder and may suggest novel pathways by which these medications affect their changes."}

A cone-only mouse model carrying a Cep290 gene mutation, rd16;Nrl-/-, was engineered to mimic the human disease. In the current study, we determined the natural history of retinal structure and function in this murine model to permit design of pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies and allow progress to be made toward human therapy. Analyses of retinal structure and visual function in CEP290-LCA patients were also performed for comparison with the results in the model.	Rd16;Nrl-/- mice were studied in the first 90 days of life with optical coherence tomography (OCT), electroretinography (ERG), retinal histopathology and immunocytochemistry. Structure and function data from a cohort of patients with CEP290-LCA (n = 15; ages 7-48) were compared with those of the model.	CEP290-LCA patients retain a central island of photoreceptors with normal thickness at the fovea (despite severe visual loss); the extent of this island declined slowly with age. The rd16;Nrl-/- model also showed a relatively slow photoreceptor layer decline in thickness with ∼80% remaining at 3 months. The number of pseudorosettes also became reduced. By comparison to single mutant Nrl-/- mice, UV- and M-cone ERGs of rd16;Nrl-/- were at least 1 log unit reduced at 1 month of age and declined further over the 3 months of monitoring. Expression of GNAT2 and S-opsin also decreased with age.	The natural history of early loss of photoreceptor function with retained cone cell nuclei is common to both CEP290-LCA patients and the rd16;Nrl-/- murine model.

Teriflunomide, the main active metabolite of leflunomide, has been approved as an oral treatment in this setting. Both substances have immunosuppressive effects. Clinical evaluation of teriflunomide is based on a comparative trial versus interferon beta-1a in 324 patients and on two placebo-controlled trials in a total of about 2300 patients lasting 1 to 2 years. In these trials, oral teriflunomide at a dose of 14 mg per day led to a statistically significant decrease in the average annual number of relapses compared to placebo, but teriflunomide may be less effective than interferon beta. No impact on the progression of disability has been shown during less than 2 years of follow-up. The burdensome adverse effect profile of teriflunomide is similar to that of leflunomide and includes hepatotoxicity, infections, leukopenia, arterial hypertension, peripheral neuropathy and alopecia. The long half-life of teriflunomide (about 19 days) complicates the management of its adverse effects and multiple drug interactions, and has important implications for patients wishing to have children. Teriflunomide is teratogenic in animals and should not be used by pregnant women. Fetal toxicity via semen cannot be ruled out. In practice, the adverse effects of teriflunomide in multiple sclerosis are disproportionate to its efficacy. It is better to choose interferon beta, despite its limitations."}

A beta oligomeric ligands (also known as ADDLs) are known to be potent inhibitors of hippocampal long-term potentiation, which is a paradigm for synaptic plasticity, and have been linked to synapse loss and reversible memory failure in transgenic mouse AD models. If such oligomers were to build up in human brain, their neurological impact could provide the missing link that accounts for the poor correlation between AD dementia and amyloid plaques. This article, using antibodies raised against synthetic A beta oligomers, verifies the predicted accumulation of soluble oligomers in AD frontal cortex. Oligomers in AD reach levels up to 70-fold over control brains. Brain-derived and synthetic oligomers show structural equivalence with respect to mass, isoelectric point, and recognition by conformation-sensitive antibodies. Both oligomers, moreover, exhibit the same striking patterns of attachment to cultured hippocampal neurons, binding on dendrite surfaces in small clusters with ligand-like specificity. Binding assays using solubilized membranes show oligomers to be high-affinity ligands for a small number of nonabundant proteins. Current results confirm the prediction that soluble oligomeric A beta ligands are intrinsic to AD pathology, and validate their use in new approaches to therapeutic AD drugs and vaccines."}

Whereas the expression of GABA transporters has been extensively studied in rodents, validation of this data in other species, including humans, has been limited. As this information is crucial for our understanding of therapeutic options in human diseases such as epilepsy, we have compared, by immunocytochemistry, the distributions of the GABA transporters GAT-1 and GAT-3 in rats, cats, monkeys and humans. We demonstrate subtle differences between the results reported in the literature and our results, such as the predominance of GAT-1 labelling in neurons rather than astrocytes in the rat cortex. We note that the optimal localisation of GAT-1 in cats, monkeys and humans requires the use of an antibody against the human sequence carboxyl terminal region of GAT-1 rather than against the slightly different rat sequence. We demonstrate that GAT-3 is localised mainly to astrocytes in hindbrain and midbrain regions of rat brains. However, in species such as cats, monkeys and humans, additional strong immunolabelling of oligodendrocytes has also been observed. We suggest that differences in GAT distribution, especially the expression of GAT-3 by oligodendrocytes in humans, must be accommodated in extrapolating rodent models of GABA homeostasis to humans."}

However, UA has low water solubility, which limits its use because the bioavailability is impaired. To overcome this inconvenience, we developed long-circulating and pH-sensitive liposomes containing ursolic acid (SpHL-UA). We investigated the antiangiogenic effect of free UA and SpHL-UA in murine brain cancer and human breast tumor models by means of determination of the relative tumor volume, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), and histopathological analysis. Methods The animals were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, free UA, long-circulating and pH-sensitive liposomes without drug (SpHL), or SpHL-UA. The animals were submitted to each treatment by intraperitoneal injection for 5 days. The dose of free UA or SpHL-UA was equal to 23 mg/kg. Results Tumor growth inhibition was not observed in human breast tumor-bearing animals. For murine gliosarcoma-bearing animals, a slight tumor growth inhibition was observed in the groups treated with free UA or SpHL-UA (9% and 15%, respectively). No significant change in any of the parameters evaluated by DCE-MRI for both experimental models could be observed. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the mean values of magnetic resonance parameters of human breast tumor-bearing animals showed evidence of a possible antiangiogenic effect induced by SpHL-UA. Histopathological analysis did not present significant change for any treatment.

Molecular brain research^\nElectroconvulsive shock exposure prevents neuronal apoptosis after kainic acid-evoked status epilepticus.^\nIn the aftermath of prolonged continuous seizure activity (status epilepticus, SE), neuronal cell death occurs in the brain regions through which the seizure propagates. The vulnerability to adrenalectomy-induced apoptotic neuronal death was recently reported to be reduced by prior exposure to repeated daily noninjurious electroconvulsive shock (ECS). The present studies identified apoptosis and apoptosis-associated gene products in the neurodegenerative response to experimentally controlled periods (1 or 2 h) of SE in the rat, and determined whether exposure to ECS can interrupt these apoptotic responses mechanisms. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the presence of apoptotic-like neurons (as assessed by in situ double labeling technique) was detected in hippocampus and rhinal cortex at 24 h after SE. Under these conditions, levels of both mRNA and protein encoded by the 'death promoting' bcl-XS gene were increased in the same brain areas. Pretreatment of animals for 7 days with low intensity (minimal) ECS conferred resistance to SE-evoked neurodegeneration, as assessed histopathologically by silver staining. Associated with this neuroprotective action was a reduction in the incidence of apoptosis-like neuronal morphology and DNA fragmentation, and a prevention of the increase in Bcl-XS protein and mRNA in hippocampus and rhinal cortex. These data suggest that pre-exposure to controlled, brief noninjurious seizures decreases vulnerability to programmed neuronal cell death, that this neuroprotective action occurs upstream from Bcl-XS, and that increases in bcl-XS gene expression may serve as a sensitive indicator of neurodegeneration following SE."}

Accumulation of regulatory T (T reg) cells in GBs is thought to contribute to the dampening of antitumor immunity. Using a syngeneic mouse model for GB, we tested whether local delivery of cytokines could render the immunosuppressive GB microenvironment conducive to an antitumor immune response. IL-12 but not IL-23 reversed GB-induced immunosuppression and led to tumor clearance. In contrast to models of skin or lung cancer, IL-12-mediated glioma rejection was T cell dependent and elicited potent immunological memory.

To evaluate priming at both nociceptor terminals, we studied, in male Sprague Dawley rats, the effect of local administration of agents that reverse type I (protein translation) or type II [combination of Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)] priming. At the central terminal, priming induced by systemic, intradermal, or intrathecal fentanyl was reversed by the combination of Src and MAPK inhibitors, but at the peripheral terminal, it was reversed by the protein translation inhibitor. Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antisense prevented fentanyl hyperalgesia and priming. To determine whether type I and II priming occur in the same population of neurons, we used isolectin B4-saporin or [Sar[9], Met(O2)[11]]-substance P-saporin to deplete nonpeptidergic or peptidergic nociceptors, respectively. Following intrathecal fentanyl, central terminal priming was prevented by both saporins, whereas that in peripheral terminal was not attenuated even by their combination. However, after intradermal fentanyl, priming in the peripheral terminal requires both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors, whereas that in the central terminal is dependent only on peptidergic nociceptors. Pretreatment with dantrolene at either terminal prevented fentanyl-induced priming in both terminals, suggesting communication between central and peripheral terminals mediated by intracellular Ca[2+] signaling. In vitro application of fentanyl increased cytoplasmic Ca[2+] concentration in dorsal root ganglion neurons, which was prevented by pretreatment with dantrolene and naloxone.

The NMDA antagonist TCP appeared to be very effective in the treatment of casualties who suffered from soman-induced seizures for 30 min: (i)Seizures were arrested within minutes after the TCP injection, confirmed by quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG), after fast Fourier analysis. Three hours after TCP the quantitative EEGs were completely normal in all frequency bands and remained normal during the entire 3-week intoxication period. The power shift to the lower (delta) frequency bands, indicative for neuropathology and found in control animals intoxicated only by soman, was not observed in the soman-TCP group.

They underline the current hypothesis that cholinergic mechanisms are responsible for eliciting seizure activity after soman and that, most likely, the subsequent recruitment of other excitatory neurotransmitters and loss of inhibitory control are responsible for the maintenance of seizures and the development of subsequent brain damage."}

Young (4- to 6-month-old) and older (15- to 18-month-old) APP(SWE) transgenic (Tg2576) mice were treated with the AD candidate drug (+)-phenserine for 16 consecutive days. We found significant reductions in insoluble Aβ1-42 levels in the cortices of both young and older transgenic mice, while significant reductions in soluble Aβ1-42 levels and insoluble Aβ1-40 levels were only found in animals aged 15-18 months. Autoradiography binding with the amyloid ligand Pittsburgh Compound B ((3)H-PIB) revealed a trend for reduced fibrillar Aβ deposition in the brains of older phenserine-treated Tg2576 mice. Phenserine treatment increased cortical synaptophysin levels in younger mice, while decreased interleukin-1β and increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were detected in the cortices of older mice. The reduction in Aβ1-42 levels was associated with an increased number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive proliferating cells in the hippocampi of both young and older Tg2576 mice. To determine whether the increased cell proliferation was accompanied by increased neuronal production, the endogenous early neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX) was examined in the dentate gyrus (DG) using immunohistochemical detection. Although no changes in the total number of DCX(+)-expressing neurons were detected in the DG in Tg2576 mice at either age following (+)-phenserine treatment, dendritic arborization was increased in differentiating neurons in young Tg2576 mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that reducing Aβ1-42 levels in Tg2576 mice at an early pathological stage affects synaptic function by modulating the maturation and plasticity of newborn neurons in the brain. In contrast, lowering Aβ levels in Tg2576 mice when Aβ plaque pathology is prominent mainly alters the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines."}

Glutamate and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors have been shown to play a crucial role in spasticity following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Gua Lou Gui Zhi decoction (GLGZD) is a well-known traditional Chinese formula that has long been used clinically in China to treat muscular spasticity following stroke, epilepsy or spinal cord injury. However, the precise mechanisms behind its neuroprotective and anti-spasticity effects remain poorly understood. In the present study, using a rat model of focal cerebral I/R injury, we evaluated the neuroprotective and anti-spasticity effects of GLGZD and investigated the underlying mechanisms. We found that GLGZD improved neurological deﬁcits and reduced infarct volumes in cerebral I/R-injured rats. In addition, GLGZD reduced cerebral ischemic spasticity since it improved the screen test and Hoffman's reflex (H-reflex) scores. It also reduced glutamate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and altered the expression of the AMPA receptor subunits. Our data demonstrate that GLGZD exerts neuroprotective and anti-spasticity effects in a cerebral ischemia model via the modulation of glutamate levels and AMPA receptor expression."}

EA stimulation (2Hz, 1mA) was needle-delivered for 30 min at acupoints corresponding to Zusanli and Sanyinjiao 3 h after carrageenan injection. Thermal and mechanical sensitivity of the hindpaw induced by carrageenan was strongly inhibited by EA stimulation. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were examined in the L4-5 segments of the spinal cord by Western blot analysis 4h and 5h after carrageenan injection. Phosphorylation of Akt and especially PI3K were significantly induced by carrageenan-induction, but these expressions were markedly inhibited by EA stimulation. CREB phosphorylation showed a similar, but insignificant, pattern as like PI3k/Akt. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt showed a similar pattern as Western blotting and were observed in most neurons and a few astrocytes. EA and PI3K inhibitor synergistically inhibited carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia. These results reveal that both neuronal PI3K and Akt may play an important role in EA-induced antinociception via inactivation in an inflammatory pain model."}

Regardless of the pathological hallmarks, synaptic dysfunction is widely accepted as a causal event in AD. Of the two major types of synapses in the central nervous system (CNS): glutamatergic and GABAergic, which provide excitatory and inhibitory outputs respectively, abundant data implicate an impaired glutamatergic system during disease progression. However, emerging evidence supports the notion that disrupted default neuronal network underlies impaired memory, and that alterations of GABAergic circuits, either plays a primary role or as a compensatory response to excitotoxicity, may also contribute to AD by disrupting the overall network function. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the involvement of Aβ, tau and apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), the major genetic risk factor in late-onset AD (LOAD), in GABAergic neurotransmission and the potential of modulating the GABAergic function as AD therapy."}

Thirty-one THPB derivatives with diverse substituents on A and D ring were synthesized, and their binding affinity to dopamine D(1), D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors were determined. Compounds 18k and 18m were identified as partial agonists at the D(1) receptor with K(i) values of 50 and 6.3nM, while both compounds act as D(2) receptor antagonists (K(i)=305 and 145nM, respectively) and 5-HT(1A) receptor full agonists (K(i)=149 and 908nM, respectively). These two THPBs compounds exerted antipsychotic actions in animal models. Further electrophysiological studies employing single-unit recording in intact animals demonstrated that 18k-excited dopaminergic (DA) neurons are associated with its 5-HT(1A) receptor agonistic activity.

Increased NOX2 expression after spinal cord injury (SCI) has been reported, and inhibition of NOX2 improves motor function. However, the underlying mechanisms of NOX2 in post-traumatic pain and motor deficit remain unexplored. In the present study, we report that depletion of NOX2 (NOX2[-/-]) or inhibition of NOX2 using NOX2ds-tat significantly reduced mechanical/thermal cutaneous hypersensitivity and motor dysfunction after moderate contusion SCI at T10 in male mice. Western blot (WB, 3 mm lesion area) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that SCI elevates NOX2 expression predominantly in microglia/macrophages up to 8 weeks post-injury. Deletion of NOX2 significantly reduced CD11b[+]/CD45[hi]F4/80[+] macrophage infiltration at 24 h post-injury detected by flow cytometry and 8-OHG[+] ROS production at 8 weeks post-injury by IHC in both lesion area and lumbar enlargement. NOX2 deficiency also altered microglial/macrophage pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory balance towards the neurorestorative response. WB analysis showed robust increase of Arginase-1 and YM1 proteins in NOX2[-/-] mice. Furthermore, qPCR analysis showed significant up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels in NOX2[-/-] mice, associated with reduced microRNA-155 expression. These findings were confirmed in CD11b[+] microglia/macrophages isolated from spinal cord at 3 days post-injury. Taken together, our data suggest an important role for IL-10/miR-155 pathway in regulating NOX2-mediated SCI-dysfunction. Thus, specific targeting of NOX2 may provide an effective strategy for treating neurological dysfunction in SCI patients."}

As a result, interest in new alternatives for autograft development has risen. The acellular peripheral nerve graft is an alternative for peripheral nerve injury repair, but to date there is not a standardized chemical decellularization method widely accepted. The objective of this study was to propose a modified chemical protocol of decellularization of rat sciatic nerve and its recellularization in vitro with mesenchimal differentiated Schwann-like cells. After the transplantation, an evaluation of its regeneration was performed using morphological and functional tests. The study consisted of two phases; in phase 1, different concentrations and times of exposure of rat sciatic nerves to detergents were tested, to establish a modified chemical protocol for nerve decellularization. The chemical treatment with 3% triton X-100 and 4% sodium deoxycholate for 15 days allowed a complete decellularization whilst conserving the extracellular matrix of the harvested nerve. In phase 2, the decellularized and recellularized alografts were compared against autografts. The morphological analysis showed a higher positivity to specific myelin antibodies in the recellularized group compared to the autograft. There were no differences in this parameter between the control limb and the experimental limb (recellularized group). The functional analysis showed no statistical differences at week 15 in the Sciatic Function Index in the autograft group vs the other groups.

Our previous findings suggest that Am80 provides therapeutic effect on intracerebral hemorrhage in mice via suppression of expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2). Here we investigated the mechanisms of inhibitory action of Am80 on expression of CXCL2 and other pro-inflammatory factors in microglial BV-2 cells. Pretreatment with Am80 markedly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of CXCL2 mRNA and release of CXCL2 protein. Am80 had no effect on LPS-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. On the other hand, Am80 prevented LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of NF-κB complex. In addition, total expression levels of p65 and IκBα proteins, as well as of mRNAs encoding p65 and IκBα, were lowered by Am80. Dependence of CXCL2 expression on NF-κB was confirmed by the effect of an NF-κB inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester that abolished LPS-induced CXCL2 expression. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester also abolished LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α, which may be relevant to the inhibitory effect of Am80 on expression of these pro-inflammatory factors. We additionally found that Am80 attenuated LPS-induced up-regulation of CD14, a co-receptor for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). These results suggest that inhibitory effect on TLR4 signaling mediated by NF-κB pathway underlies the anti-inflammatory action of retinoic acid receptor agonists in microglia."}

Moreover, the fingertip regenerated after 74 days under semi-occlusive dressings with very pleasant results. For strain identification two automated systems were employed producing discrepant results: VITEK 2 described the pathogens as Pasteurella pneumotropica while MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed A. equuli. Sequence analysis of 16S rDNA gene finally confirmed A. equuli ssp. haemolyticus as the isolated strain. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to the CLSI criteria for Pasteurella spp. Additionally we conducted a test according to the EUCAST criteria.	Wir berichten über den Nachweis von Actinobacillus equuli ssp. haemolyticus aus Wundabstrichen eines 2 Jahre alten Mädchens, welches sich wegen eines Pferdebisses in der Klinik vorstellte. Diese Verletzung führte zu einer teilweisen Amputation der distalen Phalanx ihres rechten Mittelfingers. Bei A. equuli handelt es sich um Bakterien, welche typischerweise Krankheiten bei Pferden verursachen. Bei Menschen findet A. equulii zumeist als Erreger von Wundinfektionen Erwähnung. Die Erreger konnten zu unterschiedlichen Zeitpunkten nachgewiesen werden. Während der gesamten Behandlungsdauer waren keine Zeichen einer fortschreitenden Infektion oder Entzündung zu beobachten. Die Fingerkuppe regenerierte nach 74 Tagen unter semi-occlusiven Verbänden mit einem sehr schönen Ergebnis. Die Erreger wurden mit Hilfe der beiden automatisierten Systeme VITEK 2 und MALDI-TOF MS identifiziert. Die biochemische Untersuchung mittels VITEK 2 identifizierte den Erreger als Pasteurella pneumotropica, wohingegen die massenspektrometrische Analyse A. equuli als Resultat lieferte. Die anschließende Sequenzierung des 16S rDNA Gens erbrachte das Ergebnis A. equuli ssp. haemolyticus und bestätigte somit die Identifikation der MALDI-TOF MS-Analyse.

Curcumin is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound with Congo red-like amyloid binding properties and the ability to cross the blood brain barrier. CAG140 mice, a knock-in (KI) mouse model of HD, display abnormal aggregates of mutant huntingtin and striatal transcriptional deficits, as well as early motor, cognitive and affective abnormalities, many months prior to exhibiting spontaneous gait deficits, decreased striatal volume, and neuronal loss. We have examined the ability of life-long dietary curcumin to improve the early pathological phenotype of CAG140 mice.	KI mice fed a curcumin-containing diet since conception showed decreased huntingtin aggregates and increased striatal DARPP-32 and D1 receptor mRNAs, as well as an amelioration of rearing deficits. However, similar to other antioxidants, curcumin impaired rotarod behavior in both WT and KI mice and climbing in WT mice. These behavioral effects were also noted in WT C57Bl/6 J mice exposed to the same curcumin regime as adults. However, neither locomotor function, behavioral despair, muscle strength or food utilization were affected by curcumin in this latter study. The clinical significance of curcumin's impairment of motor performance in mice remains unclear because curcumin has an excellent blood chemistry and adverse event safety profile, even in the elderly and in patients with Alzheimer's disease.	Together with this clinical experience, the improvement in several transgene-dependent parameters by curcumin in our study supports a net beneficial effect of dietary curcumin in HD."}

But little is known about survival in patients with limited recurrence (solitary locoregional recurrence or solid organ metastasis). Herein, we report our experience with these subgroups. We analyzed 1754 consecutive patients surgically treated with curative resection for esophageal cancer and cancer of the gastroesophageal junction between 1990 and 2012. Seven subgroups were defined according to the recurrence type (locoregional vs. organ metastasis), the site of recurrence (abdominal, thoracic, cervical for lymph nodes and lung, liver, adrenals and others for organ metastasis) and also the number of lesions (one vs. multiple lymph node stations or organ metastasis) Of these groups; clinical isolated locoregional recurrence (ciLR) was defined as solitary lymph-node recurrence confined to one compartment (cervical, thoracic or abdominal, within or outside surgical dissection-field) at clinical staging. Clinical solitary solid organ metastasis (csSOM) was defined as metastasis in a resectable solid organ, i.e. liver, lung, brain or adrenal. Salvage therapies were grouped in five categories. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to calculate survival. Recurrent disease was observed in 766 patients (43.7%) with overall 5-year survival of 4.5% after diagnosis of recurrence. Fifty-seven patients (7.4%) showed ciLR and 110 (14.4%) csSOM. Median time-to-recurrence was 16.8 months in ciLR and 9.9 months in csSOM (P = 0.0074). Survival is significantly improved compared to supportive therapy when local therapy is possible (P < 0.0001). In 25 (15%) of ciLR or csSOM patients, surgical therapy with or without systemic therapy, yielded a 5-year survival of 49.9% (median 54.8 months) after diagnosis of recurrence. When surgery was impossible or contraindicated, the combination of chemoradiotherapy appeared to be superior to chemotherapy alone (respectively 27.0% vs. 4.6% 5-year survival) or radiotherapy alone (no 5-year survival). Recurrent disease after esophagectomy is a common problem with poor overall survival. However prolonged survival could be obtained in selected patients if the recurrent disease is limited to ciLR or csSOM, if surgery (+/- systemic therapy) can be performed. If not a combination of chemoradiotherapy seems to offer the second best option. Patients presenting with a ciLR or csSOM should be discussed in a dedicated multidisciplinary team meeting as to evaluate and define the place of salvage treatment which in well selected cases could offer a perspective of prolonged survival."}

Administered by gavage to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice.^\nMethacrylonitrile is an aliphatic nitrile used extensively in the preparation of homo- and copolymers, elastomers, and plastics and as a chemical intermediate in the preparation of acids, amides, esters, and other nitriles. This aliphatic nitrile is also used as a replacement for acrylonitrile in the manufacture of an acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene-like polymer. Methacrylonitrile was nominated for toxicity and carcinogenicity testing by the National Cancer Institute due to its high production volume and extensive use, the lack of chronic or carcinogenicity data, and its structural resemblance to the known rat carcinogen acrylonitrile. The current 13-week studies were conducted as part of an overall effort by the NTP to assess the toxicity and carcinogenicity of methacrylonitrile. During the 13-week studies, groups of 20 male and 20 female F344/N rats were administered 0, 7.5, 15, 30, 60, or 120 mg methacrylonitrile/kg body weight in deionized, purified water by gavage. Groups of 20 male and 20 female B6C3F1 mice were administered 0, 0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, or 12 mg/kg methacrylonitrile. Ten male and ten female rats and mice from each group were evaluated on day 32. The results of these studies clearly revealed that male rats are more sensitive than females to methacrylonitrile treatment. In the rat study, 19 males and one female administered 120 mg/kg and two males administered 60 mg/kg died during the first week of the study. Males in the 60 mg/kg group at the 32-day interim evaluation and at 13 weeks and females in the 120 mg/kg group at 13 weeks had significantly lower final mean body weights and body weight gains than did the vehicle controls; the surviving male in the 120 mg/kg group also weighed less than the controls at the 32-day interim evaluation. Clinical findings of toxicity were dose dependent and included lethargy, lacrimation, tremors, convulsions, ataxia, and abnormal breathing. There was hematologic evidence indicating that administration of methacrylonitrile induced minimal, normocytic, normochromic anemia. At the 32-day interim evaluation, a minimal dose-related anemia was evidenced by decreases in hematocrit values, hemoglobin concentrations, and erythrocyte counts in male and female rats. The anemia ameliorated by week 13. Administration of methacrylonitrile resulted in dose-related increases in serum thiocyanate and blood cyanide concentrations of male and female rats. These changes were expected and would be consistent with the in vivo metabolism of methacrylonitrile to cyanide. Blood cyanide concentrations were generally higher in males than in females, which may explain the higher sensitivity of males to the lethal effect of methacrylonitrile. There was also biochemical evidence of increased hepatocellular leakage and/or altered function in dosed male rats, suggesting that the liver may be a target organ for toxic effects of methacrylonitrile. Minimal, but significant, decreases in absolute right kidney and thymus weights (32-day interim evaluation) and increases in liver and stomach weights (week 13) occurred in male rats that received 60 mg/kg compared to the vehicle controls. In female rats, stomach weights of the 60 and 120 mg/kg groups were significantly greater and thymus weights of the 120 mg/kg group were significantly less than those of the controls on day 32 and at week 13; liver weights were also significantly greater in females in the 120 mg/kg group than in the vehicle controls on day 32. Male and female rats administered 60 mg/kg and females administered 120 mg/kg had significantly greater incidences of metaplasia of the nasal olfactory epithelium on day 32 and at the end of the study than did the vehicle controls; incidences of olfactory epithelial necrosis were also significantly greater in females in the 60 and 120 mg/kg groups than in the vehicle controls on day 32. Incidence and/or severity increased with increasing dose in females; however, the mortality in male rats administered 120 mg/kg made it difficult to assess the dose-response relationship in males. The no-observed-adverse-effect level for the nasal cavity of rats was 30 mg/kg. Female rats administered 60 or 120 mg/kg methacrylonitrile had significantly longer estrous cycles than did the vehicle controls. Females in the 60 mg/kg group spent more time in diestrus than the vehicle controls. One male and one female mouse in the 12 mg/kg groups died early. Methacrylonitrile administration caused no significant differences in final mean body weights or body weight gains. Clinical findings included lethargy, tremors, ataxia, convulsions, and abnormal breathing. At the 32-day interim evaluation, stomach weights of males administered 3 mg/kg or greater were significantly greater and thymus weights of males in the 12 mg/kg group were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. At week 13, however, the stomach weights of only males in the 12 mg/kg group were increased relative to the vehicle controls. No treatment-related histopathologic lesions occurred in mice. Methacrylonitrile did not induce mutations in any of several strains of Salmonella typhimurium, with or without S9 activation, and did not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster fed methacrylonitrile during the larval stage. Results of in vivo bone marrow micronucleus tests with methacrylonitrile in male rats and mice were also negative. In summary, gavage administration of methacrylonitrile to rats and mice resulted in dose-dependent lethargy, tremors, lacrimation, convulsions, and abnormal breathing. However, these effects were more pronounced in rats than mice; these differences may be attributed to the higher doses of methacrylonitrile administered to rats. Body weight gain and survival data of rats demonstrated that males are more sensitive to methacrylonitrile dosing than females. There is an apparent correlation between blood cyanide concentrations and survival rates, with males having greater cyanide concentrations and lower survival rates than female rats administered methacrylonitrile. Microscopically, the only target of methacrylonitrile toxicity was the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. Necrotic and metaplastic effects were induced in male and female rats that received 60 or 120 mg/kg per day. No similar lesions were observed in mice administered methacrylonitrile. The no-observed-adverse-effect level for olfactory epithelial lesions in male and female rats administered methacrylonitrile for 13 weeks was 30 mg/kg per day. No clear chemical-related effects were observed in male or female mice administered methacrylonitrile for 13 weeks by gavage at doses up to 12 mg/kg per day."}

The drug treatment made either with the preventive or the therapeutic approach reduced the incidence of serious retinal lesions and increased that of light lesions as assessed by a biomicroscopic method. Biochemical analyses showed that experimental diabetes was accompanied by sustained decrease in glucose and pyruvate and an increase of the lactate content in the retina. A decrease of alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate and an increase of succinate were also observed along with a decrease of ATP, ADP and an increase in AMP. Either the preventive or the therapeutic approach was followed by an increased pyruvate and ATP content and decreased lactate and AMP content in the retinal tissue. It is possible that this drug acts on the retinal tissue by inhibiting platelet aggregation and protecting vasal endothelium with the consequent suppression of the release of vasoactive substances that facilitate platelet adhesion."}

Platelet concentrates (PC) were harvested from healthy volunteers and made into single donor-derived PL (sPL). The PL mixtures (mPL) were made from three different sPL. Some growth factors and platelet cell surface antigens were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The hBMSCs cultured with 10% PL were analyzed for their proliferative potential, surface markers, and karyotypes. The cells were incubated with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) agents and injected into a pig brain. MRI and histological analysis were performed. Consequently, nine lots of sPL and three mPL were prepared. ELISA analysis showed that PL contained adequate growth factors and a particle of platelet surface antigens. Cell proliferation capacity of PLs was equivalent to or higher than that of fetal calf serum (FCS). No contradiction in cell surface markers and no chromosomal aberrations were found. The MRI detected the distribution of SPIO-labeled hBMSCs in the pig brain. In summary, the hBMSCs cultured with allogeneic PL are suitable for cell therapy against stroke."}

Much recent research has focused on the role of cytokines in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders; however, the related family of immune proteins designated chemokines has been relatively neglected. Chemokines were originally identified as having chemotactic function on immune cells; however, recent evidence has begun to elucidate novel, brain-specific functions of these proteins of relevance to the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. A systematic review of both human and animal literature in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases was undertaken. After application of all inclusion and exclusion criteria, 157 references were remained for the review. Some early mechanistic evidence does associate select chemokines with the neurobiological processes, including neurogenesis, modulation of the neuroinflammatory response, regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and modulation of neurotransmitter systems. This early evidence however does not clearly demonstrate any specificity for a certain psychiatric disorder, but is primarily relevant to mechanisms which are shared across disorders. Notable exceptions include CCL11 that has recently been shown to impair hippocampal function in aging - of distinct relevance to Alzheimer's disease and depression in the elderly, and pre-natal exposure to CXCL8 that may disrupt early neurodevelopmental periods predisposing to schizophrenia. Pro-inflammatory chemokines, such as CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL12, and CCL13, have been shown to drive chemotaxis of pro-inflammatory cells to the inflamed or injured CNS. Likewise, CX3CL has been implicated in promoting glial cells activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion, expression of ICAM-1, and recruitment of CD4+ T-cells into the CNS during neuroinflammatory processes. With further translational research, chemokines may present novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets in psychiatric disorders."}

The present study was undertaken to determine whether AJ-3941 protects the impairment of cerebroarterial endothelium-dependent relaxation which is concomitantly induced with cerebral vasospasm. Subarachnoid hemorrhage biphasically suppressed the response to acetylcholine in rat basilar artery, at 0.5 h (n = 4; P < 0.06) and 1 day (n = 5; P < 0.05) after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The reduction of the responses was correlated significantly to the degree of vasospasm determined angiographically. This reduction was accompanied by a 49% increase of arterial lipid peroxide contents. Endothelium-independent relaxation in subarachnoid hemorrhage rats was preserved in response to 3-morpholinosydnonimine, sodium nitroprusside and papaverine. AJ-3941 prevented (n = 6-8, P < 0.05) the suppression of the acetylcholine-induced response and the increase in lipid peroxide content in subarachnoid hemorrhage rats. These results suggest that AJ-3941 could exert its vasospasmolytic effect by preserving endothelial function through its anti-lipid peroxidative action, in addition to its inhibition of vasospasmogen-induced vasoconstriction related to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization."}

The aggregation of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is a hallmark of AD and is linked to synapse loss and cognitive impairment. Capsaicin, a specific agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), has been proven to ameliorate stress-induced AD-like pathological and cognitive impairments, but it is unclear whether TRPV1 activation can affect cognitive and synaptic functions in Aβ-induced mouse model of AD. In this study, we investigated the effects of TRPV1 activation on spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in mice treated with Aβ. To induce AD-like pathological and cognitive impairments, adult C57Bl/6 mice were microinjected with Aβ42 (100 μM, 2.5 μl/mouse, i.c.v.). Two weeks after Aβ42 microinjection, spatial learning and memory as well as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) were examined. The results showed that Aβ42 microinjection significantly impaired spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests compared with controls. These behavioral changes were accompanied by synapse loss and impaired LTP in the CA1 area of hippocampus. More importantly, daily capsaicin (1 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment throughout the experiment dramatically improved spatial learning and memory and synaptic function, as reflected by enhanced hippocampal LTP and reduced synapse loss, whereas the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment had no effects on cognitive and synaptic function in Aβ42-treated mice. These results indicate that TRPV1 activation by capsaicin rescues cognitive deficit in the Aβ42-induced mouse model of AD both structurely and functionally."}

We compared the ability of diazepam and a subanesthetic dose of urethane to terminate prolonged SE and mitigate subsequent pathologies. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were injected with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to induce SE. Rats were administered diazepam (10 mg/kg, ip) or urethane (0.8 g/kg, s.c.) 1 h after DFP-induced SE and compared to rats that experienced uninterrupted SE. Large-amplitude and high-frequency spikes induced by DFP administration were quenched for at least 46 h in rats administered urethane 1 h after SE onset as demonstrated by cortical electroencephalography (EEG). By contrast, diazepam interrupted SE but seizures with high power in the 20- to 70-Hz band returned 6-10 h later. Urethane was more effective than diazepam at reducing hippocampal neurodegeneration, brain inflammation, gliosis and weight loss as measured on day 4 after SE. Furthermore, rats administered urethane displayed a 73% reduction in the incidence of spontaneous recurrent seizures after four to eight weeks and a 90% reduction in frequency of seizures in epileptic rats. By contrast, behavioral changes in the light/dark box, open field and a novel object recognition task were not improved by urethane.

Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a kind of genetic neurovisceral disorder in which the intracellular sequestration of cholesterol and other lipids in neurons, NFT formation and neuronal degeneration in brain are the neuropathology hallmarks. The age of onset and progression of the disease vary dramatically. We have analyzed the hippocampus from 17 NPC cases, aged from 7 months to 55 years, to depict the temporal characteristics of NFT formation. Unexpectedly, classic NFT was observed in about 4-year-old NPC brain, suggesting that NFT is not aging dependent, and that juvenile brain neurons satisfy the requirements for NFT formation. NFT in the hippocampus of NPC was significantly increased in number with the advance of age. More importantly, multiple mitotic phase markers, which are not usually found in normal mature neurons, were abundant in the affected neurons and incorporated into NFT. The unusual activation of cdc2/cyclin B kinase and downstream mitotic indices are closely associated with the age-dependent NFT formation, signifying the contribution of abortive cell cycle to neurodegeneration.

{"pmid": "11641446", "text": "Pediatric research^\nNeurobiology of periventricular leukomalacia in the premature infant.^\nBrain injury in the premature infant is a problem of enormous importance. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is the major neuropathologic form of this brain injury and underlies most of the neurologic morbidity encountered in survivors of premature birth. Prevention of PVL now seems ultimately achievable because of recent neurobiologic insights into pathogenesis. The pathogenesis of this lesion relates to three major interacting factors. The first two of these, an incomplete state of development of the vascular supply to the cerebral white matter, and a maturation-dependent impairment in regulation of cerebral blood flow underlie a propensity for ischemic injury to cerebral white matter. The third major pathogenetic factor is the maturation-dependent vulnerability of the oligodendroglial (OL) precursor cell that represents the major cellular target in PVL. Recent neurobiologic studies show that these cells are exquisitely vulnerable to attack by free radicals, known to be generated in abundance with ischemia-reperfusion. This vulnerability of OLs is maturation-dependent, with the OL precursor cell highly vulnerable and the mature OL resistant, and appears to relate to a developmental window characterized by a combination of deficient antioxidant defenses and active acquisition of iron during OL differentiation. The result is generation of deadly reactive oxygen species and apoptotic OL death. Important contributory factors in pathogenesis interact with this central theme of vulnerability to free radical attack. Thus, the increased likelihood of PVL in the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage could relate to increases in local iron concentrations derived from the hemorrhage. The important contributory role of maternal/fetal infection or inflammation and cytokines in the pathogenesis of PVL could be related to effects on the cerebral vasculature and cerebral hemodynamics, to generation of reactive oxygen species, or to direct toxic effects on vulnerable OL precursors. A key role for elevations in extracellular glutamate, caused by ischemia-reperfusion, is suggested by demonstrations that glutamate causes toxicity to OL precursors by both nonreceptor- and receptor-mediated mechanisms. The former involves an exacerbation of the impairment in antioxidant defenses, and the latter, an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate receptor-mediated cell death. Most importantly, these new insights into the pathogenesis of PVL suggest potential preventive interventions. These include avoidance of cerebral ischemia by detection of infants with impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation, e.g. through the use of in vivo near-infrared spectroscopy, the use of free radical scavengers to prevent toxicity by reactive oxygen species, the administration of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate receptor antagonists to prevent glutamate-mediated injury, or the use of maternal antibiotics or anticytokine agents to prevent toxicity from maternal/fetal infection or inflammation and cytokines."}

The gene is first expressed as astrocytes mature, and in the adult is strongly upregulated in response to CNS damage. Thus, in addition to its astrocyte specificity, transcriptional regulation of the GFAP gene is of interest as a reporter of CNS signaling during development and injury. Several laboratories have shown that approximately 2 kb of 5'-flanking DNA of the human or mouse GFAP gene is sufficient to direct transgene expression to astrocytes and to confer developmental and injury-induced regulation. Enhancer regions have been identified adjacent to the basal promoter and about 1500 bp upstream of the RNA start site. Juxtaposition of these two segments yielded a 447 bp promoter, gfa28, which strongly drove reporter activity in transfected glioma cells. We report here that in mice a gfa28-lacZ transgene expresses in only certain brain regions, revealing an unexpected heterogeneity among astrocytes. The restricted pattern of expression is present early in development, is not altered by injury, and is preserved in cultured astrocytes. However, astrocytes cultured from an inactive region strongly express a transiently transfected gfa28-lacZ construct, and activity of the embedded gfa28-lacZ transgene is partially restored by treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. These results indicate that the absence of gfa28-lacZ expression in specific brain regions results from a developmental failure to remodel GFAP chromatin to an open structure. Thus, expression of the gfa28-lacZ transgene appears to serendipitously mark a distinct set of astrocyte precursors."}

Marked induction of microglia activation markers (OX42, Iba1, P-p38), proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, NMDA receptor subunit NR2B and BDNF was found in spinal cord and/or dorsal root ganglia of CCI-SN rats. A long lasting spinal BDNF overexpression was also observed in BDNF i.t. rats, indicating an autocrine self-induction, with downstream long lasting TrkB-mediated neuropathic-like pain. Accordingly, TrkB blockade appeared as a relevant approach to alleviate not only i.t. BDNF- but also nerve lesion-evoked neuropathic pain."}

Increased understanding of the immunopathological processes underlying this disease, advances in biotechnology and the development of powerful magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies, together with improvements in clinical trial design, have led to a variety of valuable therapeutic approaches to MS. Therapy for MS has changed dramatically over the past decade, yielding significant progress in the treatment of relapsing remitting and secondary progressive forms; however, most of the clinically relevant therapeutic approaches are not yet available as oral formulations. A substantial number of preliminary and pivotal reports have provided promising results for oral therapies, and various phase III clinical trials are currently being initiated or are already underway evaluating the efficacy of a variety of orally administered agents, including cladribine, teriflunomide, laquinimod, fingolimod and fumaric acid. It is hoped that these trials will advance the development of oral therapies for MS."}

Removing undifferentiated cells from the donor population is critical to reduce tumorigenesis. Moreover, immature neural progenitors in transplants can proliferate unpredictably, resulting in neural overgrowth and long-term risks of compressing the surrounding host tissue. Because Notch signaling plays a role in maintaining the multipotency and proliferative capacity of neural progenitors, we used γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) to dampen Notch signaling in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors before transplantation and examined the effects on the growth of proliferative grafts. We observed a marked reduction in the percentage of dividing cells and increased neuronal maturation in GSI-treated samples in vitro. Next, grafts were transplanted into the striata of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune deficiency mice. Histological analyses performed 8 weeks after the operation showed that grafts pretreated with GSIs--N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester or compound E--were significantly smaller than control samples. Immunohistologic analyses revealed that briefly treating the donor population with GSIs not only reduced the graft volume, but also altered the composition of the graft; control grafts showed neural overgrowth with numerous PAX6+ and Ki67+ neural rosettes, whereas GSI-treated samples developed into mature neuronal grafts containing primarily Tubβ3+ cells. These results suggest that pretreating potentially proliferative progenitors with GSIs may improve the safety of cell replacement therapies using pluripotent stem cells."}

Hence their interactions with cell membranes, which generally serve as targets for lipid peroxidation, are of enormous interest. Here we report in vitro studies, via absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, on the effects of several flavonoids (namely fisetin, quercetin, chrysin, morin, and 3-hydroxyflavone, 3-HF) in goat RBC membranes. Owing to the presence of functionally relevant membrane protein components embedded in the lipid bilayer RBC ghosts provide a more realistic system for exploring drug actions in biomembranes than simpler membrane models like phosphatidylcholine liposomes used in our previous studies [e.g. B. Sengupta, A. Banerjee, P.K. Sengupta, FEBS Lett. 570 (2004) 77-81]. Here, we demonstrate that binding of the flavonoids to the RBC membranes significantly inhibits lipid peroxidation, and at the same time enhances their integrity against hypotonic lysis. Interestingly, the antioxidant and antihemolytic activities are found to be crucially dependent on the locations of the flavonoids in the membrane matrix as revealed by fluorescence studies. Furthermore, we observe that FRET (from membrane protein tryptophans to flavonoids) occurs with significant efficiency indicating that the flavonoid binding sites lie in close proximity to the tryptophan residues in the ghost membrane proteins."}

However, it is unknown if these allostatic, or adaptive, sleep responses to CSR are paralleled by behavioral and neurochemical measures of sleepiness.	This study was designed to investigate CSR-induced changes in (1) sleep time and intensity as a measure of electrophysiological sleepiness, (2) sleep latency as a measure of behavioral sleepiness, and (3) brain adenosine A1 (A1R) and A2a receptor (A2aR) mRNA levels as a putative neurochemical correlate of sleepiness.

The protein was transiently upregulated at the differentiation-inducing non-permissive temperature of 39 degrees C and it was also secreted into the culture medium. Our findings are based on in vitro investigation of artificially immortalized cell lines.

IL-1beta was associated with photoreceptor rescue that was both dose-dependent and comparable to that seen following high-dose basic fibroblast growth factor. Significant anatomical rescue relative to controls was seen in both pink-eyed and pigmented strains, although the degree and distribution varied between strains. Functional rescue was confirmed by opto-kinetic response using the pigmented strain. At 5 microg ml(-1), IL-1beta resulted in numerous CD45+ profiles within the retina and vitreous. Infiltration peaked at 48 hr and was minimal at 4 weeks, without dysplastic sequelae. IL-1beta therefore induces visually significant photoreceptor rescue in a potent, dose-dependent manner that need not entail cytoarchitectural disruption. This is consistent with the known association between injury and rescue in the rat retina. Neuroprotection may be a general, if under-appreciated, consequence of inflammatory cascade activation."}

Whereas all five potassium channel subtypes (KCNQ1-KCNQ5) are found in the nervous system, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are the primary players that mediate M currents. We investigated the plasticity of subtype selectivity by two M current effective drugs, retigabine and zinc pyrithione (ZnPy). Retigabine is more effective on KCNQ3 than KCNQ2, whereas ZnPy is more effective on KCNQ2 with no detectable effect on KCNQ3. In neurons, activation of muscarinic receptor signaling desensitizes effects by retigabine but not ZnPy. Importantly, reduction of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) causes KCNQ3 to become sensitive to ZnPy but lose sensitivity to retigabine. The dynamic shift of pharmacological selectivity caused by PIP2 may be induced orthogonally by voltage-sensitive phosphatase, or conversely, abolished by mutating a PIP2 site within the S4-S5 linker of KCNQ3. Therefore, whereas drug-channel binding is a prerequisite, the drug selectivity on M current is dynamic and may be regulated by receptor signaling pathways via PIP2."}

Pro-inflammatory cytokines could contribute to these abnormalities in blood-brain barrier function. We have generated pharmacological quantities of mouse anti-ovine interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody and shown that this antibody has very high sensitivity and specificity for interleukin-1β protein. This antibody also neutralizes the effects of interleukin-1β protein in vitro. In the current study, we hypothesized that the neutralizing anti-interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody attenuates ischemia-reperfusion related fetal blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Instrumented ovine fetuses at 127 days of gestation were studied after 30 min of carotid occlusion and 24h of reperfusion. Groups were sham operated placebo-control- (n=5), ischemia-placebo- (n=6), ischemia-anti-IL-1β antibody- (n=7), and sham-control antibody- (n=2) treated animals. Systemic infusions of placebo (0.154M NaCl) or anti-interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody (5.1±0.6 mg/kg) were given intravenously to the same sham or ischemic group of fetuses at 15 min and 4h after ischemia. Concentrations of interleukin-1β protein and anti-interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody were measured by ELISA in fetal plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and parietal cerebral cortex. Blood-brain barrier permeability was quantified using the blood-to-brain transfer constant (Ki) with α-aminoisobutyric acid in multiple brain regions. Interleukin-1β protein was also measured in parietal cerebral cortices and tight junction proteins in multiple brain regions by Western immunoblot. Cerebral cortical interleukin-1β protein increased (P<0.001) after ischemia-reperfusion. After anti-interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody infusions, plasma anti-interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody was elevated (P<0.001), brain anti-interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody levels were higher (P<0.03), and interleukin-1β protein concentrations (P<0.03) and protein expressions (P<0.001) were lower in the monoclonal antibody-treated group than in placebo-treated-ischemia-reperfusion group. Monoclonal antibody infusions attenuated ischemia-reperfusion-related increases in Ki across the brain regions (P<0.04), and Ki showed an inverse linear correlation (r= -0.65, P<0.02) with anti-interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody concentrations in the parietal cortex, but had little effect on tight junction protein expression. We conclude that systemic anti-interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody infusions after ischemia result in brain anti-interleukin-1β antibody uptake, and attenuate ischemia-reperfusion-related interleukin-1β protein up-regulation and increases in blood-brain barrier permeability across brain regions in the fetus. The pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β, contributes to impaired blood-brain barrier function after ischemia in the fetus."}

The authors first determined the half life of NO2-Tyr in rat brain at 24 hours after the start of reperfusion by blocking NO2-Tyr formation with N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine and after the decay of NO2-Tyr by means of a hydrolysis/HPLC procedure. The values obtained were approximately 2 hours in both peri-infarct and core-of-infarct regions. Using the same hydrolysis/HPLC procedure, the ratio of nitrotyrosine to tyrosine from the 2-hour occlusion to as much as 72 hours after the start of reperfusion was measured in the presence and absence of aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice a day). In the absence of aminoguanidine, the ratio of NO2-Tyr in the peri-infarct and core-of-infarct regions reached 0.95% +/- 0.34% and 0.52% +/- 0.34%, respectively, at 1 hour after the start of reperfusion. The elevated levels persisted until 48 hours, then declined. The peri-infarct region showed the highest percent NO2-Tyr level, followed by the core of infarct, then the caudoputamen. Aminoguanidine significantly reduced NO2-Tyr formation (up to 90% inhibition) during 24 to 48 hours. The authors conclude that inducible nitric oxide synthase is predominantly responsible for NO2-Tyr formation, at least in the late phase of reperfusion. These results have important implications for the therapeutic time window and choice of nitric oxide synthase inhibitors in patients with cerebral infarction."}

Among the several pathogenic mechanisms that have been related to ALS, a dysregulation of calcium-buffering proteins in motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord can make these neurons more vulnerable to disease progression. Downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) is a neuronal calcium-binding protein that plays multiple roles in the nucleus and cytosol. The main aim of this study was focused on the characterization of DREAM and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) in the brain and spinal cord tissues from transgenic SOD1[G93A] mice and ALS patients to unravel its potential role under neurodegenerative conditions. The DREAM and GFAP levels in the spinal cord and different brain areas from transgenic SOD1[G93A] mice and ALS patients were analyzed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Our findings suggest that the calcium-dependent excitotoxicity progressively enhanced in the CNS in ALS could modulate the multifunctional nature of DREAM, strengthening its apoptotic way of action in both motor neurons and astrocytes, which could act as an additional factor to increase neuronal damage. The direct crosstalk between astrocytes and motor neurons can become vulnerable under neurodegenerative conditions, and DREAM could act as an additional switch to enhance motor neuron loss. Together, these findings could pave the way to further study the molecular targets of DREAM to find novel therapeutic strategies to fight ALS."}

This study was single-blinded, prospective, sham controlled randomized trial. 40 children with non-neurogenic OAB refractory to behavioural and anticholinergic therapy were randomized either to test group or sham group. Neuromodulation was performed using two self-adhesive electrodes cephalad to medial malleolus. In test group the stimulation was given with voltage pulse intensity of 0 to 10 mA, pulse width of 200 μs and frequency of 20 Hz. In sham group patch electrodes were applied to simulate the test group but no stimulation was given. In both groups, weekly session of 30 min was given for a period of 12 weeks. The OAB symptoms, severity of incontinence, number of voids daily (NV), average voided volume (AVV) and maximum voided volume (MVV) were evaluated before and after treatment.	On assessment of subjective improvement of OAB symptoms, 66.66% patients reported cure and 23.81% patients reported significant improvement of symptoms in test group whereas in sham group only 6.25% patients reported significant improvement. In test group 71.42% patients reported complete improvement in incontinence whereas in sham group only 12.5% patient reported complete improvement. The AVV, MVV and NV improved significantly in test group (p <0.001) as compared to sham group (Table).	The present study is unique as none of the earlier studies in children were sham controlled. It is also first PTNS study in which patch electrodes were used; therefore it is completely noninvasive. This technique provides better patient acceptability and compliance. This study proved that, there is a definite effect of PTNS as compared to placebo because when patients from sham group were treated actively, they responded well. The present study has few limitations as it has relatively short follow-up period of 12 weeks. Relapse of OAB symptoms and maintenance schedule of PTNS need to be assessed further.

While some intracellular events involved in the degeneration of dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers have been well characterized, changes in their secretory profile are undescribed. To analyze the secretome profile of mdx myotubes independently of myonecrosis, we labeled the proteins of mdx and wild-type myotubes with stable isotope-labeled amino acids (SILAC), finding marked enrichment of vesicular markers in the mdx secretome. These included the lysosomal-associated membrane protein, LAMP1, that co-localized in vesicles with an over-secreted cytoskeletal protein, myosin light chain 1. These LAMP1/MLC1-3-positive vesicles accumulated in the cytosol of mdx myotubes and were secreted into the culture medium in a range of abnormal densities. Restitution of dystrophin expression, by exon skipping, to some 30 % of the control value, partially normalized the secretome profile and the excess LAMP1 accumulation. Together, our results suggest that a lack of dystrophin leads to a general dysregulation of vesicle trafficking.

Significant elevations in the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), the inflammatory mediator interleukin 1β (IL-1β), chemokines (KC and MIP-2) and adhesive molecules (ICAM-1) as well as parallel reductions in enzymes activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) were observed in the cerebral homogenates of rats with late I/R injury. Associated with these changes, mRNA levels of OPN were significantly downregulated and those of iNOS and Bax were upregulated. All these changes were reversed by in 2-VO I/R induced rats pre-administered RES. These findings suggest that inhibition of sustained inflammatory response driven by IL-1β, decreased activities of endogenous antioxidants and downregulation of OPN induced upregulation of iNOS play important roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration during late cerebral I/R injury, effects that can be modulated by RES which might explain its neuroprotection effect during late global ischemia."}

The present study was aimed at investigating the antiepileptogenic effect of borneol in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling besides its ability to suppress oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Repeated administration of a subconvulsive dose of PTZ (35 mg/kg, i.p.) on every alternate day for 4 weeks produced kindling in mice. Borneol (5, 10, and 25 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) were given as a pretreatment prior to each PTZ injection during the progression of kindling. Oxidative stress parameters such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were assessed at the end of the study. Neuronal damage was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining technique. GFAP was also evaluated in the hippocampus region of the brain by using immunohistochemistry. Borneol significantly suppressed the process of epileptogenesis in PTZ-kindled mice. The biochemical alterations induced by PTZ kindling were ameliorated in borneol-treated animals which was indicated by decreased LPO and increased SOD, GSH, CAT levels. The distinct neuronal damage observed in the kindled group was counteracted by borneol. Furthermore, it decreased the levels of GFAP which was manifested by reduced immunostaining. The above results are suggestive of the antiepileptogenic potential of borneol in the PTZ-induced kindling model of epilepsy, and thus, it could be a prospective molecule in the treatment of epilepsy."}

Despite the cellular and biochemical evidences of an early motor system dysfunction, the conventional behavioral tests do not detect early motor impairments in SOD1 mouse model. We evaluated early changes in motor behavior of ALS mice by doing the analyses of tail elevation, footprint, automatic recording of motor activities by means of an infrared motion sensor activity system and electrophysiological measurements in male and female wild-type (WT) and SOD1(G93A) mice from postnatal day (P) 20 up to endpoint. The classical evaluations of mortality, weight loss, tremor, rotometer, hanging wire and inclined plane were also employed. There was a late onset (after P90) of the impairments of classical parameters and the outcome varied between genders of ALS mice, being tremor, cumulative survival, weight loss and neurological score about 10 days earlier in male than female ALS mice and also about 20 days earlier in ALS males regarding rotarod and hanging wire performances. While diminution of hindpaw base was 10 days earlier in ALS males (P110) compared to females, the steep length decreased 40 days earlier in ALS females (P60) than ALS males. The automatic analysis of motor impairments showed substantial late changes (after P90) of motility and locomotion in the ALS females, but not in the ALS males. It was surprising that the scores of tail elevation were already decreased in ALS males and females by P40, reaching the minimal values at the endpoint. The electrophysiological analyses showed early changes of measures in the ALS mouse sciatic nerve, i.e., decreased values of amplitude (P40) and nerve conduction velocity (P20), and also an increased latency (P20) reaching maximal level of impairments at the late disease phase. The early changes were not accompanied by reductions of neuronal protein markers of neurofilament 200 and ChAT in the ventral part of the lumbar spinal cord of P20 and P60 ALS mice by means of Western blot technique, despite remarkable decreases of those protein levels in P120 ALS mice. In conclusion, early changes of motor behavior and electrophysiological parameters in ALS mouse model must be taken into attention in the analyses of disease mechanisms and therapeutic effects."}

Several clinical, epidemiological and experimental evidences suggest that consumption of the MeDiet reduces the incidence of certain pathologies related to oxidative stress, chronic inflammation and immune system diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). These reductions can be partially attributed to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) consumption which has been described as a key bioactive food because of its high nutritional quality and its particular composition of fatty acids, vitamins and polyphenols. Indeed, the beneficial effects of EVOO have been linked to its fatty acid composition, which is very rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and has moderate saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The current knowledge available on the beneficial effects of EVOO and its phenolic compounds, specifically its biological properties and antioxidant capacity against immune-mediated inflammatory responses (atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, obesity, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or neurodegenerative disease, among others) in addition to its potential clinical applications.

We aimed to describe, with an emphasis on clinical applications, what is known about the role of inflammatory cytokines in cardiac arrest.	A PubMed literature review was performed for relevant articles. Only articles in English that studied cytokines in patients with cardiac arrest were included.	Cytokines play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PCAS. Following cardiac arrest, the large release of circulating cytokines mediates the ischemia/reperfusion injury, brain dysfunction, and myocardial dysfunction seen. Interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, and matrix metalloproteinases all play a unique prognostic role in PCAS. High levels of inflammatory cytokines have been associated with mortality and/or poor neurologic outcomes. Interventions to modify the systemic inflammation seen in PCAS continue to be heavily studied. Currently, the only approved medical intervention for comatose patients following cardiac arrest is targeted temperature management.

CIA was induced in DBA/1 mice by immunisation with type II collagen (CII). Altered HA308-317, wild-type HA308-317 or irrelevant peptide was administered intranasally beginning from arthritis onset. Clinical and histological scores were assessed, and cytokine levels in the serum or supernatants from splenocytes were determined. The percentages of Th1 and Th2 cells in response to different peptides were analysed by FACS both in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that intranasal administration of altered HA308-317 peptide significantly ameliorated CIA. The therapeutic effect of altered HA308-317 peptide was associated with a substantial decrease in production of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, anti-CII IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies, and an markedly increase in production of IL-10 and IL-4 in serum or supernatants from splenocytes treated with altered HA308-317 peptide.

We examined the effect of the synthetic serine protease inhibitor FUT-175 (developed as a potent inhibitor of thrombin and the complement system) on vascular lesions using balloon dilatation-induced neointimal formation in the carotid artery of rats.	Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats underwent balloon dilatation injury of the left carotid artery to induce neointimal formation.

The control group (n=8) was similarly treated with 1 mL of saline for 7 days. The injections were started immediately after balloon injury. Two weeks after the injury, the left carotid arteries were perfusion-fixed, and the areas of the neointimal and medial layer were analyzed under a microscope.	A morphometric analysis revealed that there were significant differences in the intima-media ratio between the 4 groups treated with vehicle (saline) or a low, medium, or high dose of FUT-175 (1.45+/-0.11, 1.08+/-0.06, 0.71+/-0.04, or 0.32+/-0.04, respectively). This suppression was achieved in a dose-dependent manner by the administration of FUT-175 after balloon injury.

Here, we describe a rapid kinetic investigation of the mechanism of inhibition of the GluA2Q(flip) AMPA receptor channel opening by two 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives, i.e. the prototypic 2,3-benzodiazepine compound GYKI 52466 [(1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine)] and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7,8-methylenedioxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one (BDZ-2). GYKI 52466 and BDZ-2 are structurally similar in that the 4-methyl group in the diazepine ring of GYKI 52466 is replaced by a carbonyl group, yielding BDZ-2. Using a laser-pulse photolysis technique with ∼60 μs time resolution, we characterize the effect of the two compounds individually on the channel-opening process of the GluA2Q(flip) receptor expressed in HEK-293 cells. We find that BDZ-2 preferentially inhibits the open-channel state, whereas GYKI 52466 is more selective for the closed-channel state of the GluA2Q(flip) receptors. Each inhibitor binds independently to its own noncompetitive site, yet the two sites do not interact allosterically. The significance of these results in the context of both the structure-activity relationship and the properties of the GluA2Q(flip) receptor channels is presented."}

When environmental conditions are hot and humid, the normal physiological cooling mechanisms become ineffective. The heat accumulated may exceed a critical thermal maximum (estimated to be 42°C), which may trigger a complex pathophysiological cascade with potentially lethal consequences. This syndrome has been labelled exertional heat illness (EHI). EHI is described in humans, but has not been well documented in Thoroughbred racehorses. The clinical signs described in racehorses would suggest that the pathophysiological events affecting the central nervous (CNS) and gastrointestinal systems are similar to those described in humans. Clinical signs are progressive and include signs of endotoxaemia and increasing levels of CNS dysfunction. Initially, horses that may be mildly irritable (agitated, randomly kicking out) may progress to unmanageable (disorientation, severe ataxia, falling) and ultimately convulsions, coma and death. Currently, the approach to treatment is largely empirical and involves rapid and effective cooling, administration of drugs to provide sedation, administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to ameliorate the effects of endotoxaemia and glucocorticoids to stabilise cell membranes and reduce the effects of inflammation on the CNS. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about EHI in Thoroughbred racehorses, suggests a likely pathophysiology of the syndrome in horses based on the current literature on heat illness in humans and horses, and outlines current treatment strategies being used to treat racehorses with clinical signs of EHI."}

Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, play a central role in remyelination and originate from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). We recently showed that depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) impairs remyelination in vivo, and that Treg-secreted factors directly enhance oligodendrocyte differentiation. Here we aim to further characterize the dynamics of Treg-enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation as well as elucidate the cellular components of a murine mixed neuron-glia model. Murine mixed neuron-glia cultures were generated from P2-7 C57BL/6 mice and characterized for percentage of neuronal and glial cell populations prior to treatment at 7 days in vitro (div) as well as after treatment with Treg-conditioned media at multiple timepoints up to 12 div. Mixed neuron-glia cultures consisted of approximately 30% oligodendroglial lineage cells, 20% neurons and 10% microglia. Furthermore, a full layer of astrocytes, that could not be quantified, was present. Treatment with Treg-conditioned media enhanced the proportion of MBP[+] oligodendrocytes and decreased the proportion of PDGFRα[+] OPCs, but did not affect OPC proliferation or survival. Treg-enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation was not caused by Treg polarizing factors, was dependent on the number of activation cycles Treg underwent and was robustly achieved by using 5% conditioned media.

DR can cause irreversible blindness, and its pathogenesis is considered multifactorial. DR can progress from non-proliferative DR to proliferative DR, characterized by retinal neovascularization. The main cause of vision loss in diabetic patients is diabetic macular edema, caused by vessel leakage and blood retinal barrier breakdown. Currently, aflibercept is an anti-VEGF approved for diabetic macular edema. Aflibercept can bind several members of vascular permeability factors, namely VEGF-A, B, and PlGF. We analyzed the aflibercept-PlGF complex at molecular level, through an in silico approach. In order to explore the role of PlGF in DR, we treated primary human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) and mouse retinal epithelial cells (RPEs) with aflibercept and an anti-PlGF antibody. We explored the hypothesis that aflibercept has anti-inflammatory action through blocking of PlGF signaling and the ERK axis in an in vitro and in vivo model of DR. Both aflibercept and the anti-PlGF antibody exerted protective effects on retinal cells, by inhibition of the ERK pathway. Moreover, aflibercept significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the expression of TNF-α in an in vitro and in vivo model of DR. Therefore, our data suggest that inhibition of PlGF signaling, or a selective blocking, may be useful in the management of early phases of DR when the inflammatory process is largely involved."}

We hypothesized that seizures cause cerebral vascular dysfunction when HO activity is inhibited. With the use of cranial window techniques, we examined cerebral vascular responses to endothelium-dependent (hypercapnia and bradykinin) and endothelium-independent (isoproterenol and sodium nitroprusside) dilators during the recovery from bicuculline-induced seizures in saline controls and in animals pretreated with a HO inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin (SnPP). SnPP (3 mg/kg iv) blocked dilation to heme and reduced the CO level in cortical periarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid, indicating HO inhibition in the cerebral microcirculation. In saline control piglets, seizures increased the CO level, which correlated with the time-dependent cerebral vasodilation; during the recovery (2 h after seizure induction), responses to all vasodilators were preserved. In SnPP-treated animals, cerebral vasodilation and the CO responses to seizures were greatly reduced, and cerebral vascular reactivity was severely impaired during the recovery.

However, when comparing the MT-ratio of the cortex of WT mice with the MT-ratio of the APP/PS1 mice at 2, 4, 6 or 8 months of age, no significant changes could be observed. In contrast to the cortex, we consistently observed a decreased MT-ratio in the splenium of 4, 6 and 8 month old APP/PS1 mice as compared to age-matched WT mice. Lastly, the decreased MT-ratio in the splenium of APP/PS1 mice correlated to the Aβ plaque deposition, astrogliosis and microgliosis. This MT-ratio decrease did however not correlate to the myelin content. Combined, our results suggest that MTC is able to visualize early Aβ-induced changes in the splenium but not the cortex of APP/PS1 mice.	•MTC visualizes cortical Aβ-induced changes at very old ages.•MTC visualizes longitudinal Aβ-induced white matter changes in young APP/PS1 mice.•Changes in white matter MT-ratios correlate to Aβ plaque load, astro- and microgliosis."}

Engagement of the OX-40R, with either OX-40 ligand (OX-40L) or an Ab agonist, delivers a strong costimulatory signal to effector T cells. OX-40R+ T cells isolated from inflammatory lesions in the CNS of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis are the cells that respond to autoantigen (myelin basic protein) in vivo. We identified OX-40R+ T cells within primary tumors and tumor-invaded lymph nodes of patients with cancer and hypothesized that they are the tumor-Ag-specific T cells. Therefore, we investigated whether engagement of the OX-40R in vivo during tumor priming would enhance a tumor-specific T cell response. Injection of OX-40L:Ig or anti-OX-40R in vivo during tumor priming resulted in a significant improvement in the percentage of tumor-free survivors (20-55%) in four different murine tumors derived from four separate tissues. This anti-OX-40R effect was dose dependent and accentuated tumor-specific T cell memory. The data suggest that engagement of the OX-40R in vivo augments tumor-specific priming by stimulating/expanding the natural repertoire of the host's tumor-specific CD4+ T cells. The identification of OX-40R+ T cells clustered around human tumor cells in vivo suggests that engagement of the OX-40R may be a practical approach for expanding tumor-reactive T cells and thereby a method to improve tumor immunotherapy in patients with cancer."}

However, it is clear that most animal models are deficient when compared to the complexity of human diseases: they cannot sufficiently replicate all the features of multisystem disorders. Furthermore, some practical differences may affect the use or interpretation of animal imaging to model human conditions such as the use of anesthesia, various species differences, and limitations of methodological tools. Nevertheless, imaging animal models allows us to dissect, in interpretable bits, the effects of one system upon another, the consequences of variable neuronal losses or overactive systems, the results of experimental treatments, and we can develop and validate new methods. In this review, we focus on imaging modalities that are easily used in both human subjects and animal models such as positron emission and magnetic resonance imaging and discuss aging and Parkinson's disease as prototypical examples of preclinical imaging studies."}

Use of truncated mutants of the neuritogenic peptide of myelin basic protein (MBP) has been shown to anergize autoreactive T cells and to reverse experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). To establish a rationale basis for the use of altered peptide ligands (APLs) in the treatment of autoimmune diseases we designed a set of N- and C-terminally truncated mutants of the minimal experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) inducing bovine P2 (bP2) (60-70) peptide and compared them for the ability to induce immune responses and T cell receptor (TCR) cell signaling. Truncated peptides bound to MHC class II molecules and induced TCR internalization and expression of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) with decreasing potency. None of the shortened mutants elicited a proliferative response in P2-specific T cells. Stimulation of these antigen-specific T cells with peptide bP2(62-69) using antigen presenting cells (APCs) prepulsed with bP2(60-70) resulted in a significant decrease of the proliferative response. In agreement with the observed effects on T cell activation, analysis of TCR signaling demonstrated a lack of CD3 epsilon phosphorylation and MAPK activation. Moreover, repeated injection of bP2(62-69) significantly slowed progression of adoptive transfer EAN (AT-EAN). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that peptide bP2(62-69) can favorably modulate the antigen-induced response of neuritogenic T cells."}

OSA is associated with increased risk for morbidity and mortality affecting cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive systems, and more recently with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cancer-related deaths. Substantial variability in OSA outcomes suggests that genetically-determined and environmental and lifestyle factors affect the phenotypic susceptibility to OSA. Furthermore, OSA and obesity often co-exist and manifest activation of shared molecular end-organ injury mechanisms that if properly identified may represent potential therapeutic targets. A challenge in the development of non-invasive diagnostic assays in body fluids is the ability to identify clinically relevant biomarkers. Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) include a heterogeneous population of vesicular structures including exosomes, prostasomes, microvesicles (MVs), ectosomes and oncosomes, and are classified based on their size, shape and membrane surface composition. Of these, exosomes (30-100nm) are very small membrane vesicles derived from multi-vesicular bodies or from the plasma membrane and play important roles in mediating cell-cell communication via cargo that includes lipids, proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs and DNA. We have recently identified a unique cluster of exosomal miRNAs in both humans and rodents exposed to intermittent hypoxia as well as in patients with OSA with divergent morbid phenotypes. Here we summarize such recent findings, and will focus on exosomal miRNAs in both adult and children which mediate intercellular communication relevant to OSA and endothelial dysfunction, and their potential value as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers."}

Currently, natural products or nutraceuticals (commonly called medical foods) are increasingly employed for adjunctive therapy of these patients. However, the potential molecular mechanisms of the nutrient efficacy remain elusive. In this review, we summarized the neuroprotective and anti-cancer mechanisms of nutraceuticals. It was concluded that the nutraceuticals exerted neuroprotection and suppressed tumor growth possibly through the differential modulations of redox homeostasis. In addition, the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ROS elimination was manipulated by multiple molecular mechanisms, including cell signaling pathways, inflammation, transcriptional regulation and epigenetic modulation, which were involved in the therapeutic potential of nutraceutical antioxidants against neurological diseases and cancers. We specifically proposed that ROS scavenging was integral in the neuroprotective potential of nutraceuticals, while alternation of ROS level (either increase or decrease) or disruption of redox homeostasis (ROS addiction) constituted the anti-cancer property of these compounds. We also hypothesized that ROS-associated ferroptosis, a novel type of lipid ROS-dependent regulatory cell death, was likely to be a critical mechanism for the nutraceutical antioxidants. Targeting ferroptosis is advantageous to develop new nutraceuticals with more effective and lower adverse reactions for curing patients with neuropsychiatric diseases or carcinomas."}

Samples were obtained from both trachea and main bronchi. Modified electron microscopic scoring model was used to reveal the ultrastructural changes in both trauma and treatment groups.	There was no statistical difference between control and sham groups (p >0.05). Scores of all trauma groups were significantly different from the controls (p <0.05). Trauma produced obvious gradual damage on ultrastructure of the tracheobronchial epithelia. Erythropoietin decreased tracheobronchial scores after traumatic brain injury in significant levels. Erythropoietin attenuated ultrastructural scores for each organelle in significant levels (p <0.05 for each organelle).	The data suggested that ultrastructural damage is obvious at 2 hours deteriorating with time. Erythropoietin protects epithelia against damage after traumatic brain injury. Pharmaceutical lung preservation may help gaining efficacious donor lungs in brain death. But, further time dependent experiments are needed to determine the liability of the donor lung after traumatic brain injury. This fact is to be known for achieving higher graft survival rates."}

Neuroinflammation in the brain and spinal cord is a contributing factor to the development of symptoms associated with chronic opioid use. Recent studies have described a link between neuroinflammation and behavior that is mediated by a gut-brain signaling axis, where alterations in indigenous gut bacteria contribute to several inflammation-related psychopathologies. As opioid receptors are highly expressed within the digestive tract and opioids influence gut motility, we hypothesized that systemic opioid treatment will impact the composition of the gut microbiota. Here, we explored how opioid treatments, and cessation, impacts the mouse gut microbiome and whether opioid-induced changes in the gut microbiota influences inflammation-driven hyperalgesia and impaired reward behavior. Male C57Bl6/J mice were treated with either intermittent or sustained morphine. Using 16S rDNA sequencing, we describe changes in gut microbiota composition following different morphine regimens. Manipulation of the gut microbiome was used to assess the causal relationship between the gut microbiome and opioid-dependent behaviors. Intermittent, but not sustained, morphine treatment was associated with microglial activation, hyperalgesia, and impaired reward response. Depletion of the gut microbiota via antibiotic treatment surprisingly recapitulated neuroinflammation and sequelae, including reduced opioid analgesic potency and impaired cocaine reward following intermittent morphine treatment. Colonization of antibiotic-treated mice with a control microbiota restored microglial activation state and behaviors. Our findings suggest that differing opioid regimens uniquely influence the gut microbiome that is causally related to behaviors associated with opioid dependence."}

We investigated if fingolimod provides long-term protection from experimental neonatal germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH), aiming to support a potential mechanism of acute fingolimod-induced protection. GMH was induced in P7 rats by infusion of collagenase (0.3 U) into the right ganglionic eminence. Animals killed at 4 weeks post-GMH received low- or high-dose fingolimod (0.25 or 1.0 mg/kg) or vehicle, and underwent neurocognitive testing before histopathological evaluation. Subsequently, a cohort of animals killed at 72 h post-GMH received 1.0 mg/kg fingolimod; the specific S1PR1 agonist, SEW2871; or fingolimod co-administered with the S1PR1/3/4 inhibitor, VPC23019, or the Rac1 inhibitor, EHT1864. All drugs were injected intraperitoneally 1, 24, and 48 h post-surgery. At 72 h post-GMH, brain water content, extravasated Evans blue dye, and hemoglobin were measured as well as the expression levels of phospho-Akt, Akt, GTP-Rac1, Total-Rac1, ZO1, occludin, and claudin-3 determined. Fingolimod significantly improved long-term neurocognitive performance and ameliorated brain tissue loss. At 72 h post-GMH, fingolimod reduced brain water content and Evans blue dye extravasation as well as reversed GMH-induced loss of tight junctional proteins. S1PR1 agonism showed similar protection, whereas S1PR or Rac1 inhibition abolished the protective effect of fingolimod. Fingolimod treatment improved functional and morphological outcomes after GMH, in part, by tempering acute post-hemorrhagic blood-brain barrier disruption via the activation of the S1PR1/Akt/Rac1 pathway."}

Invertebrate nAChRs are targets of anthelmintics as well as a major group of insecticides, the neonicotinoids. The honey bee, Apis mellifera, is one of the most beneficial insects worldwide, playing an important role in crop pollination, and is also a valuable model system for studies on social interaction, sensory processing, learning, and memory. We have used the A. mellifera genome information to characterize the complete honey bee nAChR gene family. Comparison with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae shows that the honey bee possesses the largest family of insect nAChR subunits to date (11 members). As with Drosophila and Anopheles, alternative splicing of conserved exons increases receptor diversity. Also, we show that in one honey bee nAChR subunit, six adenosine residues are targeted for RNA A-to-I editing, two of which are evolutionarily conserved in Drosophila melanogaster and Heliothis virescens orthologs, and that the extent of editing increases as the honey bee lifecycle progresses, serving to maximize receptor diversity at the adult stage. These findings on Apis mellifera enhance our understanding of nAChR functional genomics and provide a useful basis for the development of improved insecticides that spare a major beneficial insect species."}

The milestones responsible for the accelerated development of POP inhibitors include the discovery that these compounds reverse memory loss in animal models of drug- or lesion-induced amnesia and the observation that the expression of POP correlates with age. Today, several POP inhibitors have already been evaluated in preclinical trials as potential drugs for the treatment of natural memory deficits that occur with aging or the pathological memory loss characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of N25 with regard to drug distribution and molecular docking, and anti-proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycling, and LD50. First, we designed a molecular approach for modeling selected SAHA derivatives based on available structural information regarding human HDAC8 in complex with SAHA (PDB code 1T69). N25 was found to be stabilized by direct interaction with the HDAC8. Anti-proliferative activity was observed in human glioma U251, U87, T98G cells and human lung cancer H460, A549, H1299 cells at moderate concentrations (0.5-30 μM). Compared with SAHA, N25 displayed an increased antitumor activity in U251 and H460 cells. We further analyzed cell death mechanisms activated by N25 in U251 and H460 cells. N25 significantly increased acetylation of Histone 3 and inhibited HDAC4. On RT-PCR analysis, N25 increased the mRNA levels of p21, however, decreased the levels of p53. These resulted in promotion of apoptosis, inducing G0/G1 arrest in U251 cells and G2/M arrest in H460 cells in a time-dependent and dose- dependent manner.

The chemokine MCP-1 is highly expressed during endotoxemia and although much is known about the importance of MCP-1 in peripheral inflammatory responses to LPS, information about MCP-1 and CNS responses to peripheral LPS is lacking.	C57Bl/6 mice were administered LPS by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, serum and brains were collected at several time points, and the time course of MCP-1 protein up-regulation was measured. To examine the role of MCP-1 in activation of the brain during acute systemic inflammation, we injected MCP-1 knockout (MCP-1-/-) or control C57Bl/6 (MCP-1+/+) mice with LPS i.p. and measured the levels of selected cytokines and chemokines in serum and brain extracts 6 hours later. Activated microglia were examined by CD45 immunohistochemistry, and serum corticosterone and ACTH levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay.	We report that LPS injection induces a robust increase in MCP-1 protein levels in serum and brain, with peak brain levels reached at 6 hrs after LPS administration. MCP-1-/- mice injected with LPS showed higher levels of serum IL-1beta and TNF-alpha compared to LPS-treated MCP-1+/+ mice. In contrast, these MCP-1-/- mice showed significantly lower inductions of brain pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, fewer activated microglia, and a reduction in serum corticosterone levels.	MCP-1-/- mice have decreased brain inflammation after a peripheral LPS insult, despite an exaggerated peripheral response.

We investigated the contribution of the MAP kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), to neonatal HI brain damage. JNK regulates several transcriptional (via AP-1 activation) and non-transcriptional processes involved in brain damage such as inflammation and cell death/survival. P7 rats were subjected to HI by unilateral carotid artery occlusion and hypoxia. HI-induced activation of cerebral AP-1 peaked at 3-6h post-HI. Intraperitoneal administration of the JNK-inhibitor TAT-JBD immediately after HI prevented AP-1 activation. TAT-JBD treatment within 3h after HI reduced early neuronal damage by approximately 30%. JNK/AP-1 inhibition did not reduce HI-induced cytokine/chemokine expression. Analysis of indicators of apoptotic cell death revealed that TAT-JBD markedly reduced the HI-induced increase in active caspase 3. However, the upstream mediators of apoptosis: active caspase 8, cleaved Bid, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase 9 cleavage were not reduced after TAT-JBD. TAT-JBD inhibited the HI-induced increase in Smac/DIABLO, an inhibitor of IAPs that prevent activation of caspase 3. TAT-JBD treatment also reduced cleavage of alpha-fodrin, indicating that calpain-mediated brain damage was reduced. Neuroprotection by TAT-JBD treatment was long-lasting as gray- and white matter damage was diminished by approximately 50% at 14 weeks post-HI concomitantly with marked improvement of sensorimotor behavior and cognitive functioning. In conclusion, JNK inhibition by TAT-JBD treatment reduced neonatal HI brain damage with a therapeutic window of 3h and long-lasting anatomical and behavioral improvements. We propose that inhibition of mitochondrial Smac/DIABLO release and calpain activation contribute to neuroprotection by TAT-JBD."}

Ammoxetine ((±)-3-(benzo[d] [1,3]dioxol-4-yloxy)-N-methyl-3-(thiophen-2-yl)propan-1-amine) has been identified as a novel potent SNRI. In this study, we evaluated the acute analgesic properties of ammoxetine in different animal models of pain, and examined the involvement of monoamines in its analgesic actions.	The analgesic effects of ammoxetine were assayed using models of acetic acid- and formalin-induced pain in mice, neuropathic pain induced by sciatic nerve injury (SNI), chronic constriction injury (CCI) and reserpine-induced fibromyalgia pain in rats. The contents of 5-HT and NE in brain regions of fibromyalgia rats were measured using HPLC-ECD. In all the experiments, duloxetine was used as a positive control drug.	Oral administration of ammoxetine (0.625-10 mg/kg) or duloxetine (2.5-40 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased the number of acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced first phase and second phase paw licking time in mice. Oral administration of ammoxetine (2.5-10 mg/kg) or duloxetine (10 mg/kg) alleviated mechanical allodynia in SNI and CCI rats and thermal hyperalgesia in CCI rats. The antiallodynic effect of ammoxetine in CCI rats was abolished by pretreatment with para-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (PCPA, a 5-HT synthesis inhibitor) or α-methyl-para-tyrosine methylester (AMPT, a catecholamine synthesis inhibitor). Oral administration of ammoxetine (30 mg/kg) or duloxetine (50 mg/kg) significantly attenuated tactile allodynia in rats with reserpine-induced fibromyalgia. In the fibromyalgia rats, administration of ammoxetine (10, 30 mg/kg) or duloxetine (30, 50 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased the levels of 5-HT and NE, and decreased the metabolite ratio of 5-HT (5-HIAA/5-HT) in the spinal cord, hypothalamus, thalamus and prefrontal cortex.

At the moment, studies have shown diverse effects of medications on functional status. For example, some have shown potentially detrimental effects, while others have found improvements on physical function in elders. Overall, suboptimal prescribing and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may negatively affect functional status. The use of selected drugs acting on central nervous system (CNS), e.g. benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, is generally associated with an increased risk of functional decline. The greater sensitivity of older people to these drugs, together with age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, account for the observed detrimental effect and suggests a cautious approach to older and frail patients when prescribing CNS agents. On the other hand, selected drugs may slow or delay functional decline in older people. In particular, drugs aimed at targeting sarcopenia (loss in muscle mass and strength), such as testosterone in androgen deficiency, ACE-inhibitors, vitamin D and β-hydroxy β-methyl butyrate (HMB), as well as the recently developed selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) may hold extreme importance. This review will provide available evidence of the diverse impacts of drug medications on functional status in older persons."}

Rat brain slices were pre-incubated at 33 degree centigrade in the presence (10, 100, and 200 micromol/L, respectively) or absence of DHED for 1 h. Then, CA 0.1 micromol/L was added and the slices were treated for another 2 h. Western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry were used to measure the phosphorylation level of tau and PP-2A.	CA treatment could remarkably increase the immunoreactivity of pS262 and decrease the staining of Tau-1, representing tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser262 (pS262) and Ser198/ 199/202 (Tau-1, as the antibody reacts with unphosphorylated tau, therefore, decreased staining represents increased phosphorylation). Pre-incubation of the brain slices with DHED could efficiently attenuate the CA-induced tau hyperphosphorylation at the above AD-related sites. Additionally, DHED also decreased the basal phosphorylation level of tau at Ser396, although CA failed to induce tau hyperphosphorylation at this site. Furthermore, CA treatment induced an increased level of Tyr307-phosphorylated PP-2A, which represents inactivation of the phosphatase, whereas DHED arrested the elevation of the inhibitory modification of PP-2A.	DHED can attenuate CA-induced tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites in metabolically active rat brain slices.

First, there was the implementation of the official IASP 'Budapest' diagnostic criteria. It would be desirable to also define exclusion and outcome criteria that should be reported in studies. The next step was to recognize the complex pathophysiology. After trauma, some inflammation is physiological; in acute CRPS, this inflammation persists for months. There is an abundance of inflammatory and a lack of anti-inflammatory mediators. This proinflammatory network (cytokines and probably also other mediators) sensitizes the peripheral and spinal nociceptive system, it facilitates the release of neuropeptides from nociceptors inducing the visible signs of inflammation, and it stimulates bone cell or fibroblast proliferation, and endothelial dysfunction leading to vascular changes. Trauma may also expose nervous system structures to the immune system and triggers autoantibodies binding to adreno- and acetylcholine receptors. In an individual time frame, the pain in this inflammatory phase pushes the transition into 'centralized' CRPS, which is dominated by neuronal plasticity and reorganization. Sensory-motor integration becomes disturbed, leading to a loss of motor function; the body representation is distorted leading to numbness and autonomic disturbances. In an attempt to avoid pain, patients neglect their limb and learn maladaptive nonuse. The final step will be to assess large cohorts and to analyze these data together with data from public resources using a bioinformatics approach. We could then develop diagnostic toolboxes for individual pathophysiology and select focused treatments or develop new ones."}

NVP-BEZ235 is a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that also effectively targets ATR with IC50 = 21 × 10[- 9] M in cells. AZD6738 does not target significantly PI3K/mTOR-related kinases but specifically inhibits ATR with IC50 = 74 × 10[- 9] M in cells. Both drugs have been proposed as radiosensitizers of different tumors including glioblastoma (GB), the most malignant brain tumor. In order to study the radiosensitizing properties of ATR inhibitors NVP-BEZ235 and AZD6738 towards GB, we have preliminarily investigated their capacity to penetrate the brain after systemic administration. Tumor-free CD-1 mice were inoculated i.p. with 25 mg/Kg body weight of NVP-BEZ235 or AZD6738. 1, 2, 6 and 8 h later, blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding after which the mice were euthanized and the brains explanted.

This is not to say that central changes are unimportant, only that much of the central change is supported by a peripheral drive. This begs the question of what causes this peripheral drive. In some instances, particularly in association with peripheral nerve injury, nociceptors may become spontaneously active because of alterations in ion channel function or expression. But in most cases nociceptor activity arises because of the actions of peripheral mediators released by injured or damaged tissue. Some of these mediators are well known, such as the prostanoids. Others have more recently been identified, such as nerve growth factor (NGF). However, the limited efficacy of existing analgesic therapies strongly suggests that other important pain mediators exist.

Focus on protein homeostasis.^\nNeuroprotection strategies to improve stroke outcome have been successful in the laboratory but not in clinical stroke trials, and thus have come under scrutiny by the medical community. Experimental stroke investigators are therefore under increased pressure to resolve this problem. Acute ischemic stroke represents a severe form of metabolic stress that activates many pathological processes and thereby impairs cellular functions. Traditionally, neuroprotection strategies were designed to improve stroke outcome by interfering with pathological processes triggered by ischemia. However, stroke outcome is also dependent on the brain's capacity to restore cellular functions impaired by ischemia, and this capacity declines with age. It is, therefore, conceivable that this age-dependent decline in the brain's self-healing capacity contributes to the disparity between the success of neuroprotective strategies in young animals, and limited success in elderly stroke patients. Here, prosurvival pathways that restore protein homeostasis impaired by ischemic stress should be considered, because their capacity decreases with increasing age, and maintenance of proteome fidelity is pivotal for cell survival. Boosting such prosurvival pathways pharmacologically to restore protein homeostasis and, thereby, cellular functions impaired by ischemic stress is expected to counterbalance the compromised self-healing capacity of aged brains and thereby help to improve stroke outcome."}

However, their use is associated with significant side effects. Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptors have been implicated in several opiate-induced neuroadaptive changes including the development of tolerance. In this study, we investigated the consequences of NPFF receptor blockade on acute and chronic stimulation of opioid receptors in mice by using RF9, a potent and selective antagonist of NPFF receptors that can be administered systemically. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The effects of RF9 were investigated on opioid pharmacological responses including locomotor activity, antinociception, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, rewarding properties and physical dependence. KEY RESULTS RF9 had no effect on morphine-induced horizontal hyperlocomotion and slightly attenuated the decrease induced in vertical activity. Furthermore, RF9 dose-dependently blocked the long-lasting hyperalgesia produced by either acute fentanyl or chronic morphine administration. RF9 also potentiated opiate early analgesic effects and prevented the development of morphine tolerance. Finally, RF9 increased morphine-induced conditioned place preference without producing any rewarding effect by itself and decreased naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome following chronic morphine treatment. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS The NPFF system is involved in the development of two major undesirable effects: tolerance and dependence, which are clinically associated with prolonged exposure to opiates. Our findings suggest that NPFF receptors are interesting therapeutic targets to improve the analgesic efficacy of opiates by limiting the development of tolerance, and for the treatment of opioid dependence."}

In this report we assessed the inflammatory potential of alpha-synuclein, a protein central to PD pathogenesis, released by neurons on the mouse microglia cell line BV-2. BV-2 cells were treated with conditioned medium isolated from normal SH-SY5Y cells and clones that over-express WT or mutant A53T alpha-synuclein. Conditioned medium isolated from over-expressing clones induced the transcription and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of SH-SY5Y alpha-synuclein over-expressing cells with MPP+, the active metabolite of the neurotoxin MPTP, increased the inflammatory response in BV-2 cells. In contrast, the direct exposure of BV-2 cells to MPP+ failed to induce an inflammatory response.

Experimental data demonstrated that rt-PA increases the activity of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP).

In our mouse model of cerebral ischemia, administration of rt-PA (10 mg/kg, i.v.) 6h after ischemia aggravated the post-ischemic degradation of ZO-1, claudin-5 and VE-cadherin, increased the hemorrhagic transformations (assessed by brain hemoglobin content and magnetic resonance imaging). Furthermore, rt-PA also aggravated ischemia-induced functional deficits. Combining PJ34 with rt-PA preserved the expression of ZO-1, claudin-5 and VE-cadherin, reduced the hemorrhagic transformations and improved the sensorimotor performances.

A video-tracking system was used to automatically track mouse behavior in standard breeding cages with C57BL/6N mice. We tested two odorants (peanut butter for the preference test, 2MB acid for the avoidance test) and distilled water (for a control). Mouse behavior was recorded for 3min and analyzed. For the preference test, investigation time was measured. For the avoidance test, time spent in sectors away from the odorant zone was measured. To confirm our experimental settings, we also evaluated an anosmia mouse model prepared with intranasal administration of ZnSO4.	All strains of mice showed reproducible behavior patterns of preference or avoidance for the odorants. The anosmia mouse model, as expected, failed to show an olfactory ability for preference or avoidance, and this was well-matched by histologic changes caused by the ZnSO4 treatment. The automatic video tracking system successfully tracked and automatically calculated mouse behavior with good reproducibility.	Our olfactory behavior test offers a simple and accurate method to evaluate olfactory function in mice. This test can be utilized as a possible standard method to search for features of olfactory phenotypes in mice."}

Stem cell transplantation-based regenerative therapy is a promising approach for axon regeneration and functional recovery of peripheral nerve injury; however, the mechanisms remain controversial and unclear. Recent studies suggest that transplanted stem cells promote tissue regeneration through a paracrine mechanism. We investigated the effects of conditioned media derived from stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED-CM) on peripheral nerve regeneration. In vitro, SHED-CM-treated Schwann cells exhibited significantly increased proliferation, migration, and the expression of neuron-, extracellular matrix (ECM)-, and angiogenesis-related genes. SHED-CM stimulated neuritogenesis of dorsal root ganglia and increased cell viability. Similarly, SHED-CM enhanced tube formation in an angiogenesis assay. In vivo, a 10-mm rat sciatic nerve gap model was bridged by silicon conduits containing SHED-CM or serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Light and electron microscopy confirmed that the number of myelinated axons and axon-to-fiber ratio (G-ratio) were significantly higher in the SHED-CM group at 12 weeks after nerve transection surgery. The sciatic functional index (SFI) and gastrocnemius (target muscle) wet weight ratio demonstrated functional recovery. Increased compound muscle action potentials and increased SFI in the SHED-CM group suggested sciatic nerve reinnervation of the target muscle and improved functional recovery. We also observed reduced muscle atrophy in the SHED-CM group. Thus, SHEDs may secrete various trophic factors that enhance peripheral nerve regeneration through multiple mechanisms. SHED-CM may therefore provide a novel therapy that creates a more desirable extracellular microenvironment for peripheral nerve regeneration."}

The TTX and toxic analogs block sodium ion activity of mammalian nerve cells resulting in failure to conduct nerve impulse which manifested clinically in host as variable degrees of organ paralysis. Human intoxication occurs after consuming food containing the toxins. Current treatment of the poisoning is supportive and symptomatic. There has been no specific drug or antidote for the TTX mediated malady. In this study, phage clones displaying human single chain antibody fragments (HuScFv) were selected from a human ScFv phage display library. HuScFv derived from phagemid transformed Escherichia coli clones (clones s16 and s35) bound to the TTX as tested by indirect ELISA and band shift assay. Homology modeling and molecular docking revealed that VL domain of the s16-HuScFv interacted with the hydroxyl groups of C6, C9, C10 and C11 of the TTX by means of Tyr 223, Ser226 and Tyr228, while the Asp53 and Asp55 of the VH domain of s35-HuScFv interacted with the positions 1 and 2 of the guanidinium group and the hydroxyl groups at C9 and C10 of the TTX. The s16- and s35-HuScFv neutralized the TTX bioactivity in nerve cell based- and mouse bio-assays. Moreover, the HuScFv could rescue the intoxicated mice from the TTX mediated lethality. Thus, the HuScFv derived from the transformed E. coli clones have high potential as a safe, effective and specific therapeutic remedy for TTX intoxication in humans and warrant further trials."}

The presence of such an imbalance may potentially define a therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive disabilities related to this pathology. Consequently, the study of monogenic disorders related to autism, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), represents a promising approach to isolate mechanisms underlying ASD-related cognitive disabilities. However, the NF1 mouse model showed increased γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, whereas the human disease showed reduced cortical GABA levels. It is therefore important to clarify whether the E/I imbalance hypothesis holds true. We hypothesize that E/I may depend on distinct pre- and postsynaptic push-pull mechanisms that might be are region-dependent.	In current study, we assessed two critical components of E/I regulation: the concentration of neurotransmitters and levels of GABA(A) receptors. Measurements were performed across the hippocampi, striatum, and prefrontal cortices by combined in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and molecular approaches in this ASD-related animal model, the Nf1[+/-] mouse.	Cortical and striatal GABA/glutamate ratios were increased. At the postsynaptic level, very high receptor GABA(A) receptor expression was found in hippocampus, disproportionately to the small reduction in GABA levels. Gabaergic tone (either by receptor levels change or GABA/glutamate ratios) seemed therefore to be enhanced in all regions, although by a different mechanism.	Our data provides support for the hypothesis of E/I imbalance in NF1 while showing that pre- and postsynaptic changes are region-specific. All these findings are consistent with our previous physiological evidence of increased inhibitory tone. Such heterogeneity suggests that therapeutic approaches to address neurochemical imbalance in ASD may need to focus on targets where convergent physiological mechanisms can be found."}

To assess whether inhibition of TNFalpha can reduce nucleus pulposus-induced abnormal discharges.	It has been shown that TNFalpha, a proinflammatory cytokine, is a key pathogenic factor in the development of nucleus pulposus-induced abnormal discharges as a pain sensation. However, the electrophysiologic mechanisms involved in sciatica after disc herniation still have not been elucidated.	Extracellular activities of wide-dynamic-range neurons were assessed in 21 rats. Autologous nucleus pulposus harvested from the tail was applied to the L5 nerve root. The animals were simultaneously treated with antibodies to TNFalpha (anti-TNF + nucleus pulposus group) and with phosphate-buffered saline (nucleus pulposus group). As a control (control group), a similar volume of muscle was applied to the nerve root with phosphate-buffered saline. Responses of wide-dynamic-range neurons to noxious and innocuous stimuli were examined for 2 hours.	Discharges evoked during noxious stimulation and discharges after withdrawal of stimulation in the nucleus pulposus group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). In the anti-TNF + nucleus pulposus group, discharges after withdrawal of stimulation were remarkably inhibited, as compared with those of the nucleus pulposus group (P < 0.05). However, evoked discharges during stimulation apparently were not inhibited. Responses to innocuous stimulation did not change throughout the measurements.	These data indicate that application of TNFalpha antibodies to the nerve root partially prevents the nucleus pulposus-induced abnormal nociresponses. Therefore, anti-TNFalpha treatment may have a therapeutic effect on sciatica after lumbar disc herniation."}

Using an in vitro model of neonatal rat SCI caused by transient application (1h) of the glutamate agonist kainate (0.05-0.1 mM) to produce limited excitotoxicity, the present study investigated whether riluzole, a drug inhibiting glutamate release and neuronal excitability, could prevent neuronal loss and protect locomotor patterns 24 h later. Immunohistochemical analysis of neuronal and motoneuronal populations was associated with recording of fictive locomotion induced by neurochemicals or dorsal root stimuli. Riluzole (5 μM; 24 h application) per se exerted strong and persistent neurodepressant effects on network synaptic transmission from which recovery was very slow. When continuously applied after kainate, riluzole partially reduced the number of pyknotic cells in the gray matter, although motoneurons remained vulnerable and no fictive locomotion was present. In further experiments, riluzole per se was applied for 3 h (expected to coincide with kainate peak excitotoxicity) and washed out for 24 h with full return of fictive locomotion. When this protocol was implemented after kainate, no efficient histological or functional recovery was observed. No additional benefit was detected even when riluzole was co-applied with kainate and continued for the following 3 h. These results show that modest neuronal losses evoked by excitotoxicity have a severe impact on locomotor network function, and that they cannot be satisfactorily blocked by strong neurodepression with riluzole, suggesting the need for more effective pharmacological approaches."}

In all rats, total antioxidant capacity and hydrogen-peroxide levels did not change significantly. Lipid hydroperoxides increased 25% only in vehicle-treated CCI rats.

Presently, there are a number of genetic-based therapies in development aimed at restoration and/or repair of the primary defect. However, growing understanding of the pathophysiological consequences of dystrophin absence has revealed several promising downstream targets for the development of therapeutics.	In this review, we discuss various strategies for DMD therapy targeting downstream consequences of dystrophin absence including loss of muscle mass, inflammation, fibrosis, calcium overload, oxidative stress, and ischemia. The rationale of each approach and the efficacy of drugs in preclinical and clinical studies are discussed.	For the last 30 years, effective DMD drug therapy has been limited to corticosteroids, which are associated with a number of negative side effects. Our knowledge of the consequences of dystrophin absence that contribute to DMD pathology has revealed several potential therapeutic targets. Some of these approaches may have potential to improve or slow disease progression independently or in combination with genetic-based approaches. The applicability of these pharmacological therapies to DMD patients irrespective of their genetic mutation, as well as the potential benefits even for advanced stage patients warrants their continued investigation."}

Neuromelanin did not affect complex I activity, but concentration-dependently increased ROS production in neurons and reduced the number of MAP2-positive and TH-positive cultured neurons.

For example, not even one health care worker has contracted AIDS from over 800,000 AIDS patients in America and Europe.

(3) From its beginning in 1980, the AIDS epidemic progressed non-exponentially, just like lifestyle diseases. (4) The epidemic is fragmented into distinct subepidemics with exclusive AIDS-defining diseases. For example, only homosexual males have Kaposi's sarcoma. (5) Patients do not have any one of 30 AIDS-defining diseases, nor even immunodeficiency, in common. For example, Kaposi's sarcoma, dementia, and weight loss may occur without immunodeficiency. Thus, there is no AIDS-specific disease. (6) AIDS patients have antibody against HIV in common only by definition-not by natural coincidence. AIDS-defining diseases of HIV-free patients are called by their old names. (7) Recreational drug use is a common denominator for over 95% of all American and European AIDS patients, including male homosexuals. (8) Lifetime prescriptions of inevitably toxic anti-HIV drugs, such as the DNA chain-terminator AZT, are another common denominator of AIDS patients. (9) HIV proves to be an ideal surrogate marker for recreational and anti-HIV drug use. Since the virus is very rare (< 0.3%) in the US/European population and very hard to transmit sexually, only those who inject street drugs or have over 1,000 typically drug-mediated sexual contacts are likely to become positive. (10) The huge AIDS literature cannot offer even one statistically significant group of drug-free AIDS patients from America and Europe. In view of this, we propose that the long-term consumption of recreational drugs (such as cocaine, heroin, nitrite inhalants, and amphetamines) and prescriptions of DNA chain-terminating and other anti-HIV drugs, cause all AIDS diseases in America and Europe that exceed their long-established, national backgrounds, i.e. > 95%. Chemically distinct drugs cause distinct AIDS-defining diseases; for example, nitrite inhalants cause Kaposi's sarcoma, cocaine causes weight loss, and AZT causes immunodeficiency, lymphoma, muscle atrophy, and dementia. The drug hypothesis predicts that AIDS: (1) is non-contagious; (2) is non-random, because 85% of AIDS causing drugs are used by males, particularly sexually active homosexuals between 25 and 49 years of age, and (3) would follow the drug epidemics chronologically. Indeed, AIDS has increased from negligible numbers in the early 1980s to about 80,000 annual cases in the early '90s and has since declined to about 50,000 cases (US figures). In the same period, recreational drug users have increased from negligible numbers to millions by the late 1980s, and have since decreased possibly twofold. However, AIDS has declined less because since 1987 increasing numbers of mostly healthy, HIV-positive people, currently about 200,000, use anti-HIV drugs that cause AIDS and other diseases.

Knowledge on the incidence and clinical presentation of other tick-borne diseases than Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis is minimal, despite the high human exposure to these pathogens through tick bites. Using molecular detection techniques, the frequency of tick-borne infections after exposure through tick bites was estimated.	Ticks, blood samples and questionnaires on health status were collected from patients that visited their general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans in 2007 and 2008. The presence of several tick-borne pathogens in 314 ticks and 626 blood samples of this cohort were analyzed using PCR-based methods. Using multivariate logistic regression, associations were explored between pathogens detected in blood and self-reported symptoms at enrolment and during a three-month follow-up period.	Half of the ticks removed from humans tested positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Rickettsia helvetica, Rickettsia monacensis, Borrelia miyamotoi and several Babesia species. Among 92 Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. positive ticks, 33% carried another pathogen from a different genus. In blood of sixteen out of 626 persons with tick bites or erythema migrans, DNA was detected from Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis (n = 7), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (n = 5), Babesia divergens (n = 3), Borrelia miyamotoi (n = 1) and Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. (n = 1). None of these sixteen individuals reported any overt symptoms that would indicate a corresponding illness during the three-month follow-up period. No associations were found between the presence of pathogen DNA in blood and; self-reported symptoms, with pathogen DNA in the corresponding ticks (n = 8), reported tick attachment duration, tick engorgement, or antibiotic treatment at enrolment.	Based on molecular detection techniques, the probability of infection with a tick-borne pathogen other than Lyme spirochetes after a tick bite is roughly 2.4%, in the Netherlands. Similarly, among patients with erythema migrans, the probability of a co-infection with another tick-borne pathogen is approximately 2.7%. How often these infections cause disease symptoms or to what extend co-infections affect the course of Lyme borreliosis needs further investigations."}

Basal ganglia ICH was created in 14 Yorkshire swine utilizing a novel MRI integrated model, permitting real-time CE observation using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. Computerized planimetry measured CE volume at each time point. Spatial vector analysis along three orthogonal axes determined distance vectors. Maximizing and minimizing the coefficient of determination defined the temporal phases of growth and stability, respectively. CE rate was calculated using a Patlak model.	Asymmetric growth and variable rates of expansion characterized HE defining three distinct growth phases and patterns. A primary growth phase (duration 160 s; IQR 50-130) demonstrated rapid linear growth (0.04 mm/s IQR 0.01-0.10) accounting for 85 ± 15 % of total HE. The stationary phase demonstrated stability (duration 145 s; IQR 0-655). A secondary growth phase (duration 300; 130-600 s) accounted for 23 ± 8 % of total HE. In the primary and secondary growth phase, asymmetric growth occurred in the anterior-posterior (AP) planes (0.056 mm/s; p = 0.026 and 0.0112 mm/s; p = 0.03). Monophasic 2 (14 %), biphasic 4 (35 %) (primary followed by secondary growth), and triphasic 8 (56 %) patterns (primary, stationary, and secondary growth phase) were observed.	A novel model of ICH provides real-time study of the dynamics and rate of CE. This data facilitates the understanding of pattern and rate of ICH formation."}

In chondrocytes, CS diminishes interleukin-1 beta(IL-1beta)-induced increases in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, and decreases nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) nuclear translocation and as a consequence, reduces the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and nitric oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2). The mechanism of action of CS explains its beneficial effect on the cartilage, synovial membrane and subchondral bone. On the other hand, in vivo, CS given orally prevents hepatic NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, suggesting that systemic CS may elicit an anti-inflammatory effect in many tissues besides the articulation. There is preliminary evidence showing that in human beings, CS may be of benefit in other diseases where inflammation is an essential marker, such as psoriasis and atherosclerosis. The review of the literature suggest that CS might also be of interest for the treatment of other diseases with an inflammatory and/or autoimmune character, such as inflammatory bowel disease, degenerative diseases of the central nervous system and stroke, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases."}

Modern medicine now offers potentially life-saving treatment for a disease that was considered invariably fatal once clinical signs develop. However, medical intervention efforts require a rapid and accurate diagnosis as early in the course of clinical disease as possible. Indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) testing on cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens provides rapid results, but the specificity of the assay has not been well studied. Because false-positive IFA results could significantly affect patient treatment and outcomes, it is critical to understand the specificity of this assay. In this study, IFA testing was performed on 135 cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens taken from patients with viral encephalitis or a presumed viral infection involving an agent other than rabies virus. Results indicate that false-positive results can occur in interpreting the rabies IFA test. Staining patterns morphologically similar to antirabies staining were observed in 7 of the 135 cerebrospinal fluid specimens examined. In addition, a majority of the cerebrospinal fluid specimens tested from patients with encephalitis presented immunoglobulin that bound to antigens present in the cell culture substrate. Of marked concern was the frequent presence of cross-reactive antibodies in encephalitis cases associated with West Nile and Powassan flaviviruses. Because IFA testing for rabies on human specimens may result in false-positive results, it should not be used as the sole basis for initiating antirabies treatment."}

Sleep-related cardiovascular regulation has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis. In this study, we explored whether such impairments are exaggerated during late sleep (before the active phase) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs).	Polysomnographic recording was performed through wireless transmission in freely moving SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) over 24 hours. The SHRs were injected with saline and an α1-adrenergic antagonist (prazosin: 5 mg/kg) on 2 separate days. Cardiovascular and autonomic functions were assessed by cardiovascular variability and spontaneous baroreflex analysis.	Compared with the early-light period (Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0-6 hours), both the WKYs and SHRs during the late-light period (ZT 6-12 hours) showed sleep fragmentation, sympathovagal imbalance, and baroreflex impairment, which were exaggerated and more advanced in the SHRs. Like the morning blood pressure (BP) surge in humans, we found that there was a wake-related blood pressure surge (WBPS) during the late-light period in both groups of rats. The WBPS was also greater and occurred earlier in the SHRs, and was accompanied by a surge in vascular sympathetic index. Under α1-adrenergic antagonism, the late-light period-related sleep fragmentation and BP surge in the SHRs were partially reversed.	Our results reveal that sleep-related sympathetic overactivity, baroreflex sensitivity impairment, WBPS, and sleep fragmentation in SHRs deteriorates during the late-light period can be partially alleviated by treatment with an α1-adrenoceptor antagonist."}

Five expert voice-specialized clinical SLPs (consensus group) were then presented CTT and a discussion ensued. Later, an informal interview by a neutral third party person occurred for further recommendations for CTT.	The CTT approach was modified to reflect all the consensus groups' recommendations, which included the need for more detail and rationale in the program, troubleshooting suggestions, and the concern for potential challenges for novice clinicians.	CTT is a new therapy approach based on motor learning theory, which exclusively uses patient-driven conversational narrative as the sole therapeutic stimuli.

This study investigated further the capability of GCIB-SIMS in imaging high-mass signals from intact cardiolipin (CL) and gangliosides in normal brain and the effect of a controlled cortical impact model (CCI) of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on their distribution. A combination of enzymatic and chemical treatments was employed to suppress the signals from the most abundant phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)) and enhance the signals from the low-abundance CLs and gangliosides to allow their GCIB-SIMS detection at 8 and 16 μm spatial resolution. Brain CLs have not been observed previously using other contemporary imaging mass spectrometry techniques at better than 50 μm spatial resolution. High-resolution images of naive and injured brain tissue facilitated the comparison of CL species across three multicell layers in the CA1, CA3, and DG regions of the hippocampus. GCIB-SIMS also reliably mapped losses of oxidizable polyunsaturated CL species (but not the oxidation-resistant saturated and monounsaturated gangliosides) to regions including the CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus after CCI. This work extends the detection range for SIMS measurements of intact lipids to above m/z 2000, bridging the mass range gap compared with MALDI. Further advances in high-resolution SIMS of CLs, with the potential for single cell or supra-cellular imaging, will be essential for the understanding of CL's functional and structural organization in normal and injured brain."}

Specifically, the effects of the novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron (0.3, 1, 10 ng/kg), and of nicotine (0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.3 mg/kg) and the anticholinesterase, physostigmine (0.05, 0.1 mg/kg), on attentional function were examined in animals which had received AMPA-induced lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbM). The behavioural impairments observed immediately following the lesion were a reduction were choice accuracy and an increase in correct response latency. Although these impairments showed recovery over the course of the following weeks, the deficit in choice accuracy could be reinstated by reducing the duration of the visual stimulus and thus increasing the attentional load placed on the animals. This reduction in choice accuracy could be dose dependently improved by systemic administration of either physostigmine or nicotine, suggesting that this impairment in attentional function may be attributed to disruption of cholinergic function. The pharmacological specificity of these improvements was supported by the inability of d-amphetamine to improve task performance (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 mg/kg). Ondansetron was also unable to improve accuracy of performance in lesioned animals, but was effective in reducing the anticipatory or premature responding observed in both control and lesioned animals, even when elevated (in the case of controls) by treatment with systemic d-amphetamine. The results of the present study therefore suggest that cholinergic dysfunction can lead to attentional impairments which can be ameliorated by cholinergic treatments such as physostigmine and nicotine, but that ondansetron, despite its proposed ability to release cortical acetylcholine, was unable to restore choice accuracy at the doses employed. The results further suggest a double dissociation of effects on accuracy and the disinhibition of responding."}

This study investigated the role of striatal buffering in the development of dyskinesias. We used nomifensine, a selective dopamine reuptake blocker, to pharmacologically impair presynaptic buffering capacity in normal squirrel monkeys. Dyskinesias were assessed at 30-min intervals for 4 h after twice-daily treatment with drug. As previously reported by our group, animals receiving levodopa alone (15 mg/kg) exhibited dyskinetic behavior. Treatment with nomifensine alone (3 mg/kg) also induced dyskinesias. Furthermore, combining levodopa with nomifensine significantly increased dyskinesias. Over 4 weeks of treatment, the animals developed tolerance to the dyskinesia-inducing effect of nomifensine. The development of tolerance was prevented by concurrent treatment with levodopa. These results show that impairing buffering by preventing dopamine reuptake can induce dyskinesias and can also augment levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Thus, this study suggests that diminished buffering capacity for dopamine could play a role in the development of dyskinesias, and that an endogenous mechanism might exist that ameliorates dyskinesias."}

Cerebral vasospasm (CV) is a predominant cause of morbidity and mortality which develops following subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH). Etiopathogenesis of CV is multifactorial. Despite many previously performed studies on this issue, the mechanism by which blood and blood products in the subarachnoidal space induce CV has not been clarified yet.	In our study, we used 'Rat Femoral Artery Vasospasm Model' introduced by Okada et al. Thanks to easy procurement and maintenance of rats. Rats were divided into four groups as: Group 1 (n = 8; control group), Group 2 (n = 8; vasospasm group), Group 3 (n = 8; vasospasm + 3 mg/kg progesterone group), and Group 4 (n = 8; vasospasm +15 mg/kg progesterone group). Progesterone which is an endogenously synthesized natural steroid was preferred in our study. Progesterone increases the production of vasodilatory epoxyeicosatrienoic acid by acting on its binding sites termed as pregnane X receptor. It decreases the intracellular influx of Ca[2+] by blocking the functioning of L-type channels in smooth muscle cells. It manifests another vasodilatory effect by decreasing expression of TxA2 receptor. In our study, at the end of the 7[th] day, where the most intense vasospasm is seen, 1 cm pieces were excised from the femoral arteries and histopathologically examined under light microscope.	Vascular walls of three vasospasm-induced groups were relatively thicker when compared with the control group. Drug-treated groups were not different from each other. Vascular walls of the groups treated with lower and higher doses of the drug were thinner when compared with the vasospasm group without any statistically significant difference between groups (P > 0.05).

Most of these protective actions have been attributed to the antioxidative capacity of ascorbic acid. Besides the presence of elevated levels of oxygen radicals, prostaglandins produced by neurones and microglial cells seem to play an important role in prolonged tissue damage.

In this study, effects of local Dexamethasone (DEX; a glucocorticoid used in epidural injections), and eplerenone (EPL; a second generation, more selective MR antagonist) applied to the DRG at the time of inflammation were examined. Mechanical and spontaneous pain behaviors were more effectively reduced by the combination of DEX and EPL than by either alone. The combination of steroids was particularly more effective than DEX alone or the model alone (3-fold improvement for mechanical allodynia) at later times (day 14). Immunohistochemical analysis of the GR in the DRG showed that the receptor was expressed in neurons of all size classes, and in non-neuronal cells including satellite glia. The GR immunoreactivity was downregulated by DRG inflammation (48%) starting on day 1, consistent with the reduction of GR (57%) observed by Western blot, when compared to control animals. On day 14, the combination of DEX and EPL resulted in rescue of GR immunoreactivity that was not seen with DEX alone, and was more effective in reducing a marker for satellite glia activation/neuroinflammation. The results suggest that EPL may enhance the effectiveness of clinically used epidural steroid injections, in part by enhancing the availability of the GR. Thus, the glucocorticoid-mineralocorticoid interactions may limit the effectiveness of epidural steroids through the regulation of the GR in the DRG."}

Genetics, age, diabetes, gender, obesity, hypertension, race, hyperopia, iris-color, smoking, sun-light and pyroptosis have varying roles in AMD, but oxidative stress-induced inflammation remains a significant driver of pathobiology. Eye is a unique organ as it contains a remarkable oxygen-gradient that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which upregulates inflammatory pathways. ROS becomes a source of functional and morphological impairments in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), endothelial cells and retinal ganglion cells. Reports demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) acts as a signaling molecule and that it may treat ailments. Therefore, we propose a novel hypothesis that H2S may restore homeostasis in the eyes thereby reducing damage caused by oxidative injury and inflammation. Since H2S has been shown to be a powerful antioxidant because of its free-radicals' inhibition properties in addition to its beneficial effects in age-related conditions, therefore, patients may benefit from H2S salubrious effects not only by minimizing their oxidant and inflammatory injuries to retina but also by lowering retinal glutamate excitotoxicity."}

The contribution of CD4(+) T cells to infection and disease progression has been extensively studied. However, during early HIV infection, macrophages in brain and other tissues are infected and contribute to tissue-specific diseases, such as encephalitis and dementia in brain and pneumonia in lung. The extent of infection of monocytes and macrophages has not been rigorously assessed with assays comparable to those used to study infection of CD4(+) T cells and to evaluate the number of CD4(+) T cells that harbor infectious viral genomes. To assess the contribution of productively infected monocytes and macrophages to HIV- and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected cells in vivo, we developed a quantitative virus outgrowth assay (QVOA) based on similar assays used to quantitate CD4(+) T cell latent reservoirs in HIV- and SIV-infected individuals in whom the infection is suppressed by ART. Myeloid cells expressing CD11b were serially diluted and cocultured with susceptible cells to amplify virus. T cell receptor β RNA was measured as a control to assess the potential contribution of CD4(+) T cells in the assay. Virus production in the supernatant was quantitated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Productively infected myeloid cells were detected in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lungs, spleen, and brain, demonstrating that these cells persist throughout SIV infection and have the potential to contribute to the viral reservoir during ART.	Infection of CD4(+) T cells and their role as latent reservoirs have been rigorously assessed; however, the frequency of productively infected monocytes and macrophages in vivo has not been similarly studied. Myeloid cells, unlike lymphocytes, are resistant to the cytopathic effects of HIV. Moreover, tissue-resident macrophages have the ability to self-renew and persist in the body for months to years. Thus, tissue macrophages, once infected, have the characteristics of a potentially stable viral reservoir. A better understanding of the number of productively infected macrophages is crucial to further evaluate the role of infected myeloid cells as a potential viral reservoir. In the study described here we compared the frequency of productively infected CD4(+) T cells and macrophages in an SIV-infected macaque model. We developed a critical assay that will allow us to quantitate myeloid cells containing viral genomes that lead to productive infection in SIV-infected macaques and assess the role of macrophages as potential reservoirs."}

Although there are reports relating transporter polymorphisms to pharmacokinetics or adverse events, few studies have extended such efforts to the brain. Conceivably, simultaneous nonfunctional expressions of more than one key efflux transporters could result in devastating clinical outcomes if the dose of their substrate drug is not adjusted for the subpopulation with such a phenotype. Imaging technologies have been used to elucidate the kinetic or functional activities of blood-brain barrier transporters, with the majority focusing on P-glycoprotein. Imaging technologies have been used to discover drugs for treating brain disorders, enable targeted delivery in combination with convection-enhanced delivery, assess the therapeutic effect of a treatment protocol and assess drug penetration into brain tumors. Research is limited, however, in using imaging technologies to link the genotype or phenotype of a transporter to the uptake of drug into the brain. No imaging studies have provided clear evidence of transporter polymorphisms discriminating the distribution of drug in the brain. Research efforts are needed to use imaging technologies to explore the correlation between pharmacogenetics and individual clinical outcomes, especially for the phenotype of more than one nonfunctional transporters."}

Hence, Sgpl1 offers a target to block T cell-dependent inflammatory processes. However, the involvement of Sgpl1 in models of disease has not been fully elucidated yet, since Sgpl1 KO mice have a short life-span.	We generated inducible Sgpl1 KO mice featuring partial reduction of Sgpl1 activity and analyzed them with respect to sphingolipid levels, T-cell distribution, and response in models of inflammation.	The partially Sgpl1 deficient mice are viable but feature profound reduction of peripheral T cells, similar to the constitutive KO mice. While thymic T cell development in these mice appears normal, mature T cells are retained in thymus and lymph nodes, leading to reduced T cell numbers in spleen and blood, with a skewing towards increased proportions of memory T cells and T regulatory cells. The therapeutic relevance of Sgpl1 is demonstrated by the fact that the inducible KO mice are protected in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). T cell immigration into the CNS was found to be profoundly reduced. Since S1P levels in the brain of the animals are unchanged, we conclude that protection in EAE is due to the peripheral effect on T cells, leading to reduced CNS immigration, rather than on local effects in the CNS.	The data suggest Sgpl1 as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis."}

The GMFM, a criterion-referenced observational measure designed to measure change in the gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy, was chosen as the assessment tool.	Upon completion of the 5-week intervention, the child was observed to have improved scores on the GMFM in two of the five dimensions measured and scored for a total of eight items. The post post-test was completed 5 weeks after the final riding session and the results demonstrated successful maintenance of the improved scores in seven of eight items.

Rapid and up to 4 h primary hyperalgesia developed following surgical castration and tail docking in the untreated and placebo-treated lambs. It was absent in the castration wounds, and significantly reduced in the tail-docking wounds, of the treated lambs. Hot-iron docking was associated with mild and transient secondary hyperalgesia, which was abolished by the topical anaesthesia.

Carvacrol, a monoterpenic phenol, is naturally occurring in various plants belonging to the family Lamiaceae and exerts protective effects in a mice model of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by reducing infarct volume and decreasing the expression of cleaved caspase-3. However, the anti-inflammatory mechanisms by which carvacrol protect the brain have yet to be fully elucidated. We investigated the effects of carvacrol on inflammatory reaction and inflammatory mediators in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats. The results of the present study showed that carvacrol inhibited the levels of inflammatory cytokines and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, as well as the expression of iNOS and COX-2. It also increased SOD activity and decreased MDA level in ischemic cortical tissues. In addition, carvacrol treatment suppressed the ischemia/reperfusion-induced increase in the protein expression of nuclear NF-kB p65. In conclusion, we have shown that carvacrol inhibits the inflammatory response via inhibition of the NF-kB signaling pathway in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Therefore, carvacrol may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cerebral ischemia injury."}

Primary brain tumors are relatively rare but deadly and present a significant challenge in the determination of risk factors in the population. These tumors are inherently difficult to cure because of their protected location in the brain. As such surgery, radiation and chemotherapy options carry potentially lasting patient morbidity and incomplete tumor cure. Some of these tumors, such as glioblastoma, were reported to present features of ER stress and to depend on UPR activation to sustain growth, but to date there is no clear general representation of the ER stress status in primary brain tumors. In this review, we describe the key molecular mechanisms controlling the UPR and their implication in cancers. Then we extensively review the literature reporting the status of ER stress in various primary brain tumors and discuss the potential impact of such observation on patient stratification and on the possibility of developing appropriate targeted therapies using the UPR as therapeutic target."}

The ischemia-induced exploratory behavior changes, measured by open field testing, were largely suppressed by lithium treatment for 7 days prior to ischemic onset. Similarly, memory impairments, measured by T-maze testing, were prevented by lithium pretreatment. This is believed to be the first report of lithium-induced protection against hyperactivity in a novel open field and memory impairment in a gerbil model of global ischemia. These behavioral benefits were associated with an increase in viable cells as measured by hematoxylin and eosin staining and a decrease in apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells in the CA1 hippocampal area of ischemic gerbils. Moreover, the lithium-induced neuroprotection was accompanied by down-regulation of pro-apoptotic p53 in the CA1 but up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the ischemic brain.

In neuronal development, GABAergic signaling regulates neural proliferation, migration, differentiation, and neuronal-network wiring. In the adult, GABA orchestrates the activity of different neuronal cell-types largely interconnected, by powerfully modulating synaptic activity. GABA exerts these functions by binding to chloride-permeable ionotropic GABAA receptors and metabotropic GABAB receptors. According to its functional importance during development, GABA is implicated in a number of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, Fragile X, Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome and neurofibromatosis. The strength and polarity of GABAergic transmission is continuously modulated during physiological, but also pathological conditions. For GABAergic transmission through GABAA receptors, strength regulation is achieved by different mechanisms such as modulation of GABAA receptors themselves, variation of intracellular chloride concentration, and alteration in GABA metabolism. In the never-ending effort to find possible treatments for GABA-related neurological diseases, of great importance would be modulating GABAergic transmission in a safe and possibly physiological way, without the dangers of either silencing network activity or causing epileptic seizures. In this review, we will discuss the different ways to modulate GABAergic transmission normally at work both during physiological and pathological conditions.

It has been suggested that ALDP assembles with ALDRP (adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein), a close homologous half-transporter, to form a functional heterodimer. For the first time full-length ALDRP cDNA (5.5 kb) was cloned, and 5' and 3' RACE analysis revealed that alternative usage of polyadenylation sites generates the two transcripts of 3.0 and 5.5 kb observed in the rat in Northern blot analysis.

Healthy lower gastrointestinal function is essential for successful ageing as it is critical to maintaining independence and autonomy to pursue further activity. One clinical expression of enteric neurodegeneration is constipation.

In vitro, 23bb presented low nanomolar antiproliferative effects against panel of cancer cell lines. Western blot analysis further confirmed that 23bb increased acetylation level of α-tubulin in vitro. 23bb has a good pharmacokinetic profile with oral bioavailability of 47.0% in rats. In in vivo efficacy evaluations of colorectal HCT116, acute myelocytic leukemia MV4-11, and B cell lymphoma Romas xenografts, 23bb more effectively inhibited the tumor growth than SAHA even at a 4-fold reduced dose or ACY-1215 at the same dose.

This review summarises recent data from in vitro and in vivo studies that have been performed both to understand this aspect of the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy and to develop therapeutic modalities for its prevention or treatment. Extensive animal studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress may be a final common pathway in the development of diabetic neuropathy, and that antioxidants can prevent or reverse hyperglycaemia-induced nerve dysfunction. Most probably, the effects of antioxidants are mediated by correction of nutritive blood flow, although direct effects on endoneurial oxidative state are not excluded. In a limited number of clinical studies, antioxidant drugs including alpha-lipoic acid and vitamin E were found to reduce neuropathic symptoms or to correct nerve conduction velocity. These data are promising, and additional larger studies with alpha-lipoic acid are currently being performed."}

Limited anti-inflammatory efficacy of the indomethacin treatment.^\nIschemic stroke is a disease of aging and causes high mortality or long-term disability. Diminished neurological recovery after stroke in aged subjects is possibly associated with exaggerated non-specific inflammatory reaction. The focus of the present study was on neurobiological and behavioral differences between young and old rats modulated by indomethacin daily treatment starting at four hours after acute cerebral ischemia in animal model. Our results indicate age-independent positive consequences of non-specific inhibition of inflammation by indomethacin including increased NeuN-positive surviving neurons, reduced infarct volume and enhanced neuroprotective response of innate immune system evidenced by increased Iba1 and Anx3 immunoreactivities and moderately activated microglia in the peri-infarcted area. Quite relevantly, the efficacy of therapy with indomethacin was reduced. In the aged rats, specifically indomethacin is ineffective in inhibiting phagocytic activity, which is probably due failure of the aged brain to up-regulate the expression of several cytokines including TNFα and Cxcl4. At protein level, we observed no change of lysosomal ED1 immunoreactivity under treatment. Our study demonstrates the beneficial anti-inflammatory treatment with indomethacin. However, aging blunted the positive effect."}

Neurite outgrowth inhibitor-A imposes the strongest effect on inhibiting axonal regeneration after traumatic brain injury. Alpha-tocopherol, a member of the vitamin E family, is recognized as an active antioxidative substance. Its use has not been well studied in brain injury research, especially in axonal regeneration research.	We obtained 99 intact adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) from the Experimental Animal Center of Central South University. We used the modified method of Freeney to generate moderate brain injury in the rats. We injected 600 mg/kg α-tocopherol intraperitoneally daily as traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment. Then, we performed behavioral tests in the corresponding time point, examined brain tissues after hematoxylin-eosin staining to identify changes in cell morphology, and performed immunohistochemical staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect the expression of NoGo and Nogo receptor (NgR) in brain tissue.	For the Neurological Severity Scores of rats, there were obvious differences among the three groups at the corresponding time points. Standard hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that the brain structure of a sham-operated group of rats was clear, uniform, and compact. A TBI group exhibited hemorrhage, edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, condensed nuclei, and necrosis. We also saw glial cells and fibrous tissue proliferation. The α-tocopherol-treated TBI group had similar but less severe changes than the TBI group. Expression of Nogo-A and NgR increased after TBI compared with the sham-operated group. However, Nogo-A and NgR expression was significantly lower in the α-tocopherol-treated TBI group compared with the TBI group. Similarly, results showed that functional neurological deficits among rats in the α-tocopherol-treated TBI group were less pronounced than in the TBI group (model group).	Our data demonstrate that α-tocopherol-treated rats had reduced microscopic evidence of brain damage. Alpha-tocopherol reduced Nogo-A and NgR expression in brain tissue after traumatic brain injury and promoted nerve regeneration. Alpha-tocopherol treatment of TBI rats had a neuroprotective role in their recovery."}

To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms orchestrating this spontaneous rewiring. In this study, we provide insights into the molecular changes in the spinal cord tissue after large ischemic cortical injury in adult female mice, with a focus on factors that might influence the reinnervation process by contralesional corticospinal neurons. We mapped the area of cervical gray matter reinnervation by sprouting contralesional corticospinal axons after unilateral photothrombotic stroke of the motor cortex in mice using anterograde tracing. The mRNA profile of this reinnervation area was analyzed using whole-genome sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes at selected time points during the recovery process. Bioinformatic analysis revealed two phases of processes: early after stroke (4-7 d post-injury), the spinal transcriptome is characterized by inflammatory processes, including phagocytic processes as well as complement cascade activation. Microglia are specifically activated in the denervated corticospinal projection fields in this early phase. In a later phase (28-42 d post-injury), biological processes include tissue repair pathways with upregulated genes related to neurite outgrowth. Thus, the stroke-denervated spinal gray matter, in particular its intermediate laminae, represents a growth-promoting environment for sprouting corticospinal fibers originating from the contralesional motor cortex. This dataset provides a solid starting point for future studies addressing key elements of the post-stroke recovery process, with the goal to improve neuroregenerative treatment options for stroke patients.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We show that the molecular changes in the spinal cord target tissue of the stroke-affected corticospinal tract are mainly defined by two phases: an early inflammatory phase during which microglia are specifically activated in the target area of reinnervating corticospinal motor neurons; and a late phase during which growth-promoting factors are upregulated which can influence the sprouting response, arborization, and synapse formation. By defining for the first time the endogenous molecular machinery in the stroke-denervated cervical spinal gray matter with a focus on promotors of axon growth through the growth-inhibitory adult CNS, this study will serve as a basis to address novel neuroregenerative treatment options for chronic stroke patients."}

In addition to the acute risk of morbidity with moderate to severe injuries, traumatic brain injury is associated with a number of chronic neurological and neuropsychiatric sequelae including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, despite the high incidence of traumatic brain injuries and the established clinical correlation with neurodegeneration, the causative factors linking these processes have not yet been fully elucidated. Apart from removal from activity, few, if any prophylactic treatments against post-traumatic brain injury neurodegeneration exist. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and neurodegeneration in order to identify potential factors that initiate neurodegenerative processes. Oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and glutamatergic excitotoxicity have previously been implicated in both secondary brain injury and neurodegeneration. In particular, reactive oxygen species appear to be key in mediating molecular insult in neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity. As such, it is likely that post injury oxidative stress is a key mechanism which links traumatic brain injury to increased risk of neurodegeneration. Consequently, reactive oxygen species and their subsequent byproducts may serve as novel fluid markers for identification and monitoring of cellular damage. Furthermore, these reactive species may further serve as a suitable therapeutic target to reduce the risk of post-injury neurodegeneration and provide long term quality of life improvements for those suffering from traumatic brain injury."}

Previous research has established that the neuroinflammatory response plays a significant role in cord damage post-SCI. However, global immunosuppressive therapies have demonstrated mixed results. As a result, more specific therapies modulating inflammation after injury are needed. In this regard, research into cytokine signaling has demonstrated that cytokines of the gp130 family including IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) play key roles in mediating damage to the spinal cord. Since members of the gp130 family all share a common signal transduction pathway via the JAK/STAT system, we performed the first study of a relatively new member of the gp130 family, IL-11, in SCI.	A validated clip-compression mouse model of SCI was used to assess for temporal changes in expression of IL-11 and its receptor, IL-11Rα, post-SCI. To elucidate the role of IL-II in the pathophysiology of SCI, we compared differences in locomotor recovery (Basso Mouse Score; CatWalk), electrophysiological spinal cord signaling, histopathology, and the acute inflammatory neutrophil response in IL-11Rα knockouts with littermate wild-type C57BL/6 mice.	We found an increase in gene expression of IL-11 in the spinal cord to a peak at twenty-four hours post-SCI with increases in IL-11Rα gene expression, peaking at seven days post-SCI. In spite of clear changes in the temporal expression of both IL-11 and its receptor, we found that there were no significant differences in motor function, electrophysiological signaling, histopathology, or neutrophil infiltration into the spinal cord between wild-type and knockout mice.	This is the first study to address IL-11 in SCI. This study provides evidence that IL-11 signaling may not play as significant a role in SCI as other gp130 cytokines, which will ideally guide future therapy design and the signaling pathways those therapies target."}

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of intrathecal delivery of AAV9 expressing α-l-iduronidase (IDUA) in a previously described feline model of mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I). A neurological phenotype has not been defined in these animals, so our analysis focused on the biochemical and histological CNS abnormalities characteristic of MPS I.

In this work, two novel exonic BCKDK mutations, c.520C>G/p.R174G and c.1166T>C/p.L389P, were identified at the homozygous state in two unrelated children with persistently reduced body fluid levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), developmental delay, microcephaly, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. Functional analysis of the mutations confirmed the missense character of the c.1166T>C change and showed a splicing defect r.[520c>g;521_543del]/p.R174Gfs1*, for c.520C>G due to the presence of a new donor splice site.

In the Part 1 of this two-part review article, after historical signs, the Authors describe the current pathogenic concepts like the 'immuno-allergic theory' and the formation of auto-antibodies in human body, contributing to the genesis of autoimmune illnesses sustained by individual reactivity linked to eredo-constitutionality. Some theories suppose a focal origin even for general pathology such as cancer, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS), Tourette's syndrome, myasthenia gravis, polycystic kidney disease, obesity, Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus. Laboratory analyses (leucocytic formula, protein electrophoresis, C-reactive protein, REUMA test VES, TAS, etc.) are suggestive of the presence of an inflammatory process or of the presence of an aspecific answer to an inflammatory situation. The DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction method (PCR) is fundamental for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections, particularly for those that have non-culturable microorganisms or in cases where are present but in extremely small number in the sample to be analyzed. A positive result confirms the diagnosis, but negative result is not indicator of the absence of illness. Even for oral inflammatory lesions, different basic mechanisms concerning the possible association with systemic diseases exist. They concern local spread, metastatic spread or immunologic cross-reactivity. In this case we assume that most of the ailments come from dental or periodontal foci, as in the bacterial endocarditis, but instead of considering them as possible pathogenetic mechanism of an immune nature, we consider them as originated by the body's response to the presence of bacterial antigens through the formation of specific antibodies. Much researche, sometimes contrasting, has evaluated periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaques isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis. Oral inflammatory lesions have been shown unequivocally to contribute to elevated systemic inflammatory responses.

In addition to blocking HI-induced caspase 3 activation, CAPE also inhibits HI-mediated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and caspase 1 in vivo and potently blocks nitric oxide-induced neurotoxicity in vitro.

Eyeballs and optic nerves were processed for histological assessment of cytoarchitecture. Protein-lipid aldehyde adducts and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were detected immunohistochemically. HA administration increased IOP and associated oxidative stress and inflammation. Elevated IOP was not affected by EDTA-MSM treatment. However, oxidative damage and inflammation were ameliorated as reflected by a decrease in formation of protein-lipid aldehyde adducts and COX-2 expression, respectively. Furthermore, EDTA-MSM treatment increased retinal ganglion cell survival and decreased demyelination of optic nerve compared with untreated eyes. Chelation treatment with EDTA-MSM ameliorates sequelae of IOP-induced toxicity without affecting IOP.

Considering that α-tubulin acetylation is an important factor in axonal transport and that Aβ impairs mitochondrial axonal transport, we manipulated the level of α-tubulin acetylation in hippocampal neurons with Aβ cultured in a microfluidic system and examined its effect on mitochondrial axonal transport. We found that inhibiting histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which deacetylates α-tubulin, significantly restored the velocity and motility of the mitochondria in both anterograde and retrograde axonal transports, which would be otherwise compromised by Aβ. The inhibition of HDAC6 also recovered the length of the mitochondria that had been shortened by Aβ to a normal level. These results suggest that the inhibition of HDAC6 significantly rescues hippocampal neurons from Aβ-induced impairment of mitochondrial axonal transport as well as mitochondrial length. The results presented in this paper identify HDAC6 as an important regulator of mitochondrial transport as well as elongation and, thus, a potential target whose pharmacological inhibition contributes to improving mitochondrial dynamics in Aβ treated neurons."}

A second experiment showed that animals that received CG subchronically (50 mg/kg s.c. every 12 h for 5 days followed by 24 mg/kg/day s.c. for 14 days using osmotic minipumps) after SE presented fewer generalized convulsive seizures and less neuronal damage in the lateral-posterior thalamic nucleus but not in the hippocampus or cortex. Our data indicate that CG can be used as a therapeutic strategy to reduce short- and long-term neuronal damage in the hippocampus and thalamus, respectively. The data also indicate that CG can reduce the expression of generalized convulsive spontaneous seizures when it is given during the latent period of epileptogenesis."}

The Beta-Blocker Cholesterol-Lowering Asymptomatic Plaque Study (BCAPS) trial reported favorable effects with beta-blockade on early stages of atherosclerosis in patients with carotid plaque but no symptoms of carotid artery disease. Compared with placebo, metoprolol controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) 25 mg once daily significantly reduced plaque thickness after 18 months of treatment (net difference -0.058 mm/year; p <0.001) and at 3 years' follow-up (net difference -0.023 mm/year; p = 0.018). The Effects of Long-Term Treatment of Metoprolol CR/XL on Surrogate Variables for Atherosclerotic Disease (ELVA) trial demonstrated that beta-blockers and statins affect different mechanisms in the atherosclerotic process and have additive beneficial effects. Patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomized to metoprolol CR/XL 100 mg once daily or placebo once daily and concomitant statin therapy. The metoprolol CR/XL group had a significantly lower rate of progression of the composite carotid bulb intima-media thickness (IMT) plus common carotid IMT than the placebo group, both at 1 year (-0.08 vs -0.01 mm; p = 0.004) and after 3 years' follow-up (-0.06 vs +0.03 mm; p = 0.011).

The expression of IL-10 mRNA was elevated at 4-14 days after occlusion when cytokines were given in the acute phase (days 1-10).

Further, hematopoietic cytokine treatment in the subacute phase, but not in the acute phase, reduced ED1-positive microglia/macrophages in the infarcted brain. Our recent study showed that the subacute-phase treatment is effective for functional recovery, enhancing generation of neuronal cells from both bone-marrow-derived and neural stem/progenitor cells.

BALB/c tracheal allografts were transplanted into MMP-2-deficient (-/-) and MMP-9-/- mice. Also, wild-type recipients were treated with doxycycline, a nonspecific MMP inhibitor. After 10, 20 and 30 days, allografts were analyzed for OAD development, intragraft levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and the frequency and cytokine/chemokine production profile of alloreactive T cells. Allografts transplanted into wild-type mice developed OAD lesions within 30 days. These allografts revealed significant upregulation of both MMP-2 and MMP-9. Allografts transplanted into MMP-9-/- and doxycycline-treated recipients did not develop OAD. In contrast, allografts transplanted into MMP-2-/- mice developed OAD lesions with normal kinetics. Interestingly, MMP-9-/- recipients showed an enhanced T cell alloreactivity associated with an abnormal profile of cytokine/chemokine production. The enhanced T cell alloreactivity in MMP-9-/- mice was mediated by enhanced dendritic cell stimulatory capacity as well as enhanced T cell responsive capacity.

Mfsd2a is specifically expressed on the cell membrane of brain-microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) and is implicated in the delivery of some substances across the BBB. Mfsd2a is the first inhibitor of the transcytosis and the first transporter for lysophosphatidylcholine-docosahexaenoic acid (LPC-DHA) in BMECs. The crucial dual function of Mfsd2a puts forward two kinds of Mfsd2a-based strategies for carrying drugs from blood to the CNS. First, the reversible inhibition of Mfsd2a may temporarily induce a general disinhibition of the transcytosis in BMECs to transport macromolecular drugs across the BBB (Strategy One). Second, Mfsd2a could be used for the transport of some small-molecule drugs chemically coupled to LPC across the BBB (Strategy Two), which is quite similar to the carrier-mediated transport (CMT) via the glucose transporter (GluT1) and the L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). We here analyze and discuss the clinical significance of the two Mfsd2a-based strategies, including therapeutic potential, available pharmaceuticals, side effects, administration procedures, and disease types. In summary, the regulatory role of Mfsd2a deepens our knowledge of the function of the BBB, potentially contributing to the effective drug delivery in the treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, brain tumors, and life-threatening infections in the CNS."}

Furthermore, a number of diseases are associated with splicing defects that are not attributed to overt mutations. Targeting splicing directly to correct disease-associated aberrant splicing is a logical approach to therapy. Splicing is a favorable intervention point for disease therapeutics, because it is an early step in gene expression and does not alter the genome. Significant advances have been made in the development of approaches to manipulate splicing for therapy. Splicing can be manipulated with a number of tools including antisense oligonucleotides, modified small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), trans-splicing, and small molecule compounds, all of which have been used to increase specific alternatively spliced isoforms or to correct aberrant gene expression resulting from gene mutations that alter splicing.

Related studies showed that these effects were modulated by concentration of fat, environmental influences, and treatment with glucose. More work is needed to identify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this impairment but saturated fatty acid intake, as well as insulin resistance and glucose intolerance may be important factors. In demonstrating a clear relationship between obesity and cognitive impairment, this research has important implications for aging.

However, the mechanism by which administration of bortezomib leads to painful neuropathy remains unclear. In the present study, we found that application of bortezomib significantly increased the expression of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Intrathecal injection of NLRP3 siRNA significantly prevented the mechanical allodynia induced by bortezomib treatment, and intrathecal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus vector encoding NLRP3 markedly decreased paw withdrawal threshold of naive rats. Furthermore, the expressions of p-STAT3 were colocalized with NLRP3-positive cells in DRG neurons, and inhibition of STAT3 by intrathecal injection of AAV-Cre-GFP into STAT3[flox/flox] mice or inhibitor S3I-201 suppressed the upregulation of NLRP3 and mechanical allodynia induced by bortezomib treatment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation further found that bortezomib increased the recruitment of STAT3, as well as the acetylation of histone H3 and H4, in the NLRP3 promoter region in DRG neurons. Importantly, inhibition of the STAT3 activity by using S3I-201 or DRG local deficiency of STAT3 also significantly prevented the upregulated H3 and H4 acetylation in the NLRP3 promoter region following bortezomib treatment. Altogether, our results suggest that the upregulation of NLRP3 in DRG via STAT3-dependent histone acetylation is critically involved in bortezomib-induced mechanical allodynia."}

The potential clinical application of hepatocyte transplantation, however, is limited by the need for readily available, well-characterized cells, and a worldwide shortage of donor organs. A clonal hepatocyte cell line that could be grown economically in vitro and would exhibit a differentiated, nontransformed phenotype following transplantation would be an attractive solution to this problem. To test this alternative, primary Lewis rat hepatocytes were conditionally immortalized by retroviral transduction with a thermolabile mutant Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen. The cloned immortalized cells proliferate in culture at 33 degrees C and stop growing at 37 degrees C to 39 degrees C. Transplanted into normal livers, these hepatocytes integrate normally into liver cords. When transplanted into the spleens of portacaval-shunted rats, they protect recipients from hyperammonemia-induced hepatic encephalopathy. The cells engrafted in the spleen exhibit normal morphology, secrete bile, and express albumin messenger RNA. The protection from hyperammonemia is reversed by splenectomy. These studies show that hepatocytes can be conditionally immortalized, expanded in culture, and are capable of providing metabolic support in chronic liver insufficiency.

The parameters of cooling used in the present study resulted in an injury length of 1 cm through which 3 mm of measured axonal regrowth and 8 mm of observed regrowth occurred over a 56-day period in the ascending fibers of the dorsal column of the mature rat. This was associated with the development of a cellular matrix consisting of macrophages, macroglia and Schwann cells which gradually expands within the injured area initially dominated by macrophages. It is the authors' impression that the presence of a substantial microglial component within the macrophage population may be a significant factor in the success of the axonal regrowth. Under this influence and that of the invading axons, the astrocyte, which provides the immediate cell support to the growing axon, can be maintained in a functional state that is supportive and not obstructive to the axon, presumably through the recruitment of astrocyte precursors from an indigenous stem cell population. These tissue changes indicate that adult mammalian spinal cord tissue does have the capacity to develop on its own a matrix capable of supporting the regrowth of axons."}

Org-24461 and NFPS both tended to increase the raphe neuronal firing rate also when given alone but their effect was not significant. This finding serves further evidence that glutamate released from axon terminals of the cortico-striatal projection neurons stimulates serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei and this effect is mediated at least in part by postsynaptic NMDA receptors.

A single administration of (-)-nicotine (0.04, 0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/kg SC) increased both noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) turnover in a dose-dependent manner, and the maximum effects were achieved 30 min after treatment with (-)-nicotine (1.0 mg/kg). The effect of (-)-nicotine on serotonin (5-HT) turnover was complicated; 5-HT turnover was increased at a low dose of (-)-nicotine (0.04 mg/kg) but decreased at a high dose (1.0 mg/kg). The (-)-nicotine (1.0 mg/kg)-induced changes in monoamine turnover were blocked by pretreatment with the centrally acting nACh-R channel blocker mecamylamine (2.0 mg/kg i.p.) but not by hexamethonium (2.0 mg/kg i.p.).

We have investigated whether inhibition of reactive astrocytosis influences established experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. We made use of transgenic mice, which express herpes simplex virus-derived thymidine kinase under control of a glial fibrillary acidic protein promotor (GFAP HSV-TK mice). Treatment of these mice with ganciclovir leads to inhibition of reactive astrocytosis. When GFAP HSV-TK mice were treated for seven days following onset of EAE with ganciclovir, disease severity increased. Although aquaporin-4 staining on astrocyte endfeet at the glia limitans remained equally detectable, GFAP immunoreactivity and mRNA expression in CNS were reduced by this treatment. Ganciclovir-treated GFAP HSV-TK mice with EAE had a 78% increase in the total number of infiltrating myeloid cells (mainly macrophages), whereas we did not find an increase in infiltrating T cells, using quantitative flow cytometry. Per cell expression of mRNA for the macrophage-associated molecules TNFα, MMP-12 and TIMP-1 was elevated in spinal cord of GFAP HSV-TK mice treated with ganciclovir. Relative expression of CD3ε was downregulated, and expression levels of IFNγ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and Foxp3 were not significantly changed. mRNA expression of CCL2 was upregulated, and CXL10 was downregulated.

L., Caprifoliaceae) by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.^\nInflammation is a hallmark of some of today's most life-threatening diseases such as arteriosclerosis, cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Herbal medicines (HMs) are re-emerging resources in the fight against these conditions and for many of them, anti-inflammatory activity has been demonstrated. However, several aspects of HMs such as their multi-component character, natural variability and pharmacodynamic interactions (e.g. synergism) hamper identification of their bioactive constituents and thus the development of appropriate quality control (QC) workflows. In this study, we investigated the potential use of Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy as a tool to rapidly and non-destructively assess different anti-inflammatory properties of ethanolic extracts from various species of the Genus Lonicera (Caprifoliaceae). Reference measurements for multivariate calibration comprised in vitro bioactivity of crude extracts towards four key players of inflammation: Nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 8 (IL-8), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPAR β/δ), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB). Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed a statistically significant, quantitative pattern-activity relationship between the extracts' ATR-FTIR spectra and their ability to modulate these targets in the corresponding cell models. Ensemble orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) discriminant models were established for the identification of extracts exhibiting high and low activity with respect to their potential to suppress NO and IL-8 production. Predictions made on an independent test set revealed good generalizability of the models with overall sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 100%, respectively. Partial least squares (PLS) regression models were successfully established to predict the extracts' ability to suppress NO production and NF-κB activity with root mean squared errors of cross-validation (RMSECV) of 8.7% and 0.05-fold activity, respectively."}

However, it is unclear whether countervailing mechanisms are engaged in these states. Here we report that iSPN intrinsic excitability and excitatory corticostriatal synaptic connectivity were lower in PD models than normal; L-DOPA treatment restored these properties. Conversely, dSPN intrinsic excitability was elevated in tissue from PD models and suppressed in LID models. Although the synaptic connectivity of dSPNs did not change in PD models, it fell with L-DOPA treatment. In neither case, however, was the strength of corticostriatal connections globally scaled. Thus, SPNs manifested homeostatic adaptations in intrinsic excitability and in the number but not strength of excitatory corticostriatal synapses."}

Biopsies were collected from 20 PM patients before and after treatment of glucocorticoid. Additionally, peritoneal macrophages were isolated from male SD model rats (n = 40).

We also conducted transwell assay to observe invasive abilities of cells; RT-PCR and western blot were intended to semi-quantify miR-21 and CXCL10 expressions in vitro and in vivo. Compared with the control group, serum creatine kinase (S-CK) was upregulated in PM subjects, but its content decreased after treatment of immunosuppressive substances (e.g., glucocorticoids). Moreover, hormone treatment can significantly increase miR-21 expressions in PM patients (P < 0.05). However, CXCL10 expressions had an opposite tendency compared to miR-21expressions. Results drawn from rat model were consistent with those discovered in PM patients. Moreover, miR-21 transfection could significantly decrease the relative luciferase activity when it was integrated with CXCL10 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) in macrophage. Estrogen treatment can also upregulate the expression of NF-κB in macrophage nucleus. Nonetheless, the upregulated tendency was inhibited by either miR-21 mimics or anti-CXCL10 mAb (P < 0.05). Both macrophage migration and CXCL10 expressions were significantly decreased after applying miR-21 treatments compared with the control group, yet estrogen could enhance macrophage migration and increase CXCL10 expressions (P < 0.05).

We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a time-to-event design. Between January and June, 2009, patients with ALS who were taking a stable dose of riluzole for at least 30 days were randomly assigned (1:1) by a centralised computer to receive either lithium or placebo. Patients, caregivers, investigators, and all site study staff with the exception of site pharmacists were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the time to an event, defined as a decrease of at least six points on the revised ALS functional rating scale score or death. Interim analyses were planned for when 84 patients had been allocated treatment, 6 months later or after 55 events, and after 100 events. Analysis was by intention to treat. The stopping boundary for futility at the first interim analysis was a p value of at least 0.68. We used a log-rank test to compare the distributions of the time to an event between the lithium and placebo groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00818389.	At the first interim analysis, 22 of 40 patients in the lithium group had an event compared with 20 of 44 patients in the placebo group (log rank p=0.51). The hazard ratio of reaching the primary endpoint was 1.13 (95% CI 0.61-2.07). The study was stopped at the first interim analysis because criterion for futility was met (p=0.78). The difference in mean decline in the ALS functional rating scale score between the lithium group and the placebo group was 0.15 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.73, p=0.61). There were no major safety concerns. Falls (p=0.04) and back pain (p=0.05) were more common in the lithium group than in the placebo group.	We found no evidence that lithium in combination with riluzole slows progression of ALS more than riluzole alone.

Its venom shows a high neurotoxicity associated with pre- and post-synaptic toxins, causing diaphragm paralysis, which may result in death. In spite of a relatively small incidence of accidents, serum therapy is crucial for those bitten. However, the adequate production of antiserum is hampered by the difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of venom from a small snake with demanding breeding conditions. In order to elucidate the molecular basis of this venom and to uncover possible immunogens for an antiserum, we generated expressed sequences tags (ESTs) from its venom glands and analyzed the transcriptomic profile. In addition, their immunogenicity was tested using DNA immunization.	A total of 1438 ESTs were generated and grouped into 611 clusters. Toxin transcripts represented 46% of the total ESTs. The two main toxin classes consisted of three-finger toxins (3FTx) (24%) and phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s) (15%). However, 8 other classes of toxins were present, including C-type lectins, natriuretic peptide precursors and even high-molecular mass components such as metalloproteases and L-amino acid oxidases. Each class included an assortment of isoforms, some showing evidence of alternative splicing and domain deletions. Five antigenic candidates were selected (four 3FTx and one PLA(2)) and used for a preliminary study of DNA immunization. The immunological response showed that the sera from the immunized animals were able to recognize the recombinant antigens.	Besides an improvement in our knowledge of the composition of coral snake venoms, which are very poorly known when compared to Old World elapids, the expression profile suggests abundant and diversified components that may be used in future antiserum formulation. As recombinant production of venom antigens frequently fails due to complex disulfide arrangements, DNA immunization may be a viable alternative. In fact, the selected candidates provided an initial evidence of the feasibility of this approach, which is less costly and not dependent on the availability of the venom."}

We hypothesized that neuroinflammation makes dendrites susceptible to excitotoxic injury following synaptic activity. We report that platelet-activating factor, an inflammatory phospholipid that mediates synaptic plasticity and neurotoxicity and is dramatically elevated in the brain during HAD, promotes dendrite injury following elevated synaptic activity and can replicate HIV-1-associated dendritic pathology. In hippocampal slices exposed to a stable platelet-activating factor analogue, tetanic stimulation that normally induces long-term synaptic potentiation instead promoted development of calcium- and caspase-dependent dendritic beading. Chemical preconditioning with diazoxide, a mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel agonist, prevented dendritic beading and restored long-term potentiation. In contrast to models invoking excessive glutamate release, these results suggest that physiologic synaptic activity may trigger excitotoxic dendritic injury during chronic neuroinflammation. Furthermore, preconditioning may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing excitotoxic injury while preserving physiologic plasticity."}

Moreover, this compound reduces the increased NF-kappaB binding activity, which occurs in these degenerative conditions. Therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the inflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease (AD) recently suggested the application of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Although the anti-inflammatory properties of acetaminophen are controversial, it emerged that in an amyloid-driven astrocytoma cell degeneration model acetaminophen proved to be effective. On these bases, we analyzed the role of acetaminophen against the toxicity exerted by different Abeta-peptides on rat primary hippocampal neurons and on a rat pheochromocytoma cell line. We found a consistent protection from amyloid beta-fragments 1-40 and 1-42-induced impairment of mitochondrial redox activity on both cell cultures, associated with a marked reduction of apoptotic nuclear fragmentation. An antioxidant component of the protective activity emerged from the analysis of the reduction of phospholipid peroxidation, and also from a significant reduction of cytoplasmic accumulation of peroxides in the pheochromocytoma cell line. Moreover, activation of NF-kappaB by amyloid-derived peptides was greatly impaired by acetaminophen pre-treatment in hippocampal cells. This evidence points out antioxidant and anti-transcriptional properties of acetaminophen besides the known capability to interfere with inflammation within the central nervous system, and suggests that it can be exploited as a possible therapeutic approach against AD."}

The 186Re-HEDP administration, given either 1 day or 8 days after surgical induction of lumbar metastasis, could significantly increase the symptom-free survival of the animals. These results were confirmed by a significant decrease in the presence of histologically detectable tumor tissue. Biodistribution studies demonstrated the uptake of the major part of the radioisotope within bone tissue. Uptake of radioactivity within the lumbar vertebrae on a microscopic scale, as shown by phosphor screen autoradiography, was concentrated in areas of bone formation and turnover. Signs of radiotoxicity, such as bone marrow replacement by fat cells and the absence of megakaryocytes, were observed.	The results show that radionuclide treatment using 186Re-HEDP is a potentially efficacious treatment option in prostate cancer disseminated to the skeleton. The optimal treatment dose should be determined carefully and aimed at acceptable levels of myelotoxicity."}

It is well known that omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial for brain function. Docosahexaenoic acid [DHA; 4 22:6(n-3)] is the most abundant essential omega-3 fatty acid present in the brain and it has multiple mechanisms of exerting protective effects after cellular injury. Certain lipid species produced from DHA early during the reperfusion stage of brain ischemia-reperfusion injury are generated in order to help the cell cope as the injury progresses. We explore these newly discovered lipid mediators in order to understand their role in the cell. We have identified one of these potentially protective lipid mediators as a novel stereospecific DHA-derived fatty acid, called neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1; 10R,17S-dihydroxy-docosa-4Z,7Z,11E,15E,19Z hexaenoic acid). DHA also has important roles in pro-survival signaling cascades after ischemia-reperfusion in injury. It has been shown to accelerate AKT translocation and activation and has binding affinity with an important PPAR-gamma family of ligand-activated nuclear receptors that have been implicated in various aspects of lipid metabolism and have been shown to have anti-inflammatory actions. Here we present an overview of these mechanisms and discuss the potential of using DHA signaling in the development of treatments for the large population of patients suffering from the devastating consequences of stroke."}

In this study, AMPA-induced neuronal injury and staurosporine (STS)-mediated apoptosis were compared in primary neuronal cultures of murine cerebral cortex by analyzing indices up- and downstream of mitochondrial activation. AMPA-mediated apoptosis involved induction of Bax, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsi(m)), early release of cytochrome c (cyt c), and more delayed release of second mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC), Omi, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) with early calpain and minor late activation of caspase 3. STS-induced apoptosis was characterized by a number of differences, a more rapid time course, non-involvement of deltapsi(m), and relatively early recruitment of SMAC and caspase 3. The AMPA-induced rise in intracellular calcium appeared insufficient to evoke feltapsi(m) as release of cyt c preceded mitochondrial depolarization, which was followed by the cytosolic translocation of SMAC, Omi, and AIF. Bax translocation preceded cyt c release for both stimuli inferring its involvement in apoptotic induction. Inclusion of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk reduced the AMPA-induced release of cyt c, SMAC, and AIF, while only affecting the redistribution of Omi and AIF in the STS-treated neurons. Only AIF release was affected by a calpain inhibitor (calpastatin) which exerted relatively minor effects on the progression of cellular injury. AMPA-mediated release of apoptogenic proteins was more hierarchical relative to STS with its calpain activation and caspase-dependent AIF redistribution arguing for a model with cross-talk between caspase-dependent/independent apoptosis."}

Recent studies suggested that berberine has many beneficial biological effects, including anti-inflammation. Because type 1 diabetes is caused by T cell-mediated destruction of beta cells and severe islet inflammation, we hypothesized that berberine could ameliorate type 1 diabetes through its immune regulation properties. Here we reported that 2 weeks of oral administration of berberine prevented the progression of type 1 diabetes in half of the NOD mice and decreased Th17 and Th1 cytokine secretion. Berberine suppressed Th17 and Th1 differentiation by reducing the expression of lineage markers. We found that berberine inhibited Th17 differentiation by activating ERK1/2 and inhibited Th1 differentiation by inhibiting p38 MAPK and JNK activation. Berberine down-regulated the activity of STAT1 and STAT4 through the suppression of p38 MAPK and JNK activation, and it controlled the stability of STAT4 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Our findings indicate that berberine targets MAPK to suppress Th17 and Th1 differentiation in type 1 diabetic NOD mice.

However, the activation mechanism of PLD2 in neuronal cells has not been defined clearly. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) plays roles in the neurodegenerative diseases and also acts as a second messenger of various molecules such as nerve growth factor. To study regulation mechanisms of PLD2 by H(2)O(2) in neuronal cells, we have made stable PC12 cell lines expressing PLD2 (PLD2-PC12 cells). H(2)O(2) treatment stimulated PLD activity in PLD2-PC12 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This activation was inhibited by the treatment with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors or by depletion of PKCalpha, -delta, and -epsilon. Phorbol ester markedly activated PLD2. Co-treatment with phorbol ester and H(2)O(2) did not show an additive effect. Chelation of extracellular calcium substantially blocked the H(2)O(2)-induced activation of PLD2. A calcium ionophore induced PLD2 activation in a PKC-dependent manner. Protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced PLD activation slightly. These data indicate that H(2)O(2) can activate PLD2 in PC12 cells and that this activation is largely dependent on PKC and Ca(2+) ions and minimally dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation."}

COH rat model was induced by cross-linking hydrogel injection into anterior chamber, and the performance of the model was assessed by intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, RGC counting and retinal morphological analysis. Endogenous H2S level was detected along with the retinal protein expressions of H2S-related synthases cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) in the COH rats. Retinal H2S level and RGC survival were evaluated again after NaHS (a H2S donor) treatment in the COH rats. The results showed that the COH model succeeded in simulating glaucoma features, and retinal H2S level decreased significantly when the retinal protein expressions of CBS, CSE and 3-MST were downregulated generally in the COH rats. Furthermore, the decrease of retinal H2S level and loss of RGCs were both improved by NaHS treatment in experimental glaucoma, without obvious variation of IOP.

However, the role of system xc(-) in cerebral ischemia and its involvement in inflammatory reaction has been scarcely explored. In this work, we report the longitudinal investigation of the neuroinflammatory process following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats using PET with [(18)F]FSPG and the translocator protein (TSPO) ligand [(18)F]DPA-714.

In contrast, [(18)F]DPA-714 evidenced maximum binding uptake values over day 7 after reperfusion. Ex vivo immnunohistochemistry confirmed the up-regulation of system xc(-) in microglial cells and marginally in astrocytes. Inhibition of system xc(-) with sulfasalazine and S-4-CPG resulted in increased arginase (anti-inflammatory M2 marker) expression at day 7 after ischemia, together with a decrease in TSPO and microglial M1 proinflammatory markers (CCL2, TNF and iNOS) expression. Taken together, these results suggest that system xc(-) plays a key role in the inflammatory reaction underlying experimental stroke."}

Part A^\nSustained, localized salicylic acid delivery enhances diabetic bone regeneration via prolonged mitigation of inflammation.^\nDiabetes is a metabolic disorder caused by insulin resistance and/or deficiency and impairs bone quality and bone healing due to altered gene expression, reduced vascularization, and prolonged inflammation. No effective treatments for diabetic bone healing are currently available, and most existing treatments do not directly address the diabetic complications that impair bone healing. We recently demonstrated that sustained and localized delivery of salicylic acid (SA) via an SA-based polymer provides a low-cost approach to enhance diabetic bone regeneration. Herein, we report mechanistic studies that delve into the biological action and local pharmacokinetics of SA-releasing polymers shown to enhance diabetic bone regeneration. The results suggest that low SA concentrations were locally maintained at the bone defect site for more than 1 month. As a result of the sustained SA release, a significantly reduced inflammation was observed in diabetic animals, which in turn, yielded reduced osteoclast density and activity, as well as increased osteoblastogenesis. Based upon these results, localized and sustained SA delivery from the SA-based polymer effectively improved bone regeneration in diabetic animals by affecting both osteoclasts and osteoblasts, thereby providing a positive basis for clinical treatments. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the case of As(III) ingestion, a small portion of all arsenic excreted in urine (about 6%) was excreted in inorganic form, while most arsenic was excreted as methylated arsenic metabolites. Following MMA treatments for 1 wk or 7 mo, the predominant products excreted were unchanged MMA and DMA accompanied by small amounts of TMAO and tetramethylarsonium (TeMA). In the case of DMA treatment the urinary compounds found were mainly the parent DMA and TMAO with minute amounts of TeMA. TMAO was methylated to TeMA to a slight extent after 1 wk and 7 mo of administration, although most TMAO was excreted in the form of unchanged TMAO. AsBe was predominantly eliminated in urine without any transformation. Two unidentified metabolites were detected in urine after 7 mo of arsenic species exposure; the amounts of these metabolites increased in the order DMA > MMA > TMAO with only small quantities of these detected in the As(III)-treated group. These results suggest that these unidentified metabolites are formed during a demethylation process, and not during methylation. Our findings indicate that long-term exposure to As(III), MMA, or DMA decreases the proportion of TMAO elimination in urine and increases that of DMA, M-1, and M-2, and that further methylation to TMAO to TeMA does occur to a slight extent following long-term exposure to arsenical compounds in rats."}

Thus, a better understanding of the molecular pathways responsible for the cause of neuropathic pain observed in SCI is important to develop effectively therapeutic agents and treatment strategies. Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) are a family member of G-protein-coupled receptors and are activated by a proteolytic mechanism. One of its subtypes PAR2 has been reported to be engaged in mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia.

Underperfusion and overperfusion impair neurologic function after selective antegrade cerebral perfusion.

The P23H mutation, the most frequent single cause of RP in the USA, causes rhodopsin misfolding and induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive ER stress response and signalling network that aims to enhance the folding and degradation of misfolded proteins to restore proteostasis. Prolonged UPR activation, and in particular the PERK branch, can reduce protein synthesis and initiate cell death through induction of pro-apoptotic pathways. Here, we investigated the effect of pharmacological PERK inhibition on retinal disease process in the P23H-1 transgenic rat model of retinal degeneration. PERK inhibition with GSK2606414A led to an inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation, which correlated with reduced ERG function and decreased photoreceptor survival at both high and low doses of PERK inhibitor.

In contrast, treatment of P23H-1 rats with an inhibitor of eIF2α phosphatase, salubrinal, led to improved photoreceptor survival.

The availability of PEA as (ultra)micronized nutraceutical formulations with reportedly no side effects, renders it accordingly an appealing candidate in human preventive care, such as in population at high risk of disease development or for healthy aging. PEA's mode of action is multi-facetted. Consensus exists that PEA's effects are primarily modulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and that PEA-activated PPARα has a pleiotropic effect on lipid metabolism, inflammation gene networks, and host defense mechanisms. Yet, an exhaustive view of how the prophylactic PEA administration changes the lipid signaling in brain and periphery, thereby eliciting a beneficial response to various negative stimuli remains still elusive. We therefore, undertook a broad lipidomic and transcriptomic study in brain and spleen of adult mice to unravel the positive molecular phenotype rendered by prophylactic PEA. We applied a tissue lipidomic and transcriptomic approach based on simultaneous extraction and subsequent targeted liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MRM) and mRNA analysis by qPCR, respectively. We targeted lipids of COX-, LOX- and CYP450 pathways, respectively, membrane phospholipids, lipid products of cPLA2, and free fatty acids, along with various genes involved in their biosynthesis and function. Additionally, plasma lipidomics was applied to reveal circulatory consequences and/or reflection of PEA's action. We found broad, distinct, and several previously unknown tissue transcriptional regulations of inflammatory pathways. In hippocampus also a PEA-induced transcriptional regulation of neuronal activity and excitability was evidenced. A massive downregulation of membrane lipid levels in the splenic tissue of the immune system with a consequent shift towards pro-resolving lipid environment was also detected. Plasma lipid pattern reflected to a large extent the hippocampal and splenic lipidome changes, highlighting the value of plasma lipidomics to monitor effects of nutraceutical PEA administration. Altogether, these findings contribute new insights into PEA's molecular mechanism and helps answering the questions, how PEA prepares the body for insults and what are the 'good lipids' that underlie this action."}

Our previous study demonstrates traumatic brain injury induces brain mitochondrial dysfunction after injury. Preservation and/or restoration of mitochondrial function may be one of the strategies for neuroprotection. Erythropoietin, a hormone for erythropoiesis, also provides tissue protection against traumatic brain injury and stroke. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of erythropoietin on traumatic brain injury-induced brain mitochondrial dysfunction. Traumatic brain injury decreased rates of respiration at the active state (state 3), increased that at the resting state (state 4) and consequently decreased respiratory control index (state 3/state 4 ratio) and the efficiency of ATP synthesis (the amount of ADP phosphorylated by inorganic phosphate divided by the amount of oxygen consumed during state 3 respiration). Erythropoietin administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes post-injury at 1000 U/kg partially improved mitochondrial function at day 1 post-injury. However, erythropoietin-induced improvement was not sustained at day 7 post-injury. Erythropoietin at 2000 or 5000 U/kg restored states 3 and 4 examined at day 1 post-injury to the sham levels. Consequently, the energy coupling capacities, such as respiratory control index and/or the efficiency of ATP synthesis, were also improved. The beneficial effect of erythropoietin at these doses persisted for at least 7 days post-injury. The beneficial effect of erythropoietin on brain mitochondrial function was observed with a wide therapeutic window from 5 minutes to 6 hours post-injury. Our data, for the first time, demonstrate that erythropoietin treatment restores brain mitochondrial function after traumatic brain injury, which will enhance cellular energy generation and reduce oxidative stress, strongly supporting erythropoietin as a promising agent for the therapeutic treatment of traumatic brain injury."}

The potential applications of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are wide ranging, but a normal cytogenetic profile is important to avoid the risk of tumor formation in clinical trials. FDA approved clinical trials are being planned and conducted for hNPC transplantation into the brain or spinal cord for various neurodegenerative disorders. Although human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are known to show recurrent chromosomal abnormalities involving 12 and 17, no studies have revealed chromosomal abnormalities in cultured hNPCs. Therefore, we investigated frequently occurring chromosomal abnormalities in 21 independent fetal-derived hNPC lines and the possible mechanisms triggering such aberrations.	While most hNPC lines were karyotypically normal, G-band karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses revealed the emergence of trisomy 7 (hNPC(+7)) and trisomy 19 (hNPC(+19)), in 24% and 5% of the lines, respectively. Once detected, subsequent passaging revealed emerging dominance of trisomy hNPCs. DNA microarray and immunoblotting analyses demonstrate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression in hNPC(+7) and hNPC(+19) cells. We observed greater levels of telomerase (hTERT), increased proliferation (Ki67), survival (TUNEL), and neurogenesis (beta(III)-tubulin) in hNPC(+7) and hNPC(+19), using respective immunocytochemical markers. However, the trisomy lines underwent replicative senescence after 50-60 population doublings and never showed neoplastic changes. Although hNPC(+7) and hNPC(+19) survived better after xenotransplantation into the rat striatum, they did not form malignant tumors. Finally, EGF deprivation triggered a selection of trisomy 7 cells in a diploid hNPC line.	We report that hNPCs are susceptible to accumulation of chromosome 7 and 19 trisomy in long-term cell culture. These results suggest that micro-environmental cues are powerful factors in the selection of specific hNPC aneuploidies, with trisomy of chromosome 7 being the most common. Given that a number of stem cell based clinical trials are being conducted or planned in USA and a recent report in PLoS Medicine showing the dangers of grafting an inordinate number of cells, these data substantiate the need for careful cytogenetic evaluation of hNPCs (fetal or hESC-derived) before their use in clinical or basic science applications."}

Several lines of evidence have recently suggested that opioid and cannabinoid receptors can functionally interact in the central nervous system (CNS). These interactions may be direct, such as through receptor heteromerization, or indirect, such as through signaling cross-talk that includes agonist-mediated release and/or synthesis of endogenous ligands that can activate downstream receptors. Interactions between opioid and cannabinoid receptors may mediate many of the behavioral phenomena associated with the use of these drugs, including the production of acute antinociception and the development of tolerance and cross-tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of opioid and cannabinoid-specific ligands. This review summarizes behavioral, anatomical, and molecular data characterizing these interactions during the development of neuropathic pain and during antinociceptive treatment with these drugs alone or in combination. These studies are critical for understanding how the receptor systems involved in pain relief are altered during acute or chronic pain, and for designing better antinociceptive drug therapies, such as the combined use of opioid and cannabinoid receptor agonists or selective activation of receptor heteromers, that directly target the altered neurophysiology of patients experiencing pain."}

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a key factor that not only promotes fibrinolysis via the activation of plasminogen, but also contributes to regulation of synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis through plasmin-mediated activation of a probrain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to mature BDNF. ProBDNF activation could potentially be supressed by competition with fibrin for plasmin and tPA. High affinity binding of plasmin and tPA to fibrin could result in a decrease of proBDNF activation during brain inflammation leading to fibrosis further perpetuating depressed mood. There is a paucity of data explaining the possible role of the fibrinolytic system or aberrant extravascular fibrin deposition in depression. We propose that within the brain, an imbalance between tPA and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and neuroserpin favors the inhibitors, resulting in changes in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation that result in depressive behavior. Our hypothesis is that peripheral inflammation mediates neuroinflammation, and that cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) can inhibit the fibrinolytic system by up- regulating PAI-1 and potentially neuroserpin. We propose that the decrement of the activity of tPA and uPA occurs with downregulation of uPA in part involving the binding and clearance from the surface of neural cells of uPA/PAI-1 complexes by the urokinase receptor uPAR. We infer that current antidepressants and ketamine mitigate depressive symptoms by restoring the balance of the fibrinolytic system with increased activity of tPA and uPA with down-regulated intracerebral expression of their inhibitors. We lastly hypothesize that psychedelic 5-ht2a receptor agonists, such as psilocybin, can improve mood through anti- inflammatory and pro-fibrinolytic effects that include blockade of TNF-α activity leading to decreased PAI-1 activity and increased clearance. The process involves disinhibition of tPA and uPA with subsequent increased cleavage of proBDNF which promotes neurogenesis, decreased neuroinflammation, decreased fibrin deposition, normalized glial-neuronal cross-talk, and optimally functioning neuro-circuits involved in mood. We propose that psilocybin can alleviate deleterious changes in the brain caused by chronic stress leading to restoration of homeostatic brain fibrinolytic capacity leading to euthymia."}

Results from the German Study on Epidemiology of Parkinson's Disease with Dementia (GEPAD).^\nParkinson's disease (PD) is often accompanied by non-motor complications, such as dementia, depression, and psychotic symptoms, which worsen the prognosis and increase the personal and socioeconomic burden of disease. Prevalence estimates of these complications are quite variable and are lacking for the outpatient care sector.	As part of a larger, nationwide, cross-sectional epidemiological study in n = 315 neurological outpatient settings in Germany, this paper estimates the frequency of dementia and cognitive impairment in n = 873 outpatients meeting the UK Brain Bank criteria for idiopathic PD. Assessments were based on a clinical interview and neuropsychological assessments, including the Hoehn & Yahr rating and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Cognitive impairment was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test (CDT) and the Parkinson Neuropsychometric Dementia Assessment (PANDA) and the clinician's diagnosis of dementia was based on the diagnostic criteria of DSMIV.	Using standardized cutoff scores, the prevalence of cognitive impairment in the study sample as measured by various methods was 17.5% by MMSE (< or = 24), 41.8% by CDT (> or = 3), 43.6% by PANDA (< or = 14), and 28.6% met the DSM-IV criteria for dementia. All estimates increased with age and PD severity. Gender was an inconsistent contributor while illness duration had no significant impact on cognition. Multiple regression analyses revealed PD severity to be the strongest predictor of dementia risk (OR = 4.3; 95% CI: 2.1-9.1), while neuropsychiatric syndromes had independent, although modest additional contributions (OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6-3.8).	Estimates of cognitive impairment and dementia in PD patients are largely dependent on the diagnostic measure used. Using established clinical diagnostic standards for dementia the overall rate on routine outpatient neurological care is 28.6%, but using more sensitive neuropsychological measures, rates for cognitive impairment might be up to 2-fold higher. The MMSE revealed strikingly low sensitivity. Neuropsychiatric syndromes, in addition to PD severity and age, have an independent--although modest--additional contribution to patients' risk for cognitive impairment and dementia."}

The initial objective of this study was to investigate the potential of neuroprotective botanicals such as Z-ligustilide in reducing the cytotoxicity of dopamine. We surprisingly found that Z-ligustilide potentiated dopamine toxicity in a dopaminergic cell specific manner. Using rat dopaminergic cell line PC12 as a model, we demonstrated that dopamine and Z-ligustilide in combination profoundly induced cell death, although these drugs alone, to a lesser extent, affected the cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. The synergistic cytotoxicity of dopamine and Z-ligustilide is likely mediated via apoptosis, characterized by DNA fragmentation and chromatin shrinking after 12 h incubation. By measuring the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced glutathione (GSH), Z-ligustilide and dopamine in combination dramatically enhanced the ROS formation and further depleted reduced GSH, whereas these drugs alone showed much less activity. Importantly, the synergistic cytotoxicity of dopamine and Z-ligustilide could be largely prevented by thiol-containing antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and GSH other than vitamin C and Trolox.

SLOS results in cognitive impairment, behavioral abnormalities and nervous system defects, though neither affected cell types nor impaired signaling pathways are fully understood. Whether 7DHC accumulation or cholesterol loss is primarily responsible for disease pathogenesis is also unclear. Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from subjects with SLOS, we identified cellular defects that lead to precocious neuronal specification within SLOS derived neural progenitors. We also demonstrated that 7DHC accumulation, not cholesterol deficiency, is critical for SLOS-associated defects. We further identified downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a key initiator of aberrant SLOS iPSC differentiation through the direct inhibitory effects of 7DHC on the formation of an active Wnt receptor complex. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling prevented the neural phenotypes observed in SLOS iPSCs, suggesting that Wnt signaling may be a promising therapeutic target for SLOS."}

Intriguingly, cerebellar Purkinje cells are highly vulnerable to hypoxia-ischemia (HI), related at least in part to their high metabolic activity. Whether or not excessive or supraphysiologic autophagy plays a role in Purkinje cell susceptibility to HI is unknown. Accordingly, we evaluated the role of autophagy in the cerebellum after global ischemia produced by asphyxial cardiac arrest in postnatal day (PND) 16-18 rats, using siRNA-targeted inhibition of Atg7, necessary for microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and Atg12-Atg5 complex formation. Two days before a 9min asphyxial cardiac arrest or sham surgery, Atg7 or control siRNA was injected intracisternally to target the cerebellum. Treatment with Atg7 siRNA: 1) reduced Atg7 protein expression in the cerebellum by 56%; 2) prevented the typical ischemia-induced formation of LC3-II in the cerebellum 24h after asphyxial cardiac arrest; 3) improved performance on the beam-balance apparatus on days 1-5; and 4) increased calbindin-labeled Purkinje cell survival assessed on day 14. Improved Purkinje cell survival was more consistent in female vs. male rats, and improved beam-balance performance was only seen in female rats. Similar responses to Atg7 siRNA i.e. reduced autophagy and neurodegeneration vs. control siRNA were seen when exposing sex-segregated green fluorescent protein-LC3 tagged mouse primary cortical neurons to oxygen glucose deprivation in vitro.

Bone remodeling is a physiological process that involves the synthesis of bone matrix by osteoblasts and resorption of bone by osteoclasts. When resorption exceeds formation, bone remodeling can be disrupted resulting in bone diseases such as osteoporosis.

Apart from IFN-α production, pDCs can also process Ag and induce T cell immunity or tolerance. In several solid tumors, pDCs have been shown to play a critical role in promoting tumor immunosuppression. We investigated the role of pDCs in the process of glioma progression in the syngeneic murine model of glioma. We show that glioma-infiltrating pDCs are the major APC in glioma and are deficient in IFN-α secretion (p < 0.05). pDC depletion leads to increased survival of the mice bearing intracranial tumor by decreasing the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and by decreasing the suppressive capabilities of Tregs. We subsequently compared the ability of mDCs and pDCs to generate effective antiglioma immunity in a GL261-OVA mouse model of glioma. Our data suggest that mature pDCs and mDCs isolated from naive mice can be effectively activated and loaded with SIINFEKL Ag in vitro. Upon intradermal injection in the hindleg, a fraction of both types of DCs migrate to the brain and lymph nodes. Compared to mice vaccinated with pDC or control mice, mice vaccinated with mDCs generate a robust Th1 type immune response, characterized by high frequency of CD4(+)T-bet(+) T cells and CD8(+)SIINFEKEL(+) T cells.

Using the murine LCMV infection model, we established a correlation between cell stemness and the ability of CD8[+] T cells to undergo ACD. Transient mTOR inhibition was proven to increase ACD rates in naïve and memory cells and to install this ability in exhausted CD8[+] T cells.

Moreover, transient mTOR inhibition also increased ACD rates in human CD8[+] T cells.

Lovastatin and sodium phenylacetate (NaPA) were found to inhibit LPS- and cytokine-mediated production of NO and expression of iNOS in rat primary astrocytes; this inhibition was not due to depletion of end products of mevalonate pathway (e.g., cholesterol and ubiquinone). Reversal of the inhibitory effect of lovastatin on LPS-induced iNOS expression by mevalonate and farnesyl pyrophosphate and reversal of the inhibitory effect of NaPA on LPS-induced iNOS expression by farnesyl pyrophosphate, however, suggests a role of farnesylation in the LPS-mediated induction of iNOS. The inhibition of LPS-mediated induction of iNOS by FPT inhibitor II, an inhibitor of Ras farnesyl protein transferase, suggests that farnesylation of p21(ras) or other proteins regulates the induction of iNOS. Inhibition of LPS-mediated activation of NF-kbeta by lovastatin, NaPA, and FPT inhibitor II in astrocytes indicates that the observed inhibition of iNOS expression is mediated via inhibition of NF-kbeta activation. In addition to iNOS, lovastatin and NaPA also inhibited LPS-induced expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in rat primary astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages.

Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a well-established risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. Prospective studies have estimated that at least 40-65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a defined neurodegenerative phenotype, almost always a 'synucleinopathy' (Parkinson's disease, Lewy Body dementia or multiple system atrophy).

The interval between RBD onset and disease onset averages 10-15 years, suggesting a promisingly large window for intervention into preclinical disease stages. The ability of RBD to predict disease has major implications for design and development of neuroprotective therapy, and testing of other predictive markers of synuclein-mediated neurodegeneration. Recent studies in idiopathic RBD patients have demonstrated that olfaction, color vision, severity of REM atonia loss, transcranial ultrasound of the substantia nigra, and dopaminergic neuroimaging can predict development of neurodegenerative disease."}

Xijiao Dihuang Decoction (XDD), a famous herbal formula for treating hemorrhagic fever syndromes, has been shown to exert powerful neuroprotective property. The aim of this study was to identify the chemical constituents in XDD, observe the neuroprotective effect of XDD against acute ischemic stroke, and explore the specific mechanisms by which these effects were mediated. With UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS, 47 components in XDD were detected and 25 of them were identified. In rats subjected to MCAO, XDD ameliorated neurological deficit, histopathology changes, and infarction volume. In addition, levels of TNF-ɑ, IL-6, and IL-1β in XDD-treated group were significantly lower compared to the model group. Mechanistic studies showed that XDD inhibited MCAO-induced NF-κB activation, presenting as downregulating the expression of phospho-NF-κB p65 and preventing IκBɑ degradation. Besides, BDNF, GDNF, VEGF, bFGF, and CD34 levels were significantly increased by XDD, suggesting that the protective effects of XDD may also be associated with the promotion of neurogenesis and angiogenesis. In conclusion, these findings provided a novel regulatory pathway of the neuroprotective effect of XDD that helped rehabilitate patients with stroke."}

Neuropathological examination of patients vaccinated against purified Abeta-42 (AN-1792) has demonstrated that senile plaque disruption occurred in immunized humans as well. Here, we examined tissue histology and quantified and biochemically characterized the remnant amyloid peptides in the gray and white matter and leptomeningeal/cortical vessels of two AN-1792-vaccinated patients, one of whom developed meningoencephalitis. Compact core and diffuse amyloid deposits in both vaccinated individuals were focally absent in some regions. Although parenchymal amyloid was focally disaggregated, vascular deposits were relatively preserved or even increased. Immunoassay revealed that total soluble amyloid levels were sharply elevated in vaccinated patient gray and white matter compared with Alzheimer's disease cases. Our experiments suggest that although immunization disrupted amyloid deposits, vascular capture prevented large-scale egress of Abeta peptides. Trapped, solubilized amyloid peptides may ultimately have cascading toxic effects on cerebrovascular, gray and white matter tissues. Anti-amyloid immunization may be most effective not as therapeutic or mitigating measures but as a prophylactic measure when Abeta deposition is still minimal. This may allow Abeta mobilization under conditions in which drainage and degradation of these toxic peptides is efficient."}

In the past few years, technological advances in the induction and maintenance of cooling have been achieved and can potentially allow for a more accurate evaluation of this form of treatment. We report a series of 14 patients with an average age of 39.4 years (range, 16-62 years) with acute, complete (AIS A) cervical spinal cord injuries who underwent a protocol using an intravascular cooling catheter to achieve modest (33 degrees C) systemic hypothermia. There was an excellent correlation between intravascular and intrathecal cerebrospinal fluid temperature. The average time between injury and induction of hypothermia was 9.17 +/- 2.24 h (mean +/- SEM); the time to target temperature was 2.72 +/- 0.42 h; the duration of cooling at target temperature was 47.6 +/- 3.1 h; the average total length of time of cooling was 93.6 +/- 4 h. There was a positive correlation between temperature and heart rate. Most documented adverse events were respiratory in nature. We were able to effectively deliver systemic cooling using the cooling catheters with minimal variation in body temperature. The study represents the largest, modern series of hypothermia treatment of acute spinal cord injury with intravascular cooling techniques and provides needed baseline data for outcome studies to include larger multi-center, randomized trials."}

According to previous studies, apelin-13 protects cardiomyocytes from ischemic injury as well as apoptosis. In addition, this peptide has a neuroprotective effect on hippocampal and cultured mouse cortical neurons against NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity.

To optimize this approach, we proposed to study the involvement of this nucleus in a non-human primate model of mesial temporal lobe seizure. Two macaques were implanted with one chronic electrode into the hippocampus allowing to monitor the ictal activity. Neurons of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus were recorded with a microelectrode inserted acutely. To induce seizures, penicillin was injected into the hippocampus and neuronal activities of the anterior nucleus were analyzed during ictal and interictal periods. The effects of the chemical neuromodulation of the anterior nucleus on the ictal hippocampal activities were studied and electron microscopy analysis was carried out to study morphological modifications induced in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results demonstrate that the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is directly involved in the pathophysiology of induced seizures since: (1) Electrophysiological study showed an heterogenous excitation during seizure characterized by the appearance of 2 types of neuronal firing response; (2) chemical neuromodulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus changed the severity of seizures; (3) morphological modification of the ultrastructure as well as a reduction of synapse density were observed within the ipsilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. This study demonstrates that the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the epileptic network activated during temporal lobe seizures and suggests that this nucleus would be valid target for seizure control using deep brain stimulation."}

Consequently, the overall prognosis remains grim. Herein, we report our pilot studies in cell culture experiments and in an animal model of GBM in which RT is complemented by PEGylated-gold nanoparticles (GNPs). GNPs significantly increased cellular DNA damage inflicted by ionizing radiation in human GBM-derived cell lines and resulted in reduced clonogenic survival (with dose-enhancement ratio of ~1.3). Intriguingly, combined GNP and RT also resulted in markedly increased DNA damage to brain blood vessels. Follow-up in vitro experiments confirmed that the combination of GNP and RT resulted in considerably increased DNA damage in brain-derived endothelial cells. Finally, the combination of GNP and RT increased survival of mice with orthotopic GBM tumors. Prior treatment of mice with brain tumors resulted in increased extravasation and in-tumor deposition of GNP, suggesting that RT-induced BBB disruption can be leveraged to improve the tumor-tissue targeting of GNP and thus further optimize the radiosensitization of brain tumors by GNP. These exciting results together suggest that GNP may be usefully integrated into the RT treatment of brain tumors, with potential benefits resulting from increased tumor cell radiosensitization to preferential targeting of tumor-associated vasculature."}

C5ar(-/-) mice, which lack the signaling receptor for C5a, displayed signs of improved locomotor recovery and reduced inflammation during the first week of SCI compared with wild-type mice. Intriguingly, the early signs of improved recovery in C5ar(-/-) mice deteriorated from day 14 onward, with absence of C5aR ultimately leading to poorer functional outcomes, larger lesion volumes, reduced myelin content, and more widespread inflammation at 35 d SCI. Pharmacological blockade of C5aR with a selective antagonist (C5aR-A) during the first 7 d after SCI improved recovery compared with vehicle-treated mice, and this phenotype was sustained up to 35 d after injury. Consistent with observations made in C5ar(-/-) mice, these improvements were, however, lost if C5aR-A administration was continued into the more chronic phase of SCI. Signaling through the C5a-C5aR axis thus appears injurious in the acute period but serves a protective and/or reparative role in the post-acute phase of SCI. Further experiments in bone marrow chimeric mice suggested that the dual and opposing roles of C5aR on SCI outcomes primarily relate to its expression on CNS-resident cells and not infiltrating leukocytes. Additional in vivo and in vitro studies provided direct evidence that C5aR signaling is required during the postacute phase for astrocyte hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and glial scar formation. Collectively, these findings highlight the complexity of the inflammatory response to SCI and emphasize the importance of optimizing the timing of therapeutic interventions."}

In breast cancer, HER2 status is associated with increased risk of brain metastases and response to HER2-targeted therapy. The purpose of this project was to compare HER2 status in GI cancer brain metastases versus matched prior sites of disease in order to determine if HER2+ disease is more common intracranially.	We identified 28 patients with GI cancer who had craniotomy for brain metastases between 1999 and 2017 with intracranial metastatic tissue available at Massachusetts General Hospital. Twenty-four patients also had tissue from a prior site of disease. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER2 were performed on all samples. A tumor was defined as HER2+ if it had 3+ staining by IHC or amplification by FISH.	A prior site of disease (including intracranial metastases) was HER2+ for 13% of evaluable patients: 3 of 11 patients with colorectal cancer and no patients with esophageal or pancreatic cancer. The most recent brain metastases were HER2+ for 32% of patients: 2 of 3 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 3 of 10 esophageal adenocarcinomas (ACs), 3 of 14 colorectal ACs, and 1 of 1 pancreatic AC. Only 37.5% of patients with HER2+ brain metastasis had concordant HER2+ prior tissue (κ = 0.38, p = .017).	In this cohort of patients with GI cancer with brain metastases, HER2+ status was more common intracranially compared with prior sites of disease. These findings suggest that testing HER2 in patients with GI cancer with brain metastases may lead to additional therapeutic options, regardless of HER2 status in previously examined tissue.	HER2 amplification is a well-known driver of oncogenesis in breast cancer, with associated increased risk of brain metastases and response to HER2-directed therapy. In nongastric gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, HER2 amplification is not common and consequently is infrequently tested. The current study shows that brain metastases in patients with GI primary malignancies have a relatively high likelihood of being HER2 positive despite HER2 amplification or overexpression being less commonly found in matched tissue from prior sites of disease. This suggests that regardless of prior molecular testing, patients with GI cancer with brain metastases who have tissue available are likely to benefit from HER2 assessment to identify potential novel therapeutic options.	背景。在非胃肠 (GI) 癌症中，HER2 阳性 (HER2+) 疾病并不常见。在乳腺癌中，HER2 状态与脑转移风险增加和 HER2 靶向治疗反应相关。该项目的目的是将胃肠癌脑转移中的 HER2 状态与相匹配的先前疾病部位进行比较，以确定 HER2+ 疾病是否更常见于颅内。 材料和方法。我们确定了 28 名患有胃肠癌的患者，这些患者于 1999 年至 2017 年间进行了脑转移开颅术，颅内转移组织存放于马萨诸塞州综合医院。有二十四名患者之前患病部位的组织也可获得。我们对所有样本进行了针对 HER2 的荧光原位杂交 (FISH) 和免疫组织化学 (IHC) 检测。如果肿瘤通过 IHC 出现 3+ 染色或通过 FISH 扩增，则将肿瘤定义为 HER2+。 结果。对于 13% 的可评估患者，先前的疾病部位(包括颅内转移)为 HER2+:11 例患者中有 3 例患有结肠直肠癌，且没有患有食管癌或胰腺癌的患者。对于 32% 的患者，最近的脑转移是 HER2+:3 例食管鳞状细胞癌病例中有 2 位患者，10 例食管腺癌 (AC) 病例中有 3 位患者，14 例结直肠腺癌病例中有 3 位患者，以及 1 例胰腺癌中的 1 位患者。只有 37.5% 的 HER2+ 脑转移患者具有与先前组织一致的 HER2+ (κ = 0.38, p = 0.017)。 结论。在这组患有脑转移的胃肠癌患者中，与先前的疾病部位相比，HER2+ 状态在颅内更常见。这些研究结果表明，对患有脑转移的胃肠癌患者进行 HER2 检测可能会产生其他治疗选择，无论先前检查的组织中 HER2 状态如何。 对实践的启示:HER2 扩增是众所周知的乳腺癌中癌发生的驱动因素，与脑转移的风险增加和对 HER2 定向治疗的反应有关。在非胃肠 (GI) 癌症中，HER2 扩增并不常见，因此很少进行检测。目前的研究表明，胃肠原发性恶性肿瘤患者的脑转移具有相对较高的 HER2 阳性可能性，尽管 HER2 扩增或过表达在先前疾病部位的匹配组织中较少见。这表明，无论先前的分子检测如何，具有可用组织的患有脑转移的胃肠癌患者可能受益于 HER2 评估，以确定潜在的新治疗选择。"}

Peptide scanning is a simple and efficient method that straightforwardly maps the linear epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb). Here, the authors present an epitope determination methodology involving serially truncated recombinant proteins, synthetic peptide design, and dot-blot hybridization for the antigenic recognition of nervous necrosis virus coat protein using a neutralizing mAb. This technique relies on the dot-blot hybridization of synthetic peptides and mAbs on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The minimum antigenic region of a viral coat protein recognized by the RG-M56 mAb can be narrowed down by step-by-step trimmed peptide mapping onto a 6-mer peptide epitope. In addition, alanine scanning mutagenesis and residue substitution can be performed to characterize the binding significance of each amino acid residue making up the epitope.

Multiple pFUS+MB exposures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models are being investigated as a method to clear amyloid plaques by activated microglia or infiltrating immune cells. Since it has been reported that pFUS+MB can induce a sterile inflammatory response (SIR) [1-5] in the rat, the goal of this study was to investigate the potential long-term effects of SIR in the brain following single and six weekly sonications by serial high-resolution MRI and pathology. Methods: Female Sprague Dawley rats weighing 217±16.6 g prior to sonication received bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to tag proliferating cells in the brain. pFUS was performed at 548 kHz, ultrasound burst 10 ms and initial peak negative pressure of 0.3 MPa (in water) for 120 s coupled with a slow infusion of ~460 µL/kg (5-8×10[7] MB) that started 30 s before and 30 s during sonication. Nine 2 mm focal regions in the left cortex and four regions over the right hippocampus were treated with pFUS+MB. Serial high-resolution brain MRIs at 3 T and 9.4 T were obtained following a single or during the course of six weekly pFUS+MB resulting in BBBD in the left cortex and the right hippocampus. Animals were monitored over 7 to 13 weeks and imaging results were compared to histology. Results: Fewer than half of the rats receiving a single pFUS+MB exposure displayed hypointense voxels on T2*-weighted (w) MRI at week 7 or 13 in the cortex or hippocampus without differences compared to the contralateral side on histograms of T2* maps. Single sonicated rats had evidence of limited microglia activation on pathology compared to the contralateral hemisphere. Six weekly pFUS+MB treatments resulted in pathological changes on T2*w images with multiple hypointense regions, cortical atrophy, along with 50% of rats having persistent BBBD and astrogliosis by MRI. Pathologic analysis of the multiple sonicated animals demonstrated the presence of metallophagocytic Prussian blue-positive cells in the parenchyma with significantly (p<0.05) increased areas of activated astrocytes and microglia, and high numbers of systemic infiltrating CD68[+] macrophages along with BrdU[+] cells compared to contralateral brain. In addition, multiple treatments caused an increase in the number of hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau)-positive neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the sonicated cortex but not in the hippocampus when compared to contralateral brain, which was confirmed by Western blot (WB) (p<0.04). Conclusions: The repeated SIR following multiple pFUS+MB treatments could contribute to changes on MR imaging including persistent BBBD, cortical atrophy, and hypointense voxels on T2w and T2*w images consistent with pathological injury. Moreover, areas of astrogliosis, activated microglia, along with higher numbers of CD68[+] infiltrating macrophages and BrdU[+] cells were detected in multiple sonicated areas of the cortex and hippocampus. Elevations in pTau and NFT were detected in neurons of the multiple sonicated cortex. Minimal changes on MRI and histology were observed in single pFUS+MB-treated rats at 7 and 13 weeks post sonication. In comparison, animals that received 6 weekly sonications demonstrated evidence on MRI and histology of vascular damage, inflammation and neurodegeneration associated with the NVU commonly observed in trauma. Further investigation is recommended of the long-term effects of multiple pFUS+MB in clinical trials."}

In cultured astrocytes, CNβ expression increased after treatment with a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, and with oxygen and glucose deprivation, an in vitro model of ischemia. Similarly, CNβ was induced in astrocytes in vivo in two different mouse models of brain injury - photothrombotic stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Immunoprecipitation and chemical activation dimerization methods pointed to physical interaction of CNβ with the unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). In accordance, induction of CNβ resulted in oligomerization and activation of PERK. Strikingly, the presence of a phosphatase inhibitor did not interfere with CNβ-mediated activation of PERK, suggesting a hitherto undiscovered non-enzymatic role for CNβ. Importantly, the cytoprotective function of CNβ was PERK-dependent both in vitro and in vivo. Loss of CNβ in vivo resulted in a significant increase in cerebral damage, and correlated with a decrease in astrocyte size, PERK activity and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. Taken together, these data reveal a critical role for the CNβ-PERK axis in not only prolonging astrocyte cell survival but also in modulating astrogliosis after brain injury."}

A VAS pain-rating scale, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EQ-5D-5L Quality of Life Questionnaire 5 dimensions, and Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale were evaluated at 12 weeks and 6 months post implantation.	VAS pain scores for back pain reduced from 91 to 31 mms and 80 to 35 mms for leg pain. Additionally, while stimulation remained paresthesia-free, there were a marked decrease in pain medications and an increase in quality of life. Also, an increase in functionality from crippled to moderate was reported. There were no adverse reactions related to the procedure or device.	The minimally invasive, wireless approach to deliver high-frequency, paresthesia-free DRG stimulation for treatment of chronic back and leg pain associated with FBSS was effective and encouraging."}

Panax ginseng C. A. Mey. has been used as a nootropic herb for thousands of years in Asian countries. Saponins are recognized as its major active components. Previous studies have shown that ginseng saponins offer protection against memory deficits caused by various factors. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of their nootropic effects are still largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the memory-improving effects of ginseng total saponins (GTS) on simulated microgravity hindlimb-unloaded rats using a metabolomics approach. After being exposed to a 7-days hindlimb unloading (HU), variations of plasmatic and hippocampal metabolic profiles of rats with and without GTS intervention were examined by a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based untargeted metabolomics method. Subsequently, 8 hippocampal neurotransmitters were determined using a LC-MS/MS method. Finally, a LC-MS/MS based targeted metabolomics was performed to validate biomarkers found in the untargeted analysis. Besides, to support the metabolomics results, passive avoidance (PA) test, Nissl staining, and plasmatic corticosterone (CORT) levels determination were performed. The results showed that HU could lead to variations of 7 neurotransmitters and significantly different plasmatic and hippocampal metabolic profiles. GTS could restore most of the imbalanced neurotransmitters, especially glutamic acid and acetylcholine, and correct the levels of various disturbed learning and memory relevant biomarkers such as asparagine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and choline. In addition, GTS could markedly ameliorate HU-induced memory deficiency, protect hippocampal neurons from damage, and down-regulate elevated CORT levels. In conclusion, GTS exhibits memory-improving effects mainly through regulating the metabolism of amino acids, neurotransmitters, choline, kynurenine, and sphingolipids. The findings of this study not only can deepen our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of MG-induced memory disorders, but also provide scientific evidence for choosing ginseng as a countermeasure against MG-induced memory deficiency."}

Mesoangioblasts have the ability to undergo skeletal muscle differentiation and cross the blood vessel wall regardless of the developmental stage at which they are isolated. Here we show that PW1/Peg3 is expressed at high levels in mesoangioblasts obtained from mouse, dog and human tissues and its level of expression correlates with their myogenic competence. Silencing PW1/Peg3 markedly inhibits myogenic potential of mesoangioblasts in vitro through MyoD degradation. Moreover, lack of PW1/Peg3 abrogates mesoangioblast ability to cross the vessel wall and to engraft into damaged myofibres through the modulation of the junctional adhesion molecule-A. We conclude that PW1/Peg3 function is essential for conferring proper mesoangioblast competence and that the determination of PW1/Peg3 levels in human mesoangioblasts may serve as a biomarker to identify the best donor populations for therapeutic application in muscular dystrophies."}

Felbamate (5 or 10 mg/kg) significantly increased afterdischarge threshold, shortened seizure and afterdischarge durations but remained without effect on seizure severity. Furthermore, the combination of felbamate (2.5 mg/kg) with carbamazepine (7.5 mg/kg; both drugs at their subeffective doses), was associated with the reduction in seizure severity and afterdischarge duration. In relation to the afterdischarge duration, the antiseizure potency of felbamate and carbamazepine, in combination, was comparable with that of carbamazepine (10 mg/kg) administered alone. Neither carbamazepine (7.5 and 10 mg/kg) nor felbamate (2.5-10 mg/kg) affected seizure severity, whereas the combined administration of felbamate (2.5 mg/kg) with carbamazepine (7.5 mg/kg) led to significant reduction in seizure severity from the fifth to the third stage of Racine's scale. Among the conventional antiepileptic drugs evaluated in this study, only valproate (100 mg/kg) and clonazepam (0.1 mg/kg) exerted similar action on seizure severity. However, the combinations of felbamate (2.5 mg/kg), with subeffective doses of valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin or clonazepam, were not associated with any protective action. As blood and brain felbamate and carbamazepine concentrations were unaffected, a pharmacokinetic interaction can be excluded and a pharmacodynamic interaction concluded.

It is hypothesized that dopamine receptor agonists reduce neuronal output from the STN. The present study tests this hypothesis by using in vivo extracellular single unit recording techniques to measure neuronal activity in the STN of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway (a model of Parkinson's disease). As predicted, firing rates of STN neurons in lesioned rats were tonically elevated under basal conditions and were decreased by the nonselective dopamine receptor agonists apomorphine and L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). STN firing rates were also decreased by the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole when administered after the D1 receptor agonist (+/-)- 1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(1H)-3-benzazepine-7,8-diol (SKF 38393). Results of the present study challenge the prediction that dopaminergic agonists reduce STN activity predominantly through actions at striatal dopamine D2 receptors. Firing rates of STN neurons were not altered by selective stimulation of D2 receptors and were increased by selective stimulation of D1 receptors. Moreover, there was a striking difference between the responses of the STN to D1/D2 receptor stimulation in the lesioned and intact rat; apomorphine inhibited STN firing in the lesioned rat and increased STN firing in the intact rat. These findings support the premise that therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is associated with a decrease in the activity of the STN, but challenge assumptions about the roles of D1 and D2 receptors in the regulation of neuronal activity of the STN in both the intact and dopamine-depleted states."}

In this study, the effect of exercise on spatial memory function recovery in the early stage was shown, and the mechanism of recovery was discussed using a rat model of brain embolism.	Intra-arterial microsphere (MS) injection induced small emboli in the rat brain. Treadmill exercise was started at 24 hours (early group) or 8 days (late group) after MS injection. The non-exercise (NE) and sham-operated groups were included as controls. Memory function was evaluated by the Morris water maze test, and hippocampal levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. To further investigate the effect of BDNF on memory function, BDNF was continuously infused into the hippocampus via implantable osmotic pumps in the early or late stage after stroke.	Memory function significantly improved only in the early group compared with the late and the NE groups, although hippocampal BDNF concentrations were temporarily elevated after exercise in both the early and the late groups. Rats infused with BDNF in the early stage exhibited significant memory function recovery; however, rats that received BDNF infusion in the late stage showed no improvement.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rolipram on metabolic disorder and its underlying mechanisms. Metabolic disorder was induced in 8-week-old wild type BABL/c mice by administration of D-galactose for 4 weeks. Simultaneously the mice were administered vehicle or rolipram. Alternatively, beginning at 3 or 21 months, the mice were administered db-cAMP for 3 months, with or without a high-fat-diet (HFD) to induce metabolic disorder. In both models, better metabolic function was observed in rolipram-treated mice. Rolipram reduced adipose deposition and inflammation and reserved metabolic disorder. Treatment with rolipram increased the AMPK phosphorylation and SIRT6 levels in the liver and kidney while reducing NF-κB acetylation. In vitro, these effects were blocked by suppression of SIRT6 expression using specific siRNA. Increased cAMP levels reduced excessive adipose deposition, and improved adipose distribution in presenile mice. These findings provide a promising strategy for the treatment of aging-related metabolic dysfunctions and suggest that selective PDE4 inhibitors may be useful agents for the treatment of aging-related metabolic diseases."}

Drugs currently used to treat NP have undesirable side effects, so research on other natural sources has been required. β-caryophyllene (BCP), a natural sesquiterpene found in some food condiments and considered an agonist to cannabinoid receptor type 2, could have potential therapeutic effects to treat conditions such as NP and emotional disorders. For this reason, we assessed whether BCP modulates nociception, anxiety, and depressive-like behavior in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced experimental diabetic BALB/c female mice. BCP was orally chronic administrated (10 mg/kg/60 μL). Pain developed with STZ was evaluated with von Frey filament test, SMALGO[®], and hot plate test. Anxiety and depression-like behavior were assessed by marbles test, forced swim test, and tail suspension test. BCP significantly reduced glycemia in experimental diabetic mice. The pain was also mitigated by BCP administration. Depression-like behavior assessed with tail suspension test was attenuated with orally chronic BCP administration. Substance P and cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also attenuated with BCP administration. NP was positively correlated with substance P and IL-6 and IL-1β release.

Dose-dependent effects observed included growth retardation, craniofacial and cardiovascular malformations, as well as neural tube defects. In the axolotl, ATRA induced slightly more pronounced embryotoxic effects than ATRAG. All-trans-retinal was shown to be a major endogenous retinoid in this species. Endogenous levels of all-trans-retinaldehyde were increased during exposure to both ATRA and ATRAG. The glucuronide, however, was only detected in small amounts after ATRAG exposure.

Age matched controls were provided water without added nitrate. In fast-twitch muscle fibres dissected from nitrate treated mice, myoplasmic free [Ca(2+)] was significantly greater than in Control fibres at stimulation frequencies from 20 to 150 Hz, which resulted in a major increase in contractile force at ≤ 50 Hz. At 100 Hz stimulation, the rate of force development was ∼35% faster in the nitrate group. These changes in nitrate treated mice were accompanied by increased expression of the Ca(2+) handling proteins calsequestrin 1 and the dihydropyridine receptor. No changes in force or calsequestrin 1 and dihydropyridine receptor expression were measured in slow-twitch muscles. In conclusion, these results show a striking effect of nitrate supplementation on intracellular Ca(2+) handling in fast-twitch muscle resulting in increased force production. A new mechanism is revealed by which nitrate can exert effects on muscle function with applications to performance and a potential therapeutic role in conditions with muscle weakness."}

Our plan is to reproduce AD pathology in rodents by making them transgenic for several human proteins involved in AD. This report describes transgenic animal lines that we have produced, and summarizes our current approach and future plans. Two human genes known to be involved in AD pathology are the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the E4 isoform of apolipoprotein E (apoE4). So far, we have produced and analyzed a transgenic line carrying the entire human APP gene cloned in a yeast artificial chromosome. We have also produced but not yet analyzed a mouse carrying the human apoE4 gene. Work is in progress to produce a transgenic line carrying a disease-causing mutation in the human APP gene. As we produce these animals, we are breeding them together, and also breeding them with a mouse line that lacks endogenous apoE, to produce an animal model carrying several human proteins whose interaction is believed to be instrumental in development of AD pathology. These transgenic animals will be useful for dissecting the biochemical and physiological steps leading to AD, and for development of therapies for disease intervention."}

Adrenergic vasopressor agents produce systemic vasoconstriction. This increases aortic diastolic pressure, and consequently, coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures. The pharmacologic responses to the adrenergic agents are mediated by a group of receptors that are classified as alpha (alpha), including alpha1 and alpha2, and beta (beta), including beta1 and beta2. Epinephrine, which has each of these adrenergic actions, has been the preferred adrenergic agent for the management of cardiac arrest for almost 40 years. Its primary efficacy is due to its alpha-adrenergic vasopressor effects. This contrasts with its beta-adrenergic actions, which are inotropic, chronotropic, and vasodilator. Accordingly, beta-adrenergic actions prompt increases in myocardial oxygen consumption, ectopic ventricular arrhythmias, and transient hypoxemia due to pulmonary arteriovenous shunting. This may account for the failure to demonstrate that epinephrine improves ultimate outcomes in human victims of cardiac arrest. Major interest has more recently been focused on selective alpha-adrenergic agonists. Both alpha1-agonists and alpha2-agonists are peripheral vasopressors. However, rapid desensitization of alpha1-adrenergic receptors occurs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Moreover, alpha1-adrenergic receptors are present in the myocardium, and beta1-agonists, like beta-adrenergic agonists, increase myocardial oxygen consumption. If they cross the blood-brain barrier, alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists also have centrally acting vasodilator effects. In the absence of central nervous system access, alpha2-adrenergic agonists have selective peripheral vasoconstrictor effects. Under experimental conditions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, selective alpha2-agonists, which do not gain entrance into the brain, produce only systemic vasoconstriction. Experimentally, these selective alpha2-agonists are as effective as epinephrine for initial cardiac resuscitation and have the additional advantage of minimizing myocardial oxygen consumption during the global myocardial ischemia of cardiac arrest. Accordingly, myocardial ischemic injury during cardiopulmonary resuscitation is minimized, and postresuscitation myocardial function is preserved with improved survival."}

Liposomes can reduce the toxicity of cisplatin and provide a better therapeutic action, but the low lipid solubility of cisplatin hinders its high entrapment in such lipid carrier. In the present investigation, positively charged reactive aquated species of cisplatin were complexed with negatively charged caprylate ligands, resulting in enhanced interaction of cisplatin with lipid bilayer of liposomes and increase in its encapsulation in liposomal carrier. Prepared cisplatin liposomes were found to have a vesicular size of 107.9 ± 6.2 nm and zeta potential of -3.99 ± 3.45 mV. The optimized liposomal formulation had an encapsulation efficiency of 96.03 ± 1.24% with unprecedented drug loading (0.21 mg cisplatin / mg of lipids). The in vitro release studies exhibited a pH-dependent release of cisplatin from liposomes with highest release (67.55 ± 3.65%) at pH 5.5 indicating that a maximum release would occur inside cancer cells at endolysosomal pH.

Iron metabolism is controlled by hepcidin, a 25-amino acid peptide. Hepcidin is induced by inflammation, causes iron to be sequestered, and thus, potentially contributes to AI. Human hepcidin (hHepc) overexpression in mice caused an iron-deficient phenotype, including stunted growth, hair loss, and iron-deficient erythropoiesis. It also caused resistance to supraphysiologic levels of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, supporting the hypothesis that hepcidin may influence response to treatment in AI. To explore the role of hepcidin in inflammatory anemia, a mouse AI model was developed with heat-killed Brucella abortus treatment. Suppression of hepcidin mRNA was a successful anemia treatment in this model. High-affinity antibodies specific for hHepc were generated, and hHepc knock-in mice were produced to enable antibody testing. Antibody treatment neutralized hHepc in vitro and in vivo and facilitated anemia treatment in hHepc knock-in mice with AI.

The aim of present review was to summarize recent findings about neuroprotective effects of OPN on ischemic stroke, targeting to provide a novel therapeutic strategy.	To prepare this review, a pathophysiological and pharmacological literature survey was performed using PubMed, and Web of Science. Also, some statistical and epidemiological literature sources were used.	Mounting evidence indicates that OPN attenuates cerebral damage and promotes neurogenesis in ischemic stroke by binding to its receptors to activate diverse signaling pathways.	The paper highlights the neuroprotective and pro-regenerative effects of OPN after cerebral ischemia, which would demonstrate its therapeutic potential in ischemic stroke and other informs of ischemic brain injury."}

One of the most important changes, called immunosenescence, occurs in the immune system. Immunosenescence covers changes in the innate and the adaptive immune systems and is associated with a low-grade inflammation called inflammaging. Aging, likely via inflammaging, is also associated with the emergence of chronic diseases including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The origin of this inflammaging is not known with certainty, but several concurrent contributing factors have been suggested, such as aging-associated changes in the innate and adaptive immune response, chronic antigenic stimulation, the appearance of endogenous macromolecular changes, and the presence of senescent cells exhibiting a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. A better understanding of the multiple biological phenomena leading to these diseases via the immunosenescence associated with inflammaging provides a powerful target for interventions to increase the healthspan of elderly subjects."}

To explore these possible epileptogenic mechanisms, electrophysiological and anatomic methods were used to examine the dentate gyrus network in adult rats that had been treated systemically with kainic acid. All kainate-treated rats, but no age-matched vehicle-treated controls, were observed to have spontaneous recurrent motor seizures beginning weeks to months after exposure to kainate. Epileptic kainate-treated rats and control animals were anesthetized for field potential recording from the dentate gyrus in vivo. Epileptic kainate-treated rats displayed spontaneous positivities ('dentate electroencephalographic spikes') with larger amplitude and higher frequency than those in control animals. After electrophysiological recording, rats were perfused and their hippocampi were processed for Nissl and Timm staining. Epileptic kainate-treated rats displayed significant hilar neuron loss and granule cell axon reorganization. It has been hypothesized that hilar neuron loss reduces lateral inhibition in the dentate gyrus, thereby decreasing seizure threshold. To assess lateral inhibition, simultaneous recordings were obtained from the dentate gyrus in different hippocampal lamellae, separated by 1 mm. The perforant path was stimulated with paired-pulse paradigms, and population spike amplitudes were measured. Responses were obtained from one lamella while a recording electrode in a distant lamella leaked saline or the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor antagonist bicuculline. Epileptic kainate-treated and control rats both showed significantly more paired-pulse inhibition when a lateral lamella was hyperexcitable. To assess seizure threshold in the dentate gyrus, two techniques were used. Measurement of stimulus threshold for evoking maximal dentate activation revealed significantly higher thresholds in epileptic kainate-treated rats compared with controls. In contrast, epileptic kainate-treated rats were more likely than controls to discharge spontaneous bursts of population spikes and to display stimulus-triggered afterdischarges when a focal region of the dentate gyrus was disinhibited with bicuculline. These spontaneous bursts and afterdischarges were confined to the disinhibited region and did not spread to other septotemporal levels of the dentate gyrus. Epileptic kainate-treated rats that displayed spontaneous bursts and/or afterdischarges had significantly larger percentages of Timm staining in the granule cell and molecular layers than epileptic kainate-treated rats that failed to show spontaneous bursts or afterdischarges. In summary, this study reveals functional abnormalities in the dentate gyri of epileptic kainate-treated rats; however, lateral inhibition persists, suggesting that vulnerable hilar neurons are not necessary for generating lateral inhibition in the dentate gyrus."}

This study thus aimed to elucidate brain bioavailability of trans-resveratrol by monitoring brain concentrations and dwell times following administration of resveratrol through intragastric, intraperitoneal, external carotid artery/ECA and intrathecal routes. In parallel, we evaluated the biological responses of rat RG2 glioblastoma cells as well as RG2-formed rat intracranial glioblastomas treated with resveratrol via intrathecal administration. The results revealed that resveratrol was detected in rat brains except when administered systemically. Intrathecal administration of reseveratrol led to abundant apoptotic foci and increased staining of the autophagy proteins, LC-3 and Beclin-1 and shrinkage of the intracranial tumors. In conclusion, the BBB penetrability of resveratrol is remarkably increased by intracthecal administration. Regular short-term resveratrol treatments suppress growth and enhance autophagic and apoptotic activities of rat RG2 glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, intrathecal administration of resveratrol could be an optimal intervention approach in the adjuvant management of brain malignancies."}

This disease is associated with elevated concentrations of very long chain fatty acids (C24:0 and C26:0) in the plasma and tissues of patients. Under its severe form, brain demyelination and inflammation are observed. Therefore, we determined the effects of C24:0 and C26:0 on glial cells:oligodendrocytes, which synthesize myelin, and astrocytes, which participate in immune response. So, 158N murine oligodendrocytes, rat C6 glioma cells, rat primary cultures of neuronal-glial cells, and of oligodendrocytes were treated for various periods of time in the absence or presence of C24:0 and C26:0 used at plasmatic concentrations found in X-ALD patients (1-5 μM) and higher (10, 20, 40 μM). To evaluate the importance of extrinsic and intrinsic factors, the part taken by TNF-α and reduced Abcd1 level was studied. Whatever the cells considered, no effects on cell growth and/or viability were detected at 1-5 μM, more or less pronounced effects were identified at 10 μM, and an induction of cell death with increased permeability to propidium iodide and loss of transmembrane mitochondrial potential was observed at 20-40 μM. On 158N, cell death was characterized by (i) an increased superoxide anion production at the mitochondrial level; (ii) the presence of vacuoles of different sizes and shapes; a destabilization of lysosomal membrane and a cytoplasmic redistribution of lysosomes; (iii) a modulation of Abcd3/PMP70 and Acox-1 protein expression, and a decrease in catalase activity at the peroxisomal level. When TNF-α was combined with C24:0 or C26:0 and used on 158N cells, C6 cells, and on 158N cells after siRNA mediated knockdown of Abcd1, no or slight potentiation was revealed. Thus, on the different cell models used, an induction of cell death with marked cellular dysfunctions at the mitochondrial, lysosomal, and peroxisomal levels were found with C24:0 and C26:0 at 20 μM and higher. However, in our experimental conditions, plasmatic concentrations of these fatty acids were unable to induce cell death, and organelle dysfunctions on oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, and additional intrinsic and environmental factors, such as reduced Abcd1 level and/or TNF-α, were ineffective to potentiate their side effects."}

In the present work, we investigated the putative neuroprotective role of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, on early life SE-induced acute neuronal death and long-term behavioral abnormalities. Male Wistar rats (16 postnatal days) were induced to SE by LiCl-pilocarpine i.p. administration (3 mEq/kg; 60 mg/kg, respectively). Fifteen or 60min after pilocarpine injection, animals received a ketamine administration (22.5mg/kg i.p.). Neuronal degeneration was assessed 24h after SE induction. Another subset of animals was destined to behavioral tasks in adulthood (75-80 postnatal days). Fluoro-Jade C labeling revealed a marked neuronal death on CA1 hippocampal subfield, habenula, thalamus and amygdala in SE animals. Ketamine post-SE onset treatment prevented neuronal death in all regions assessed. In the elevated plus maze, SE induced an increase in anxiety-like behaviors whereas ketamine administration during seizures was able to prevent this alteration. Ketamine administration in non-SE animals resulted in high anxiety levels. There were no observed differences among groups in the open field task in all parameters analyzed. Our results suggest that ketamine post-SE onset treatment was effective in preventing acute and long-standing alterations caused by SE early in life, which indicates a putative role of glutamatergic system on SE-induced brain damage as well as long-lasting behavioral consequences."}

Its ability to evade and rapidly suppress host inflammatory responses is considered a key element for its profound virulence. We previously established that Ftt lipids play a role in inhibiting inflammation, but we did not determine the lipid species mediating this process. Here, we show that a unique, abundant, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), present in Francisella, contributes to driving the suppression of inflammatory responses in human and mouse cells. Acyl chain lengths of this PE, C24: 0 and C10: 0, were key to the suppressive capabilities of Francisella PE. Addition of synthetic PE 24: 0-10: 0 resulted in the accumulation of PE in host cells for up to 24 h of incubation, and recapitulated the inhibition of inflammatory responses observed with native Ftt PE. Importantly, this novel PE significantly inhibited inflammatory responses driven by a medically and globally important flavivirus, dengue fever virus. Thus, targeting these lipids and/or the pathways that they manipulate represents a new strategy to combat immunosuppression engendered by Ftt, but they also show promise as a novel therapeutic intervention for significant viral infections."}

In the present study we compared the effects of short- (8 h) and intermediate-term (48 h) sleep deprivation (SD) on the expression of BDNF and its downstream targets, Synapsin I, CREB and CAMKII in the neocortex and the hippocampus. Rats were sleep deprived using an intermittent treadmill system which equated total movement in the SD and control treadmill animals (CT), but permitted sustained periods of rest in CT animals. Animals were divided into SD (treadmill schedule: 3 s on/12 s off) and two treadmill control groups, CT1 (15 min on/60 min off) and CT2 (30 min on/120 min off - permitting more sustained sleep). Real-time Taqman RT-PCR was used to measure changes in mRNA; BDNF protein levels were determined using ELISA. In the hippocampus, 8 h treatments reduced BDNF, Synapsin I, CREB and CAMKII gene expression in both SD and control groups. Following 48 h of experimental procedures, the expression of all these four molecular markers of plasticity was reduced in SD and CT1 groups compared to the CT2 and cage control groups. In the hippocampus, BDNF protein levels after 8 h and 48 h treatments paralleled the changes in mRNA. In neocortex, neither 8 h nor 48 h SD or control treatments had significant effects on BDNF, Synapsin I and CAMKII mRNA levels. Stepwise regression analysis suggested that loss of REM sleep underlies the effects of SD on hippocampal BDNF, Synapsin I and CREB mRNA levels, whereas loss of NREM sleep underlies the effects on CAMKII mRNA."}

Because there is still no worldwide agreement on RBE values, more often than not, average values for these parameters are used.

Approaching this quest from another angle: the outcome will also provide the parameters (and values) which influence the optimal source neutron energy. For brain tumours it turns out that the 10B concentration, the RBE factors for 10B as well as fast neutrons, together with the dose limit set for healthy tissue, affect the optimal BNCT source neutron energy.

Even though several isoform-specific effects of apoE have been identified, the relationship between biochemical function and risk factor assessment remains unknown. Our previous studies have demonstrated that there is an equilibrium between cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and plasma beta-amyloid (Abeta) and that amyloid plaques can modify this equilibrium. Trafficking of soluble central nervous system (CNS) Abeta is a very dynamic system that almost certainly is modulated by Abeta-binding proteins. Altered trafficking of the Abeta peptide might have a dramatic consequence as to whether the peptide is metabolized or begins to deposit within the brain. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which apoE influences AD pathogenesis and/or Abeta trafficking, we developed PDAPP transgenic mice that express different levels of human apoE3. Analysis of the soluble CNS pools of Abeta in young mice showed an apoE3 dose-dependent decrease in Abeta levels (E3-/- > E3-/- > E3+/+). In addition to the dose-dependent effects on soluble Abeta, by 15 mo of age there were highly significant differences in the amount of deposited Abeta between the genotypes (E3-/- > E3-/- > E3+/+). These data indicate that apoE3 provides a dose-dependent protective effect against Abeta deposition. This study suggests that increasing human apoE levels in brain might be a possible therapeutic target for preventing AD."}

Previously, we showed that silicone tubes filled with dental pulp cells (DPCs) promoted facial nerve regeneration in rats. However, the use of silicone tubes requires a secondary removal operation because they may give rise to chronic inflammation and pain.

Five days after transplantation, the facial nerves connected by the PLGA tubes containing DPCs were repaired more quickly than the control nerves. The PLGA tubes were resorbed in vivo and nerve regeneration was observed 2 months after the transplantation. Immunostaining showed that Tuj1-positive axons were present in the regenerated nerves 2 months after transplantation, and osmium-toluidine blue staining showed no mineralization of the regenerated nerves in those tubes containing myelinated fibres after 9 weeks.

They migrate, undergo hypertrophy, and form a glial scar that inhibits axon regeneration. Therefore, limiting astrocytic responses represents a potential therapeutic strategy to improve functional recovery. It was recently shown that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is upregulated in astrocytes after injury and promotes their transformation into reactive astrocytes. Furthermore, EGF receptor inhibitors were shown to enhance axon regeneration in the injured optic nerve and promote recovery after spinal cord injury. However, the signaling pathways involved were not elucidated. Here we show that in cultures of adult spinal cord astrocytes EGF activates the mTOR pathway, a key regulator of astrocyte physiology. This occurs through Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the GTPase-activating protein Tuberin, which inhibits Tuberin's ability to inactivate the small GTPase Rheb. Indeed, we found that Rheb is required for EGF-dependent mTOR activation in spinal cord astrocytes, whereas the Ras-MAP kinase pathway does not appear to be involved. Moreover, astrocyte growth and EGF-dependent chemoattraction were inhibited by the mTOR-selective drug rapamycin. We also detected elevated levels of activated EGF receptor and mTOR signaling in reactive astrocytes in vivo in an ischemic model of spinal cord injury. Furthermore, increased Rheb expression likely contributes to mTOR activation in the injured spinal cord. Interestingly, injured rats treated with rapamycin showed reduced signs of reactive gliosis, suggesting that rapamycin could be used to harness astrocytic responses in the damaged nervous system to promote an environment more permissive to axon regeneration."}

The same therapeutic schedule was used, consisting of five total administrations every third day, of 0.525 mg temozolomide, 20 microg F16-IL2, the combination, or the control solution.	Immunohistochemical analysis of U87MG xenografts and of human glioblastoma specimens showed selective tumour staining of F16. A quantitative biodistribution confirmed the preferential tumour accumulation of radiolabelled F16-IL2. In the study with subcutaneous xenografts, the combination of F16-IL2 with temozolomide induced complete remission of the animals, which remained tumour free for over 160 days. The same treatment led to a consistent size reduction of intracranial xenografts and to a longer survival of animals. The immunocytokine promoted the recruitment of leukocytes into tumours of both models.	The combined use of temozolomide with F16-IL2 deserves clinical investigations, which will be facilitated by the excellent safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys, and by the fact that F16-IL2 is in clinical trials in patients with cancer."}

Studies have demonstrated that between 30 and 80% of alcoholics are thiamine deficient, and this puts them at risk of developing the Wernicke-Korsakoff (WK) syndrome. The relative roles of alcohol and TD in causing brain damage remain controversial and it is important to try to determine the role played by each factor. Animal studies support an additive effect of alcohol exposure and TD, and indicate the potential for interaction between alcohol and TD in human alcohol-related brain damage. Early diagnosis of alcohol-related TD is therefore an important aspect of effective intervention and treatment. Alcohol biomarkers provide a direct and indirect way of estimating the amount of alcohol being consumed, the duration of ingestion and the harmful effects that long-term alcohol use has on body functions. Appropriate use of these markers is very helpful when considering a diagnosis of alcohol-related TD."}

Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is strongly implicated as a proximal event in AD pathophysiology, but the neurochemical signals that regulate APP processing in the brain are not completely understood. Activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) has been shown to affect APP processing and AD pathology, but less is known about the roles of specific mAChR subtypes. In this study, we used M(1) mAChR knock-out mice (M(1)KO) to isolate the effects of the M(1) mAChR on APP processing in primary neurons and on the development of amyloid pathology in a transgenic mouse model of AD. We demonstrate that the loss of M(1) mAChRs increases amyloidogenic APP processing in neurons, as evidenced by decreased agonist-regulated shedding of the neuroprotective APP ectodomain APPsalpha and increased production of toxic Abeta peptides. Expression of M(1) mAChRs on the M(1)KO background rescued this phenotype, indicating that M(1) mAChRs are sufficient to modulate nonamyloidogenic APP processing. In APP(Swe/Ind) transgenic mice, the loss of M(1) mAChRs resulted in increased levels of brain Abeta and greater accumulation of amyloid plaque pathology. Analysis of APP metabolites in APP(Swe/Ind) brain tissue indicates that the loss of M(1) mAChRs increases amyloidogenic APP processing. These results indicate that the M(1) mAChR is an important regulator of amyloidogenesis in the brain and provide strong support for targeting the M(1) mAChR as a therapeutic candidate in AD."}

Consequently, the relative secretion of amyloidogenic Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42(3) is reduced. This is particularly relevant since fibroblasts and other cells expressing APP and presenilin AD mutations secrete increased amounts of total Abeta and/or increased ratios of Abeta1-42(3)/Abeta1-40. Interestingly, PKC defects have been found in AD brain alpha and beta isoforms) and in fibroblasts (alpha isoform) from AD patients. Here, we use a novel PKC activator (benzolactam, BL) with improved selectivity for the alpha, beta and gamma isoforms to enhance sAPP secretion in fibroblasts from AD patients and in PC12 cells. Incubation (2 h) of AD fibroblasts with BL (1 and 10 microM) resulted in significant increases of sAPP secretion over basal levels. sAPP secretion in BL-treated AD cells was also slightly higher compared to control BL-treated fibroblasts, which only showed significant increases of sAPP secretion after treatment with 10 microM BL. Staurosporine (a PKC inhibitor) eliminated the effects of BL in both control and AD fibroblasts. BL and a related compound (LQ12) also caused an approximately 3-fold sAPP secretion in PC12 cells. The use of a novel and possibly non-tumorigenic PKC activator may prove useful to favor non-amyloidogenic APP processing and is, therefore, of potential therapeutic value."}

Several reports have identified cellular membranes as sensitive targets for Al intoxication. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with Al would alter membrane fluidity and potential and these changes would correlate with aberrant generation of cellular oxidants. The effects of in vitro Al exposure in resting rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells, a model that exhibits neuron-like properties, were investigated. Treatment of PC-12 cells with Al (>0.01mM) resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in membrane fluidity. Similar concentrations of Al increased the rate of extracellular acidification, measured by a cytosensor microphysiometer, indicating stimulation of proton extrusion from cells. This change in proton extrusion was accompanied by a rapid and concentration-dependent hyperpolarizion of the cell membrane as determined by decreased fluorescence of a potential-sensitive dye, bis-[1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid]trimethine oxonol [Dibac(4)(3)]. Al-induced perturbations of membrane properties correlated with an increased level of cellular oxidants, indicated by increasing dihydrorhodamine 123 oxidation. Results suggest that acute exposure to Al modifies membrane properties of neuron-like cells and therefore cellular membranes represent a plausible target for Al neurotoxicity. Alterations in membrane potential can have a dramatic impact on cellular communication especially in neurons and may be an important mechanism in Al neurotoxicity."}

However, the localization of viral vector delivery to diseased target sites remains a challenge. We tested the hypothesis that an adenoviral vector could be successfully delivered by complexation with a specific antibody that is bound to a biodegradable matrix designed for achieving localized gene transduction. We report the first successful delivery system based upon antibody immobilization of virions in a type I collagen-avidin gel using a polyclonal biotinylated IgG specific for the adenovirus hexon. In vitro stability studies demonstrated retention of viral vector activity with antibody-complexed adenovirus collagen gel preparations, in comparison to loss of vector activity from collagen gels prepared with nonspecific biotinylated IgG. Cell culture investigations using this antibody-controlled release system for adenoviral vector transduction of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A10) demonstrated a significantly more localized reporter expression (beta-galactosidase) compared with non-antibody-complexed controls. Herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSVtk) adenoviral vectors were immobilized on avidin-collagen gels via this antibody-complexation approach, and ganciclovir was added to rat smooth muscle cells (A10) in culture with the gels. With complexed HSVtk adenovirus, only cells either in contact with the virus-containing gel or within 50 microm were killed. By comparison, at the same adenovirus and ganciclovir dose, non-antibody-complexed HSVtk adenoviral delivery with ganciclovir resulted in the death of virtually all cells. Myocardial gene transfer studies in pigs demonstrated significantly more efficient right ventricular adenoviral GFP expression with anti-hexon antibody-complexed matrix injections, compared with direct vector injections. Thus, our results show that matrix formulations based on antibody-complexation delivery of adenovirus resulted in site-specific localization of transgene expression that enhances the efficiency of therapeutic vector strategies and provides a potent means for localization, to avoid distal side-effects. This approach has therapeutic potential as an implantable preparation that through the means of antibody-complexation, can localize and optimize viral vector gene therapy."}

Measures of tray-reaching performance were obtained before the administration of nicotine and every other week for a total of 7 weeks.

Pyramidal cells in the forelimb area of both hemispheres were then examined for dendritic length and branching using a Golgi-Cox procedure. Animals treated with saline displayed excellent performance in both reaching tasks and an increase in neuronal branching in Layer V pyramidal cells in the motor cortex contralateral to the reaching paw. In contrast, animals treated with nicotine showed bilateral increases in neuronal branching. Behavioral results showed that nicotine improved forelimb use in the concurrently administered tray-reaching task, but severely degraded quantitative and qualitative scores of skilled forelimb use in the subsequently administered single-pellet reaching task.

The currently available therapies do not allow modification of disease progression. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been shown to exert potent neuroprotective effects by multiple pathways associated with the MJD mechanisms of disease. Thus, we evaluated NPY levels in MJD and investigated whether raising NPY by gene transfer would alleviate neuropathological and behavioural deficits in cerebellar and striatal mouse models of the disease. For that, a cerebellar transgenic and a striatal lentiviral-based models of MJD were used. NPY overexpression in the affected brain regions in these two mouse models was obtained by stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated viral vectors encoding NPY. Up to 8 weeks after viral injection, balance and motor coordination behaviour and neuropathology were analysed. We observed that NPY levels were decreased in two MJD patients' cerebella and in striata and cerebella of disease mouse models. Furthermore, overexpression of NPY alleviated the motor coordination impairments and attenuated the related neuropathological parameters, preserving cerebellar volume and granular layer thickness, reducing striatal lesion and decreasing mutant ataxin-3 aggregation. Additionally, NPY mediated increase of brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and decreased neuroinflammation markers. Our data suggest that NPY is a potential therapeutic strategy for MJD."}

Recent work also indicates that regulatory T cells are important in limiting proatherogenic T-cell responses. Given the important role of T cells in atherosclerosis, there is a need to fully understand how proatherogenic T cells are activated and regulated. Antigen-dependent activation of naïve T cells, leading to clonal expansion and effector T-cell differentiation, and effector and memory T cells, is enhanced by signals provided by costimulatory molecules expressed by antigen presenting cells, which bind to receptors on the T cells. In addition, T-cell responses to antigen are negatively regulated by coinhibitory molecules expressed by antigen-presenting cells, which bind to receptors on T cells. Two major families of costimulatory molecules include the B7 and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) families. These molecules bind to receptors on T cells belonging to the CD28 or TNF receptor families, respectively. The best-defined coinhibitors and their receptors belong to the B7 and CD28 families. Recent work has begun to define how these T-cell costimulatory and coinhibitory pathways influence atherosclerosis, largely in mouse models of the disease. Profound effects are attributable to molecules in both the B7/CD28 (B7-1/2, ICOS, and PDL-1/2) and the TNF/TNF receptor (CD40, OX40, and CD137) families. One emerging theme is that both pathogenic effector T-cell responses and regulatory T cells are influenced by overlapping sets of costimulators and coinhibitors.

Death of spinal motoneurons and corticospinal neurons is observed in the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Axotomy of adult rat corticospinal neurons at internal capsule levels induces half of them to die, and the surviving population displays severe atrophy. To examine the trophic effects of GDNF on corticospinal neurons, Fast Blue-labelled corticospinal neurons were stereotaxically axotomized at internal capsule levels and GDNF was infused intracortically to lesioned corticospinal neurons at total doses of 2, 4, 10, 20, 40, 100 and 300 microg for 7 days. GDNF prevented axotomy-induced death of corticospinal neurons at doses between 2 and 40 microg and abolished or attenuated their atrophy at all doses examined. In addition, treatment with 8 microg GDNF for the first 2 weeks after axotomy resulted in the long-term survival of corticospinal neurons for 42 days. With regard to the development of treatment strategies for upper motoneuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, application of GDNF via the cerebrospinal fluid may be more relevant than intracortical delivery as its diffusion within the brain parenchyma is limited. Intraventricular as well as intracisternal infusion of GDNF (300 microg over 7 days) completely prevented corticospinal neuron death. These results show that GDNF promotes the long-term survival of corticospinal neurons and has a positive effect on their size in vivo.

It is a poorly understood paradoxical immune reaction resulting in thrombin generation in vivo, which leads to a hypercoagulable state and the potential to initiate venous or arterial thrombosis. A number of factors are thought to influence the incidence of HIT including the type and preparation of heparin (unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)) and the heparin-exposed patient population, with the postoperative patient population presenting a higher risk.Although LMWH has largely replaced UFH as a front-line therapy, there is evidence supporting a lack of superiority of LMWH compared with UFH regarding prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following surgery, and similar frequencies of bleeding have been described with LMWH and UFH. The decision as to which of these two preparations of heparin to use may thus be influenced by adverse reactions such as HIT. We therefore sought to determine the relative impact of UFH and LMWH specifically on HIT in postoperative patients receiving thromboembolism prophylaxis.	The objective of this review was to compare the incidence of HIT and HIT complicated by thrombosis in patients exposed to UFH versus LMWH in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of postoperative heparin therapy.	The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their Specialised Register (March 2012) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 2). In addition, the authors searched LILACS (March 2012) and additional trials were sought from reference lists of relevant publications.	We were interested in comparing the incidence of HIT occurring during exposure to UFH or LMWH after any surgical intervention. Therefore, we studied RCTs in which participants were postoperative patients allocated to receive UFH or LMWH, in a blinded or unblinded fashion. Eligible studies were required to have as an outcome clinically diagnosed HIT, defined as a relative reduction in the platelet count of 50% or greater from the postoperative peak (even if the platelet count at its lowest remained > 150 x 10(9)/L) occurring within five to 14 days after the surgery, with or without a thrombotic event occurring in this timeframe. Additionally, circulating antibodies associated with the syndrome were required to have been investigated through laboratory assays.	Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with participation of a third author.	In total two studies involving 923 participants met all the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Pooled analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of HIT with LMWH compared with UFH (risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.82; P = 0.02). This result suggests that patients treated with LMWH would have a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 76% in the probability of developing HIT compared with patients treated with UFH.Venous thromboembolism (VTE) complicating HIT occurred in 12 of 17 patients who developed HIT. Pooled analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in HIT complicated by VTE with LMWH compared with UFH (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90; P = 0.04). This result indicates that patients using LMWH would have a RRR of 80% for developing HIT complicated by VTE compared with patients using UFH. Arterial thrombosis occurred in only one patient who received UFH and there were no amputations or deaths documented.	There was a lower incidence of HIT and HIT complicated by VTE in postoperative patients undergoing thromboprophylaxis with LMWH compared with UFH. This is consistent with the current clinical use of LMWH over UFH as front-line heparin therapy. However, conclusions are limited by a scarcity of high quality evidence. We did not expect the paucity of RCTs including HIT as an outcome as heparin is one of the most commonly used drugs worldwide and HIT is a life-threatening adverse drug reaction. To address the scarcity of clinically-relevant information on the topic of HIT as a whole, HIT should be included as an outcome in future RCTs of heparin, and HIT as an adverse drug reaction should be considered in clinical recommendations regarding monitoring of the platelet count for HIT."}

More recently, anti-H3R antagonists have entered early-phase clinical trials for possible application in obesity and a variety of neurologic disorders. The preferential expression of H4R by several immune cells and its involvement in the development of allergic inflammation provide the rationale for the use of anti-H4R antagonists in allergic and in other immune-related disorders."}

The expanded CAG repeats are translated into polyglutamine (polyQ), causing aberrant functions as well as aggregate formation of mutant Htt. Effective treatments for HD are yet to be developed.	Here, we report a novel dual-function compound, N(6)-(4-hydroxybenzyl)adenine riboside (designated T1-11) which activates the A(2A)R and a major adenosine transporter (ENT1). T1-11 was originally isolated from a Chinese medicinal herb. Molecular modeling analyses showed that T1-11 binds to the adenosine pockets of the A(2A)R and ENT1. Introduction of T1-11 into the striatum significantly enhanced the level of striatal adenosine as determined by a microdialysis technique, demonstrating that T1-11 inhibited adenosine uptake in vivo. A single intraperitoneal injection of T1-11 in wildtype mice, but not in A(2A)R knockout mice, increased cAMP level in the brain. Thus, T1-11 enters the brain and elevates cAMP via activation of the A(2A)R in vivo. Most importantly, addition of T1-11 (0.05 mg/ml) to the drinking water of a transgenic mouse model of HD (R6/2) ameliorated the progressive deterioration in motor coordination, reduced the formation of striatal Htt aggregates, elevated proteasome activity, and increased the level of an important neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor) in the brain. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of T1-11 for treating HD.	The dual functions of T1-11 enable T1-11 to effectively activate the adenosinergic system and subsequently delay the progression of HD. This is a novel therapeutic strategy for HD. Similar dual-function drugs aimed at a particular neurotransmitter system as proposed herein may be applicable to other neurotransmitter systems (e.g., the dopamine receptor/dopamine transporter and the serotonin receptor/serotonin transporter) and may facilitate the development of new drugs for other neurodegenerative diseases."}

In this study, we have used a clone of the AtT20 mouse pituitary cell line which expresses high levels of the amyloid beta precursor protein to characterize the glycosylation state of the secreted and membrane-bound forms of the protein and to examine the role of post-translational modifications in protein processing. Lectin blot analysis of immunoprecipitated amyloid beta precursor protein demonstrated that the soluble form of the protein contains significant amounts of sialic acid, with the lectin staining being reduced in the particulate cellular fractions. Treatment of the cells with mannosidase inhibitors to interfere with the formation of complex-type N-linked glycans resulted in a decrease in secreted amyloid beta precursor protein and an increase in the level of the cellular form of the protein. The increase in amyloid beta precursor protein levels in the cellular fraction was accompanied by an increase in perinuclear staining. Furthermore, cells overexpressing the alpha2,6(N)-sialyltransferase enzyme also demonstrated an increase in amyloid beta precursor protein secretion. These results suggest that the presence of terminal sialic acid residues on complex-type N-glycans may be required for the optimal transport of the amyloid beta precursor protein from the Golgi to the cell membrane with the subsequent cleavage to generate the secreted form of the protein."}

The hypothesis proposes that the deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) is the initial pathological event in AD, leading to the formation of extracellular senile plaques (SP), tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuronal loss, and ultimately, clinical dementia. Ever since the formulation of the ACH, however, there have been questions regarding whether it completely describes AD pathogenesis. This review critically examines various aspects of the ACH including its origin and development, the role of amyloid precursor protein (APP), whether SP and NFT are related to the development of clinical dementia, whether Aβ and tau are 'reactive' proteins, and whether there is a pathogenic relationship between SP and NFT. The results of transgenic experiments and treatments for AD designed on the basis of the ACH are also reviewed. It was concluded: (1) Aβ and tau could be the products rather than the cause of neurodegeneration in AD, (2) it is doubtful whether there is a direct causal link between Aβ and tau, and (3) SP and NFT may not be directly related to the development of dementia, (4) transgenic models involving APP alone do not completely replicate AD pathology, and (5) treatments based on the ACH have been unsuccessful. Hence, a modification of the ACH is proposed which may provide a more complete explanation of the pathogenesis of AD."}

A neuroprotective effect, beyond that related to the decrease in cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen, has been shown to be present in many in vitro and in vivo established experimental models of mild/moderate acute cerebral ischemia. Experimental studies on traumatic brain injury are limited and less encouraging. Despite the experimental results and the positive effects on cerebral physiology (propofol reduces cerebral blood flow but maintains coupling with cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen and decreases intracranial pressure, allowing optimal intraoperative conditions during neurosurgical operations), no clinical study has yet indicated that propofol may be superior to other anesthetics in improving the neurological outcome following acute cerebral injury. Therefore, propofol cannot be indicated as an established clinical neuroprotectant per se, but it might play an important role in the so-called multimodal neuroprotection, a global strategy for the treatment of acute injury of the brain that includes preservation of cerebral perfusion, temperature control, prevention of infections, and tight glycemic control."}

The glial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is expressed in astrocytes, and along with the inwardly-rectifying K(+) channel K(ir)4.1 is thought to underlie the reuptake of H(2)O and K(+) into glial cells during neural activity. Previous studies have demonstrated increased seizure duration and slowed potassium kinetics in AQP4(-/-) mice, and redistribution of AQP4 in hippocampal specimens from patients with chronic epilepsy. However, the regulation and role of AQP4 during epileptogenesis remain to be defined. In this study, we examined the expression of AQP4 and other glial molecules (GFAP, K(ir)4.1, glutamine synthetase) in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) model of epilepsy and compared behavioral and histologic outcomes in wild-type mice vs. AQP4(-/-) mice. Marked and prolonged reduction in AQP4 immunoreactivity on both astrocytic fine processes and endfeet was observed following KA status epilepticus in multiple hippocampal layers. In addition, AQP4(-/-) mice had more spontaneous recurrent seizures than wild-type mice during the first week after KA SE as assessed by chronic video-EEG monitoring and blinded EEG analysis. While both genotypes exhibited similar reactive astrocytic changes, granule cell dispersion and CA1 pyramidal neuron loss, there were an increased number of fluorojade-positive cells early after KA SE in AQP4(-/-) mice. These results indicate a marked reduction of AQP4 following KA SE and suggest that dysregulation of water and potassium homeostasis occurs during early epileptogenesis. Restoration of astrocytic water and ion homeostasis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy."}

In humans, its most important side effect is peripheral polyneuropathy, the frequency of which is dose related. To evaluate this effect, we administered benznidazole to adult, male, mongrel dogs at doses ranging from 5 to 40 mg/kg/day (0.5 to 4 times the dose used to treat chagasic patients). Subsequent neurological examination revealed apathy, ataxia, spastic tetraplegia with hyperreflexia of stretching reflexes, balance disorders and asymmetrical gait. These alterations appeared earlier and were more intense at the higher doses. Drug withdrawal also left dose- and time-dependent sequelae like ataxia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia and alterations of balance. No peripheral neuropathy was detected.

Modulating endocannabinoid function, as a plasticity based therapeutic strategy, in the above pathologies with particular focus on cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 receptor) antagonists/inverse agonists, is discussed. On the basis of the existing literature and of new experimental evidence presented here, CB1 receptor antagonists might be beneficial in disease states associated with hedonic dysregulation, and with cognitive dysfunction in particular in the context of psychosis.

We tested the hypothesis that phrenic and hypoglossal (XII) LTF are diminished in acyclic geriatric rats when fluctuating sex hormone levels no longer establish conditions that enhance LTF. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) enhances LTF (41); thus we further predicted that CIH would restore LTF in geriatric female rats. LTF was measured in young (3-4 mo) and geriatric (20-22 mo) female Sasco Sprague-Dawley rats and in a group of geriatric rats exposed to 1 wk of nocturnal CIH (11 vs. 21% O2 at 5-min intervals, 12 h/night).

LTF in geriatric female rats was smaller than previously reported for middle-aged rats but comparable to that in young female rats. CIH augmented phrenic and XII LTF to levels similar to those of middle-aged female rats without CIH (P < 0.05).

The antibody routinely used to label A(2A)Rs failed to detect A(2A)R-positive neurons in the GPi and SNr, however, in situ hybridization showed that A(2A)R mRNA transcripts were indeed present in both these nuclei. Surprisingly, by labeling pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic projection neurons originating in the GPi and SNr with the neuronal retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB), the receptor protein was unmasked and detectable using the antibody. This unmasking of the protein was specific to CTB and not an artifact of the tracer.

Previous evidence obtained in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS showed that the triplicated gene APP (amyloid precursor protein) is critically involved in neurogenesis alterations. In particular, excessive levels of AICD (amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain) resulting from APP cleavage by gamma-secretase increase the transcription of Ptch1, a Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) receptor that keeps the mitogenic Shh pathway repressed. Previous evidence showed that neonatal treatment with ELND006, an inhibitor of gamma-secretase, reinstates the Shh pathway and fully restores neurogenesis in Ts65Dn pups. In the framework of potential therapies for DS, it is extremely important to establish whether the positive effects of early intervention are retained after treatment cessation. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to establish whether early treatment with ELND006 leaves an enduring trace in the brain of Ts65Dn mice. Ts65Dn and euploid pups were treated with ELND006 in the postnatal period P3-P15 and the outcome of treatment was examined at ~one month after treatment cessation. We found that in treated Ts65Dn mice the pool of proliferating cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and total number of granule neurons were still restored as was the number of pre- and postsynaptic terminals in the stratum lucidum of CA3, the site of termination of the mossy fibers from the DG. Accordingly, patch-clamp recording from field CA3 showed functional normalization of the input to CA3. Unlike in field CA3, the number of pre- and postsynaptic terminals in the DG of treated Ts65Dn mice was no longer fully restored.

Thereafter mice were monitored for relapse of parasitemia after which they were treated with melarsoprol at a dosage of 3.6mg/kg body weight for 4days and sacrificed 24h post the last dosage to obtain brain samples. Brain sections from mice with PTRE that did not receive any antioxidant treatment showed a more marked presence of inflammatory cells, microglial activation and disruption of the brain parenchyma when compared to PTRE mice supplemented with either coenzyme-Q10, purple tea anthocyanins or a combination of the two. The mice group that was treated with coenzyme-Q10 or purple tea anthocyanins had higher levels of GSH and aconitase-1 in the brain compared to untreated groups, implying a boost in brain antioxidant capacity.

We have shown that EPO is able to induce an increased synaptic efficacy in vivo along with a plasticity promoting effect. In the Morris water maze EPO administration to fimbria-fornix lesioned male rats induces a significant improvement of their spatial memory, affected by the lesion. Singularly, EPO was only effective when administered shortly after training (10 min) but not after several hours (5 h), suggesting a specific EPO effect on time dependent plasticity process. In the present paper we have expanded this line of evidence using a low stress paradigm of object placement recognition in lesioned and healthy male rats. The memory trace in this model is short-lasting; animals could recognize the change in object position when tested 24 h after, but not 48 or 72 h after the acquisition session.

Inhibition of PARP by specific inhibitors is known to prevent the development of STZ induced diabetic nephropathy by reduction in oxidative stress induced apoptosis. This study shows for the first time the role of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitors as an alternative approach for inhibition of PARP. Gallotannin (20 mg/kg/day, i.p.) treatment for 4 weeks led to a significant reduction in the levels of plasma creatinine which is a well known marker for diabetic nephropathy. Treatment with gallotannin resulted in protection up to a certain level of glomerular damage, suggesting compensatory glomerular hypertrophy. As a PARG inhibitor gallotannin treatment also showed protection in PARP cleavage which is a hallmark for apoptotic cell death signifying the protective role of gallotannin in cell death signaling."}

Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP^\nDNA methyltransferase expressions in Japanese rice fish (Oryzias latipes) embryogenesis is developmentally regulated and modulated by ethanol and 5-azacytidine.^\nWe aimed to investigate the impact of the epigenome in inducting fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes in Japanese rice fish embryogenesis. One of the significant events in epigenome is DNA methylation which is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. We analyzed DNMT enzyme mRNA expressions in Japanese rice fish development starting from fertilized eggs to hatching and also in embryos exposed for first 48h of development either to ethanol (300mM) or to 5-azacytidine (5-azaC; 2mM), an inhibitor of DNMT enzyme activity. As observed in FASD phenotypes, 5-azaC exposure was able to induce microcephaly and craniofacial cartilage deformities in Japanese rice fish. Moreover, we have observed that expression of DNMTs (dnmt1, dnmt3aa, and dnmt3bb.1) are developmentally regulated; high mRNA copies were found in early stages (1-2day-post-fertilization, dpf), followed by gradual reduction until hatched. In ethanol-treated embryos, compared to controls, dnmt1 mRNA is in reduced level in 2dpf and in enhanced level in 6dpf embryos. While dnmt3aa and 3bb.1 remained unaltered. In contrast, embryos exposed to 5-azaC have an enhanced level of dnmt1 and dnmt3bb.1 mRNAs both in 2 and 6dpf embryos while dnmt3aa is enhanced only in 6dpf embryos. Moreover, endocannabinoid receptor 1a (cnr1a) mRNA which was found to be reduced by ethanol remained unaltered and cnr1b and cnr2 mRNAs, which were remained unaltered by ethanol, were increased significantly by 5-azaC in 6dpf embryos. This study indicates that the craniofacial defects observed in FASD phenotypes are the results of dysregulations in DNMT expressions."}

To reduce the risk of NTD, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandated that all enriched cereal grain products be fortified with folic acid as of January 1998. Recent data demonstrate that this public health action is associated with increased folate blood levels among U.S. women of childbearing age and that the national rate of spina bifida has decreased by 20%. Rates of anencephaly appear not to have declined. Epidemiologic data on use of folate and folate antagonists have also implicated folic acid in prevention of other birth defects such as facial clefts and cardiac and limb defects. Dietary folic acid is likely to be inadequate for maximal protection against NTD. Because about half of pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned, according to the March of Dimes, birth defect prevention includes a recommended daily dose of 400 micro g synthetic folic acid for women of childbearing age. Uniform compliance is estimated to decrease the incidence of NTD by up to 70%. This could reduce the overall incidence from 2 to 0.6 per 1000 pregnancies and prevent disease in approximately 2000 babies per year in the U.S. Four thousand micrograms of folic acid per day is recommended for women with previous pregnancies affected by NTD."}

PGZ-loaded NPs were developed by the solvent displacement method. Parameters such as mean size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, encapsulation efficacy, rheological behavior, and short-term stability were evaluated. Ex vivo permeation studies were then carried out using buccal, sublingual, nasal, and intestinal mucosa. PGZ-NPs with a size around of 160 nm showed high permeability in all mucosae. However, the permeation and prediction parameters revealed that lag-time and vehicle/tissue partition coefficient of nasal mucosa were significantly lower than other studied mucosae, while the diffusion coefficient and theoretical steady-state plasma concentration of the drug were higher, providing biopharmaceutical results that reveal more favorable PGZ permeation through the nasal mucosa. The results suggest that nasal mucosa represents an attractive and non-invasive pathway for PGZ-NPs administration to the brain since the drug permeation was demonstrated to be more favorable in this tissue."}

Both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms have been implicated, with the latter including apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). The peptidyl-proplyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (CypA) transports AIF from the cytosol to the nucleus, a key step for AIF-dependent cell death. We compared the effects of single versus combined inhibition of caspase and AIF pathways in a mouse controlled cortical impact (CCI) model, by examining the effects of CypA gene knockout (CypA(-/-)), caspase inhibition with a pan-caspase inhibitor (boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethylketone, BAF), or combined modulation. TBI caused caspase activation as well as translocation of AIF to the nucleus. Markers of caspase activation including caspase-specific fodrin cleavage fragments and number of FLIVO-positive cells were reduced in BAF-treated CypA(+/+) mice, whereas markers of AIF activation including AIF/H2AX interaction and AIF translocation to the nucleus were attenuated in CypA(-/-) mice. Each single intervention, (CypA(-/-) or BAF-treated CypA(+/+)) reduced the number of apoptotic cells (TUNEL-positive) in the cortex and improved long-term sensorimotor function; CypA(-/-) also attenuated microglial activation after injury. Importantly, BAF-treated CypA(-/-) mice, showed greater effects than either intervention alone on multiple outcomes including: reduction in TUNEL-positive cells, decrease in neuroinflammation, improved motor and cognitive recovery, and attenuation of lesion volume and neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Using two in vitro neuronal cell death models known to induce AIF-mediated PCD, we also showed that neurons from CypA(-/-) animals were protected and that effects were unrelated to caspase activation. These data indicate that AIF-mediated and caspase-dependent pathways contribute independently and in parallel to secondary injury after TBI, and suggest that combined therapeutic strategies directed at multiple PCD pathways may provide superior neuroprotection than those directed at single mechanisms."}

Here, we investigated the effects of PYC on CA3-CA1 synaptic function following CCI. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats received an ipsilateral CCI injury followed 15 min later by intravenous injection of saline vehicle or PYC (10 mg/kg). Hippocampal slices from the injured (ipsilateral) and uninjured (contralateral) hemispheres were prepared at seven and fourteen days post-CCI for electrophysiological analyses of CA3-CA1 synaptic function and induction of long-term depression (LTD). Basal synaptic strength was impaired in slices from the ipsilateral, relative to the contralateral, hemisphere at seven days post-CCI and susceptibility to LTD was enhanced in the ipsilateral hemisphere at both post-injury timepoints. No interhemispheric differences in basal synaptic strength or LTD induction were observed in rats treated with PYC. The results show that PYC preserves synaptic function after CCI and provides further rationale for investigating the use of PYC as a therapeutic in humans suffering from neurotrauma."}

Medium supplemented with FGF + PEDF enhanced the RSC yield and more interestingly allowed expansion of the culture by increasing secondary retinal neurospheres after the 1st passage. This effect was accompanied by cell proliferation as revealed by BrdU incorporation. PEDF usage did not affect rod-like differentiation potential.

Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were conducted to examine the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine, and BDNF. The rats in the ADHD group showed hyperactivity and spatial learning memory deficit. Reduction of TH in the striatum and substantia nigra and BDNF in the hippocampus was observed of the rats in the ADHD group. Treadmill exercise and MPH alleviated the ADHD-induced hyperactivity and spatial learning memory impairment.

In the present study we explored: (1) the effect of the PPAR-gamma agonist pioglitazone on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS activity and nitric oxide (NO) generation by microglia; (2) the differential role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) on LPS-induced NO generation; and (3) the regulation of p38 MAPK, JNK, and PI3K by pioglitazone.	Mesencephalic neuron-microglia mixed cultures, and microglia-enriched cultures were treated with pioglitazone and/or LPS. The protein levels of iNOS, p38 MAPK, JNK, PPAR-gamma, PI3K, and protein kinase B (Akt) were measured by western blot. Different specific inhibitors of iNOS, p38MAPK, JNK, PI3K, and Akt were used in our experiment, and NO generation was measured using a nitrite oxide assay kit. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons were counted in mesencephalic neuron-microglia mixed cultures.	Our results showed that pioglitazone inhibits LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO generation, and inhibition of iNOS is sufficient to protect dopaminergic neurons against LPS insult. In addition, inhibition of p38 MAPK, but not JNK, prevented LPS-induced NO generation. Further, and of interest, pioglitazone inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Wortmannin, a specific PI3K inhibitor, enhanced p38 MAPK phosphorylation upon LPS stimulation of microglia. Elevations of phosphorylated PPAR-gamma, PI3K, and Akt levels were observed with pioglitazone treatment, and inhibition of PI3K activity enhanced LPS-induced NO production. Furthermore, wortmannin prevented the inhibitory effect of pioglitazone on the LPS-induced NO increase.	We demonstrate that pioglitazone protects dopaminergic neurons against LPS insult at least via inhibiting iNOS expression and NO generation, which is potentially mediated via inhibition of p38 MAPK activity. In addition, the PI3K pathway actively participates in the negative regulation of LPS-induced NO production. Our findings suggest that PPAR-gamma activation may involve differential regulation of p38 MAPK and of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the regulation of the inflammatory process."}

Several pathogenetic factors have been involved in the onset and progression of PD, including inflammation, oxidative stress, unfolded protein accumulation, and apoptosis. Ample evidence indicates that miRNAs could regulate post-transcriptional gene expression and neuronal disease. In this study, we evaluated the effects and mechanism of miR-124-3p on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and SH-SY5Y cells. qRT-PCR results showed that the level of miR-124-3p was downregulated in 6-OHDA-treated PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells, and overexpression of miR-124-3p significantly promoted the cell viability of 6-OHDA-treated PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells, whereas miR-124-3p inhibitor reversed these effects. In addition, PC12 or SH-SY5Y cells were treated with miR-124-3p mimics or inhibitors following 6-OHDA administration, which mediated cell apoptosis and downregulation or upregulation of Caspase-3 activity, respectively.

Accordingly, embryonic and germline, as well as some adult stem cells, produce the telomerase enzyme at various levels of expression. Our results show that, while muscle is a largely postmitotic tissue, the muscle stem cells (satellite cells) that maintain this biological system throughout adult life do indeed display robust telomerase activity. Conversely, primary myoblasts (the immediate progeny of satellite cells) quickly and dramatically downregulate telomerase activity. This work thus suggests that satellite cells, and early transient myoblasts, may be more promising therapeutic candidates for regenerative medicine than traditionally utilized myoblast cultures. Muscle atrophy accompanies human aging, and satellite cells endogenous to aged muscle can be triggered to regenerate old tissue by exogenous molecular cues. Therefore, we also examined whether these aged muscle stem cells would produce tissue that is 'young' with respect to telomere maintenance. Interestingly, this work shows that the telomerase activity in muscle stem cells is largely retained into old age wintin inbred 'long' telomere mice and in wild-derived short telomere mouse strains, and that age-specific telomere shortening is undetectable in the old differentiated muscle fibers of either strain. Summarily, this work establishes that young and old muscle stem cells, but not necessarily their progeny, myoblasts, are likely to produce tissue with normal telomere maintenance when used in molecular and regenerative medicine approaches for tissue repair."}

However, it remains elusive which biological processes and biomolecules involved in the pathophysiologic processes of AD would constitute good targets for multitargeted therapy. This study proposes that a co-module, consisting of biological processes, cellular pathways and nodes, in a molecular subnetwork perturbed by different therapeutic drugs may be the optimal therapeutic target for an AD multitarget-based intervention. Based on this hypothesis, genes regulated in the hippocampus and cortex of senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) mice by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions with different constituents and the same beneficial effects on AD, including the decoctions Liu-Wei-Di-Huang (LW), Ba-Wei-Di-Huang (BW), Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS), Huang-Lian-Jie-Du (HL) and Tiao-Xin-Fang (TXF), were investigated via cDNA microarray, and the perturbed subnetworks were constructed and interpreted. After comparing 15 perturbed subnetworks based on genes affected by LW, BW, HL, DSS and TXF, the results showed that the most important common nodes perturbed by these interventions in the brains of SAMP8 mice were RPS6KA1 and FHIT, and that other important common nodes included UBE2D2, STUB1 and AMFR. These five drugs simultaneously and significantly disturbed the regulation of apoptosis and protein ubiquitination among biological processes. These nodes and processes were key components of the co-module regulated by therapeutic drugs in a molecular subnetwork of AD.

These projections terminate in cortical areas that are continuously influenced by released neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Among the subcortical structures, the dopaminergic midbrain plays a pivotal role in tuning cortical functions that commonly result altered in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Incidentally, extensive neuropathological observations support a strong link between structural alterations of the dopaminergic midbrain and significant behavioural symptomatology observed in patients suffering from Alzheimer 's disease(AD). Here, we will review recent progress on the involvement of the dopaminergic system in the pathophysiology of AD as well as the current therapeutic strategies targeting this system."}

However, these approaches do not address the underlying causes of balance decline. Using mice, the impact of near infrared light (NIr) on the metabolism of cells in the vestibular sensory epithelium was assessed. Data collected shows that this simple and safe intervention may protect these vulnerable cells from the deleterious effects of natural aging. mRNA was extracted from the isolated peripheral vestibular sensory epithelium (crista ampullaris and utricular macula) and subsequently transcribed into a cDNA library. This library was then probed for the expression of ubiquitous antioxidant (SOD-1). Antioxidant gene expression was then used to quantify cellular metabolism. Using transcranial delivery of NIr in young (4 weeks) and older (8-9 months) mice, and a brief treatment regime (90 sec/day for 5 days), this work suggests NIr alone may be sufficient to improve mitochondrial function in the vestibular sensory epithelium. Since there are currently no available, affordable, non-invasive methods of therapy to improve vestibular hair cell function, the application of external NIr radiation provides a potential strategy to counteract the impact of aging on cellular metabolism inthe vestibular sensory epithelium."}

Molecular brain research^\nExpression of calbindin-D28k in C6 glial cells stabilizes intracellular calcium levels and protects against apoptosis induced by calcium ionophore and amyloid beta-peptide.^\nThe calcium binding protein, calbindin-D28k is normally present in neurons. Recently we reported that brain injury and tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) induce calbindin-D28k in astrocytes. TNF-treated calbindin expressing astrocytes were resistant to acidosis and calcium ionophore toxicity, suggesting that calbindin may have a cytoprotective role in astrocytes in the injured brain (M.P. Mattson, B. Cheng, S.A. Baldwin, V.L. Smith-Swintosky, J. Keller, J. Geddes, Scheff, J.W., Christakos, S., Brain injury and tumor necrosis factors induce calbindin-D28k in astrocytes: evidence for a cytoprotective response, J. Neurosci. Res., 42 (1995) 257). In order to obtain direct evidence for a role of calbindin, using the eukaryotic expression vector pREP4, rat calbindin-D28k was stably expressed in C6 rat astocytoma glial cells. Cytotoxicity in response to calcium ionophore or amyloid beta-peptide (which accumulates in the brain in Alzheimer's disease and has been reported to be neurotoxic) was measured by MTT reduction in vector transfected cells and in calbindin transfected clones. Stably expressed calbindin resulted in increased cell survival in the presence of calcium ionophore (1-10 microM) or amyloid beta-peptide (10-100 microM). In addition, the calcium ionophore or amyloid beta-peptide mediated rise in intracellular calcium in vector transfected cells was significantly attenuated in calbindin expressing cells. Apoptotic cell death was detected by the Hoechst method in vector transfected C6 glial cells treated with calcium ionophore or beta-amyloid (34-36% apoptotic cells/culture). The number of apoptotic nuclei was significantly attenuated in similarly treated calbindin-D28k transfected clones (10-13% apoptotic cells/culture; p<0.01). Our results support the involvement of calcium fluxes in apoptosis and suggest that calbindin-D28k, by buffering calcium, can suppress death in apoptosis susceptible cells in the central nervous system."}

However, the mechanisms responsible for these individual differences remain poorly understood. We tested whether a prior experience of exercise training affects the responses of skeletal muscles to unloading. Young rats were assigned to perform daily running training with a treadmill for 8 wk. After an additional 8 wk of normal habitation, the rats were hindlimb unloaded by tail suspension for 1 wk. Fast-twitch plantaris, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles did not atrophy after unloading in rats with training experience, although soleus muscle lost weight similar to sedentary rats. We also analyzed the transcriptome in plantaris muscle with RNA sequencing followed by hierarchical clustering analysis and found that a subset of genes that were generally upregulated in sedentary rats after unloading were less responsive in rats with training experience. The distribution of histone 3 was diminished at the loci of these genes during the training period. Although the deposition of histone 3 was restored after an additional period of normal habitation, the incorporation of H3.3 variant was promoted in rats with training experience. This remodeling of nucleosomes closely correlated to the conformational changes of chromatin and suppressed gene expression in response to unloading. These results suggest that exercise training stimulated the early turnover of histone components, which may alter the responsiveness of gene transcription to physiological stimuli.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present study demonstrates that disuse atrophy was suppressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscles of rats with training experience in early life. We also found a subset of genes that were less responsive to unloading in the muscle of rats with training experience. It was further determined that exercise training caused an early turnover of nucleosome components, which may alter the responsiveness of genes to stimulus in later life."}

Particularly, in fulminant type 1 diabetes, rapid β-cell destruction is suggested to be triggered by viral infection. Recently, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have been reported to have direct beneficial effects on β-cells, such as anti-apoptotic effect, increasing β-cell mass, and improvement of β-cell function. However, their effects on β-cell destruction induced by viral infections have not been elucidated. In this study, we used an encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-induced diabetic model mouse to show that a GLP-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4, prevents β-cell destruction. Nine-week-old male DBA/2 mice were intraperitoneally injected with EMCV (200 plaque forming units (PFU)mouse(-1)). Low (20 nmolkg(-1)d(-1)) or high (40 nmolkg(-1)d(-1)) doses of exendin-4 were administered for 10d, starting from 2d before the infection, and the rate of diabetic onset was evaluated. In addition, the number of infiltrating macrophage per islet and the ratio of β-cell area to islet area were determined. The effects of exendin-4 on infected β-cells and macrophages were investigated by using MIN6 and RAW264 mouse macrophages. The incidence of diabetes was significantly lower in the high-dose exendin-4-treated group than in the control group. Furthermore, the β-cell area was significantly more preserved in the high-dose exendin-4-treated group than in the control. In addition, the number of macrophages infiltrating into the islets was significantly less in the high-dose exendin-4-treated group than in the control group. In vitro, exendin-4 reduced β-cell apoptosis, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin β (IL-β), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) production of infected or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages.

Implicit tasks which assess semantic priming effects are often used to understand semantic deficits in Alzheimer's disease, but they have led to unclear conclusions because of methodological problems such as intervention of attentional mechanisms. To explore the effects of semantic priming in Alzheimer's disease and their relationship with semantic memory deficits, we used two tasks, one implicit and the other explicit. The implicit task was a lexical decision task to assess semantic priming, and in which pairs of words had coordinate (tiger-lion) or attribute relationships (zebra-stripe). The explicit task was a semantic knowledge task composed of namings and questions involving superordinate categories and attribute knowledge of concepts. The two tasks systematically assessed the integrity of the same concepts. This protocol was given to 53 Alzheimer's disease patients with mild to moderate dementia and to 20 controls. The Alzheimer's disease group as a whole obtained significantly greater priming effects (hyperpriming) than controls in the coordinate condition, and equivalent priming in the attribute condition. In the coordinate condition, a subgroup of 26 patients, with attribute knowledge deficits, had larger priming effects than both a subgroup without semantic deficits and the control group. These results show that in Alzheimer's disease the semantic priming effects vary according to the degree of attribute loss, and the presence of hyperpriming would reflect semantic memory deficits. This study unravels the fine-grained structure of semantic memory disturbances in Alzheimer's disease with mild to moderate dementia, affecting initially the attributes of concepts within a hierarchical network in which superordinate concepts remain preserved."}

In this study we hypothesized that, prior to hypoxia, intravenously administered nicotine might have an effect on how newborn piglets tolerate hypoxia, with regard to the time and degree of damage inflicted, due to its suggested neuroprotective abilities, and further that resuscitation with 21 compared with 100% oxygen in nicotine-pretreated animals would cause less cerebral damage.	Thirty anesthetized newborn piglets were randomized to either hypoxia or control groups, and pretreatment with either saline or nicotine. In addition, the nicotine/hypoxia group was randomized to resuscitation with either 21 or 100% oxygen for 15 min following hypoxia.	We found significantly more necrosis in the striatum and cortex combined (p = 0.036), and in the striatum alone (p = 0.026), in the animals pretreated with nicotine and resuscitated with 100% when compared to 21% oxygen. There was no significant difference in the cerebellum.

In the present study, we proposed that the level of beta 2AR expression on anti-CD3 mAb-activated CD4+ effector Th cells may differ from the level on resting cells, and that a change in receptor expression may alter the functional responsiveness of these cells to either the beta 2AR-selective ligand terbutaline or the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Following anti-CD3 activation, the beta 2AR was expressed on Th1 cells, but not Th2 cells. The number of binding sites on Th1 cells was maintained, with no change in affinity, over a 24-h activation period. When Th clones were exposed to terbutaline following anti-CD3 activation, Th1 cell, but not Th2 cell, cytokine production was modulated. IL-2 production by Th1 cells was decreased, while IFN-gamma production was not significantly altered. The decrease in IL-2 production was concentration dependent and was blocked by an antagonist. In comparison with control supernatants, the lower level of IL-2 present in terbutaline-exposed culture supernatants supported the proliferation of an IL-2-dependent Th1 clone to a lesser degree. Additionally, norepinephrine down-modulates IL-2, but not IFN-gamma, production by binding specifically to the beta-adrenergic receptor. Thus, a detectable level of the beta 2AR is expressed on activated Th1 cells, but not activated Th2 cells, thereby providing a mechanism by which IL-2 production is preferentially modulated by an endogenous and therapeutic ligand following Th1 cell activation."}

A total of 70 and 43% of rats developed ICTs 37-45 weeks after the treatment with STZ (50 or 75mg/kg, i.v.) and NA (350mg/kg, twice, p.o.), respectively. Among the islet tumors observed in the STZ/NA-treated groups, 75% were adenomas, while 25% were carcinomas. Most STZ/NA-induced carcinomas were characterized by well-differentiated tumor cells with/without local invasion into the surrounding tissues, and weak proliferative activity. No outcome such as distance metastasis and death was noted. All of the ICTs strongly expressed insulin, part of which had hormone productivity; however there were no hypoglycemia-related clinical signs such as convulsion in these rats 36 weeks after the treatment. These results suggested that rat ICTs induced STZ/NA have small impact on biological activity or prognosis.

Thus, better knowledge and specific targeting of the pathways that lead to these noxious species may result in valuable therapeutic strategies. We characterized some effects of the molecular chaperone clusterin, providing new and more detailed evidence of its potential neuroprotective effects. Using a classical thioflavin T assay, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of the aggregation process. The global analysis of time courses under different conditions demonstrated that clusterin has no effect on the elongation rate but mainly interferes with the nucleation processes (both primary and secondary), reducing the number of nuclei available for further fibril growth. Then, using a recently developed immunoassay based on surface plasmon resonance, we obtained direct evidence of a high-affinity (KD= 1 nm) interaction of clusterin with biologically relevant Aβ1-42oligomers, selectively captured on the sensor chip. Moreover, with the same technology, we observed that substoichiometric concentrations of clusterin prevent oligomer interaction with the antibody 4G8, suggesting that the chaperone shields hydrophobic residues exposed on the oligomeric assemblies.

However, the mechanism(s) of the biphasic action of 2-ME2 has been elusive. Here we describe a regulatory role of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in the biphasic effects on estrogen receptor (ER)+ GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells and MCF-7 human breast tumor cells depending on the dosage of 2-ME2 used. We observed that acute exposure to 2-ME2, irrespective of dosage, did not alter cellular proliferation, but enhanced the VEGF-A mRNA level. As the treatment duration increased, biphasic effect was elicited. A concentration of 1 microM 2-ME2 increased both cell proliferation and VEGF-A levels in these cells, whereas higher doses exhibited reversed impact. A low dose of 2-ME2 also increased the VEGF-A mRNA expression in ER-alpha-transfected human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). The effect was reversed in ER- cells. The enhanced expression of VEGF-A mRNA could be blocked by the pure estrogen antagonist, ICI 182,780, and reveal that the upregulation of VEGF-A expression by 2-ME2 is mediated through ER-alpha. Furthermore, the biphasic effect of 2-ME2 on cell proliferation can be modulated by administrating VEGF-A antibodies or VEGF-A proteins. Studies also demonstrate that the VEGF-A protein, induced by 2-ME2, is functionally active and upregulates the proliferation of adjacent endothelial cells."}

The effect of Hyp was thus evaluated on an animal model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a classic, Th1-mediated autoimmune disease of the CNS, and we observed that Hyp attenuates the severity of the disease symptoms significantly. Together, these properties qualify Hyp as a putative, therapeutic molecule for the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory disease sustained by Th1 cells, including EAE."}

No therapeutic strategy exists to minimize white matter injury in survivors with IVH. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) enhances myelination, astrogliosis, and neurologic recovery in animal models of white matter injury. Here, we hypothesized that recombinant human (rh) EGF treatment would enhance oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) maturation, myelination, and neurological recovery in preterm rabbits with IVH. In addition, rhEGF would promote astrogliosis by inducing astroglial progenitor proliferation and GFAP transcription. We tested these hypotheses in a preterm rabbit model of IVH and evaluated autopsy samples from human preterm infants. We found that EGF and EGFR expression were more abundant in the ganglionic eminence relative to the cortical plate and white matter of human infants and that the development of IVH reduced EGF levels, but not EGFR expression. Accordingly, rhEGF treatment promoted proliferation and maturation of OPCs, preserved myelin in the white matter, and enhanced neurological recovery in rabbits with IVH. rhEGF treatment inhibited Notch signaling, which conceivably contributed to OPC maturation. rhEGF treatment contributed to astrogliosis by increasing astroglial proliferation and upregulating GFAP as well as Sox9 expression. Hence, IVH results in a decline in EGF expression; and rhEGF treatment preserves myelin, restores neurological recovery, and exacerbates astrogliosis by inducing proliferation of astrocytes and enhancing transcription of GFAP and Sox9 in pups with IVH. rhEGF treatment might improve the neurological outcome of premature infants with IVH.

In this study, we developed a tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-targeted dendrimer conjugated with catechol and poly(ethylene glycol) groups for the targeted delivery of bortezomib to metastatic bone tumors. Bortezomib was loaded on the dendrimer via a boronate-catechol linkage with pH-responsive property, which plays an essential role in the control of bortezomib loading and release. The nontargeted bortezomib nanomedicine showed minimal cytotoxicity at pH 7.4, but significantly increased anticancer activity when cyclic RGD (cRGD) moieties were anchored on the dendrimer surface. The ligand cRGD enabled efficient internalization of the bortezomib complex by breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 cells. The targeted nanomedicine efficiently depressed the progression of metastatic bone tumors and significantly inhibited the tumor-associated osteolysis in a model of bone tumors. This study provided an insight into the development of nanomedicine for metastatic bone tumors."}

This led to complete clearance of disease-specific HS and reduction of secondary lysosomal defects and neuropathology across various brain regions lasting for at least 28 days after the last dose.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a major pathogen in immunocompromised individuals and may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in the general population. We evaluated whether CMV-infection alters the function of arterial smooth muscle. 2. Blood pressure (BP) and arterial reactivity were recorded in immunosuppressed rats that had been infected with CMV (10(5) plaque forming units i.p.). Furthermore, the reactivity of isolated arteries was compared between CMV-infected rats and rats injected with bacterial endotoxin (LPS). 3. Initially resting BP and heart rate (HR) were not modified in CMV-infected rats, but baroreflex control of HR was impaired. By the eighth day post-CMV, BP dropped precipitously and could no longer be raised by phenylephrine (PHE). 4. In mesenteric resistance arteries, isolated at this stage from CMV-infected rats, contractile responses to nerve stimulation, noradrenaline, PHE and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were virtually absent while those to high potassium and vasopressin (AVP) were not modified. In aortae of CMV-infected rats, responses to 5-HT and AVP were impaired while those to PHE or potassium were hardly affected. Reduced contractile responses could not be restored by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). 5. Continuous treatment of CMV-infected rats with prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 day-1) prevented blood pressure lowering and resistance artery changes. 6. Observations in arteries of LPS-treated rats (5-10 mg kg-1, i.p.) differed markedly from those in vessels of CMV-infected animals. The contractile reactivity of their mesenteric resistance arteries was not altered while in their aortae, responses to PHE, 5-HT and AVP were reduced. With the exception of the AVP responses, this was more pronounced in the presence of 1-arginine and reversed by L-NAME. 7. These findings indicate that CMV-infection results in a reduction of resistance artery reactivity and hypotonia. This seems not to involve cytokine-mediated induction of NO synthase in the vascular wall but may be due to alterations of excitation-contraction coupling in arterial smooth muscle in response to increased sympathetic nervous input."}

In rodents, symptoms comprise locomotor and motor activity (LMA), myoclonia, and, at pressure greater than 9-10 MPa, convulsions and tonic-clonic seizures. We studied the behavioral effects of bilateral injection of the glutamate uptake inhibitor L-trans-pyrollidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (L-trans-PDC), in either the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr), the globus pallidus (GP), or the striatum on high helium pressure-induced LMA and myoclonia. Injection of L-trans-PDC in the GP and the SNr attenuated LMA, whereas injection in the striatum enhanced it. Alternatively, injection of L-trans-PDC in the SNr increased myoclonia, whereas injection in the GP or the striatum showed no effects on myoclonia. These results confirm that helium pressure-induced LMA and myoclonia have different neural origins. According to current thinking on basal ganglia function and previous data, it is suggested that high helium pressure would lead to a reduction of glutamate transmission in the SNr that could contribute to a reduction in activity of the nigrothalamic GABA pathway and then to the occurrence of LMA. It is further suggested that glutamate and DA transmissions in the striatum could have synergistic, rather than antagonistic, influences on motor activity."}

Since ischemia-reperfusion brain injury is associated with large increases in the concentrations of reactive aldehydes in the penumbra area, we investigated if the hydrazine function of phenelzine was capable of sequestering reactive aldehydes. Both aminoaldehydes and acrolein are generated from the metabolism of polyamines to putrescine by polyamine oxidase. These toxic aldehydes in turn compromise mitochondrial and lysosomal integrity and initiate apoptosis and necrosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that pharmacological neutralization of reactive aldehydes via the formation of thioacetal derivatives results in significant neuroprotection in ischemia-reperfusion injury, in both focal and global ischemia models. In our studies of acrolein and 3-aminopropanal toxicity, using an immortalized retinal cell line, we found that aldehyde sequestration with phenelzine was neuroprotective. The neuroprotection observed with phenelzine is in agreement with previous studies of aldehyde sequestering agents in the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion brain injury and supports the concept that 'aldehyde load' is a major factor in the delayed cell losses of the ischemic penumbra."}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of lorazepam treatment for multiple withdrawals to prevent or blunt the development/expression of sensitized central nervous system hyperexcitability during a subsequent untreated withdrawal episode. A mouse model of withdrawal sensitization involving repeated ethanol withdrawals was used.	Adult male C3H/He mice were exposed to different patterns of chronic ethanol vapor in inhalation chambers. One group received four cycles of 16 hr of ethanol exposure separated by 8-hr withdrawal periods, another group was tested after a single 16-hr exposure period, and a final group served as ethanol-naïve controls. These groups were further divided into lorazepam dosage (0.25-1.0 mg/kg) conditions. Lorazepam was administered 1 hr into each of the first three withdrawal cycles (or equivalent times); no drug injections were given during the final (fourth) withdrawal cycle. The ability of lorazepam treatment to alter development and expression of sensitized handling-induced convulsions (HIC), as well as changes in pentylenetetrazol seizure threshold dosage during an untreated withdrawal episode, was examined. Separate animals were used to assess the effects of lorazepam treatment on blood ethanol clearance and plasma levels of the benzodiazepine during the test withdrawal cycle.	Lorazepam dose-dependently reduced HIC activity during successive withdrawal cycles, and this resulted in attenuated expression of the sensitized HIC response during the acute phase of a subsequent untreated withdrawal episode. However, HIC activity was exacerbated at later time points during this final test withdrawal in mice that had received lorazepam treatment for earlier withdrawals. A similar pattern of results was obtained for changes in pentylenetetrazol seizure threshold dosage. These results do not seem to be due to pharmacokinetic factors, because peak blood ethanol levels, rate of ethanol elimination, and plasma levels of lorazepam did not significantly differ among groups during the final test withdrawal cycle.	Blocking central nervous system hyperexcitability during repeated ethanol withdrawals with lorazepam effectively blunts the development and expression of sensitized seizure activity during the acute phase of a subsequent unmedicated withdrawal episode. At later time points, withdrawal-related seizure activity was exacerbated, and this is possibly reflective of an interaction between protracted ethanol withdrawal and withdrawal from the benzodiazepine. The clinical implications of these findings suggest that repeated use of benzodiazepines for treatment of multiple ethanol withdrawals may have some initial beneficial effects, but such treatment may also place patients at increased risk of seizures at later time points."}

Multiple biological roles for PK2 have been discovered, including circadian rhythms, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis. However, the role of PK2 in neuropathology is unknown. Using primary cortical cultures, we found that PK2 mRNA is up-regulated by several pathological stressors, including hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, and excitotoxic glutamate. Glutamate-induced PK2 expression is dependent on NMDA receptor activation and extracellular calcium. Enriched neuronal culture studies revealed that neurons are the principal source of glutamate-induced PK2. Using in vivo models of stroke, we found that PK2 mRNA is induced in the ischemic cortex and striatum. Central delivery of PK2 worsens infarct volume, whereas PK2 receptor antagonist decreases infarct volume and central inflammation while improving functional outcome. Direct central inhibition of PK2 using RNAi also reduces infarct volume. These findings indicate that PK2 can be activated by pathological stimuli such as hypoxia-ischemia and excitotoxic glutamate and identify PK2 as a deleterious mediator for cerebral ischemia."}

The Rapid Analysis and Detection of Animal-related Risks (RADAR) project, which has been collecting data on the movement of cattle since 1998, provides a relatively comprehensive record of how these policies have influenced the movement of cattle between animal holdings, markets, and slaughterhouses in Britain. Many previous studies have focused on the properties of the network that can be derived from these movements--treating farms as nodes and movements as directed (and potentially weighted) edges in the network. However, of far greater importance is how these policy changes have influenced the potential spread of infectious diseases. Here we use a stochastic fully individual-based model of cattle in Britain to assess how the epidemic potential has varied from 2000 to 2009 as the pattern of movements has changed in response to legislation and market forces. Our simulations show that the majority of policy changes lead to significant decreases in the epidemic potential (measured in multiple ways), but that this potential then increases through time as cattle farmers modify their behaviour in response. Our results suggest that the cattle industry is likely to experience boom-bust dynamics, with the actions that farmers take during epidemic-free periods to maximise their profitability likely to increase the potential for large-scale epidemics to occur."}

Glutamate, the most important excitatory neurotransmitter, has been recently involved in peripheral neuropathies, thus prevention of its toxic effect is desirable to preserve the integrity of peripheral nervous system and Schwann cells physiology. Removal of glutamate from the extracellular space is accomplished by the high affinity glutamate transporters, so we address our studies to analyze their functional presence in Schwann cells. We first demonstrate that Schwann cells express the EAAC1 transporter in the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicular compartments of the endocytic recycling pathways. Uptake experiments confirm its presence and functional activity in Schwann cells. Secondly, we demonstrate that the EAAC1 activity can be modulated by exposure to the neurosteroid allopregnanolone 10 nM (a progesterone metabolite proved to support Schwann cells). Transporter up-regulation by allopregnanolone is rapid, does not involve protein neo-synthesis and is prevented by actin depolymerization. Allopregnanolone modulation involves GABA-A receptor and PKC activation, promotes the exocytosis of the EAAC1 transporter from intracellular stores to the Schwann cell membrane, in actin-rich cell tips, and modifies the morphology of cell processes. Finally, we provide evidence that glutamate transporters control the allopregnanolone-mediated effects on cell proliferation. Our findings are the first to demonstrate the presence of a functional glutamate uptake system, which can be dynamically modulated by allopregnanolone in Schwann cells.

Other immune proteins including chemokines have been relatively neglected in such studies. Recent evidence has implicated chemokines in many neurobiological processes potentially relevant to psychiatric disorders, beyond their classical chemotactic functions. These may include neuromodulator effects, neurotransmitter-like effects, and direct/indirect regulation of neurogenesis. This systematic review presents the existing early evidence which supports an association of many chemokines with the psychiatric disorders: depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The non-specific association of chemokines including CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1α) and CCL5 (RANTES) with these disorders across diagnostic categories implies a generalised involvement of many chemokine systemic with psychiatric disease. Additional chemokines with great mechanistic relevance including CXCL12 (SDF-1) and CX3CL1 (fractalkine) have been rarely reported in the existing human literature and should be included in future clinical studies. The potential utility of these proteins as pathologically relevant biomarkers or therapeutic targets should be considered by future clinical and translational research."}

We performed a novel approach to enhance the outcome of trabeculectomies using suramin, a substance that inhibits the action of growth factors.	Trabeculectomies were performed in 10 eyes of 10 patients with advanced stages of complicated glaucoma and/or poor visual prognosis in a prospective, consecutive study. For comparison, an equal number of matched controls were selected from surgical cases using mitomycin and another 20 cases without mitomycin. Pre- and post-operative data were evaluated as well as complications and the need for further surgeries.	The follow up was 18 months for the eyes in all groups. Average IOP values decreased from 32.7 mm Hg and 29.5 mm Hg to 19.7 mm Hg and 19.3 mm Hg in the suramin and mitomycin groups. The average number of medications decreased from 2.6 and 2.5 (P <0.86, t-test) to 1.3 and 0.4 (P <0.027) in the suramin- and mitomycin-treated eyes at the last visit. Hypotony following trabeculectomy occurred in 2/10 cases in suramin-treated eyes and 5/10 cases in mitomycin-treated eyes (P <0.18). Hypotony lasting for more than three months occurred in 0/10 suramin-treated eyes and 5/10 mitomycin-treated eyes. Conjunctival dehiscence (2/10), choroidal detachment (4/10), hypotony maculopathy (1/10), and endophthalmitis (1/10) were only noted in mitomycin-treated eyes. Without mitomycin 60% of surgeries performed failed.	In this first study using suramin to inhibit fibrosis following trabeculectomy for complicated cases of glaucoma, it appears that the use of suramin is associated with fewer cases of severe hypotony, choroidal detachment, and severe visual loss as compared to mitomycin, while the success rates seem to be similar."}

Male Balb/c mice were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion and were treated with 3.0 mg/kg of Edaravone or vehicle 30 min before ischemia. Infarct volume was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) method after 24 h. Furthermore, in situ detection of superoxide in the ipsilateral neocortex was carried out using the superoxide-sensitive dye dihydroethidium (DHE) staining technique. Pretreatment with 3.0 mg/kg of Edaravone ameliorated the tissue damage in the infarct rim and significantly reduced infarct volume to about 77% of the control (p<0.05). Semi-quantitative measurement of red fluorescence emitted from DHE revealed that the superoxide increased in the ischemic core at 1 h after the onset of ischemia and extended towards the infarct rim at 3 and 6 h, and that pretreatment with 3.0 mg/kg of Edaravone significantly inhibited the increase of superoxide in the infarct rim at 3 and 6 h (p<0.01). Double staining with DHE and monoclonal antibody against NeuN showed that the majority of the nuclei positive for DHE were also positive for NeuN. These findings suggest that Edaravone salvages the boundary zone of infarct by scavenging reactive oxygen species especially in the neurons during permanent focal cerebral ischemia."}

TNF-alpha secretion from Con A-stimulated splenocytes was reduced by dietary calcium or 1,25D3 treatment. The IL-10 KO mice that received both high calcium diets and 1,25D3 treatments had the lowest TNF-alpha production. In the colons, a TNF-alpha-inducing transcription factor, LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor (LITAF), was inhibited by 1,25D3, but not by calcium. The inhibition of several TNF-alpha-related genes was associated with the decreased colitis in 1,25D3-treated IL-10 KO mice. Furthermore, fulminating IBD in vitamin D receptor/IL-10 double-KO mice corresponded with the increased expression of TNF-alpha and LITAF in the colon. Our results suggest that dietary calcium has independent effects on IBD severity and that 1,25D3 and high calcium together result in the maximal suppression of experimental IBD.

In this context the contribution of astrocyte derived factors in regulating the interactions between inflammatory cells and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier was studied. The treatment of endothelial cells derived from brain or peripheral sources (hepatic) with astrocyte conditioned medium resulted in a dose dependent enhancement of adhesion of T cells to endothelium. The antigen specificity of the T cells did not influence the findings. Identical results were obtained with fresh Concanavalin A activated T cells and T cell hybridomas generated using myelin basic protein or chicken ovalbumin as immunogens.

GCV, cidofovir, acyclovir (ACV), brivudin (BVDU) and foscarnet (PFA) were included as reference compounds. The viruses studied were wild-type, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK(-)) and PFA-resistant (PFA(r)) HSV strains.

A similarly increased activity of E-GCV (as compared to GCV) was noted for TK(-) and PFA(r) HSV-1 or HSV-2 strains. However, E-GCV did not exhibit superior activity over GCV to VZV or HCMV in vitro. The antiviral efficacy of E-GCV was also evaluated in vivo against intracerebral HSV-2 infection in NMRI mice. Animals were treated intraperitoneally or perorally with E-GCV, GCV or placebo once daily for 10 days, starting the day of infection.

The aim of this study was to characterise the phosphatase activity of the atypical dual specificity phosphatase, DUSP26 on MAP kinases, and to determine its expression, regulation and function in cancer cells. Overexpression and knockdown of DUSP26 in epithelial cells and in vitro phosphatase assays were used to demonstrate that, contrary to several published reports, DUSP26 does not act as a dual specificity phosphatase on ERK, JNK or p38 MAPKs. However, overexpression of DUSP26 in MCF10A epithelial cells suppressed colony formation and acinar growth in 3D culture, effects dependent on its phosphatase activity, while knockdown of DUSP26 in HOSE17.1 cells enhanced colony formation and cellular proliferation. DUSP26 mRNA expression was reduced in neuroblastoma, brain and ovarian cancer cell lines. Consistent with epigenetic silencing of DUSP26, expression was enhanced by treatment of cells with 5-aza-2-deoxycitidine and trichostatin A, and a CpG island upstream of the DUSP26 transcriptional start site was variably methylated in cancer cell lines. Together, these results help to clarify confusion in the literature relating to DUSP26 substrate specificity and support recent reports that substrates other than MAPKs are the primary substrates of this phosphatase. In addition, they indicate that DUSP26 may function as a tumour suppressor in particular cancers."}

Adult, male Wistar rats subjected to different atmospheric pressures of injury during FPI showed great variability in injury severity when functional behavior was determined based on the Neurological Severity Score (NSS) assessment. When NSS was used to select rats with the most severe FPI-induced brain injury, 63% of rats experienced at least one convulsive seizure 2-5 weeks after FPI. This same cohort of rats (i.e., selected for severe TBI based on NSS) were significantly more susceptible to PTZ-induced seizures compared to sham controls.

However, the rate of isolated EEG spikes was greater in rats with severe FPI-induced injury compared to sham controls. These data suggest that convulsive seizures can be obtained in FPI-treated rats when NSS is used as an inclusion criterion to select rats with severe injury.

Deaths from snakebites in the Amazon.^\nSnake envenoming represents a major burden for public health worldwide. In the Amazon, the official number of cases and deaths detected is probably underestimated because of the difficulty riverine and indigenous populations have reaching health centers in order to receive medical assistance. Thus, integrated analysis of health information systems must be used in order to improve adequate health policies. The aim of this work is to describe a series of deaths and identify risk factors for lethality from snakebites in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. All deaths from snakebites reported to the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (SINAN) and to the Mortality Information System (SIM; ICD10-10th revision, X.29), from 2007 to 2015, were included. Variables were assessed by blocks with distal (ecological variables), intermediate (demographics) and proximal (clinical variables) components to identify predictors of case fatality. A total of 127 deaths from snakebites were recorded, with 58 pairs found through linkage of the SINAN and SIM databases (45.7%), 37 (29.1%) deaths found only in SINAN and 32 (25.2%) found only in the SIM. Deaths occurred mostly in males (95 cases; 74.8%) living in rural areas (78.6%). The most affected age group was the ≥61 years old (36 cases; 28.4%). Snakebites were presumably due to Bothrops snakes in 68.5% of the cases and Lachesis in 29.5% based on clinico-epidemiological diagnosis. A proportion of 26.2% of the cases received treatment over 24 h after the bite ocurred. On admission, cases were mostly classified as severe (65.6%). Overall, 28 patients (22.0%).

Respiratory failure/dyspnea, systemic bleeding, sepsis and shock were recorded only among fatal cases. In conclusion, i) death from snakebites was underreported in the mortality surveillance system; ii) older age groups living in remote municipalities and indigenous peoples were the population groups most prone to death; iii) lack or underdosage of antivenom resulted in higher case fatality and iv) systemic bleeding, circulatory shock, sepsis and acute respiratory failure were strongly associated to fatal outcome."}

They are ubiquitously expressed and are subject to regulation by cholesterol loading or by treatment with agents that activate the nuclear hormone receptor LXR. Earlier studies in both primates and non-primates reported that treatment with endotoxin (bacterial lipopolysaccharide, LPS) reduces plasma levels of HDL cholesterol. To determine if such HDL reduction correlates with a change in ABCA1 or ABCG1 expression, their expressions were measured in THP-1 monocytes and mice treated with LPS. LPS treatment leads to a rapid, dose-dependent increase of ABCA1 but not ABCG1 mRNA expression. Analysis of mouse livers showed that LPS treatment decreases expression of CYP7A, another target gene of LXR. When THP-1 cells were transfected with the ABCA1 promoter construct (-928 to +101 bp), promoter activity was significantly increased by treatment of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol but not by LPS. Together, these studies show that LPS regulates ABCA1 expression through an LXR-independent mechanism. Further studies showed that treatment with Rhodobacter sphaeroiders LPS, an LPS antagonist, or PD169316, a specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, prevented the induction of ABCA1 by LPS. Therefore, this suggests that both transport of LPS from the plasma membrane to an intracellular site and activation of p38 MAP kinase are involved in the LPS-mediated induction of ABCA1."}

The balance and muscle strength of the OLE (150 and 300 mg/kg)-treated groups were significantly improved. Treatment with OLE prevented the increases in the levels of MDA, significantly improved the SOD, CAT, and GPx levels in the midbrain, and prevented the depletion of the TH-positive neurons.

Isometric tension was used to record the contractile response of rabbit BA to hemolysate, and Western blots were obtained using antibodies for MAPK. The following results are reported. 1) Hemolysate produced a concentration-dependent contraction of rabbit BA; however, preincubation of arteries with the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD-98059 markedly reduced this contraction. The administration of PD-98059 also relaxed, in a concentration-dependent fashion, the sustained contraction induced by 10% hemolysate. 2) The Janus tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor AG-490, preincubated with arterial rings, reduced the contractile response to hemolysate but failed to relax the sustained contraction induced by this agent. The Src-tyrosine kinase inhibitor damnacanthal and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin failed to reduce hemolysate-induced contraction. 3) Hemolysate produced a time-dependent elevation of MAPK immunoreactivity as seen on Western blots of rabbit BA. The MAPK was enhanced 1 minute after hemolysate exposure and the effect reached maximum levels at 5 minutes. The immunoreactivity of MAPK decayed slowly over time, but the level of this kinase was still higher than the basal level, even at 2 hours after exposure to hemolysate. Preincubation of arteries with the MEK inhibitor PD-98059 abolished the effect of hemolysate on MAPK immunoreactivity.

Similar changes, but of lesser severity, were present in the animals treated with balloon dilatation only. After 14 days, the severity of vascular and perivascular alterations (medial haemorrhage, perivascular haemorrhage, thrombus formation) was significantly lower in the local delivery group (P < 0.05), but disruption of the internal elastic lamina, as a marker of the initial trauma, was present in all the animals. The presence of residual intracoronary thrombus was only seen in the PTCA group without local delivery.	In this safety study, both groups showed pronounced alterations in the vessel wall 3 days following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. This changed 14 days following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty when intramural injection of Clivarin resulted in a marked decrease of residual thrombus and medial as well as perivascular haemorrhage. Although the additional vessel trauma by the drug delivery technique did not result in increased complications, a careful approach with this potentially harmful procedure is essential."}

One of the implicated mechanisms is enhancement of apoptotic neuronal death, which occurs physiologically in the developing brain. We investigated whether topiramate, one of the newer antiepileptic drugs, has neurotoxic properties in the developing rat brain. Topiramate slightly but significantly enhanced apoptotic neuronal death in the 7-day-old rat brain at doses of 50 mg/kg and above. These doses are several folds higher than reported ED(50) doses in infant rodent seizure models that respond to topiramate. Electron microscopy confirmed that dying neurons following topiramate treatment displayed the same morphological features as neurons undergoing physiological cell death during development. When compared to the neurotoxicity profile of phenytoin, valproate, and phenobarbital, the separation between the effective anticonvulsant dose and the neurotoxic dose was greater for topiramate and the neurotoxic effect was lower."}

BetaA toxicity was measured in septal glia, via a dose-response experiment, by quantifying the effects of three different doses (0.1, 1, and 10 microM) of betaA on cell survival. Astrocytes from embryonic day-16 rats were grown in serum-free media in a single layer culture. Cells were treated on day in vitro (DIV)1 and survival was determined on DIV3 to ascertain which concentration was most toxic. In a separate set of experiments, an attempt was made to protect glial cells from the degenerative effects of betaA, with treatments of growth factors and estrogen. BetaA (10 microM) treatment was administered on DIV1, on DIV2 the cells were treated with estrogen (EST, 10 nM), insulin-like growth factors (IGF1 and IGF2, each 10 ng/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 5 ng/ml) or nerve growth factor (NGF, 100 ng/ml), and on DIV3 the cells were visualized and quantified by fluorescence microscopy with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). In addition to dose-response and glial protection, experiments were also conducted to determine whether toxic effects were due to apoptosis. Our results suggest that the survival of glial populations is significantly affected in all three concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10 microM) of betaA. Glial protection was evident in the presence of NGF, for it showed the significantly highest survival rate relative to the betaA treatment alone.

While chemotherapy has long been attributed as the cause of these memory, learning and concentration difficulties, we recently observed cognitive impairment in cancer patients prior to treatment. This suggests the cancer alone may be sufficient to induce cognitive impairment, however the mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that we can experimentally replicate the clinical phenomenon of cancer-associated cognitive impairment and we identify inflammation as a causal mechanism. We demonstrate that a peripheral tumor is sufficient to induce memory loss. Using an othotopic mouse model of breast cancer, we found that mice with 4T1.2 or EO771 mammary tumors had significantly poorer memory than mice without tumors. Memory impairment was independent of cancer-induced sickness behavior, which was only observed during the later stage of cancer progression in mice with high metastatic burden. Tumor-secreted factors were sufficient to induce memory impairment and pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated in the plasma of tumor-bearing mice. Oral treatment with low-dose aspirin completely blocked tumor-induced memory impairment without affecting tumor-induced sickness or tumor growth, demonstrating a causal role for inflammation in cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that anti-inflammatories may be a safe and readily translatable strategy that could be used to prevent cancer-associated cognitive impairment in patients."}

Primary cultured rat astrocytes were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by recovery. Cell death was measured by lactate dehydrogenase assay. Astrocyte proliferation was determined by cell viability assay, cell counting and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation assay. The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) secretion from astrocytes was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The expressions of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), SDF-1, GFAP and the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular regulated protein kinase (Erk) 1/2 were evaluated by immunoblot assay. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression of HIF-1α and SDF-1.	Mild OGD (2 h-OGD) did not induce astrocyte injury but proliferation at 48 and 72 h after recovery. Mild OGD also induced the accumulation of HIF-1α, the subsequent expression and secretion of SDF-1, resulting in the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt. TSA attenuated astrocyte proliferation and significantly decreased the OGD-induced accumulation of HIF-1α and SDF-1, then blocked the downstream signaling, Erk1/2 and Akt activation.	TSA inhibits the astrocyte proliferation induced by sub-lethal ischemic insult via blocking the activation of HIF-1α/SDF-1 pathway.

Furthermore, it affects anticonvulsant action of some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in mice seizure tests and both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions were noted. The present study was carried out to investigate influence of sildenafil on the threshold for 6 Hz-induced psychomotor seizures in mice. Effect of sildenafil on activity of some AEDs, i.e., phenobarbital (PB), clonazepam (CZP), ethosuximide (ETS), valproic acid (VPA), tiagabine (TGB), oxcarbazepine (OXC) and levetiracetam (LEV), in 6 Hz test was also examined. Moreover, combination of sildenafil with LEV was investigated in terms of influence on motor coordination (determined by the chimney test), muscular strength (evaluated in the grip-strength test) and long-term memory (assessed in the passive avoidance task) in mice. To determine the type of pharmacological interaction between sildenafil and LEV, free plasma and total brain concentrations of this AED were determined by LC-MS/MS method. Sildenafil at a dose ranging from 10 to 40 mg/kg statistically increased psychomotor seizure threshold in mice. Moreover, sildenafil enhanced the anticonvulsant action of all the studied AEDs in this test. Interactions between this PDE5 inhibitor and PB, CZP, ETS, TGB and OXC seem to be pharmacodynamic. Since sildenafil increased free plasma and total brain concentration of LEV, interactions between these drugs have pharmacokinetic nature. This kind of interaction was also noted between sildenafil and VPA. Neither LEV (2.32 mg/kg) nor its co-administration with sildenafil (40 mg/kg) produced any significant changes in motor coordination, muscular strength and long-term memory in mice."}

The underlying mechanisms are controversially discussed: The stimulation can either be based on a direct excitation of neurons, or it is a result of an optoacoustic pressure wave acting on the basilar membrane. Animal studies comparing the intra-cochlear optical stimulation of hearing and deafened guinea pigs have indicated that the stimulation requires intact hair cells. Therefore, optoacoustic stimulation seems to be the underlying mechanism. The present study investigates optoacoustic characteristics using pulsed laser stimulation for in vivo experiments on hearing guinea pigs and pressure measurements in water. As a result, in vivo as well as pressure measurements showed corresponding signal shapes. The amplitude of the signal for both measurements depended on the absorption coefficient and on the maximum of the first time-derivative of laser pulse power (velocity of heat deposition). In conclusion, the pressure measurements directly demonstrated that laser light generates acoustic waves, with amplitudes suitable for stimulating the (partially) intact cochlea. These findings corroborate optoacoustic as the basic mechanism of optical intra-cochlear stimulation."}

In addition, mitochondrial abnormalities have been well recognized to contribute to degenerative diseases, like Parkinson's disease (PD). Particularly a deficiency in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and cristae disruption have been consistently described in PD. Moreover, the products of PD-familial genes, including alpha-synuclein, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2 and HTR2A, were shown to localize to the mitochondria under certain conditions. It seems that PD has a mitochondrial component so events that would modulate normal mitochondrial functions may compromise neuronal survival.

Consequently, in a separate group of mice, we stabilized and matched MABP during hypoxia. Hypoxic hyperemia was attenuated by 38% (P<0.05) in KO animals whose MABP was uncontrolled, and by 81% (P<0.05) in KO animals whose MABP changes were matched to the MABP in the hypoxic WT mice. In animals treated with adenosine antagonists, hypoxic hyperemia was decreased by 44% to 48% (P<0.05) in WT mice, but was without effect in KO mice.

However, the mechanisms of interaction between these materials and human cells are not fully understood. In order to clarify this relationship, we have studied the iron role in β-TCP ceramics. Iron-containing β-TCPs were prepared by replacing CaCO3 with C6H5FeO7 at different molar ratios. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated the occurrence of β-TCP as the sole phase in the pure β-TCP and iron-containing ceramics. The incorporation of iron ions in the β-TCP lattice decreased the specific surface area as the pore size was shifted toward meso- and/or macropores. Furthermore, the human osteoblastlike cell line MG-63 was cultured onto the ceramics to determine cell proliferation and viability, and it was observed that the iron-β-TCP ceramics have better cytocompatibility than pure β-TCP. Finally, in vivo assays were performed using rabbit calvaria as a bone model. The scaffolds were implanted for 8 and 12 weeks in the defects created in the skullcap with pure β-TCP as the control. The in vivo behavior, in terms of new bone formed, degradation, and residual graft material were investigated using sequential histological evaluations and histomorphometric analysis. The in vivo implantation of the ceramics showed enhanced bone tissue formation and scaffold degradation for iron-β-TCPs.

However, recent research has shown that activation of glia also leads to some beneficial outcomes. Glia release anti-inflammatory factors that protect against neurotoxicity and restore normal pain. Accordingly, use of glial inhibitors might compromise the protective functions of glia in addition to suppressing their detrimental effects. With a better understanding of how different conditions affect glial cell activation, we may be able to promote the protective function of glia and pave the way for future development of novel, safe, and effective treatments of neuropathic pain."}

This study was undertaken to investigate dopamine (DA) release upon l-DOPA treatment. Chronoamperometric measurements were performed in unilaterally DA-depleted rats, chronically treated with l-DOPA, resulting in dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic animals. Normal and lesioned l-DOPA naïve animals were used as controls. Potassium-evoked DA releases were significantly reduced in intact sides of animals undertaken chronic l-DOPA treatment, independent on dyskinetic behavior. Acute l-DOPA further attenuated the amplitude of the DA release in the control sides. In DA-depleted striata, no difference was found in potassium-evoked DA releases, and acute l-DOPA did not affect the amplitude. While immunoreactivity to serotonin uptake transporter was higher in lesioned striata of animals displaying dyskinetic behavior, no correlation could be documented between serotonin transporter-positive nerve fiber density and the amplitude of released DA. In conclusions, the amplitude of potassium-evoked DA release is attenuated in intact striatum after chronic intermittent l-DOPA treatment. No change in amplitude was found in DA-denervated sides of either dyskinetic or non-dyskinetic animals, while release kinetics were changed. This indicates the importance of studying DA release dynamics for the understanding of both beneficial and adverse effects of l-DOPA replacement therapy."}

We used cerebellar granule neurons because of low glial contamination. Cell viability was measured by the MTT method, and apoptosis was evaluated by assessing DNA fragmentation with flow cytometry or quantification of nuclear condensation. Our data indicate that the neuroprotective effects of caffeine in the MPP+ model of apoptosis are mediated through activation of the ATM/p53 pathway. In addition, caffeine decreased the expression of cyclin D and the transcription factor E2F-1, a regulator of apoptosis in neurons. Caffeine-mediated neuroprotection was not mediated through blockade of adenosine receptors because DPCPX and CGS-15943, two antagonists of these receptors, failed to attenuate apoptosis produced by MPP+ treatment. In addition, caffeine did not exert neuroprotective effects after serum and potassium withdrawal, a p53-independent model of apoptosis. Taken together, our findings indicate that DNA damage/ATM activation is a key component of MPP+-induced apoptosis in CGNs through activation of p53 and reentry into the cell cycle, specifically expression of the transcription factor E2F-1."}

We have identified the mouse mutant coloboma as an animal model for examining the neurological basis of hyperactivity. Coloboma mice exhibit spontaneous locomotor hyperactivity that is a result of a reduction in SNAP-25, a presynaptic protein that regulates exocytotic release. These mice exhibit an imbalance in catecholamine regulation whereby brain dopamine (DA) utilization is reduced while norepinephrine (NE) concentrations are significantly increased. Further, calcium-dependent NE release was also increased in these hyperactive mice, despite the reduction in SNAP-25. To determine the role of NE in the expression of hyperactivity, brain NE concentrations were reduced using the specific noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4 [N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride]. DSP-4 treatment specifically decreased NE concentrations, but had no effect on brain DA or serotonin. Depletion of NE by DSP-4 through either systemic or central administration significantly reduced the locomotor activity in coloboma mice. These results suggest that NE regulation in the CNS plays an important role in the expression of hyperactivity in this mouse model, consistent with results of human studies and current models of ADHD."}

Screening of our internal compound collection for inhibitors of JNK3 led to the identification of (benzothiazol-2-yl)acetonitrile derivatives as potent and selective JNK1, -2, -3 inhibitors. Starting from initial hit 1 (AS007149), the chemistry and initial structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this novel and unique kinase inhibitor template were explored. Investigation of the SAR rapidly revealed that the benzothiazol-2-ylacetonitrile pyrimidine core was crucial to retain a good level of potency on rat JNK3. Therefore, compound 6 was further optimized by exploring a number of distal combinations in place of the chlorine atom. This led to the observation that the presence of an aromatic group, two carbons away from the aminopyrimidine moiety and bearing substituents conferring hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) properties, could improve the potency. Further improvements to the biological and biopharmaceutical profile of the most promising compounds were performed, resulting in the discovery of compound 59 (AS601245).

The mechanism involves AIBP binding to Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and increased binding of AIBP to activated microglia, which mediates selective regulation of lipid rafts in inflammatory cells. AIBP-mediated lipid raft reductions downregulate LPS-induced TLR4 dimerization, inflammatory signaling, and expression of cytokines in microglia. In mice, intrathecal injections of AIBP reduce spinal myeloid cell lipid rafts, TLR4 dimerization, neuroinflammation, and glial activation. Intrathecal AIBP reverses established allodynia in mice in which pain states were induced by the chemotherapeutic cisplatin, intraplantar formalin, or intrathecal LPS, all of which are pro-nociceptive interventions known to be regulated by TLR4 signaling.

The intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion model may be suitable for this purpose. Although this model has been well characterized in rodents, it has not previously been used in monkeys. The goal of the present study was to characterize the behavioral effects of unilateral injections of 6-OHDA in the basal ganglia of common marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Cell counts from tyrosine hydroxylase immunochemistry 5 months postlesion revealed DA cell loss in the substantia nigra on the lesioned side to approximately 46% of relative to the unlesioned side. 6-OHDA lesioned monkeys showed a variety of behavioral deficits. Apomorphine induced rotation and simple sensorimotor measures (head position bias and PD disability rating score) were most affected by the lesion. The largest deficits were seen at 1 or 2 weeks postsurgery but had recovered by week 10. 6-OHDA lesioned monkeys took longer to complete a more complex sensorimotor staircase task. At 3.5 months postlesion, 6-OHDA monkeys also showed deficits on an object retrieval task designed to measure sensorimotor planning and skilled hand use. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine, a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, reinstated those deficits which had undergone recovery in the lesioned animals and also exacerbated the deficits on the staircase task. This model has potential in assessing treatments for PD aimed at curtailing disease progression such as continuous delivery of neurotrophic factors."}

Some interferons (IFNs) have been used for the treatment of viral infections for decades; however, conventional IFNs only display mild anti-EV71 activities. No effective drug is currently available for the treatment of EV71 infection. Here, we aimed to investigate whether some IFN subtypes display potent anti-EV71 activities.

The expression levels of IFN downstream antiviral genes were also measured by qRT-PCR.	Out of 17 type I IFNs, 4 IFNs (IFN-α4, IFN-α6, IFN-α14 and IFN-α16) displayed potent antiviral activity. Compared with conventional IFN-α2a, IFN-α14 displayed approximately 20× higher antiviral activity.

Transmission between cats occurs mainly through friendly contacts, but also through biting. In large groups of non-vaccinated cats, around 30-40% will develop persistent viraemia, 30-40% show transient viraemia and 20-30% seroconvert. Young kittens are especially susceptible to FeLV infection.	The most common signs of persistent FeLV viraemia are immune suppression, anaemia and lymphoma. Less common signs are immune-mediated disease, chronic enteritis, reproductive disorders and peripheral neuropathies. Most persistently viraemic cats die within 2-3 years.	In low-prevalence areas there may be a risk of false-positive results; a doubtful positive test result in a healthy cat should therefore be confirmed, preferably by PCR for provirus. Asymptomatic FeLV-positive cats should be retested.	Supportive therapy and good nursing care are required. Secondary infections should be treated promptly. Cats infected with FeLV should remain indoors. Vaccination against common pathogens should be maintained. Inactivated vaccines are recommended. The virus does not survive for long outside the host.	All cats with an uncertain FeLV status should be tested prior to vaccination. All healthy cats at potential risk of exposure should be vaccinated against FeLV. Kittens should be vaccinated at 8-9 weeks of age, with a second vaccination at 12 weeks, followed by a booster 1 year later.

Given that data concerning the serotype B (BoNT/B) are limited, the aim of the present study was to verify if also BoNT/B is able not only to counteract neuropathic pain, but also to interfere with inflammatory and regenerative processes associated with the nerve injury.

Recently, gene defects underlying four monogenic epilepsies (generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures, autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, benign familial neonatal convulsions and episodic ataxia type 1 with partial seizures) have been identified, shedding new light on the pathophysiology of epilepsy as these diseases are caused by ion channel mutations. Although epileptic syndromes differ pathophysiologically, common ictogenesis-related characteristics as increased neuronal excitability and synchronicity are shared as well as mechanisms involved in interictal-ictal transition. Emerging insights point to alterations of synaptic functions and intrinsic properties of neurons as common mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability. This work also reviews the neurochemical mechanisms of epilepsy. An imbalance between glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter systems can lead to hyperexcitability but catecholaminergic neurotransmitter systems and opioid peptides were shown to play a role in epileptogenesis as well. An overview of currently available anti-epileptic drugs and their presumed mechanisms of action is given as an illustration of the neurochemistry of epileptogenesis. Most anti-epileptic drugs exert their anti-epileptic properties through only a few neurochemical mechanisms that are meanwhile basic pathophysiological mechanisms thought to cause seizures."}

The present study aimed to examine the sexually dimorphic effects of chronic prenatal ethanol exposure (CPEE) on behavior cognition and synaptic plasticity balance (SPB), and tried to understand a possible mechanism by evaluating the alternation of SPB. The animal model was produced by ethanol exposure throughout gestational period with 4 g/kg bodyweight. Offspring of both male and female were selected and studied on postnatal days 36. Subsequently, the data showed that chronic ethanol exposure resulted in birth weight reduction, losing bodyweight gain, microcephaly and hippocampus weight retardation. In Morris water maze (MWM) test, escape latencies were significantly higher in CPEE-treated rats than that in control ones. They also spent much less time in the target quadrant compared to that of control animals in the probe phase. In addition, it was found that there was a more severe impairment in females than that in males after CPEE treatment. Electrophysiological studies showed that CPEE considerably inhibited hippocampal LTP and facilitated depotentiation in males, while significantly enhanced LTP and suppressed depotentiation in females. A novel index, developed by us, showed that the action of CPEE on SPB was more sensitive in females than that in males, suggesting that it might be an effective index to distinguish the difference of SPB impairment between males and females."}

Despite vast ongoing researches focusing on the area, little is known about novel treatments. In this study, we aimed to survey the effects of Capparis spinosa (C. spinosa) extract on amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ)-injected rat.	For this purpose, hydroalcoholic extracts of caper leaf and fruit were prepared. Total phenolic content, DPPH, and FRAP assay were accomplished to determine antioxidant activity of C. spinosa. HPLC analysis was conducted to measure rutin and quercetin content of selected parts of the plant. Higher levels of flavonoids were observed in leaves of the plant. Twelve male Wistar Aβ-induced rats were randomly divided in four groups of (1) Aβ[-]/DW[+]: Sham-operated group (2) Aβ[+]/DW[+]: Aβ-injected group (3) Aβ[+]/RU[+]: Standard rutin treatment (4) Aβ[+]/CS[+]: C. spinosa extract treatment. After 6 weeks of oral administration, real-time qPCR were conducted to determine APP, BACE-1, PSEN-1, and PSEN-2 genes expression in the hippocampus of rats.	HPLC analysis showed high levels of rutin and quercetin in leaves of Capparis. Rutin was 16939.2 ± 0.01 and quercetin was 908.93 ± 0.01 µg/g fresh weight. In fruit, 1019.52 ± 0.01 rutin and 97.86 ± 0.01 µg/g FW quercetin were measured. Expression of BACE-1, APP, PSEN-1, and PSEN-2 genes in comparison with the control group showed significant down regulation.	Results of the study demonstrated that C. spinosa has the potential to down regulate inflammation-involved genes in AD, due to its high levels of flavonoids and could be beneficial as a dietary complement in AD patients."}

Previously, we demonstrated that GALR1 mRNA expression was increased in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and discrete hypothalamic nuclei in galanin transgenic (GAL-tg) mice. This observation suggested a compensatory adjustment in cognate receptors in the face of chronic GAL exposure. To evaluate the molecular alterations to GALR2 and GALR3 in the forebrain of GAL overexpressing mice, we performed complementary quantitative, real-time PCR (qPCR), in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry in select forebrain regions of GAL-tg mice to characterize the neuronal distribution and magnitude of GAL mRNA and peptide expression and the consequences of genetically manipulating the neuropeptide GAL on the expression of GALR2 and GALR3 receptors. We found that GAL-tg mice displayed dramatic increases in GAL mRNA and peptide in the frontal cortex, posterior cortex, hippocampus, septal diagonal band complex, amygdala, piriform cortex, and olfactory bulb. Moreover, there was evidence for ectopic neuronal GAL expression in forebrain limbic regions that mediate cognitive and affective behaviors, including the piriform and entorhinal cortex and amygdala. Interestingly, regional qPCR analysis failed to reveal any changes in GALR2 or GALR3 expression in the GAL-tg mice, suggesting that, contrary to GALR1, these receptor genes are not under ligand-mediated regulatory control. The GAL-tg mouse model may provide a useful tool for the investigation of GAL ligand-receptor relationships and their role in normal cognitive and affective functions as well as in the onset of neurological disease."}

Ephrins, semaphorins, Slits, Netrins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Wnts are among the most likely molecules to be involved in limiting axonal regeneration in the injured spinal cord. The receptors for these molecules are not universally expressed by neurons but there is evidence that ephrins and semaphorins limit regeneration of particular classes of axon into spinal cord lesion sites. It is likely that other repulsive guidance cues will also differentially affect the regeneration of specific tracts within the spinal cord. In addition to direct effects on axonal regeneration, many axonal guidance molecules have effects on glial, meningeal or immune system cells which also modulate the responses of CNS tissue to injury."}

On the other hand, many individuals produce aPL and yet never develop thrombotic events. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) appears to be necessary for aPL-mediated prothrombotic effects in venous and microvascular models of thrombosis, but its role in arterial thrombosis has not been studied. Here, we propose that aPL alone are insufficient to cause thrombotic events in an arterial model of APS, and that a concomitant trigger of innate immunity (e.g. TLR4 activation) is required. We show specifically that anti-β2-glycoprotein I (anti-β2GPI) antibodies, a subset of aPL, accelerated thrombus formation in C57BL/6 wild-type, but not TLR4-deficient, mice in a ferric chloride-induced carotid artery injury model. These aPL bound to arterial and venous endothelial cells, particularly in the presence of β2GPI, and to human TLR4 by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Arterial endothelium from aPL-treated mice had enhanced leukocyte adhesion, compared to control IgG-treated mice. In addition, aPL treatment of mice enhanced expression of tissue factor (TF) in leukocytes induced by the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS). aPL also enhanced LPS-induced TF expression in human leukocytes in vitro. Our findings support a mechanism in which aPL enhance TF expression by leukocytes, as well as augment adhesion of leukocytes to the arterial endothelium. The activation of TLR4 in aPL-positive individuals may be required to trigger thrombotic events."}

Deletion in the DYT1 gene, encoding the torsinA protein, is responsible for this dominantly inherited disorder, which is non-degenerative and exhibits reduced penetrance among carriers. Here, we explore the hypothesis that deficits in torsinA function result in an increased vulnerability to stress associated with protein folding and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where torsinA is located. Using an in vivo quantitative readout for the ER stress response, we evaluated the consequences of torsinA mutations in transgenic nematodes expressing variants of human torsinA. This analysis revealed that, normally, torsinA serves a protective function to maintain a homeostatic threshold against ER stress. Furthermore, we show that the buffering capacity of torsinA is greatly diminished by the DYT1-associated deletion or mutations that prevent its translocation to the ER, block ATPase activity, or increase the levels of torsinA in the nuclear envelope versus ER. Combinations of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans designed to mimic clinically relevant genetic modifiers of disease susceptibility also exhibit a direct functional correlation to changes in the ER stress response. Furthermore, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from torsinA knockout mice, we demonstrated that loss of endogenous torsinA results in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress. This study extends our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying dystonia, and establishes a new functional paradigm to evaluate therapeutic strategies to compensate for reduced torsinA activity in the ER as a means to restore homeostatic balance and neuronal function."}

Whole cell patch clamp measurements revealed that magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of hypothalamic slices of the rats responded to the C5aR-agonist PL37-MAP peptide with calcium ion current pulses. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) producing neurons in slices of the preoptic area of the mice also reacted to the peptide treatment with inward calcium current. PL37-MAP was able to evoke the inward ion current of GnRH neurons in slices from ovariectomized animals. The amplitude of the inward pulses became higher in slices obtained from 17beta-estradiol (E2) substituted mice. Calcium imaging experiments demonstrated that PL37-MAP increased the intracellular calcium content in the culture of the GnRH-producing GT1-7 cell line in a concentration-dependent manner. Calcium imaging also showed that E2 pretreatment elevated the PL37-MAP evoked increase of the intracellular calcium content in the GT1-7 cells. The estrogen receptor blocker Faslodex in the medium prevented the E2-evoked increase of the PL37-MAP-triggered elevation of the intracellular calcium content in the GT1-7 cells demonstrating that the effect of E2 might be related to the presence of estrogen receptor. Real-time PCR experiments revealed that E2 increased the expression of C5aR mRNA in GT1-7 neurons, suggesting that an increased C5aR synthesis could be involved in the estrogenic modulation of calcium response. These data indicate that hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons can integrate immune and neuroendocrine functions. Our results may serve a better understanding of the inflammatory and neurodegeneratory diseases of the hypothalamus and the related neuroendocrine and autonomic compensatory responses."}

In one experimental cohort the injury was created and repaired using interfascicular nerve autografts or coaxially aligned freeze-thawed skeletal muscle autografts in a group of adult sheep and in a group of newborn lambs. In a second cohort a similar injury was created and repaired either immediately or after a delay of 30 days, using either interfascicular nerve autografts or coaxially aligned freeze-thawed skeletal muscle autografts in four groups of six newborn lambs. In all cases both functional and morphometric indices of nerve regeneration were poorer in the injured and repaired nerves than in normal nerves. In lambs the method of repair made no difference and no significant differences were found for any of the indices of nerve function or morphology. In sheep the use of muscle grafts was associated with a poorer outcome than the use of nerve autografts. Where a delay of 30 days had elapsed between injury and repair, the results using nerve autografts were not significantly different. Where freeze-thawed muscle autografts had been used, the maturation of the regenerated nerve fibres after delay was significantly poorer than after immediate repair.

We investigated whether direct PI3-K activation prevents Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. To evaluate the effect of Abeta on neuronal cells, we treated primary cultured cortical neurons with several doses of Abeta for 72 h. To investigate the protective effect that PI3-K activation has on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, cells were simultaneously treated with several doses of a PI3-K activator for 72 h. An MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, trypan blue staining, and DAPI staining showed that Abeta decreased neuronal cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner and also that PI3-K activation effectively prevented Abeta-induced neuronal cell death. Abeta significantly decreased survival signals, including phosphorylated Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, and heat shock transcription factor-1. Abeta also increased death signals, such as phosphorylated tau (pThr231) and activated caspase-3. Treatment with a PI3-K activator restored the survival signals and inhibited the death signals. These results suggest that the neurotoxic effect of Abeta can be partially prevented by PI3-K activation."}

Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic components of viper venom play a pivotal role in bringing redox turbulence in victims. Venom-induced hemorrhage and necrosis with subsequent release of damage associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) molecules also contribute to sustained oxidative stress and inflammation.

However, activation of calpain also plays a protective function in the early phase of excitotoxic neuronal death. The exact role of calpains in neuronal death and recovery after exposure to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) is not clearly known. The purpose of present study was to examine the involvement of mu- and m-calpain in NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in the adult rat retina. Increased immunoreactivity of mu-calpain was noted in RGC layer cells and in the inner nuclear layer with maximal expression at 12 h after NMDA injection. This was further confirmed with Western blotting. TdT-mediated biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells in the inner retina co-localized with moderate or intense mu-calpain immunoreactivity. In contrast, there was no remarkable change in m-calpain immunoreactivity at any time point after NMDA injection. Simultaneous injection of 2 nmol of a calpain inhibitor (calpain inhibitor II) significantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the inner retina at 18 h after NMDA injection and preserved RGC-like cells counted at 7 days after injection.

Typical experimental settings yield MR studies that are sensitive to mean molecular displacements of approximately 5 microm, and ionophoresis experiments to displacements of > or =100 microm. An assessment of the correspondence between the methods is hampered by the fact that no common probe molecule has been used. One of the most frequently utilized probe molecules in ionophoresis measurements is the tetramethylammonium (TMA) ion. In the current work the diffusion properties of TMA were studied in rat brain in vivo with localized (1)H MR spectroscopy (MRS). Standard treatment of the MR data yielded a 3.6-fold lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) compared to ionophoresis. To explore the source of this discrepancy, a separate data processing scheme was applied to the MR data to monitor individual elapsed displacement-distance subpopulations of TMA molecules. This analysis revealed a dependence of the ADC estimation on a given subpopulation's elapsed displacement distance. The MR-derived ADC approached the ionophoresis-derived value as the elapsed displacement distance increased to 15 microm. These observations demonstrate that MR and ionophoresis studies provide complementary information, and that ADC estimates obtained from the two techniques are sensitive to different biophysical determinants."}

The aim of the current study was to search for means other than intracranial injection to deliver HSV-derived vectors to the central nervous system of mice. We also aimed to study the replication efficiency of these vectors in nervous system tissues and to elucidate the effects of the viruses on the immune response. We studied the spread and replication of the following viruses with deletions in neurovirulence gene gamma(1)34.5: R3616, R849 (lacZ transgene), R3659 (alpha-tk), R8306 (murine IL-4 transgene), and R8308 (murine IL-10 transgene). The samples were taken from trigeminal ganglia and brains of BALB/c mice after corneal, intralabial, and intranasal infection, and the viral load was examined by viral culture, HSV DNA PCR, and VP16 reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The results show that (i) intranasal infection was the most efficient means of spread to the central nervous system (CNS) besides intracranial injection; (ii) the viruses did not grow in the culture from the brain samples, but the viral DNA persisted even until day 21 postinfection; (iii) viral replication, as observed by VP16 mRNA RT-PCR, occurred mainly on days 4 and 7 postinfection in trigeminal ganglia and to a low extent in brain; (iv) R3659, R8306, and R8308 showed reactivation from the trigeminal ganglia in explant cultures; (v) in the brain, the vectors spread to the midbrain more efficiently than to other brain areas; and (vi) the deletions in the R3659 genome significantly limited the ability of this virus to replicate in the nervous system. The immunological studies show that (i) the only recombinant to induce IL-4 mRNA expression in the brain was R8306, the gamma interferon response was very low in the brain for R3659 and R8306, and the IL-23p19 response to R8306 decreased by day 21 postinfection, unlike for the other viruses; (ii) Deltagamma(1)34.5 HSV vectors modulated the subsets of the splenocytes differently depending on the transgene; (iii) R3659 infection of the nervous system induces expression and production of cytokines from the stimulated splenocytes; and (iv) HSV vectors expressing IL-4 or IL-10 induce expression and production of both of the Th2-type cytokines from splenocytes. We conclude that the intranasal route of infection is a possible means of delivery of Deltagamma(1)34.5 HSV vectors to the CNS in addition to intracranial infection, although replication in the CNS remains minimal. The DNA of the HSV vectors is able to reside in the brain for at least 3 weeks.

It could be found that the steric complementarity and the hydrophobic interaction between the inhibitors and the receptor were very important to the biological activity, while the contribution of the electronic effect was not so obvious. Moreover, by construction of the spline models for these four principal descriptors, the effective range for each descriptor was identified."}

Nontargeted gadolinium-loaded liposomes were achieved by incorporating amphipathic material, Gd (III) [N,N-bis-stearylamidomethyl-N'-amidomethyl] diethylenetriamine tetraacetic acid, into the liposome membrane using lipid film hydration method. GBI-10, as the targeting ligand, was then conjugated onto the liposome surface to get GBI-10-targeted gadolinium-loaded liposomes (GTLs). Both nontargeted gadolinium-loaded liposomes and GTLs displayed good dispersion stability, optimal size, and zeta potential for tumor targeting, as well as favorable imaging properties with enhanced relaxivity compared with a commercial MRI contrast agent (CA), gadopentetate dimeglumine. The use of GBI-10 aptamer in this liposomal system was intended to result in increased accumulation of gadolinium at the periphery of C6 glioma cells, where the targeting extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C is overexpressed. Increased cellular binding of GTLs to C6 cells was confirmed by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and MRI, demonstrating the promise of this novel delivery system as a carrier of MRI contrast agent for the diagnosis of tumor. These studies provide a new strategy furthering the development of nanomedicine for both diagnosis and therapy of tumor."}

Cell physiology^\nPharmacological chaperone corrects lysosomal storage in Fabry disease caused by trafficking-incompetent variants.^\nFabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) resulting in lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipid globotriosylceramide Gb3. Misfolded alpha-Gal A variants can have residual enzyme activity but are unstable. Their lysosomal trafficking is impaired because they are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by quality control. Subinhibitory doses of the competitive inhibitor of alpha-Gal A, 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (DGJ), stabilize mutant alpha-Gal A in vitro and correct the trafficking defect. We showed by immunolabeling that the chaperone-like action of DGJ significantly reduces the lysosomal Gb3 storage in human Fabry fibroblasts harboring the novel mutations T194I and V390fsX8. The specificity of the DGJ effect was proven by RNA interference. Electron microscopic morphometry demonstrated a reduction of large-size, disease-associated lysosomes and loss of characteristic multilamellar lysosomal inclusions on DGJ treatment. In addition, the pre-Golgi intermediates were decreased. However, the rough ER was not different between DGJ-treated and untreated cells. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that DGJ treatment resulted in maturation and stabilization of mutant alpha-Gal A. Genes involved in cell stress signaling, heat shock response, unfolded protein response, and ER-associated degradation show no apparent difference in expression between untreated and DGJ-treated fibroblasts. The DGJ treatment has no apparent cytotoxic effects. Thus our data show the usefulness of a pharmacological chaperone for correction of the lysosomal storage in Fabry fibroblasts harboring different mutations with residual enzyme activity. Pharmacological chaperones acting on misfolded, unstable mutant proteins that exhibit residual biological activity offer a convenient and cost-efficient therapeutic strategy."}

We report on the cases of 3 patients diagnosed with spinal cord DCS presenting with severe neurologic symptoms after scuba diving.	Of 175 patients with DCS referred to the Tokyo Metropolitan Ebara Hospital Department of Neurosurgery, 3 were determined by MR imaging and neurologic examination to have a spinal cord injury. Hyperbaric oxygen, methylprednisolone, and rehabilitation therapies were applied to these patients. We examined whether the severity of the patients' neurologic dysfunction, classified according to Fränkel's grade, was associated with the extent of abnormal signals depicted by spinal MR imaging in these patients at the acute phase and monthly follow-up points. T2-weighted MR imaging performed within 24 hours of the onset of the patients' neurologic symptoms revealed signals of increased intensity located predominantly in the dorsolateral regions, involving spinal segments 1 through 4, and a neurologic examination upon admission revealed severe sensory and motor dysfunction (Fränkel's grade A) in all 3 patients. The abnormal signals on MR images at 1 month postinjury were markedly decreased in size as compared with those at the acute phase. However, neurologic function showed minimal or no improvement (Fränkel's grade A or B).	In patients with spinal cord DCS, the improvement in MR imaging findings was not associated with improved clinical status. This discrepancy suggests that intricate pathophysiologic changes, reversible and persistent damage subsequent to initial cord injuries (ie, edematous and neurotoxic lesions), underlie the disease and affect the clinical course."}

In group B, the biomarkers were significantly increased compared to the other groups (P < 0.001), except for NO which in group B decreased significantly (P < 0.001). In group B, there was a higher inflammatory infiltration level (80.67%) in relation to destroyed fibers.

Rodent models of brain diseases have spurred understanding of pathology but the concern arises that they may not recapitulate the full spectrum of neuron disruptions associated with human neuropathology. iPSC derived neurons, or other neural cell types, provide the ability to access pathology in cells derived directly from a patient's blood sample or skin biopsy where availability of brain tissue is limiting. Thus, utilization of iPSC to study brain diseases provides an unlimited resource for disease modelling but may also be used for drug screening for effective therapies and may potentially be used to regenerate aged or damaged cells in the future. Many brain diseases across the spectrum of neurodevelopment, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric are being approached by iPSC models. The goal of an iPSC based disease model is to identify a cellular phenotype that discriminates the disease-bearing cells from the control cells. In this mini-review, the importance of iPSC cell models validated for pluripotency, germline competency and function assessments is discussed. Selected examples for the variety of brain diseases that are being approached by iPSC technology to discover or establish the molecular basis of the neuropathology are discussed."}

Angiogenesis participates in the development of collaterals. Spironolactone is an aldosterone receptor antagonist used to control fluid overload in cirrhotic patients although recent studies suggest that it also inhibits angiogenesis. This study investigated the effect of spironolactone on abnormal angiogenesis and portal-systemic collaterals in cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by common bile duct ligation (BDL), and sham-operated rats were the controls. The BDL and sham rats received spironolactone (20 mg/kg/d, oral gavage) or vehicle from day 15 to 28 after the operations. Spironolactone did not influence the portal and systemic hemodynamic, and the renal and hepatic biochemistry data, but it significantly ameliorated hepatic fibrosis, portal-systemic shunting, and mesenteric angiogenesis. Plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and the mesenteric protein expression of VEGF and phosphor-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) decreased in the spironolactone group. Spironolactone did not affect motor activity or plasma ammonia levels. The down-regulation of VEGF pathway participates, albeit partly, in the antiangiogenic effect of spironolactone.

The secretion of pituitary PL is under hypothalamic control. The cytokines IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6 also stimulate production, while IFN-gamma and endothelin-3 are inhibitory. PL exerts its effects via PL receptors (PLr) which exist as three isoforms. PL regulates reproduction, osmoregulation, and behavior and has potent immunomodulatory effects. PL is structurally related to members of the cytokine/hematopoietic family such as erythropoietin, GM-CSF, growth hormone, and IL-2 to IL-7. The PLr is a member of the cytokine/hematopoietic receptor family. Interaction of PL with PLr activates the Jak kinases which phosphorylate latent STAT proteins resulting in the activation of transcription. PL counteracts the effects of corticosteroids by enhancing Th1 cellular responses. Perturbations of PL physiology have significant immunologic effects. Hypoprolactinemia impairs immune function while hyperprolactinemia enhances active systemic lupus erythematosus, Reiter's disease, juvenile and adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, and cardiac allograft rejection. PL gene polymorphisms have now been shown to be linked to RA. Thus, manipulation of PL may have significant clinical utility. Further study of the relationship of the PL/PLr complex, other hormones, and the immune system will provide further insights into the potential therapeutic utility of this complex in immune diseases."}

Food and water consumption and body weight were monitored daily. As a measure of referred hyperalgesia, tail-flick latency was measured daily, before and 4 h after analgesia administration. Compared with those of the no-surgery controls, significant decreases in food consumption and body weight occurred 24 h after surgery without analgesics. There were nonsignificant reductions in these effects by analgesics, but the benefits were not significantly different than those of saline. These parameters continued to be decreased with variable significance in the buprenorphine groups at 48 and 72 h after surgery. In both buprenorphine-treated groups, water consumption was significantly increased at 24 h after surgery but not at 48 or 72 h. Tail-flick latency was not significantly different between the no-surgery and no-analgesia groups but was significantly increased 4 h after high-dose buprenorphine administration and declined nonsignificantly over time in the other groups. We conclude that painful effects from surgery are present primarily during the first 24 h after surgery. The analgesic regimens tested did not completely reduce these effects.

Work in an animal model has established that the magnitude of donor motor input received by heterotopically transferred muscle correlates with reinnervation and force production, the corollary being that standardising donor motor input could standardise outcome. We hypothesise that a 'low-capacity' interposed nerve graft could deliver a fixed motor input to an FMT despite variable motor input, thereby standardising force production and clinical outcome. To test this hypothesis, we compared reinnervation and force production by FMTs reinnervated with different-sized motor inputs via high- and low-capacity interposed nerve grafts. Force production was measured in vivo after recovery of transplanted muscle, and reinnervation quantified by both nerve morphometry and intramuscular immunohistochemical staining for protein gene product 9.5. Both reinnervation and force production data suggest that outcome correlates with donor motor nerve magnitude only when a high-capacity interposed nerve graft is used, this correlation being lost when using a low-capacity interposed nerve graft.

Taking advantage of this feature, we also showed that lentivirus-mediated CRAG expression in the Purkinje cells of mice expressing polyQ resulted in clearance of the polyQ aggregates and rescue from ataxia. However, the molecular basis of the function of CRAG in cell survival against polyQ remains unclear. Here we report that CRAG, but not centaurin-γ3, induces transcriptional activation of c-Fos-dependent activator protein-1 (AP-1) via serum response factor (SRF). Mutation analysis indicated that the nuclear localization signal and both the N- and C-terminal regions of CRAG are critical for SRF-dependent c-Fos activation. CRAG knockdown by siRNA or expression of a dominant negative mutant of CRAG significantly attenuated the c-Fos activation triggered by either polyQ or the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Importantly, c-Fos expression partially rescued the enhanced cytotoxicity of CRAG knockdown in polyQ-expressing or MG132-treated cells. Finally, we suggest the possible involvement of CRAG in the sulfiredoxin-mediated antioxidant pathway via AP-1.

The rational basis for the therapeutic use of orthosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of nicotinic receptors arises from the finding that functional nicotinic receptors are ubiquitously expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues including brain regions highly vulnerable to traumatic and ischemic types of injury (e.g., cortex and hippocampus). Moreover, functional nicotinic receptors do not vanish in age-, disease- and trauma-related neuropathologies, but their expression and/or activation levels decline in a subunit- and brain region-specific manner. Therefore, augmenting the endogenous cholinergic tone by nicotinic agents is possible and may offset neurological impairments associated with cholinergic hypofunction. Importantly, because neuronal damage elevates extracellular levels of choline (a selective agonist of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) near the site of injury, α7-PAM-based treatments may augment pathology-activated α7-dependent auto-therapies where and when they are most needed (i.e., in the penumbra, post-injury). Thus, nicotinic-PAM-based treatments are expected to augment the endogenous cholinergic tone in a spatially and temporally restricted manner creating the potential for differential efficacy and improved safety as compared to exogenous orthosteric nicotinic agonists that activate nicotinic receptors indiscriminately. In this review, I will summarize the existing trends in therapeutic applications of nicotinic PAMs."}

To perform more extensive biochemical characterization and to develop new approaches for enzyme therapy, a method of producing and purifying recombinant alpha-galactosidase A suitable for scale-up manufacture for use in humans is needed. Previously, a catalytically active recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A was expressed using a baculovirus vector and purified using conventional chromatography.

In particular, ageing and cancer share some common origins and hallmarks such as genomic instability, epigenetic alteration, aberrant telomeres, inflammation and immune injury, reprogrammed metabolism, and degradation system impairment (including within the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagic machinery). Recent advances indicate that damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) such as high mobility group box 1, histones, S100, and heat shock proteins play location-dependent roles inside and outside the cell. These provide interaction platforms at molecular levels linked to common hallmarks of ageing and cancer. They can act as inducers, sensors, and mediators of stress through individual plasma membrane receptors, intracellular recognition receptors (e.g., advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptors, AIM2-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, and NOD1-like receptors, and toll-like receptors), or following endocytic uptake. Thus, the DAMP Hypothesis is novel and complements other theories that explain the features of ageing. DAMPs represent ideal biomarkers of ageing and provide an attractive target for interventions in ageing and age-associated diseases."}

During normal development, GNPs divide in response to Sonic hedgehog (SHH), a ligand that binds to the patched (PTCH) receptor on GNPs. If one copy of the Ptch gene is lost, as in human Gorlin's syndrome and in Ptch(+/-) mice, MBs may form. Proper transduction of the SHH signal critically depends on primary cilia. Loss of primary cilia results in improper signal reception and failure to properly activate SHH target genes. KIF3a, part of a kinesin motor, is required for formation of primary cilia. Here, we use tamoxifen-induced ablation of Kif3a in GNPs of postnatal Ptch(+/-) mouse cerebella to show that KIF3a is necessary for MB formation. To investigate the importance of primary cilia in established tumors, we deleted Kif3a from cultured cells and from tumor cell grafts. The loss of Kif3a from established tumors led to their growth arrest and regression. MBs behave as if they are addicted to the presence of primary cilia. These results underscore the potential utility of agents that disrupt cilia for the treatment of Hh pathway-related MBs."}

However, most investigations of this drug in animals have only assessed its antinociceptive effect, presumably because of the difficulty in developing animal models of spasticity. This study attempted to evaluate both, the antinociceptive and antispastic action of (-)-baclofen (the more active enantiomer) by incorporating the chronic spinal preparation, in which spasticity gradually develops following spinal transection. Separate groups of intact, acute (1 day) or chronic (20-25 days) spinal rats were pretested on the nociceptive tail-flick (TF) assay prior to either subcutaneous (SC; 1-30 mg/kg) or intrathecal (IT; 0.1-12 micrograms) injection of (-)-baclofen and retested at specific post-injection intervals. Hindlimb spasticity was elicited in chronic spinal rats by mechanical stimulation to the abdomen. Because the clinical use of baclofen generally involves chronic administration, both responses were tested for 3 successive days to assess tolerance. Results confirmed the analgesic effect of SC and IT (-)-baclofen in intact rats. As previously reported, the antinociceptive effect of IT (-)-baclofen was increased in acute spinal rats. However, three weeks after spinalization there was a profound decrease in this response. In contrast, antinociception produced by SC (-)-baclofen was reduced in acute and chronic spinal rats compared to intact animals; but there was no difference between the acute and chronic conditions. In spite of this differential decrease in antinociception after IT, relative to SC, administration, both routes of administration produced an antispastic effect in chronic spinal rats. There was no antinociceptive tolerance to SC administration and only minimal tolerance to IT (-)-baclofen (in intact rats); the antispastic effect did not become tolerant. A peripheral action might explain the dichotomy between SC and IT (-)-baclofen in regard to antinociception. However, further research is needed to determine why both routes of administration were effective against spasticity while only SC (-)-baclofen retained an antinociceptive action in chronic spinal rats."}

However, no study has examined the direct effects of heating carotid artery smooth muscle and tested the hypothesis that hyperthermia induces arterial vasoconstriction and, thereby, decreases cerebral blood flow. We recorded isometric tension of rabbit carotid artery strips in organ baths during stepwise temperature elevation. The heating responses were tested at basal tone, in norepinephrine- and KCl-precontracted vessels, and after electrical field stimulation. Stepwise heating from 37 degrees C to 47 degrees C induced reproducible graded contraction proportional to temperature. The responses could be elicited at basal tone and in precontracted vessels. Heating decreased the contractile responses to norepinephrine and electrical field stimulation but increased contraction to KCl. These responses were not eliminated by pretreatment with the neuronal blocker tetrodotoxin. Our results demonstrate that heating carotid artery preparations above 37 degrees C (normothermia) induced a reversible graded vasoconstriction proportional to temperature. In vivo this reaction may lead to a decrease in cerebral blood flow and cerebral ischemia with brain damage as in heatstroke. The heating-induced contraction is not mediated by a neurogenic process but is due to altered transcellular Ca2+ transport. Cooling, in particular of the neck area, therefore, should be used in the treatment of heatstroke."}

Facilitation of NMDA receptor function by co-agonists (D-serine or glycine) only partially alleviates the symptoms in schizophrenia; other means to facilitate NMDA receptors are required. NMDA receptor sub-types differ in their subunit composition, with varied GluN2 subunits (GluN2A-GluN2D) imparting different physiological, biochemical and pharmacological properties. CIQ is a positive allosteric modulator that is selective for GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors (Mullasseril et al.).	The effect of systemic administration of CIQ was tested on impairment in prepulse inhibition (PPI), hyperlocomotion and stereotypy induced by i.p. administration of MK-801 and methamphetamine. The effect of CIQ was also tested on MK-801-induced impairment in working memory in Y-maze spontaneous alternation test.	We found that systemic administration of CIQ (20 mg·kg⁻¹, i.p.) in mice reversed MK-801 (0.15 mg·kg⁻¹, i.p.)-induced, but not methamphetamine (3 mg·kg⁻¹, i.p.)-induced, deficit in PPI. MK-801 increased the startle amplitude to pulse alone, which was not reversed by CIQ. In contrast, methamphetamine reduced the startle amplitude to pulse alone, which was reversed by CIQ. CIQ also partially attenuated MK-801- and methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and stereotyped behaviours. Additionally, CIQ reversed the MK-801-induced working memory deficit in spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze.

Current study was designed to investigate a suppressive effect of tropisetron on VCR-induced neuropathy and whether this effect exerts through the 5-HT3 receptor or not. Neuropathy was induced in rats by administration of vincristine (0.5mg/kg, 3 intraperitoneal injections on alternate days) and in treatment group, tropisetron (3mg/kg); m-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG), a selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist (15mg/kg); tropisetron (3mg/kg) plus mCPBG (15mg/kg); granisetron, another selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (3mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally 1h prior to vincristine injection. Hot plate, open field tests (total distance moved, mean velocity and percentage of total duration of the movement) and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) were performed to evaluate the sensory and motor neuropathy. Further, plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the level of TNF-α in sciatic nerve were assessed as well as histological examination. In only VCR-treated rats hot plate latencies were significantly increased, total distance moved, mean velocity, total duration of the movement and sciatic MNCV significantly decreased compared with control. In tropisetron and tropisetron plus mCPBG groups, one injection of tropisetron prior to each VCR injection robustly diminished TNF-α and IL-2 levels, and also prevented mixed sensory-motor neuropathy, as indicated by less mortality rate, better general conditions, behavioral and electrophysiological studies. Moreover, pathological evidence confirmed the results obtained from other findings. But granisetron and mCPBG had no significant effect on the mentioned parameters. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that tropisetron significantly suppressed VCR-induced neuropathy and could be a neuroprotective agent for prevention of VCR-induced neuropathy via a receptor-independent pathway."}

The present study explores the possibility that the levels of endogenous BDNF determine the susceptibility to ischemic neuronal death. To block BDNF activity the authors used the TrkB-Fc fusion protein, which was infused intraventricularly in rats during 1 week before and 1 week after 5 or 30 minutes of global forebrain ischemia. Ischemic damage was quantified in the striatum and hippocampal formation after 1 week of reperfusion using immunocytochemistry and stereological procedures. After the 30-minute insult, there was a significantly lower number of surviving CA4 pyramidal neurons, neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive dentate hilar neurons, and choline acetyltransferase- and TrkA-positive, cholinergic striatal interneurons in the TrkB-Fc-infused rats as compared to controls. In contrast, the TrkB-Fc treatment did not influence survival of CA1 or CA3 pyramidal neurons or striatal projection neurons. Also, after the mild ischemic insult (5 minutes), neuronal death in the CA1 region was similar in the TrkB-Fc-treated and control groups. These results indicate that endogenous BDNF can protect certain neuronal populations against ischemic damage. It is conceivable, though, that efficient neuroprotection after brain insults is dependent not only on this factor but on the concerted action of a large number of neurotrophic molecules."}

However, the mechanisms of depression in epilepsy patients are poorly understood. Establishment of animal models of this comorbidity is critical for both understanding the mechanisms of the condition, and for preclinical development of effective therapies. The current study examined whether a commonly used animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by behavioural and biochemical alterations involved in depression. Male Wistar rats were subjected to LiCl and pilocarpine status epilepticus (SE). The development of chronic epileptic state was confirmed by the presence of spontaneous seizures and by enhanced brain excitability. Post-SE animals exhibited increase in immobility time under conditions of forced swim test (FST) which was indicative of despair-like state, and loss of taste preference in saccharin solution consumption test which pointed to the symptomatic equivalence of anhedonia. Biochemical studies revealed compromised serotonergic transmission in the raphe-hippocampal serotonergic pathway: decrease of serotonin (5-HT) concentration and turnover in the hippocampus, measured by high performance liquid chromatography, and decrease of 5-HT release from the hippocampus in response to raphe stimulation, measured by fast cyclic voltammetry. Administration of fluoxetine (FLX, 20 mg/kg/day for 10 days) to naive animals significantly shortened immobility time under conditions of FST, and inhibited 5-HT turnover in the hippocampus. In post-SE rats FLX treatment led to a further decrease of hippocampal 5-HT turnover; however, performance in FST was not improved. At the same time, FLX reversed SE-induced increase in brain excitability. In summary, our studies provide initial evidence that post-SE model of TLE might serve as a model of the comorbidity of epilepsy and depression. The finding that behavioural equivalents of depression were resistant to an antidepressant medication suggested that depression in epilepsy might have distinct underlying mechanisms beyond alterations in serotonergic pathways."}

However, there is no consensus regarding the dose and rate of infusion of cholecystokinin, both of which can alter the GEF, and the definition of an abnormal ejection fraction varies among studies. Many but not all studies have concluded that a low GEF predicts good outcomes after cholecystectomy, but most studies suffer from poor methodology and there is only one prospective randomized controlled trial. Also, some patients with a normal GEF have responded to cholecystectomy. Another controversial area has been the role of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) in patients with biliary-type pain and gallbladder in situ. Some reports suggest an overlap between SOD and low GEF, although a causal relationship has not been established. Yet another subject of interest is the role of visceral hyperalgesia in patients with acalculous biliary-type pain.

All three drugs improve motor signs of PD, and are effective in reducing motor fluctuations in patients undergoing long-term L-DOPA treatment. The effect of MAOB inhibitors on non-motor symptoms is not uniform and may not be class-related. Selegiline and rasagiline are irreversible inhibitors forming a covalent bond within the active site of MAOB. In contrast, safinamide is a reversible MAOB inhibitor, and also inhibits voltage- sensitive sodium channels and glutamate release. Safinamide is the prototype of a new generation of multi-active MAOB inhibitors, which includes the antiepileptic drug, zonisamide. Inhibition of MAOB-mediated dopamine metabolism largely accounts for the antiparkinsonian effect of the three drugs. Dopamine metabolism by MAOB generates reactive oxygen species, which contribute to nigro-striatal degeneration. Among all antiparkinsonian agents, MAOB inhibitors are those with the greatest neuroprotective potential because of inhibition of dopamine metabolism, induction of neurotrophic factors, and, in the case of safinamide, inhibition of glutamate release.

Clinical trials testing the therapeutic efficacy of high-dose αTOC against stroke have largely failed or reported negative outcomes when a 'more is better' approach to supplementation (>400 IU/d) was used. This work addresses mechanisms by which supraphysiologic αTOC may contribute to stroke-induced brain injury. Ischemic stroke injury and the neuroinflammatory response were studied in tocopherol transfer protein-deficient mice maintained on a diet containing αTOC vitamin E at the equivalent human dose of 1680 IU/d. Ischemic stroke-induced brain injury was exacerbated in the presence of supraphysiologic brain αTOC levels. At 48 h after stroke, S100B and RAGE expression was increased in stroke-affected cortex of mice with elevated brain αTOC levels. Such increases were concomitant with aggravated microglial activation and neuroinflammatory signaling. A poststroke increase in markers of oxidative injury and neurodegeneration in the presence of elevated brain αTOC establish that at supraphysiologic levels, αTOC potentiates neuroinflammatory responses to acute ischemic stroke. Exacerbation of microglial activation by excessive αTOC likely depends on its unique cell signaling regulatory properties independent of antioxidant function. Against the background of clinical failure for high-dose αTOC, outcomes of this work identify risk for exacerbating stroke-induced brain injury as a result of supplementing diet with excessive levels of αTOC."}

Thrombin generation (TG) is a cornerstone of coagulation cascade, and represents a critical biomarker of atherothrombosis. We, therefore, sought to define the effect of D in escalating concentrations on the time course of TG using the Calibrated Automated Thrombogram(®) (CAT) technology in patients after ischemic stroke. Serial plasma samples were obtained from 20 patients with ischemic stroke documented by neuroimaging, who were treated with aspirin for at least 30 days. The impact of 0.1, 0.23, 0.46, 0.69 mM D in platelet-poor plasma (PPP) on TG indices was assessed using fluorogenic substrate CAT device. The following integrated CAT parameters: TGmax, start time (t-start) peak time (t-peak), and mean time (t-mean) were calculated for each D dose and compared with those of the vehicle. Preincubation of PPP with D resulted in dose-dependent significant inhibition of most TG indices. The TGmax was gradually reduced from 447 ± 21 nM at baseline and reach significance for 0.46 mM D (355 ± 44 nM, P = 0.03); and decreased further at 0.69 mM D to 302 ± 27 nM (P = 0.01). The t-peak has been achieved 2-3 times later than after vehicle already at 0.23 nM D. The t-start was delayed 3-4 fold starting from 0.23 mM concentration of D (P < 0.001 for all), but not different from D 0.1 mM (1.5 vs. 1.6; P = 0.34). The t-mean was not significantly affected by D.

Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and flumazenil (FMZ) binding in the cat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and in patients with acute ischemic hemispheric stroke were reviewed. After permanent MCAO, the development of 'misery-perfused' penumbral tissue and its centrifugal conversion into necrosis could be demonstrated, resembling focal pathophysiological changes in patients with ischemic attacks. In the experimental model and in vascular insults in humans, a chance of recovery existed if collateral perfusion developed spontaneously within the first hours. In transient MCAO, reperfusion was only effective in preventing infarction when it was initiated as long as misery perfusion persisted; in these cases tissue was salvaged and large infarcts did not develop. In the other instances when oxygen metabolism broke down, and an increased OEF was no longer seen, reperfusion even at levels above preocclusion had no effect, and large space-occupying infarcts developed. These experimental findings are comparable to the variable outcome after thrombolytic therapy; if reperfusion is achieved within the therapeutic window of tissue viability, large infarcts are prevented and complete or partial recovery can be achieved. In the experimental model of focal ischemia and in human stroke, FMZ can be utilized as a marker of neuronal integrity. If FMZ binding in the cortex is decreased below 4 times the mean value of white matter in the acute stage, permanent infarcts were observed on late CT/MRI; this irreversible damage could not be prevented by thrombolytic therapy.

In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect and anti-inflammatory actions of osthole, a natural coumarin derivative, in both in vivo and in vitro TBI models. We first prepared a mouse model of cortical stab wound brain injury, investigated the capacity for osthole to prevent secondary brain injury and further examined the underlying mechanism. We revealed that osthole significantly improved the neurological function, increased the number of neurons beside injured site. Additionally, osthole treatment reduced the expression of microglia and glial scar, lowered the level of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and blocked the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Furthermore, the protective effect of osthole was also examined in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to scratch injury. Treatment of osthole prominently suppressed cell apoptosis and inflammatory factors release by blocking injury-induced IκB-α phosphorylation and NF-κB translocation, and upregulated the IκB-α which functions in the NF-κB signaling pathway of SH-SY5Y cells. However, NF-κB signaling pathway was inhibited by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-κB inhibitor, the anti-inflammatory effect of osthole was abolished. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that osthole attenuated inflammatory response by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway in TBI."}

However, the signaling mechanisms that induce autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) dysfunction are not well understood. The present study investigates the contributions of protein kinase C delta (PKCδ)-mediated signaling events in MA-induced autophagy, UPS dysfunction, and cell death. Using an in vitro mesencephalic dopaminergic cell culture model, we demonstrate that MA-induced early induction of autophagy is associated with reduction in proteasomal function and concomitant dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), followed by significantly increased PKCδ activation, caspase-3 activation, accumulation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates and microtubule-associated light chain-3 (LC3-II) levels. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCδ or overexpression of cleavage-resistant mutant of PKCδ dramatically reduced MA-induced autophagy, proteasomal function, and associated accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, which closely paralleled cell survival. Importantly, when autophagy was inhibited either pharmacologically (3-MA) or genetically (siRNA-mediated silencing of LC3), the dopaminergic cells became sensitized to MA-induced apoptosis through caspase-3 activation. Conversely, overexpression of LC3 partially protected against MA-induced apoptotic cell death, suggesting a neuroprotective role for autophagy in MA-induced neurotoxicity. Notably, rat striatal tissue isolated from MA-treated rats also exhibited elevated LC3-II, ubiquitinated protein levels, and PKCδ cleavage. Taken together, our data demonstrate that MA-induced autophagy serves as an adaptive strategy for inhibiting mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death and degradation of aggregated proteins. Our results also suggest that the sustained activation of PKCδ leads to UPS dysfunction, resulting in the activation of caspase-3-mediated apoptotic cell death in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system."}

The corneal endothelium in anesthetized mice was surgically injured in vivo under direct visualization. The secretion of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) into the aqueous humor was analyzed with western blotting. The expression of FGF2, Snai1, Zeb1, Col1a1, Col1a2, Fn1, Vim, Cdk2, Ccne1, and Cdh1 was analyzed with semiquantitative RT-PCR in the mouse corneal endothelium ex vivo and in vivo. Knockdown of FGF2 was done using siRNA. Col8a2 was used as a corneal endothelial marker, and Keratocan (Ktcn) was used as a stromal marker. β-actin was used as a loading control.	Sequential expression of IL-1β and FGF2 was detected in the aqueous humor after surgical injury. FGF2 treatment induced expression of endothelial to mesenchymal transition-related genes including Snai1, and Zeb1 in the mouse ex vivo corneal endothelium. This led to increased expression of Col1a1, Col1a2, Fn1, and Vim and suppression of Cdh1 in a time-dependent manner. Expression of FGF2, Snai1, Zeb1, Col1a1, Col1a2, Fn1, Vim, Cdk2, and Ccne1 was completely abolished by FGF2 siRNA knockdown in the mouse corneal endothelium ex vivo. Surgical injury induced FGF2 expression in the in vivo mouse corneal endothelium. The injury-dependent expression of FGF2, Snai1, Zeb1, Col1a1, Col1a2, Fn1, Vim, Cdk2, and Ccne1 and the suppression of Cdh1 were inhibited by siRNA knockdown of FGF in the mouse corneal endothelium in vivo. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of FGF2 inhibited the formation of the injury-dependent retrocorneal membrane in the in vivo mouse corneal endothelium.	These findings suggest that after surgical injury, FGF2 induces the expression of EndoMT-related genes Snai1, Zeb1, Col1a1, Col1a2, Fn1, Vim, Cdk2, and Ccne1 in the mouse corneal endothelium in vivo, similar to the human corneal endothelium ex vivo."}

Eight-week-old male Wistar rats (n = 90) were randomly divided into three groups: sham procedure, chronic constriction injury, and chronic constriction injury plus vein wrapping. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds and walking patterns were measured with use of von Frey filaments and the CatWalk system, respectively. We investigated L4-L5 dorsal root ganglia immunohistochemically at fourteen days postsurgery and sciatic nerves histologically at fourteen days and again five months postsurgery. Concentrations of several sciatic neurotrophic factors in the ligated sciatic nerves were quantified with use of ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).	In behavioral tests, the rats in which the chronic constriction injury had been followed by vein wrapping displayed significantly greater pain responses than the sham group, and the group with untreated chronic constriction injury showed greater pain responses than the vein-wrapping group (both p < 0.05). Immunoreactive markers of inflammation and nerve damage, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3), were upregulated in dorsal root ganglion neurons in the constriction-injury and vein-wrapping groups compared with those in the sham group, with greater upregulation in the constriction-injury group than in the vein-wrapping group (both p < 0.01). Histologic observation showed marked nerve degeneration and scar tissue formation around the sciatic nerve in the constriction-injury group, but these effects were prevented to some extent in the vein-wrapping group. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels at one and three days postsurgery and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels at three, seven, fourteen, and twenty-eight days postsurgery were significantly higher in the vein-wrapping group than in the other groups (p < 0.05).	Vein wrapping decreased pain-associated behavior and nerve damage caused by chronic constriction injury. VEGF and HGF produced in response to vein grafts may play a mechanistic role.

Some forms of structural plasticity do not follow Hebbian- or anti-Hebbian paradigms of plasticity but rather appear to contribute to the homeostasis of network activity.

Furthermore, classical methods of autophagy induction used with nonneural cells, such as starvation, simply result in neuron death. To study neuronal autophagy, we cultured primary cortical neurons from transgenic mice that ubiquitously express green fluorescent protein-tagged LC3 and monitored LC3-I to LC3-II conversion by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Evaluation of different culture media led us to discover that culturing primary neurons in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without B27 supplementation robustly activates autophagy. We validated this nutrient-limited media approach for inducing autophagy by showing that 3-methyl-adenine treatment and Atg5 RNA interference knockdown each inhibits LC3-I to LC3-II conversion. Evaluation of B27 supplement components yielded insulin as the factor whose absence induced autophagy in primary neurons, and this activation was mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent. When we tested if nutrient-limited media could protect neurons expressing polyglutamine-expanded proteins against cell death, we observed a strong protective effect, probably due to autophagy activation. Our results indicate that nutrient deprivation can be used to understand the regulatory basis of neuronal autophagy and implicate diminished insulin signaling in the activation of neuronal autophagy."}

These facts have drawn attention to this indole, triggering interest in evaluating its changes and in its relationship to the processes indicated, and analyzing its role in the mechanisms involved at the onset and development of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as its therapeutic potential. Multiple sclerosis, the most common cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults, is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease, characterized by demyelination, inflammation, and neuronal and oxidative damage. In its early diagnosis, it often requires a differential screening with other neurodegenerative diseases with similar symptoms, such as Huntington's disease, an autosomal dominant disorder. The onset of both diseases occurs in the second or third decade of life. On the other hand, cerebral ischemia is a major cause of human disability all over the world. Although a cerebral stroke can occur as the result of different damaging insults, severe ischemia produces the death of neuronal cells within minutes. Changes in melatonin levels have been observed in these processes (Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and cerebral ischemia) as part of their pathogenic features. This review aims to update and discuss the role played by melatonin during neurodegenerative processes, specifically in multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and cerebral ischemia, and its possible therapeutic use.

Here we compare DA efflux and metabolism in the striatum and the substantia nigra in dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic animals following a standard dose of L-DOPA. Rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions were treated chronically with L-DOPA, monitored on the abnormal involuntary movements scale, and then subjected to intracerebral microdialysis under freely-moving conditions. Following s.c. L-DOPA injection, peak extracellular DA levels in both striatum and substantia nigra were about twice as large in dyskinetic animals compared to non-dyskinetic rats. This effect was not attributable to differences in DOPA levels or DA metabolism.

Striatal levels of serotonin and its main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid were indeed elevated in dyskinetic animals compared to non-dyskinetic rats, indicating a larger serotonergic innervation density in the former group. High DA release was, however, not sufficient to explain dyskinesia.

However, little is known concerning the effect of HPC on traumatic brain injury (TBI). We designed this study to investigate the effect of HPC on TBI and explore its underlying mechanisms. We found that HPC significantly alleviates neurological dysfunction, lessens brain edema, reduces cell apoptosis, increases neuronal survival, up-regulates the expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1, and decreases the inducer of protein carbonyls, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine in the brain tissue of rats 24h after brain injury. However, no influence was observed in normal rats after only 3d of hypoxic training. Results further indicated that HPC protects the brain against traumatic damage. This protective effect may be achieved by up-regulating Nrf2 and HO-1 expression and alleviating oxidative stress damage."}

In guinea pigs, TAK-029 at 30 micrograms/kg (i.v.) inhibited ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation completely and prolonged BT to 4.5 times the control value 5 min after administration, and it prevented thrombotic occlusion in 2 out of 5 animals in a photochemically-induced basilar thrombosis model. TAK-029 at 100 micrograms/kg (i.v.) prolonged BT more than 9 times 5 min after administration, and it prevented thrombus formation for over 60 min. In dogs, TAK-029 at 30 micrograms/kg (i.v.) inhibited ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation by 87% 5 min after administration, and it prevented thrombotic occlusion in injured and stenosed coronary arteries for 22 min without prolonging the BT.

Previous studies have demonstrated that cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) are involved in the pathogeneses of stroke. Therefore, in vivo and in vitro studies were designed to investigate the effects of magnolol on I-R-induced neural injury and BBB dysfunction. In cerebral I-R model of mice, cerebral infarct volumes, brain water content, and the exudation of Evans blue were significantly reduced by intravenous injection with magnolol at the doses of 1.4, 7.0, and 35.0 μg/kg. When primary cultured microglial cells were treated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus increasing concentrations of magnolol, ranging from 0.01 to 10 μmol/L, magnolol could statistically inhibit LPS-induced NO release, TNF-α secretion, and expression of p65 subunit of NF-κB in the nucleus of microglial cells. In the media of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), oxygen and glucose deprivation-reperfusion (OGD-R) could remarkably lead to the elevation of TNF-α and IL-1β levels, while magnolol evidently reversed these effects. In BBB model in vitro, magnolol dose- and time-dependently declined BBB hyperpermeability induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), OGD-R, and ephrin-A1 treatment. More importantly, magnolol could obviously inhibit phosphorylation of EphA2 (p-EphA2) not only in ephrin-A1-treated BMECs but also in cerebral I-R model of mice. In contrast to p-EphA2, magnolol significantly increased ZO-1 and occludin levels in BMECs subjected to OGD. Taken together, magnolol can protect neural damage from cerebral ischemia- and OGD-reperfusion, which may be associated with suppressing cerebral inflammation and improving BBB function."}

Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophic factor produced by MSCs and may contribute to their therapeutic efficacy. The purpose of the current study was to determine if BDNF is elevated in infarcted brain and in which compartment of blood (plasma or serum) after intravenous MSC infusion in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in the rat.	In rats, a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced by intraluminal vascular occlusion with a microfilament and MSCs were intravenously administered 6 h after right MCAO induction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of brain, serum and plasma BDNF were performed after the MSC infusion following the MCAO induction. Lesion volume was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. Functional outcome was assessed using the Limb Placement Test.	Infused MSCs reduced lesion volume and elicited functional improvement compared to the vehicle infused group. ELISA analysis of the MSC treated group revealed an increase BDNF levels in the infarcted hemisphere of the brain and plasma, but not in serum. The MSC group showed a greater increase in BDNF levels than sham control. In the MSC group, the expression of increased plasma BDNF levels correlated with increased brain BDNF levels.	These results support the hypothesis that BDNF levels in plasma, but not serum, may be more appropriate to detect circulating BDNF in vivo following MSC infusion in a cerebral infarction rat model of ischemic stroke.

The four members of the ErbB receptor family interact with diverse ligands and substrates, as well as with each other through cell surface heterodimerization. The sum of these diverse interactions is a signaling network that is complex but also finely regulated. Among the cellular functions influenced by ErbB signaling is cell survival. ErbB receptor signaling has been demonstrated to interact with all of the major mechanisms of cell death signaling in a manner that promotes cell survival. Survival factors such as Ras, PI3-K, Akt, and Bcl-x/-2 all have been shown to be activated by ErbB signaling (Fig. 5). ErbB abrogation of apoptotic signals has been shown to play an important role during embryonic tissue development, in normal adult tissue maintenance (e.g. mammary tissue, wound healing), and also in tumor development and progression. Although the majority of studies suggest that ErbB receptor family members are mediators of cell survival, there have been occasional reports suggesting that ErbB receptors can induce cell death under selected experimental conditions. While this apparent discrepancy remains unresolved, in many of these reports, cell death may be the result of anoikis in response to changes in the cytoskeleton associated with hyperstimulation of ErbB signaling. The notion that ErbB receptor family members function to promote cell survival is not a recent observation. However, how this family functions to prevent apoptosis is an area that only recently has been considered. The understanding of ErbB receptor signaling as it relates to the avoidance of apoptosis had profound implications for the treatment of solid tumors originating in multiple tissues, as well as for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. Further elucidation of the complex relationships between ErbB receptor signaling networks and the apoptotic machinery is certain to yield biologically important and potentially life-saving information."}

However, the mechanisms by which HFS alleviates these symptoms are not understood. Whereas initial studies focused on HFS-induced changes in neuronal firing rates, recent studies suggest that changes in patterns of neuronal activity may correlate with symptom alleviation. We hypothesized that effective STN HFS reduces the disorder of neuronal firing patterns in the basal ganglia thalamic circuit, minimizing the pathological activity associated with parkinsonism. Stimulating leads were implanted in the STN of two rhesus monkeys rendered parkinsonian by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Action potentials were recorded from neurons of the internal and external globus pallidus and the motor thalamus (ventralis anterior, ventralis lateralis pars oralis, and ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis) during HFS that reduced motor symptoms and during clinically ineffective low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Firing pattern entropy was calculated from the recorded spike times to quantify the disorder of the neuronal activity. The firing pattern entropy of neurons within each region of the pallidum and motor thalamus decreased in response to HFS (n > or = 18 and P < or = 0.02 in each region), whereas firing rate changes were specific to pallidal neurons only. In response to LFS, firing rates were unchanged, but firing pattern entropy increased throughout the circuit (n > or = 24 and P < or = 10(-4) in each region). These data suggest that the clinical effectiveness of HFS is correlated with, and potentially mediated by, a regularization of the pattern of neuronal activity throughout the basal ganglia thalamic circuit."}

The lattice arrangement and spacing of the collagen fibrils that allows for transparency may be disrupted due to genetic mutations and injuries. The purpose of this study is to examine the therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (UMSCs) in treating congenital and acquired corneal opacity associated with the loss of collagen V.	Experimental mice, i.e., wild-type, Col5a1[f/f] and Kera-Cre/Col5a1[f/f] (Col5a1[∆st/∆st] , collagen V null in the corneal stroma) mice in a C57BL/6J genetic background, were subjected to a lamellar keratectomy, and treated with or without UMSC (10[4] cells/cornea) transplantation via an intrastromal injection or a fibrin plug.

Col5a1[∆st/∆st] mice display a cloudy cornea phenotype that is ameliorated following intrastromal transplantation of UMSCs. Loss of collagen V in Col5a1[∆st/∆st] corneas augments the formation of cornea scarring following the keratectomy. UMSC transplantation with a fibrin plug improves the healing of injured corneas and regeneration of transparent corneas, as determined with in vivo HRT II confocal microscopy. Second harmonic confocal microscopy revealed the improved collagen fibril lamellar architecture in the UMSC-transplanted cornea in comparison to the control keratectomized corneas.	UMSC transplantation was successful in recovering some corneal transparency in injured corneas of wild-type, Col5a1[f/f] and Col5a1[∆st/∆st] mice.

We associated the ectopic occurrence of follicular melanin after chemotherapy with splenic melanosis - an interesting example of extradermal melanin localization - and we expected an increase in splenic melanin deposition after chemotherapy. Using the C57BL/6 murine model of synchronized hair cycle induced by depilation, we visualized splenic melanin by means of several histological and histochemical protocols of staining: hematoxylin and eosin, May-Grünwald-Giemsa and Fontana-Masson. Unexpectedly, the splenic deposition of melanin decreased due to application of cyclophosphamide (i.p. 120 mg/ kg body weight on day 9 post depilation). The drop was abrupt and lasted for at least 5 days (day 13-18 post depilation), as compared with normal hair cycle. Moreover, in mice with normal, depilation-induced hair cycle we observed a similar drop shortly before entering catagen (day 15 post depilation), followed by a slow and partial increase in splenic melanization up to day 27 post depilation in both groups. We conclude that cyclophosphamide negatively affects splenic melanization and/or extradermal transfer of ectopic melanin from the dystrophic hair follicles, but the most powerful down-regulator of splenic melanosis is normal and dystrophic catagen - the phase of hair follicle involution and re-modelling."}

Although NADPH oxidases (Noxs) play a crucial role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the role of Noxs in chemical burn-induced corneal injury remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the transcription and expression of Noxs in corneas were examined by RT-qPCR, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. It was found that alkali burns markedly upregulated the transcription and expression of Nox2 and Nox4 in human or mouse corneas. The inhibition of Noxs by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or apocynin (Apo) effectively attenuated alkali burn-induced ROS production and decreased 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) protein levels in the corneas. In addition, Noxs/CD11b double‑immunofluorescence staining indicated that Nox2 and Nox4 were partially co-localized with CD11b. DPI or Apo prevented the infiltration of CD11b-positive inflammatory cells, and inhibited the transcription of inflammatory cytokines following alkali burn-induced corneal injury. In our mouse model of alkali burn-induced corneal injury, corneal neovascularization (CNV) occurred on day 3, and it affected 50% of the whole area of the cornea on day 7, and on day 14, CNV coverage of the cornea reached maximum levels. DPI or Apo effectively attenuated alkali burn‑induced CNV and decreased the mRNA levels of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

Sarcopenia is defined as a progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function.

Pathophysiological mechanisms relating sarcopenia and NASH may include insulin resistance (IR) and increased inflammation. IR leads to accumulation of triglycerides in both muscle tissue and the liver. It also exacerbates proteolysis and leads to muscle depletion. Chronic inflammation leads to liver injury and progression of fibrosis. The inflammatory milieu also stimulates protein catabolism. Viewing skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ that secretes various salutary myokines may help us understand its role in the development of steatosis.

Several neuroprotective nutrients have been shown to enhance cognition, memory and other impaired functions seen in AD. Within recent years neuroprotective nutrients have gained more attention in the field of epigenetic. A growing body of evidence suggest that epigenetic changes triggered by dietary nutrients have an important role in health and in prevention of some diseases, especially neurodegenerative disorders. Several studies have shown that folic acid, vitamin B12, choline, zinc, selenium, dietary polyphenols are capable of interacting with epigenetic mechanisms and ultimately gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms resulting in neuronal dysfunction may be modified by diet. Therefore manipulation of epigenetic mechanisms via dietary nutrients may affect influence the vulnerability of neurons to degeneration which is seen in AD. The aim of this article is to provide a brief overview about the recent findings related to epigenetic alterations that are linked to AD pathogenesis, and to discuss the bioactive nutrients which can affect these epigenetic mechanisms."}

Brain research reviews^\nStrategies for repair of the deafferented spinal cord.^\nDeafferentation of the spinal cord by interruption of the sensory fibers in the dorsal roots highlights the problem of regeneration failure in the central nervous system. The injured dorsal root axons regenerate steadily, albeit slowly, in the peripheral compartment of the dorsal root, but abruptly cease to elongate when confronted with the interface between the peripheral and central nervous system, the dorsal root transitional zone (DRTZ). The glial cells of the CNS and their products together form this regeneration barrier. Recent years have witnessed several successful approaches to, at least in part, overcome this barrier. Particularly promising results have been obtained by (1). the replacement of adult non-regenerating dorsal root ganglion neurons with corresponding cells from embryonic or fetal donors, (2). the implantation of olfactory ensheathing cells at the DRTZ, and (3). immediate intrathecal infusion of growth factors to which dorsal root ganglion cells respond. In all these instances, growth of sensory axons into the adult spinal cord, as well as return of spinal cord connectivity, have been demonstrated. These findings suggest routes towards treatment strategies for plexus avulsion, and contribute to our understanding of possibilities to overcome regeneration failure in the spinal cord."}

The PLA50 tubes collapsed soon after implantation and, consequently, compressed the graft inside, leading to only occasional thin cables with SCs and a low number of myelinated axons: 17 +/- 6 at 1 and 158 +/- 11 at 2 months post-grafting. The cable contained 32 +/- 23 blood vessels at 2 weeks, 55 +/- 33 at 1 month and 46 +/- 30 at 2 months after implantation. PLA(100/10) tubes, on the other hand, were found to break up into large pieces, which compressed and sometimes protruded into the tissue cable inside. At all time points studied, however, cables contained SCs and were well vascularized with 414 +/- 47 blood vessels at 2 weeks, 437 +/- 139 at 1, 609 +/- 134 at 2 and 396 +/- 95 at 4 months post-grafting. The number of myelinated axons was 712 +/- 509 at 1 month, 1819 +/- 837 at 2 months and 609 +/- 132 at 4 months post implantation. These results demonstrated that fiber growth and myelination into a SC graft contained in a resorbable PLA(100/10) tube increases over the first 2 months post-implantation but decreases thereafter. Changes in geometry of both types of polymer tubes were detrimental to axonal regeneration. Future research should explore the use of polymers that better retain the appropriate mechanical, geometrical and permeability properties over time."}

One of the mechanisms of morphine tolerance involves γ-aminobutric acid (GABA), whose level is regulated by GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1). The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of GAT-1 in the spinal cord during morphine treatment. Morphine was administrated to rats via drinking water for 21 days. On day 21, a single dose of morphine (10mg/kg) was injected, followed by the administration of 5% formalin after 30 min. Expression of GAT-1 in the lumbar spinal cord during morphine treatment was analyzed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry assay. In another set of experiments, a morphine-tolerant group was treated with a GAT-1 inhibitor, ethyl nipecotate (60 mg/kg), 5 min prior to the formalin test. To assess a possible analgesic effect of the GAT-1 inhibitor, a non-tolerant group was injected only with ethyl nipecotate 5 min prior to the formalin test. Our results indicated that a chronic consumption of morphine led to morphine tolerance. Morphine tolerance was also concomitant with GAT-1 up-regulation in the lumbar spinal cord. The GAT-1 inhibitor ethyl nipecotate improved the antinociceptive effect of morphine in the morphine-tolerant group. Ethyl nipecotate also had an antinociceptive effect on the non-tolerant group. Thus, our data suggest that GAT-1 overexpression in the spinal cord plays an important role in morphine tolerance."}

The medicinal and food use of seed from the cycad plant (Cycas spp.), which contains the genotoxin cycasin, is a proposed etiological factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC), a prototypical neurodegenerative disease found in the western Pacific. Patients with ALS/PDC have a very high prevalence of glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus (in the range of 50-80%). We investigated whether the cycad plant toxin cycasin (methylazoxymethanol (MAM) beta-D-glucoside) or the aglycone MAM are toxic in vitro to mouse or human pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Mouse pancreatic islets treated for 6 days with cycasin impaired the beta-cell insulin response to glucose, but this effect was reversible after a further 4 days in culture without the toxin. When mouse islets were exposed for 24 hr to MAM/MAM acetate (MAMOAc; 0.1-1.0 mM), there was a dose-dependent impairment in insulin release and glucose metabolism, and a significant decrease in islet insulin and DNA content. At higher MAM/MAMOAc concentrations (1.0 mM), widespread islet cell destruction was observed. Glucose-induced insulin release remained impaired even after removal of MAM and a further culturing for 4 days without the toxin. MAM damages islets by two possible mechanisms: (a) nitric oxide generation, as judged by increased medium nitrite accumulation; and (b) DNA alkylation, as judged by increased levels of O6-methyldeoxyguanosine in cellular DNA. Incubation of mouse islets with hemin (10 or 100 microM), a nitric oxide scavenger, or nicotinamide (5-20 mM) protected beta-cells from a decrease in glucose oxidation by MAM. In separate studies, a 24 hr treatment of human beta-islet cells with MAMOAc (1.0 mM) produced a significant decrease in both insulin content and release in response to glucose. In conclusion, the present data indicate that cycasin and its aglycone MAM impair both rodent and human beta-cell function which may lead to the death of pancreatic islet cells. These data suggest that a 'slow toxin' may be a common aetiological factor for both diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative disease."}

While cholinolytics such as atropine are able to counteract muscarinic symptoms, they are unable to restore the impaired neuromuscular transmission (NMT). Here, oximes as potential reactivators of inhibited AChE may be effective. Until now, no unequivocal relation between oxime-induced increase in muscle force and reactivation has been demonstrated. To address this issue the isolated circumfused mouse hemidiaphragm was used as an experimental model. The muscle force generation upon tetanic stimuli was recorded during AChE inhibition by 1 microM paraoxon and after a wash-out period in the presence of obidoxime, pralidoxime and the experimental oximes HI 6, and HLö 7, 10 microM each. At the end of the experiments AChE activity was determined in the diaphragm homogenates by a radiometric assay. At 50-Hz stimulation, recovery was complete with obidoxime, nearly complete with HLö 7 but incomplete with HI 6 and pralidoxime. Only with obidoxime a significant increase in AChE activity was found. An increase of AChE to 10% of normal was sufficient to allow normal muscle force generation. When paraoxon was still present, obidoxime and HLö 7 were effective at 0.1 microM paraoxon, but failed so at paraoxon >1 microM. The data show different effectiveness of the oximes investigated in reactivation of muscle AChE and recovery of NMT after inhibition by paraoxon. Although an increase in muscle force by the oximes was accompanied by a measurable increase in AChE activity only in the case of obidoxime, the plot of muscle force against AChE activity as well as lacking evidence for a direct effect and adaptive processes indicate that reactivation of the enzyme is the main mechanism of NMT recovery. In agreement, in presence of AChE inhibitory concentrations of paraoxon during reactivation a reduced effectiveness of oximes was found."}

It has long been known that insulin-resistant conditions adversely affect general health status. A growing body of findings suggests that insulin contributes to normal brain functioning and that peripheral insulin abnormalities increase the risk for memory loss and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Potential mechanisms for these effects include insulin's role in cerebral glucose metabolism, peptide regulation, modulation of neurotransmitter levels, and modulation of many aspects of the inflammatory network. An intriguing question is whether insulin abnormalities also influence the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder characterized by elevated inflammatory biomarkers, central nervous system white matter lesions, axonal degeneration, and cognitive impairment. MS increases the risk for type 1 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the lack of association between MS and type 2 diabetes may suggest that insulin resistance affects patients with MS and the general population at the same alarming rate. Therefore, insulin resistance may exacerbate phenomena that are common to MS and insulin-resistant conditions, such as cognitive impairments and elevated inflammatory responses. Interestingly, the thiazolidinediones, which are used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes, have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents for both Alzheimer's disease and MS. The agents improve insulin sensitivity, reduce hyperinsulinemia, and exert anti-inflammatory actions. Ongoing studies will determine whether thiazolidinediones improve cognitive functioning for patients with type 2 diabetes or Alzheimer's disease. Future studies are needed to examine the effects of thiazolidinediones on patients with MS."}

Deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled in the USA since 1999, and this pattern is now occurring globally. Inappropriate opioid prescribing after surgery, particularly after discharge, is a major cause of this problem. Chronic postsurgical pain, occurring in approximately 10% of patients who have surgery, typically begins as acute postoperative pain that is difficult to control, but soon transitions into a persistent pain condition with neuropathic features that are unresponsive to opioids. Research into how and why this transition occurs has led to a stronger appreciation of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, use of more effective and safer opioid-sparing analgesic regimens, and non-pharmacological interventions for pain management. This Series provides an overview of the epidemiology and societal effect, basic science, and current recommendations for managing persistent postsurgical pain. We discuss the advances in the prevention of this transitional pain state, with the aim to promote safer analgesic regimens to better manage patients with acute and chronic pain."}

Improved endurance to particularly stressful periods is one of the medicinal claims for Marapuama (Ptychopetalum olacoides Bentham, PO), a popular Amazonian herbal. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if PO possesses anti-stress properties. To this end, an extract from PO (POEE) was evaluated on anxiety and glucose levels in mice submitted to the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) paradigm. POEE did not present anxiolytic effects, but was able to prevent (p<0.01) the UCMS-induced anxiety as assessed by the light/dark test (time spent in the lit area, POEE 100 and 300mg/kg 235.9+/-20.6s and 250.4+/-17.4s, respectively, compared to DMSO 104.7+/-24.4s).

Primary atrophic rhinitis usually develops as a consequence of an acute febrile illness in members of lower socioeconomic groups in developing areas of the world. The clinical setting and presence of culturable Klebsialla ozenae in the purulent, foul-smelling, nasal discharge of these patients forms the basis for diagnosis. An animal model for the disease exists in swine in which case an effective vaccine has been developed. Secondary atrophic rhinosinusitis is a condition that follows destruction of the nasal mucosa by any of a number of inflammatory processes including inflammatory diseases nasal/sinus surgery, and antiangiogenic therapy. Diagnostic criteria include patient reported recurrent epistaxis or episodic anosmia; or physician documented nasal purulence, nasal crusting, chronic inflammatory disease involving the upper airway (e.g. sarcoidosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, etc.) or two or more sinus surgeries. Patients with two more of these have secondary atrophic rhinitis with a sensitivity of 0.95 and a specificity of 0.77.	Atrophic rhinosinusitis results from destruction of the normal respiratory epithelium and transition to a nonciliated squamous epithelium, loss of mucociliary clearance, accumulation of stagnant mucous. That milieu facilitates acute and chronic infection (wet phase), and eventual sclerosis with epistaxis and chronic bloody crusts (dry phase)."}

Infant rats with prenatal exposure of methylazoxymethanol at gestational day 15 were used.

We have previously shown that expression of these two peptides is induced by inflammatory cytokines in T98G human glioblastoma cells. Glucocorticoids are frequently used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and glioblastomas. We therefore studied effects of dexamethasone on expression of adrenomedullin and endothelin-1 in T98G human glioblastoma cells. Dexamethasone dose-dependently increased adrenomedullin mRNA levels and immunoreactive-adrenomedullin levels in the medium in T98G cells, whereas it decreased immunoreactive-endothelin levels in the medium. A combination of three cytokines, interferon-gamma (100 U/ml), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (20 ng/ml) and interleukin-1beta (10 ng/ml) induced expression of adrenomedullin and endothelin-1 in T98G cells. Dexamethasone (10(-8) mol/l) suppressed increases in expression of both adrenomedullin and endothelin-1 induced by these three cytokines. Thus, dexamethasone alone increased adrenomedullin expression whereas it suppressed the cytokine-induced expression of adrenomedullin in T98G cells. These findings raised the possibility that effects of dexamethasone on brain inflammation and glioblastomas may be partly mediated or modulated by its effects on expression of adrenomedullin and endothelin-1."}

This fact led us to study genetic interactions in vivo between c-Abl and p53 by examining the phenotype of mice and cells deficient in both proteins. c-Abl-null mice show high neonatal mortality and decreased B lymphocytes, whereas p53-null mice are prone to tumor development. Surprisingly, mice doubly deficient in both c-Abl and p53 are not viable, suggesting that c-Abl and p53 together contribute to an essential function required for normal development. Fibroblasts lacking both c-Abl and p53 were similar to fibroblasts deficient in p53 alone, showing loss of the G(1)/S cell-cycle checkpoint and similar clonogenic survival after ionizing radiation. Fibroblasts deficient in both c-Abl and p53 show reduced growth in culture, as manifested by reduction in the rate of proliferation, saturation density, and colony formation, compared with fibroblasts lacking p53 alone. This defect could be restored by reconstitution of c-Abl expression.

Catalepsy evoked by intrastriatal haloperidol (7 micrograms/side) was also strongly attenuated by systemic MK 801 (0.2 mg/kg i.p.). We also found that the cataleptic rigidity induced by systemic haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.) could be prevented by prior injection of MK 801 into the striatum (10 micrograms), subthalamic nucleus (5 micrograms), entopeduncular nucleus (5 micrograms) or substantia nigra pars reticulata (1 microgram). These results suggest that the anticataleptic action of systemic MK 801 versus haloperidol, is due to the blockade of NMDA receptors in the striatum as well as in striatal output circuits through the subthalamus. However, systemic MK 801 (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was without effect on the catalepsy elicited by injecting muscimol into the globus pallidus (25 ng) or ventromedial thalamus (50 ng).

Antibodies against human GALC localized the GALC antigen in retrovirally transduced cells and cells receiving enzyme via cell to cell secretion and uptake to the lysosomal fraction. In fact immunocytochemical studies in transduced oligodendrocytes revealed that the GALC colocalizes in vesicles lysosomal-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2) (+). Moreover, labeling cells with anti-GALC and a marker for oligodendrocytes demonstrated that, upon differentiation, transduced, twitcher oligodendrocytes attained the normal branched process configuration, while untransduced cells show only abnormal morphology. Phenotype correction in mutant oligodendrocytes has also been observed after enzyme transfer. These studies indicate that GALC activity supplied to cultured oligodendrocytes from twitcher mice by different methods can correct the pathological phenotype of these cells."}

This study was conducted to examine whether and how 2-ME could improve the vascular malformations. Intracranial venous hypertension (VH) model produced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at the anoxia condition were used to induce in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis, respectively. Lentiviral vectors of ID-1 and p53 genes and of their siRNA were intracranially injected into rats and transfected into HUVECs to overexpress and down-regulate these molecules. 2-ME treatment not only reduced the in vivo progression of brain tissue angiogenesis in the intracranial VH rats and the in vitro increases in microvasculature formation, cellular migration and HIF-1α expression induced by anoxia in HUVECs but also reversed the up-regulation of ID-1 and down-regulation of p53 in both the in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis models. All of the anti-angiogenesis effects of 2-ME observed in VH rats and anoxic HUVECs were abrogated by ID-1 overexpression and p53 knockdown. Our data collectively suggest that 2-ME treatment inhibits hypoxia/anoxia-induced angiogenesis dependently on ID-1 down-regulation and p53 up-regulation, providing a potential alternative medical treatment for un-ruptured AVM patients."}

Activation of innate immune mechanisms leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine up-regulation is involved in devastating and disabling human brain illnesses, as Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia in the elderly. Emerging data indicates that the cytokine Interleukin (IL)-18, one of the key mediator of inflammation and immune response, has relevance in the physiopathological processes of the brain, by ultimately influencing the integrity of neurons and putatively contributing to AD. In this review, the relationship between specific IL-18-mediated processes and AD neurodegeneration is summarized and clinical studies pointing to a role of the cytokine in the pathology are discussed. Altogether, the presented data indicate that a more complete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-18 implication in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways could contribute toward the development of new therapeutic strategies for AD."}

Male 8-week-old C57BL/6 J mice were fed either a standard chow diet (normal control) or a high-fat diet (HFD) either alone (HFD-control) or in combination with G. cambogia extract containing hydroxycitric acid (HCA, an herbal weight-loss supplement), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA, a weight-loss supplement), orlistat (a clinically available anti-obesity drug), AFW, or AFE (n = 6 mice per group) for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, several body weight and obesity-related parameters were examined, including: liver and adipose weight, adipocyte size, serum lipid profiles, liver expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and adipose tissue expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2).	High-performance liquid chromatography showed that both AFE and AFW contain ferulic acid and quercetin. Oral administration of AFW and AFE to HFD-fed mice decreased body weight as well as liver and adipose tissue weight and adipocyte size. Serum lipid profiles and adiponectin levels were improved in HFD-fed mice treated with AFE but not AFW. However, both AFW and AFE significantly attenuated HFD-induced changes in serum leptin and insulin-like growth factor 1 levels, liver expression of AMPK, and adipose tissue expression of UCP2.

Interpretation of the serum biomarkers routinely used to detect and monitor DILI, which have not changed in almost 50 years, can be improved with recently proposed models employing quantitative systems pharmacology. In addition, several newer serum biomarkers are showing great promise. Studies in rodents indicate that the ratio of the caspase cleaved fragment of cytokeratin 18 to total K18 in serum (termed the 'apoptotic index') estimates the relative proportions of apoptosis vs necrosis during drug-induced liver injury. Glutamate dehydrogenase can reliably differentiate liver from muscle injury and, when serum is properly prepared, may also detect mitochondrial toxicity as a mechanism of liver injury. MicroRNA-122 is liver-specific, but recent data suggests it can be actively released from hepatocytes in the absence of overt toxicity limiting enthusiasm for it as a DILI biomarker. Finally, damage associated molecular patterns, particularly high mobility group box 1 and its various modified forms, are promising biomarkers of innate immune activation, which may be useful in distinguishing benign elevations in aminotransferases from those that portend clinically important liver injury. These new biomarkers are already being measured in early clinical trials, but broad acceptance will require widespread archiving of serum from diverse clinical trials and probably pre-competitive analysis efforts. We believe that utilization of a panel of traditional and newer biomarkers in conjunction with quantitative systems pharmacology modelling approaches will transform DILI detection and risk management."}

DAT -/- mice were unable to demonstrate temporal control of behavior in either fixed-interval or peak-interval timing procedures, whereas DAT +/- mice were similar to DAT +/+ mice under normal conditions. Low to moderate-dose methamphetamine (MAP) challenges indicated that DAT +/- mice were less sensitive to the clock-speed enhancing effects of MAP compared with DAT +/+ mice. In contrast, DAT +/- mice were more vulnerable than DAT +/+ mice to the disruptive effects of MAP at high doses as revealed by the elevation of response rate in the right hand tail of the Gaussian-shaped timing functions. Moreover, this treatment made DAT +/- mice functionally equivalent to DAT -/- mice in terms of the loss of temporal control.

Signaling is initiated by binding of EphB receptors to ephrinB ligands, stimulating their tyrosine phosphorylation via an unclear mechanism. Here we show that this mechanism involves presenilin1 (PS1)/γ-secretase regulation of phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains/Csk binding protein (PAG/Cbp), an adaptor protein that controls the activity of Src kinases. Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot of mouse primary neuronal and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell extracts overexpressing PAG/Cbp, we show that EphB2 induces tyrosine dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp in a γ-secretase-dependent manner. In these cells, PAG/Cbp dephosphorylation is promoted by the PS1/γ-secretase-produced fragment of ephrinB2 cleavage (ephrinB2/CTF2), which forms complexes with PAG/Cbp when introduced exogenously. EphB2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrinB2 depends on PAG/Cbp because EphB2 cannot increase ephrinB2 phosphorylation in cells treated with anti-PAG siRNA or in PAG/Cbp-knockout (KO) cells. Furthermore, in contrast to WT PS1, familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) PS1 mutants expressed in PS1-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts inhibited both the EphB2-induced dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp and the phosphorylation of ephrinB2. PS1 FAD mutations may thus inhibit the function of ephrinB in the brain, promoting neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease."}

In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of laser acupuncture at HT7 on memory impairment, oxidative stress status, and the functions of both cholinergic and dopaminergic systems in hippocampus of animal model of PD. Male Wistar rats, weighing 180-220 g, were induced unilateral lesion at right substantianigra by 6-OHDA and were treated with laser acupuncture continuously at a period of 14 days. The results showed that laser acupuncture at HT7 enhanced memory and neuron density in CA3 and dentate gyrus. The decreased AChE, MAO-B, and MDA together with increased GSH-Px in hippocampus of a 6-OHDA lesion rats were also observed.

In the present study, we explored the interaction between the two systems by examining the mutual effects between TNF-α and the Ang II/AT1 receptor axis in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Rat DRG neurons were treated with TNF-α in different concentrations for different lengths of time in the presence or absence of transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) inhibitor SPD304, β-catenin signaling inhibitor CCT031374, or different kinase inhibitors. TNF-α decreased the AT1 receptor mRNA level as well as the AT1a receptor promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner within 30 h, which led to dose-dependent inhibition of Ang II-binding AT1 receptor level on the cell membrane. Actinomycin D (1 mg/ml), SPD304 (50 μM), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor PD169316 (25 μM), and CCT031374 (50 μM) completely abolished the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on AT1 receptor expression. TNF-α dose-dependently increased soluble β-catenin and phosphorylated GSK-3β levels, which was blocked by SPD304 and PD169316. In DRG neurons treated with AT2 receptor agonist CGP421140, or Ang II with or without AT1 receptor antagonist losartan or AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 for 30 h, we found that Ang II and Ang II+PD123319 significantly decreased TNF-α expression, whereas CPG421140 and Ang II+losartan increased TNF-α expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that TNF-α inhibits AT1 receptor expression at the transcription level via TNFR1 in rat DRG neurons by increasing the soluble β-catenin level through the p38 MAPK/GSK-3β pathway. In addition, Ang II appears to inhibit and induce TNF-α expression via the AT1 receptor and the AT2 receptor in DRG neurons, respectively.

However, the new studies using single particle EM and X-ray crystallography are revealing important insights. For example, the tetrameric crystal structure of the GluA2cryst construct provided the atomic view of the intact receptor. In addition, the single particle EM structures of the subunit assembly intermediates revealed the conformational requirement for the dimer-to-tetramer transition during the maturation of AMPA-Rs. These new data in the field provide new models and interpretations. In the brain, the native AMPA-R complexes contain auxiliary subunits that influence subunit assembly, gating, and trafficking of the AMPA-Rs. Understanding the mechanisms of the auxiliary subunits will become increasingly important to precisely describe the function of AMPA-Rs in the brain. The AMPA-R proteomics studies continuously reveal a previously unexpected degree of molecular heterogeneity of the complex. Because the AMPA-Rs are important drug targets for treating various neurological and psychiatric diseases, it is likely that these new native complexes will require detailed mechanistic analysis in the future. The current ultrastructural data on the receptors and the receptor-expressing stable cell lines that were developed during the course of these studies are useful resources for high throughput drug screening and further drug designing.

Epidemiological studies on magnetic fields and cancer, reproduction and neurobehavioural reactions have been presented. More recently, neurological, degenerative and heart diseases have also been reported to be related to such electromagnetic fields. Furthermore, the increased use of mobile phones worldwide has focussed interest on the possible effects of radiofrequency fields of higher frequencies. In this paper, a summary is given on electromagnetic fields and health outcomes and what policy is appropriate--'no restriction to exposure', 'prudent avoidance' or 'expensive interventions'? The results of research studies have not been unambiguous; studies indicating these fields as being a health hazard have been published and so were studies indicating no risk at all. In 'positive' studies, different types of effects have been reported despite the use of the same study design, e.g., in epidemiological cancer studies. There are uncertainties as to exposure characteristics, e.g., magnetic field frequency and exposure intermittence, and not much is known about possible confounding or effect-modifying factors. The few animal cancer studies reported have not given much help in risk assessment; and in spite of a large number of experimental cell studies, no plausible and understandable mechanisms have been presented by which a carcinogenic effect could be explained. Exposure to electromagnetic fields occurs everywhere: in the home, at work, in school, etc. Wherever there are electric wires, electric motors and electronic equipment, electromagnetic fields are created. This is one of the reasons why exposure assessment is difficult. For epidemiologists, the problems is not on the effect side as registers of diseases exist in many countries today. The problem is that epidemiologists do not know the relevant exposure characteristics to be used in their studies. In international guidelines, limits for restrictions of field exposure are several orders of magnitude above what can be measured from overhead power lines and found in 'electrical' occupations. These guidelines emphasize that the state of scientific knowledge today does not warrant limiting exposure levels for the public and the work force, and that further data are required to confirm whether health hazards are present. In some countries, however, the 'principle of caution' or 'prudent avoidance' has been adopted; meaning the low-cost avoidance of unnecessary exposure as long as there is scientific uncertainty about its health effects."}

In the present study, we used the OIR model to investigate the role of distinct β-ARs on retinal proangiogenic factors, pathogenic neovascularization and electroretinographic responses. Our results demonstrate that β(2) -AR blockade with ICI 118,551 decreases retinal levels of proangiogenic factors and reduces pathogenic neovascularization, whereas β(1) - and β(3) -AR antagonists do not. Determination of retinal protein kinase A activity is indicative of the fact that β-AR blockers are indeed effective at the receptor level. In addition, the specificity of ICI 118,551 on retinal angiogenesis has been demonstrated by the finding that in mouse retinal explants, β(2) -AR silencing prevents ICI 118,551 effects on hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor accumulation. In OIR mice, ICI 118,551 is effective in increasing electroretinographic responses suggesting that activation of β(2) -ARs constitutes an important part of the retinal response to hypoxia. Lastly, immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that β(2) -ARs are localized to several retinal cells, particularly to Müller cells suggesting the possibility that β(2) -ARs play a role in regulating vascular endothelial growth factor production by these cells.

However, the clot engagement approach of caging the clot against the vessel wall can cause vessel stenosis and stroke recurrence. A device with reduced radial stenting force that reduces vessel wall friction would minimize stenosis and damage. The use of localized Radio Frequency (RF) to enable clot engagement and retrieval with minimal stenting force is explored in this study. New mechanical thrombectomy devices enabled with RF (Patent No.: US 62/172,043) were built and tested on human blood clots in vessels ex vivo. Test results showed that the RF-mechanical thrombectomy successfully and reproducibly captured and retrieved the clots without relying on stent caging of the clot against the vessel wall. Further work will be conducted on animals to compare vessel wall damage between conventional and RF-mechanical thrombectomy."}

In this study, we investigated the efficacies of drinking hydrogen water for prevention of spatial memory decline and age-related brain alterations using senescence-accelerated prone mouse 8 (SAMP8), which exhibits early aging syndromes including declining learning ability and memory. However, treatment with hydrogen water for 30 days prevented age-related declines in cognitive ability seen in SAMP8 as assessed by a water maze test and was associated with increased brain serotonin levels and elevated serum antioxidant activity. In addition, drinking hydrogen water for 18 weeks inhibited neurodegeneration in hippocampus, while marked loss of neurons was noted in control, aged brains of mice receiving regular water. On the basis of our results, hydrogen water merits further investigation for possible therapeutic/preventative use for age-related cognitive disorders."}

We demonstrate that before neurodegeneration, Purkinje neurons in a mouse model of SCA3 exhibit increased intrinsic excitability resulting in depolarization block and the loss of the ability to sustain spontaneous repetitive firing. These alterations in intrinsic firing are associated with increased inactivation of voltage-activated potassium currents. Administration of an activator of calcium-activated potassium channels, SKA-31, partially corrects abnormal Purkinje cell firing and improves motor function in SCA3 mice. Finally, expression of the disease protein, ataxin-3, in transfected cells increases the inactivation of Kv3.1 channels and shifts the activation of Kv1.2 channels to more depolarized potentials. Our results suggest that in SCA3, early Purkinje neuron dysfunction is associated with altered physiology of voltage-activated potassium channels. We further suggest that the observed changes in Purkinje neuron physiology contribute to disease pathogenesis, underlie at least some motor symptoms, and represent a promising therapeutic target in SCA3."}

GPR17, in particular, is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor that has been identified as oligodendroglial maturation inhibitor because its stimulation arrests primary mouse oligodendrocytes at a less differentiated stage. However, the intracellular signaling effectors transducing its activation remain poorly understood. Here, we use Oli-neu cells, an immortalized cell line derived from primary murine oligodendrocytes, and primary rat oligodendrocyte cultures as model systems to identify molecular targets that link cell surface GPR17 to oligodendrocyte maturation blockade. We demonstrate that stimulation of GPR17 by the small molecule agonist MDL29,951 (2-carboxy-4,6-dichloro-1H-indole-3-propionic acid) decreases myelin basic protein expression levels mainly by triggering the Gαi/o signaling pathway, which in turn leads to reduced activity of the downstream cascade adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). In addition, we show that GPR17 activation also diminishes myelin basic protein abundance by lessening stimulation of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC), thus uncovering a previously unrecognized role for EPAC to regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation. Together, our data establish PKA and EPAC as key downstream effectors of GPR17 that inhibit oligodendrocyte maturation. We envisage that treatments augmenting PKA and/or EPAC activity represent a beneficial approach for therapeutic enhancement of remyelination in those demyelinating diseases where GPR17 is highly expressed, such as multiple sclerosis."}

This endogenous factor allosterically decreases [(3)H]dizocilpine binding to NMDA receptor, most likely acting as a weak channel blocker. In the present study we investigated whether endobain E is present in the cerebral cortex of rats subjected to ischemia and modulates NMDA receptor exposed to the same conditions. Ischemia-reperfusion was carried out by bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries followed by a 15-min reperfusion period. Elution profile of brain soluble fraction showed that endobain E is present in cerebral cortex of ischemia-reperfusion rats. On assaying its effect on synaptosomal membrane Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity and [(3)H]dizocilpine binding to cerebral cortex membranes prepared from animals without treatment, it was found that the endogenous modulator isolated from ischemia-reperfusion rats was able to inhibit both enzyme activity and ligand binding. On the other hand, endobain E prepared from rats without treatment also decreased binding to cerebral cortex or hippocampal membranes obtained from animals exposed to ischemia-reperfusion. Since ischemia decreases tissue pH and NMDA receptor activity varies according to proton concentration, pH influence on endobain E effect was tested. Endobain E (approximately 80 mg original tissue) decreased [(3)H]dizocilpine binding 25% at pH 7.4 or 8.0 but 90% at pH 6.5. These results demonstrate that endobain E is present and also able to modulate NMDA receptor in the short-term period that follows cerebral ischemia and that its effect depends on proton concentration, suggesting greater NMDA receptor modulation by endobain E at low pH, typical of ischemic tissues."}

Reactive oxygen species, specifically superoxide formed during the early phase of reperfusion, augment neuronal injury. NADPH oxidase is a key enzyme for superoxide production. The present study tested the hypothesis that atorvastatin protects against cerebral infarction via inhibition of NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide in transient focal ischemia. Transient focal ischemia was created in halothane-anesthetized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Atorvastatin (Lipitor, 10 mg/kg sc) was administered three times before MCAO. Infarct volume was measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. NADPH oxidase enzymatic activity and superoxide levels were quantified in the ischemic core and penumbral regions by lucigenin (5 microM)-enhanced chemiluminescence. Expression of NADPH oxidase membrane subunit gp91(phox) and membrane-translocated subunit p47(phox) and small GTPase Rac-1 was analyzed by Western blot. NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide levels increased after reperfusion and peaked within 2 h of reperfusion in the penumbra, but not in the ischemic core, in MCAO rats. Atorvastatin pretreatment prevented these increases, blunted expression of membrane subunit gp91(phox), and prevented translocation of cytoplasmic subunit p47(phox) to the membrane in the penumbra 2 h after reperfusion. Consequently, cerebral infarct volume was significantly reduced in atorvastatin-treated compared with nontreated MCAO rats 24 h after reperfusion. These results indicate that atorvastatin protects against cerebral infarction via inhibition of NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide in transient focal ischemia."}

CNS and neurological disorders^\nThe neuronal cytoskeleton as a potential therapeutical target in neurodegenerative diseases and schizophrenia.^\nThe cytoskeleton plays a key role in maintaining the highly asymmetrical shape and structural polarity of neurons that are essential for neuronal physiology. Cytoskeletal reorganization plays a key role in neuritogenesis. In neurodegenerative diseases, the cytoskeleton is abnormally assembled and impairment of neurotransmission occurs. In Alzheimer's disease, abundant amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles constitute the two major neuropathologic alterations present in the brain. Neurofibrillary tangles are formed of paired helical filaments consisting nearly entirely of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Under normal conditions tau binds to microtubules, stabilizing neuron structure and integrity. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is assumed to be the cause of formation of paired helical filaments. Another example of cytoskeletal abnormalities present in neurodegenerative diseases are the Lewy bodies considered as cytopathologic markers of Parkinson's disease. Lewy bodies are constituted of tubulin, MAP1, and MAP2. Neuronal shape, loss of dendrites and spines, as well as irregular distribution of neuronal elongations occur in specific brain areas of schizophrenic patients. Increase in non-phosphorylated MAP2 and MAP1B at hippocampus has been suggested as responsible for somatodendritic and cytoarchitectural abnormalities found in schizophrenia. In addition, neurofibrillary tangles are more frequent among schizophrenic patients who received pharmacologic antipsychotic treatment. Cumulative evidence suggests that neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric illnesses are associated with cytoskeletal alterations in neurons that, in turn, loose synaptic connectivity and the ability to transmit incoming axonal information to the somatodendritic domain. We will review evidence supporting that the neuronal cytoskeleton is disrupted in neurodegenerative and some psychiatric diseases, and therefore could be a target for drug therapy. In addition, current data indicating that melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, promotes neuritogenesis through cytoskeletal rearrangements and in addition to the potential therapeutic use of melatonin in neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed."}

Therapeutic options are very limited. We assessed the effects of D-JNKi, a small peptide c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAP kinase inhibitor, on neuroinflammation, mitochondrial integrity and neuronal damage in a neonatal rat model of ischemic brain damage. Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury was induced in postnatal-day 7 rats by unilateral carotid artery occlusion and hypoxia, and was followed by intraperitoneal D-JNKi treatment. We demonstrate here for the first time that a single intraperitoneal injection with D-JNKi directly after HI strongly reduces neonatal brain damage by >85% with a therapeutic window of at least 6h. D-JNKi treatment also restored cognitive and motor function as analyzed at 9weeks post-insult. Neuroprotective D-JNKi treatment inhibited phosphorylation of nuclear c-Jun (P-c-Jun), and consequently reduced activity of the AP-1 transcription factor and production of cerebral cytokines/chemokines as determined at 3 and 24h post-HI. Inhibition of P-c-Jun by D-JNKi is thought to be mediated via inhibition of the upstream phosphorylation of cytosolic and nuclear JNK and/or by preventing the direct interaction of phosphorylated (P-)JNK with c-Jun. Surprisingly, however, HI did not induce a detectable increase in P-JNK in cytosol or nucleus. Notably, we show here for the first time that HI induces P-JNK only in the mitochondrial fraction, which was completely prevented by D-JNKi treatment. The hypothesis that mitochondrial JNK activation is key to HI brain injury was supported by data showing that treatment of rat pups with SabKIM1 peptide, a specific mitochondrial JNK inhibitor, is also neuroprotective. Inhibition of HI-induced mitochondrial JNK activation was associated with preservation of mitochondrial integrity as evidenced by prevention of ATP loss and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The HI-induced increase in apoptotic markers (cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation) as analyzed at 24h post-HI were also strongly reduced by D-JNKi and the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were upregulated. Neuroprotection was lost after repeated 0+3h D-JNKi treatment which was associated with complete inhibition of the second peak of AP-1 activity and disability to upregulate mitochondrial Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. We show here for the first time that D-JNKi treatment efficiently protects the neonatal brain against ischemic brain damage and subsequent cognitive and motor impairment. We propose that inhibition of phosphorylation of mitochondrial JNK is a pivotal step in preventing early loss of mitochondrial integrity leading to reduced neuroinflammation and inhibition of apoptotic neuronal loss. Moreover we show the crucial role of upregulation of mitochondrial anti-apoptotic proteins to maintain neuroprotection."}

Diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, renal failure, lower limb amputation, and an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD)--a leading cause of death in Western society. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which diabetes mellitus promotes atherosclerosis is essential to developing methods to treat and prevent diabetes-associated CVD. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the mechanisms by which diabetes may promote atherogenesis and specifically focuses on a novel pathway linking these 2 conditions. We hypothesize that the accumulation of intracellular glucosamine observed in conditions of chronic hyperglycaemia may promote atherogenesis via a mechanism involving dysregulated protein folding, activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and increased glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 activity. The identification of this novel mechanism provides a promising hypothesis and multiple new targets for potential therapeutic intervention in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and accelerated atherosclerosis."}

Partial behavioral recovery in amphetamine-induced rotation was correlated with the number of ES-derived tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons in the grafts (r=0.5, P<0.05). Post mortem analysis of ES-derived grafts revealed TH+neurons with mature morphology, similar to fetal DA neurons, and expression of midbrain transcription factors, such as Engrailed (En) and Nurr-1. While the total number of TH+neurons was not different between the two groups, TH/En co-expression was significantly higher (>90%) in grafts from differentiated ES cells than in grafts derived from progenitor cells (<50%), reflecting a more heterogeneous cellular composition.

It is postulated that environmental factors such as diet and population-specific genetics, influence the distribution of MS. Diagnosis is based on established clinical criteria, aided by magnetic resonance imaging, evoked potential recordings and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Whichever the type of clinical manifestation, MS is considered an organ-specific autoimmune disease, characterized by T-cell and macrophage infiltrates, triggered by CNS-specific CD4 T-cells. The prominent autoimmune etiology of MS is considered to be the aberrant activation of IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells that recognize self-peptides of the myelin sheath, such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP). Current treatments for MS aim primarily to suppress T-cell-mediated immune responses, albeit non-specifically. Experimental approaches towards the therapeutic management of MS involve the use of peptide analogs of disease-associated myelin epitopes or vaccines, to help shift T helper cell responses from Type-1 (secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines) to Type-2 (secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines) or induce peripheral T-cell tolerance.

Genetic studies have identified mutations in the Abeta precursor protein (APP) as the key triggers for the pathogenesis of AD. Other genes such as presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1/2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) also play a critical role in increased Abeta deposition. Several biochemical and molecular studies using transfected cells and transgenic animals point to mechanisms by which Abeta is generated and aggregated to trigger the neurodegeneration that may cause AD. Three important enzymes collectively known as 'secretases' participate in APP processing. An enzymatic activity, beta-secretase, cleaves APP on the amino side of Abeta producing a large secreted derivative, sAPPbeta, and an Abeta-bearing membrane-associated C-terminal derivative, CTFbeta, which is subsequently cleaved by the second activity, gamma-secretase, to release Abeta. Alternatively, a third activity, alpha-secretase, cleaves APP within Abeta to the secreted derivative sAPPalpha and membrane-associated CTFalpha. The predominant secreted APP derivative is sAPPalpha in most cell-types. Most of the secreted Abeta is 40 residues long (Abeta40) although a small percentage is 42 residues in length (Abeta42). However, the longer Abeta42 aggregates more readily and was therefore considered to be the pathologically important form. Advances in our understanding of APP processing, trafficking, and turnover will pave the way for better drug discovery for the eventual treatment of AD. In addition, APP gene regulation and its interaction with other proteins may provide useful drug targets for AD. The emerging knowledge related to the normal function of APP will help in determining whether or not the AD associated changes in APP metabolism affect its function. The present review summarizes our current understanding of APP metabolism and function and their relationship to other proteins involved in AD."}

More recently, sEH gene polymorphisms in the human population have been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. Thus the biological actions of epoxyeicosanoids and the sEH enzyme are ideal therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases. The rapid development of 1,3-disubstituted urea based sEH inhibitors over the past five years has resulted in a number of studies demonstrating cardiovascular protection. sEH inhibitors have antihypertensive and antiinflammatory actions and have been demonstrated to decrease cerebral ischemic and renal injury in rat models of hypertension. These findings of beneficial actions in animal models of disease position the sEH enzyme as a promising therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases."}

High-dose (0.5-1 IU/kg/hour) insulin, in combination with a glucose infusion to maintain euglycaemia (hyperinsulinaemia/euglycaemia therapy), has been proposed as a treatment for calcium channel antagonist (CCA) and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) poisonings. However, the basis for its beneficial effect is poorly understood.CCAs inhibit insulin secretion, resulting in hyperglycaemia and alteration of myocardial fatty acid oxidation. Similarly, blockade of beta(2)-adrenoceptors in beta-blocker poisoning results in impaired lipolysis, glycogenolysis and insulin release. Insulin administration switches cell metabolism from fatty acids to carbohydrates and restores calcium fluxes, resulting in improvement in cardiac contractility. Experimental studies in verapamil poisoning have shown that high-dose insulin significantly improved survival compared with calcium salts, epinephrine or glucagon. In several life-threatening poisonings in humans, the administration of high-dose insulin produced cardiovascular stabilisation, decreased the catecholamine vasopressor infusion rate and improved the survival rate. In a canine model of propranolol intoxication, high-dose insulin provided a sustained increase in systemic blood pressure, cardiac performance and survival rate compared with glucagon or epinephrine. In contrast, insulin had no effect on heart rate and electrical conduction in the myocardium. In another study, high-dose insulin reversed the negative inotropic effect of propranolol to 80% of control function and normalised heart rate. High-dose insulin produced a significant decrease in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and a significant increase in the stroke volume and cardiac output. The vasodilator effect was explained by an enhanced cardiac output leading to withdrawal of compensatory vasoconstriction. No clinical studies have yet been performed. Although not effective in all cases, we recommend hyperinsulinaemia/euglycaemia therapy in patients with severe CCA poisoning who present with hypotension and respond poorly to fluid, calcium salts, glucagon and catecholamine infusion. However, careful monitoring of blood glucose and serum potassium concentrations is required to avoid serious adverse effects. More clinical data are needed before this therapy can be recommended in beta-blocker poisoning. There is a need for large prospective clinical trials to confirm safety and efficacy of hyperinsulinaemia/euglycaemia therapy in both CCA and beta-blocker poisoning."}
{"pmid": "18945675", "text": "The Journal of biological chemistry^\nTargeting artificial transcription factors to the utrophin A promoter: effects on dystrophic pathology and muscle function.^\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a genetic defect in the dystrophin gene. The absence of dystrophin results in muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration, leading to progressive muscle fiber loss. Utrophin is a close analogue of dystrophin. A substantial, ectopic expression of utrophin in the extrasynaptic sarcolemma of dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers can prevent deleterious effects of dystrophin deficiency. An alternative approach for the extrasynaptic up-regulation of utrophin involves the augmentation of utrophin transcription via the endogenous utrophin A promoter using custom-designed transcriptional activator proteins with zinc finger (ZFP) motifs. We tested a panel of custom-designed ZFP for their ability to activate the utrophin A promoter. Expression of one such ZFP efficiently increased, in a time-dependent manner, utrophin transcript and protein levels both in vitro and in vivo. In dystrophic mouse (mdx) muscles, administration of adenoviral vectors expressing this ZFP led to significant enhancement of muscle function with decreased necrosis, restoration of the dystrophin-associated proteins, and improved resistance to eccentric contractions. These studies provide evidence that specifically designed ZFPs can act as strong transcriptional activators of the utrophin A promoter. These may thus serve as attractive therapeutic agents for dystrophin deficiency states such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy."}

In Ayurveda, Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is well known for its immunomodulatory properties. The current study is an extension of our previous report on in vitro model system and was aimed to investigate anti-neuroinflammatory potential of water extract from the Ashwagandha leaves (ASH-WEX) against systemic LPS-induced neuroinflammation and associated behavioral impairments using in vivo rat model system. Oral feeding of ASH-WEX for 8 weeks significantly ameliorated the anxiety-like behavior as evident from Elevated plus maze test. Suppression of reactive gliosis, inflammatory cytokines production like TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and expression of nitro-oxidative stress enzymes like iNOS, COX2, NOX2 etc were observed in ASH-WEX-treated animals. NFκB, P38, and JNK MAPKs pathways analysis showed their involvement in inflammation suppression which was further confirmed by inhibitor studies. The current study provides first ever preclinical evidence and scientific validation that ASH-WEX exhibits the anti-neuroinflammatory potential against systemic LPS-induced neuroinflammation and ameliorates associated behavioral abnormalities.

The aim of this study is to analyse the social construction of illness explanations among patients with MUS, and to illustrate the use of explanatory idioms as being dependent on space, time and setting, legitimizing each idiom. The study is based on repeated, semi-structured, qualitative interviews with nine informants during a period of 1.5 years.

We found, that patients with MUS employ at least four different explanatory idioms defined as: (1) the symptomatic idiom; (2) the personal idiom; (3) the social idiom; and (4) the moral idiom. All idioms play an important role in the process of creating meaning in the patients' everyday life. The symptomatic idiom is mainly used at clinical consultations in primary care, but it is not the only idiom of significance for the patients. Simultaneously other idioms exist and gradually become important for especially patients with MUS due to the lack of valid diagnoses and treatment opportunities. Clinical settings, however, call for the employment of the symptomatic idiom and a discrepancy is found between the general practitioners' notion of the bio-psycho-social model and the patients' everyday life idioms."}

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of a pure Hsp70/Hsc70 preparation delivered to the brain regions involved in generalized seizures induced in rats by intracerebroventricular microinjections of NMDA or systemic injections of pentylenetetrazole. Purified Hsp70/Hsc70 was administered (intracerebroventricular) 2 h before the induction of seizures. Compared to the vehicle-treated control animals, Hsp70/Hsc70-pretreated rats demonstrated reduced severity of NMDA- and pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. To identify the brain structures potentially implicated in the Hsp70/Hsc70-mediated anticonvulsant effect, we analysed the localization of a fluorescently-labelled chaperone in the brain. Labelled Hsp70/Hsc70 was found in neurons and terminals of the limbic seizure complex of the brain and was co-localized in these regions with NMDA receptors, synaptophysin and the GABA-synthesizing enzyme, L-glutamic acid decarboxylase 67. An immunoprecipitation assay confirmed interactions between Hsp70 and both synaptophysin and L-glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 in brain tissue.

Excised nodules were digested with collagenase to isolate adult worms. Embryograms were prepared with females for the evaluation of their reproductive capacities.	Oocyte production was not affected by IVM. The mean number of intermediate embryos (morulae and coiled mf) decreased similarly in the two groups between D0 and D80. In contrast, an accumulation of stretched mf, either viable or degenerating, was observed at D80. However, it was observed that the increase in number of degenerating mf between D0 and D80 was much lower in the frequently treated group than in the control one (Incidence Rate Ratio: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.10-0.63; p = 0.003), which may indicate a reduced sequestration of mf in the worms from the frequently treated group.

We reported pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) was induced in the cochlea 6h after noise exposure, but the pathophysiological implications of this are still obscure. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of IL-6 inhibition using the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (MR16-1). Noise-exposed mice were treated with MR16-1 and evaluated. Improved hearing at 4kHz as measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) was noted in noise-exposed mice treated with MR16-1. Histological analysis revealed the decrease in spiral ganglion neurons was ameliorated in the MR16-1-treated group, while no significant change was observed in the organ of Corti. Immunohistochemistry for Iba1 and CD45 demonstrated a remarkable reduction of activated cochlear macrophages in spiral ganglions compared to the control group when treated with MR16-1. Thus, MR16-1 had protective effects both functionally and pathologically for the noise-damaged cochlea primarily due to suppression of neuronal loss and presumably through alleviation of inflammatory responses.

It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the motor neurons controlling voluntary movement. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive, a fact that has precluded development of effective treatments. ALS presents as a sporadic condition 90-95% of the time, i.e., without familial history or obvious genetic mutation. This suggests that ALS has a strong environmental component. Organophosphates (OPs) are prime candidate neurotoxicants in the etiology of ALS, as exposure to OPs was linked to higher ALS incidence among farmers, soccer players, and Gulf War veterans. In addition, polymorphisms in paraoxonase 1, an enzyme that detoxifies OPs, may increase individual vulnerability both to OP poisoning and to the risk of developing ALS. Furthermore, exposure to high doses of OPs can give rise to OP-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN), a debilitating condition akin to ALS characterized by similar motor impairment and paralysis. The question we pose in this review is: 'what can we learn from acute exposure to high doses of neurotoxicants (OPIDN) that could help our understanding of chronic diseases resulting from potentially decades of silent exposure (ALS)?' The resemblances between OPIDN and ALS are striking at the clinical, etiological, neuropathological, cellular, and potentially molecular levels.

We have now found that activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induces NOS-2 in astrocytes of the human optic nerve head (ONH) in vitro and EGFR is significantly upregulated and tyrosine phosphorylated in reactive astrocytes in human glaucomatous ONHs in vivo. Furthermore, in response to elevated hydrostatic pressure, EGFR rapidly becomes phosphorylated in the nucleus. This pressure-dependent activation of EGFR is necessary for NOS-2 induction.

The three mono-layer competitive networks of the BG main axis flexibly extract relevant features from the current state of the thalamo-cortical activity to control current (ongoing) and future actions. We hypothesize that the striatal and the subthalamic projections neurons act as mono-stable integrators (class I excitability) and the in-vivo pallidal neurons act as bi-stable resonators (class II excitability). GPe neurons exhibit pausing behavior because their membrane potential lingers in the vicinity of an unstable equilibrium point and bi-stability, and these pauses enable a less-greedy exploratory behavioral policy. Finally, degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine depletion (as in Parkinson's disease) lead to augmentation of striatal excitability and competitive dynamics. As a consequence the pallidal network, whose elements tend to synchronize as a result of their bi-stable resonance behavior, shifts from a Poissonian-like non-correlated to synchronous oscillatory discharge mode."}

As evidenced by shortening of the external urethral sphincter electromyogram silent period in ovariectomized rats, the disruption of coordination between the external urethral sphincter and the detrusor muscle could decrease urine outflow and in turn voiding efficiency.

Its dose-limiting side effect is the emergence of peripheral neuropathy, resulting in chronic neuropathic pain in many patients. This study sought to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of neuropathic pain by vincristine-induced neurotoxicity. We focused on signs of functional changes and revealed that deep layers of the spinal cord (III-IV) experience increased neuronal activity both in the absence of peripheral stimulation and, as a result of tactile mechanical stimulations. These laminae and superficial laminae I-II were also subject to structural changes as evidenced by an increase in immunoreactivity of Piccolo, a marker of active presynaptic elements. Further investigations performed, using DNA microarray technology, describe a large number of genes differentially expressed in dorsal root ganglions and in the spinal dorsal horn after vincristine treatment. Our study describes an important list of genes differentially regulated by vincristine treatment that will be useful for future studies and brings forward evidence for molecular and anatomical modifications of large diameter sensory neurons terminating in deep dorsal horn laminae, which could participate in the development of tactile allodynia."}

New evidence for the use of statins in neurologic disease is mounting, and the range of therapeutic applications is formidable. Statins are beginning to show benefits in a wide range of neurologic conditions, from common ischemic stroke to rare congenital neurometabolic storage diseases, from acute brain injury to chronic central nervous system inflammation, and from prevention of neurodegenerative disease to acute neuroprotection. A diverse therapeutic spectrum is explained by shared pathogenetic mechanisms of neurologic disease and the manifold pharmacodynamic effects of statins."}

Accumulating evidence supports an essential role of IL-6 in the development, differentiation, regeneration and degeneration of neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system. Major sites of IL-6 synthesis are neurons and glial cells. Interleukin-6 functions are mediated by a specific receptor system composed of a binding site and a signal transducer. This receptor system can be modulated by a complex of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor acting as agonist. The IL-6 can exert completely opposite actions on neurons, triggering either neuronal survival after injury or causing neuronal degeneration and cell death in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Development of selective IL-6 agonists and antagonists, as well as the usage of soluble IL-6 receptors, offers new possibilities for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, optimized genetic mouse models, including transgenic and knockout animals, should help to define the physiological and pathophysiological role of IL-6 in the nervous system."}

However, due to recent concerns over risks associated with prion transmission, porcine tissue is considered to be an alternate xenogeneic source for clinical use. In the present study, we investigated whether microencapsulated porcine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (PCCs) also have analgesic effect to reduce allodynia caused by neuropathic pain in chronic constriction injury model of rat. PCCs were isolated from a porcine adrenal medulla and then microencapsulated with alginate and poly. In in vitro tests, the microencapsulated PCCs were investigated whether they have an ability to release catecholamines responding to nicotine stimulation. The levels of catecholamines released from the microencapsulated PCCs were significantly higher than from microencapsulated BCCs. In addition, the microencapsulated PCCs released catecholamines and met-enkephalin responding to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) retrieved from a neuropathic pain model. In in vivo tests, implantation of microencapsulated PCCs reduced both mechanical and cold allodynia in chronic constriction injury model of a rat whereas the microencapsulated BCCs reduced only cold allodynia under the same conditions. The injection of antagonist of opioid peptides reversed the reduction of cold allodynia in microencapsulated PCC-received animal. The levels of catecholamines in the CSF of rats after implantation of microencapsulated PCCs were significantly higher than in the control group.

This signalling pathway plays an important role in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as itself being altered in conditions of oxidative stress. Here, we investigated the effects of recombinant fractalkine (rCX3CL1) in models of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced demyelination and astrocyte toxicity, within organotypic cerebellar slice cultures.	Organotypic cerebellar slice cultures were generated from postnatal day 10 C57BL/6J mice to assess myelination. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the degree of myelination. Fluorescent images were obtained using a leica SP8 confocal microscope and data analysed using ImageJ software.	We show here, for the first time, that rCX3CL1 significantly attenuated bolus H2O2-induced demyelination as measured by expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) and attenuated reduced vimentin expression. Using the GOX-CAT system to continuously generate low levels of H2O2 and induce demyelination, we observed similar protective effects of rCX3CL1 on MBP and MOG fluorescence, although in this model, the decrease in vimentin expression was not altered.	This data indicates possible protective effects of fractalkine signalling in oxidative stress-induced demyelination in the central nervous system. This opens up the possibility of fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) modulation as a potential new target for protecting against oxidative stress-induced demyelination in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory nervous system disorders."}

The cells that fuel the growth of tumours resemble neural stem cells found in the developing and adult mammalian forebrain. These are referred to as glioma stem cells (GSCs). Similar to neural stem cells, GSCs exhibit a variety of phenotypic states: dormant, quiescent, proliferative and differentiating. How environmental cues within the brain influence these distinct states is not well understood. Laboratory models of GBM can be generated using either genetically engineered mouse models, or via intracranial transplantation of cultured tumour initiating cells (mouse or human). Unfortunately, these approaches are expensive, time-consuming, low-throughput and ill-suited for monitoring live cell behaviours. Here, we explored whole adult brain coronal organotypic slices as an alternative model. Mouse adult brain slices remain viable in a serum-free basal medium for several weeks. GSCs can be easily microinjected into specific anatomical sites ex vivo, and we demonstrate distinct responses of engrafted GSCs to diverse microenvironments in the brain tissue. Within the subependymal zone - one of the adult neural stem cell niches - injected tumour cells could effectively engraft and respond to endothelial niche signals. Tumour-transplanted slices were treated with the antimitotic drug temozolomide as proof of principle of the utility in modelling responses to existing treatments. Engraftment of mouse or human GSCs onto whole brain coronal organotypic brain slices therefore provides a simplified, yet flexible, experimental model. This will help to increase the precision and throughput of modelling GSC-host brain interactions and complements ongoing in vivo studies.

It is possible that different mechanisms account for anticonvulsant, antinociceptive, anxiolytic and neuroprotective activity in animal models. Gabapentin is an amino acid, with a mechanism that differs from those of other anticonvulsant drugs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine or valproate. Radiotracer studies with [14C]gabapentin suggest that gabapentin is rapidly accessible to brain cell cytosol. Several hypotheses of cellular mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pharmacology of gabapentin: 1. Gabapentin crosses several membrane barriers in the body via a specific amino acid transporter (system L) and competes with leucine, isoleucine, valine and phenylalanine for transport. 2. Gabapentin increases the concentration and probably the rate of synthesis of GABA in brain, which may enhance non-vesicular GABA release during seizures. 3. Gabapentin binds with high affinity to a novel binding site in brain tissues that is associated with an auxiliary subunit of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Recent electrophysiology results suggest that gabapentin may modulate certain types of Ca2+ current. 4. Gabapentin reduces the release of several monoamine neurotransmitters. 5. Electrophysiology suggests that gabapentin inhibits voltage-activated Na+ channels, but other results contradict these findings. 6. Gabapentin increases serotonin concentrations in human whole blood, which may be relevant to neurobehavioral actions. 7. Gabapentin prevents neuronal death in several models including those designed to mimic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This may occur by inhibition of glutamate synthesis by branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAA-t)."}

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly elucidated. In this study, we reported an important role of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) s-nitrosylation in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and 9 secretion from tPA-treated ischemic endothelial cells. Brain vascular endothelial cells (bEND3) were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 2 h before adding recombinant human tPA for 6 h. This treatment induced a significant increase of MMP2 and 9 in the media of bEND3 cells and a simultaneous degradation of fibronectin and laminin β-1, the two main components of extracellular matrix (ECM). Inhibition of MMP2 and 9 with SB-3CT completely blocked the degradation of fibronectin and laminin β-1. ODG+tPA treatment led to Cav-1 shedding from bEND3 cells into the media. Notably, OGD triggered nitric oxide (NO) production and S-nitrosylationof Cav-1 (SNCav-1). Meanwhile tPA induced activation of ERK signal pathway and stimulates the secretion of SNCav-1. Pretreatment of bEND3 cells with C-PTIO (a NO scavenger) or U0126 (a specific ERK inhibitor) significantly reduced OGD-induced S-nitrosylation of Cav-1 in cells and blocked the secretion of Cav-1 and MMP2 and 9 into the media as well as the degradation of fibronectin and laminin β-1 in OGD and tPA-treated cells. These data indicate that OGD-triggered Cav-1 S-nitrosylation interacts with tPA-induced ERK activation to augment MMP2 and 9 secretion and subsequent ECM degradation, which may account for the exacerbation of ischemic blood brain barrier damage following tPA thrombolysis for ischemic stroke."}
{"pmid": "26196248", "text": "Pharmacological research^\nA novel quantitative assay of mitophagy: Combining high content fluorescence microscopy and mitochondrial DNA load to quantify mitophagy and identify novel pharmacological tools against pathogenic heteroplasmic mtDNA.^\nMitophagy is a cellular mechanism for the recycling of mitochondrial fragments. This process is able to improve mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) quality in heteroplasmic mtDNA disease, in which mutant mtDNA co-exists with normal mtDNA. In disorders where the load of mutant mtDNA determines disease severity it is likely to be an important determinant of disease progression. Measuring mitophagy is technically demanding. We used pharmacological modulators of autophagy to validate two techniques for quantifying mitophagy. First we used the IN Cell 1000 analyzer to quantify mitochondrial co-localisation with LC3-II positive autophagosomes. Unlike conventional fluorescence and electron microscopy, this high-throughput system is sufficiently sensitive to detect transient low frequency autophagosomes. Secondly, because mitophagy preferentially removes pathogenic heteroplasmic mtDNA mutants, we developed a heteroplasmy assay based on loss of m.3243A>G mtDNA, during culture conditions requiring oxidative metabolism ('energetic stress'). The effects of the pharmacological modulators on these two measures were consistent, confirming that the high throughput imaging output (autophagosomes co-localising with mitochondria) reflects mitochondrial quality control. To further validate these methods, we performed a more detailed study using metformin, the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug that is still sometimes used in Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness (MIDD). This confirmed our initial findings and revealed that metformin inhibits mitophagy at clinically relevant concentrations, suggesting that it may have novel therapeutic uses."}

Within the Alzheimer's disease (AD) literature, extensive differences in Abeta processing across cell lines and evolution have clearly been observed. In the recent past, increased levels of amyloid beta Abeta1-42 have been heralded to be what distinguishes whether one is prone to the development of AD [59]. However, observations in naturally occurring, non-transgenic animals which display a great deal of parenchymal Abeta1-42 (Abeta found within extracellular plaque deposits) and a complete lack ofbeta1-40 within these same Abeta1-42 plaques raise the issue of whether Abetax-42 (Abeta that is truncated or modified at the N- terminus), rather than Abeta1-42, is instead the critical mediator of Abeta production and pathogenesis [47,49]. Distinct ratios of Abeta N-terminal variants (i.e. Abeta1-x, Abeta3-x, Abeta11-x, beta17-x) have been assessed in human amyloid plaques [18,21,40,41,42,47,48,49,52]. Moreover, ratios of specific Abeta N-terminal variants separate naturally occurring, non-transgenic animals which develop abundant levels of Abetax-42 and not Abetax-40 from human AD participants who harbor plaques that contain both the Abetax-42 and Abetax-40 variants [49]. Next, Teller and colleagues have demonstrated the presence of N-terminal truncated soluble 3kD (likely Abeta17-x) and 3.7kD peptides (in addition to 4kD Abeta) well before the appearance of amyloid plaques in Down Syndrome brain [51], indicating an early contribution of thebeta N-terminus to the formation of amyloid pathology. Additional critical facts concerning the major contribution of the Abeta N-terminus in AD pathogenesis include observations which support thatbeta generated by rodent neurons is predominantly truncated at Abeta11-x [13], the major form of APP C-terminal fragments in mice lacking functional PS1 is AbetaPP11-98 [9], beta11-x expression is increased as a function of BACE expression [55], and an interrelationship between presenilin-1 mutations and increased levels of N-terminally truncatedbeta [40]. This commentary highlights current understanding and potential biochemical, pathological, and cell biological contributions of Abeta N-terminal variants implicated during the course of AD pathogenesis. Although the amyloid beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) gene and Abeta are highly conserved across mammalian species, there are species-specific differences. For instance, the primate, guinea pig, canine, and polar bear share an identical Abeta sequence to that observed in human brain while the rat displays a distinct amino acid sequence with substitutions at residues 5 (Arg), 10 (Tyr), and 13 (His) [24,37]. All of these mammals generate Abeta1-42 via cleavage by at least two enzymes, beta (beta-) secretase and gamma (gamma-) secretase (Fig. 1). The enzyme that liberates the N- terminus of the Abeta peptide ('beta-secretase') is also termed BACE (beta-site AbetaPP cleaving enzyme) [55]. Cathepsin D, which accumulates within AD neurons [15], also cleaves at the N-terminal side of the first aspartate residue of amyloid beta [2].beta-secretase activity is necessary in order to initiate 4kD beta1-x formation by cleaving AbetaPP at the N-terminus and results in the release of a soluble 100kD AbetaPP N- terminal fragment and a 12kD membrane bound C-terminal fragment (C99/C100) [55]. The carboxyl-terminus of the Abetapeptide is liberated through cleavage by the enzyme termed gamma-secretase. In the past, potential AD therapeutic strategies have mainly been geared towards gamma-secretase inhibition. However, such strategies alone no longer appear sound as it is clear that the AbetaPP C99/C100 fragment itself, which requires beta-, but not gamma-, secretase cleavage for generation and includes the entire Abeta peptide, is neurotoxic when evaluated in cultured cells [12,30,34]. Thus, gamma-secretase inhibition alone would not preclude the generation of the neurotoxic C99/C100 fragment."}

Peptides were injected 5-11 days prior to induction of EAE, and the severity of the disease was monitored by a standard clinical scoring protocol and change in body weight. The BBB breakdown in diseased and treated mice was compared to that in normal control mice by determining deposition of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (Gd-DTPA) in the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mice treated with PLP-BPI showed no or low indication of EAE as well as normal increase in body weight. In contrast, mice treated with the control peptide or PBS showed a decrease in body weight and a high disease score. The diseased mice had high deposition of Gd-DTPA in the brain, indicating breakdown in the BBB. However, the deposition of Gd-DTPA in PLP-BPI-treated mice was similar to that in normal control mice.

The 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is expressed in most cells, including neurons. Alongside its metabolic functions, it is also known to be activated in Alzheimer's brains, phosphorylate tau, and be a critical autophagy activator. Whether it plays a neurotoxic or neuroprotective role remains unclear. In tauopathies stress conditions can result in AMPK activation, enhancing tau-mediated toxicity. Paradoxically, in these cases AMPK activation does not always lead to protective autophagic responses. Using a Drosophila in vivo quantitative approach, we have analysed the impact of AMPK and autophagy on tau-mediated toxicity, recapitulating the AMPK-mediated tauopathy condition: increased tau phosphorylation, without corresponding autophagy activation. We have demonstrated that AMPK binding to and phosphorylating tau at Ser-262, a site reported to facilitate soluble tau accumulation, affects its degradation. This phosphorylation results in exacerbation of tau toxicity and is ameliorated via rapamycin-induced autophagy stimulation. Our findings support the development of combinatorial therapies effective at reducing tau toxicity targeting tau phosphorylation and AMPK-independent autophagic induction. The proposed in vivo tool represents an ideal readout to perform preliminary screening for drugs promoting this process."}

Mammary carcinogenesis was induced in the female Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). Following administration of MNU, rats progressively showed a reduction in food intake and body weight. Fourteen weeks after MNU treatment, rats were injected daily with CART or CART-antibody intracerebroventricularly for 5days, and food intake and body weight were monitored (g) before the next injection time-point. In normal rats, while a distinct anorexia and weight loss was observed following CART administration, injection of CART-antibody produced opposite effects. However, both the agents failed to produce any significant alterations in food intake and body weight of mammary tumor-bearing animals. An immunohistochemical application of antibodies against CART to the brain sections of cancerous rats showed a reduced immunoreactivity in the hypothalamic dorsomedial, ventromedial, lateral, paraventricular and arcuate nuclei. The results suggest that, cancerous condition might down-regulate the CART system in the hypothalamus.

The detailed molecular mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of β-LAP was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, reporter gene assay, Western blot, and RT-PCR analysis.	β-LAP inhibited the expression of iNOS, proinflammatory cytokines, and MMPs (MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9) at mRNA and protein levels in LPS-stimulated microglia. On the other hand, β-LAP upregulated the expressions of anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2). The anti-inflammatory effect of β-LAP was confirmed in an LPS-induced systemic inflammation mouse model. Thus, β-LAP inhibited microglial activation and the expressions of iNOS, proinflammatory cytokines, and MMPs in the LPS-injected mouse brain. Further mechanistic studies revealed that β-LAP exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting MAPKs, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB/AP-1 signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated microglia. β-LAP also inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by suppressing the expression and/or phosphorylation of NADPH oxidase subunit proteins, such as p47(phox) and gp91(phox). The anti-oxidant effects of β-LAP appeared to be related with the increase of HO-1 and NQO1 via the Nrf2/anti-oxidant response element (ARE) pathway and/or the PKA pathway.	The strong anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant effects of β-LAP may provide preventive therapeutic potential for various neuroinflammatory disorders."}

Because of allergenic and genotoxic effects, ginkgolic acids are restricted in EGb 761 to 5 ppm. The question arises whether ginkgolic acids also have neurotoxic effects. In the present study, ginkgolic acids caused death of cultured chick embryonic neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, in the presence and in the absence of serum. Ginkgolic acids-induced death showed features of apoptosis as we observed chromatin condensation, shrinkage of the nucleus and reduction of the damage by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, demonstrating an active type of cell death. However, DNA fragmentation detected by the terminal-transferase-mediated ddUTP-digoxigenin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and caspase-3 activation, which are also considered as hallmarks of apoptosis, were not seen after treatment with 150 microM ginkgolic acids in serum-free medium, a dose which increased the percentage of neurons with chromatin condensation and shrunken nuclei to 88% compared with 25% in serum-deprived, vehicle-treated controls. This suggests that ginkgolic acid-induced death showed signs of apoptosis as well as of necrosis. Ginkgolic acids specifically increased the activity of protein phosphatase type-2C, whereas other protein phosphatases such as protein phosphatases 1A, 2A and 2B, tyrosine phosphatase, and unspecific acid- and alkaline phosphatases were inhibited or remained unchanged, suggesting protein phosphatase 2C to play a role in the neurotoxic effect mediated by ginkgolic acids."}

Extracts of SF (SFe) have also been reported to increase skeletal muscle mass and inhibit muscle atrophy.	We examined whether SFe had muscle-protective effects in old mice after chronic forced exercises, and, if so, relevant mechanisms.	Ten-month-old aged male mice were divided into six groups. One group received no forced swimming after oral administration of distilled water (Intact); the other groups received forced swimming after administration of distilled water (SW), oxymetholone (OXY), or SFe at 500, 250 and 125mg/kg (SFe500, SFe250, and SFe125, respectively). Forced swimming was conducted for 2min at 30min after oral administration; the treatment was repeated for 28 days. Muscle thickness, weight, lean proportion, and strength were examined. The sampled muscles were subjected to histopathological and biochemical analyses. Plasma was examined by biochemical analyses.	The thicknesses of the calf muscle and the sampled gastrocnemius and soleus, protein proportion and muscle strength increased significantly in the SW group versus Intact, and they were further increased in the SFe and OXY groups versus SW. The forced swimming in the SW group upregulated mRNA expression related to protein synthesis (Akt1, PI3K) and muscle growth (A1R, TRPV4), while it downregulated mRNAs related to protein degradation (atrogin-1, MuRF1) and muscle growth inhibitor (myostatin, SIRT1). The detected upregulation and downregulation were enhanced in the SFe groups. In addition, the SFe administration inhibited lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species, and accelerated activities of endogenous anti-oxidants and anti-oxidant enzymes. Plasma biochemistry showed decreases in creatine, creatine kinase and LDH in the SFe groups versus SW, suggesting muscle-protective effects of SFe. In the SFe groups versus SW, histopathological analyses revealed an increase in myofibre diameter, and immunohistochemistry showed increases in myofibres immunoreactive for ATPase and decreases in myofibres for apoptosis markers (caspase-3, PARP) and oxidative stress markers (NT, 4HNE, iNOS).	Oral administration of SFe, especially SFe500, enhanced exercise-induced adaptive muscle strengthening in aged mice after forced swimming through anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant effects, mediated via modulation of gene expression related to muscle synthesis or degradation. These results suggest that SFe may be helpful in improvement various muscle disorders as an adjuvant therapy to exercise-based remedies."}

However, the edema-resolving mechanisms of triamcinolone are incompletely understood. Since cell swelling is a central cause of cytotoxic edema in the brain and retina, we determined the effects of triamcinolone acetonide on the swelling of retinal ganglion and Müller glial cells in acutely isolated retinas from rats and guinea pigs in situ. Triamcinolone acetonide (100 microM) had no effect on the swelling of ganglion cells that was evoked in isolated whole mounts of the guinea pig retina by acute application of glutamate (1 mM) or high K+ (50 mM). However, triamcinolone reversed the osmotic swelling of Müller glial cells in retinas of the rat that was observed under various experimental conditions: in retinas isolated at 3 days after transient retinal ischemia, in retinas of eyes with lipopolysaccharide-induced ocular inflammation, and in control retinas in the presence of Ba2+ (1 mM), H2O2 (200 microM), arachidonic acid (10 microM), or prostaglandin E2 (30 nM). The inhibiting effect of triamcinolone on osmotic glial cell swelling was mediated by stimulation of transporter-mediated release of endogenous adenosine and subsequent A1 receptor activation, resulting in an elevation of the intracellular cAMP level and activation of the protein kinase A, and, finally, in an opening of extrusion pathways for K+ and Cl- ions. The inhibitory effect on the cytotoxic swelling of glial cells may contribute to the fast edema-resolving effect of vitreal triamcinolone observed in human patients."}

An integrative look at memory, dementia and the promising therapeutics of traditional chinese medicines.^\nRecent advances in neuroscience have revealed a greater, in-depth understanding of the complexities associated with memory. Contemporary theories hold that an integral relationship between memory formation, stabilization and consolidation revolve around plasticity of neuronal networks. The associated requisite receptors α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and cellular mechanisms surrounding plasticity (posed to incite molecular functionality), also display strong correlations in the pathogenesis of dementias. When the brain is in a diseased state as a result of malignant neurotransmission (i.e. in Alzheimer's disease; AD), the homeostatic balance required for normal neuronal processes is disrupted, which leads to degeneration of neural circuitry. Present efforts to find new treatments aimed at reversing or halting neurodegeneration are immense, with increasing attention being placed on investigating various herbal medicines. A wide variety of herbal plants (i.e. Panax ginseng, Polygala tenuifolia, Acorus gramineus and Huperzia serrata, examined here within), extracts and compounds have, to date, already presented advantageous results when tested against known pathogenic markers related to AD-associated dementia.

Here, we investigated the role of CGRP in an animal model that mimics the chronic migraine condition via repeated and intermittent nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. We also evaluated the modulatory effect of topiramate on this experimental paradigm. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with NTG (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle, every 2 days over a 9-day period (5 total injections). A group of animals was injected with topiramate (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline every day for 9 days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration of NTG or vehicle, animals underwent tail flick test and orofacial Von Frey test. Rats were subsequently sacrificed to evaluate c-Fos and CGRP gene expression in medulla-pons region, cervical spinal cord and trigeminal ganglia.	NTG administration induced spinal hyperalgesia and orofacial allodynia, together with a significant increase in the expression of CGRP and c-Fos genes in trigeminal ganglia and central areas. Topiramate treatment prevented NTG-induced changes by reversing NTG-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia, and inhibiting CGRP and c-Fos gene expression in all areas evaluated.	These findings point to the role of CGRP in the processes underlying migraine chronification and suggest a possible interaction with gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and glutamate transmission to induce/maintain central sensitization and to contribute to the dysregulation of descending pain system involved in chronic migraine."}

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is avidly retained in photoreceptors, while mechanisms controlling DHA uptake and retention are unknown. Thus, we demonstrate that AdipoR1 ablation results in DHA reduction. In situ hybridization reveals photoreceptor and RPE cell AdipoR1 expression, blunted in AdipoR1(-/-) mice. We also find decreased photoreceptor-specific phosphatidylcholine containing very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and severely attenuated electroretinograms. These changes precede progressive photoreceptor degeneration in AdipoR1(-/-) mice. RPE-rich eyecup cultures from AdipoR1(-/-) reveal impaired DHA uptake. AdipoR1 overexpression in RPE cells enhances DHA uptake, whereas AdipoR1 silencing has the opposite effect. These results establish AdipoR1 as a regulatory switch of DHA uptake, retention, conservation and elongation in photoreceptors and RPE, thus preserving photoreceptor cell integrity."}

Characterization of the transmembrane topology of G6Pase should facilitate the identification of amino acid residues contributing to the active site and broaden our understanding of the effects of mutations that cause glycogen storage disease type 1a. Using N- and C-terminal tagged G6Pase, we show that in intact microsomes, the N terminus is resistant to protease digestion, whereas the C terminus is sensitive to such treatment. Our results demonstrate that G6Pase possesses an odd number of transmembrane helices, with its N and C termini facing the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and the cytoplasm, respectively. During catalysis, a phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate is formed, and the phosphoryl acceptor in G6Pase is a His residue. Sequence alignment suggests that mammalian G6Pases, lipid phosphatases, acid phosphatases, and a vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase (whose tertiary structure is known) share a conserved phosphatase motif. Active-site alignment of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase and G6Pases predicts that Arg-83, His-119, and His-176 in G6Pase contribute to the active site and that His-176 is the residue that covalently binds the phosphoryl moiety during catalysis. This alignment also predicts that Arg-83, His-119, and His-176 reside on the same side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, which is supported by the recently predicted nine-transmembrane helical model for G6Pase. We have previously shown that Arg-83 is involved in positioning the phosphate during catalysis and that His-119 is essential for G6Pase activity. Here we demonstrate that substitution of His-176 with structurally similar or dissimilar amino acids inactivates the enzyme, suggesting that His-176 could be the phosphoryl acceptor in G6Pase during catalysis."}

From a large series of pyrrolyl-quinoxalinedione derivatives, we selected six new competitive non-NMDA receptor antagonists. The basis of selection was high potency and selectivity for AMPA and/or kainate receptors, high in vivo potency after systemic administration, and an acceptable ratio between neuroprotective or anticonvulsant effects and adverse effects. Pharmacological characteristics of these novel compounds are described in this study with special emphasis on their effects in the kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common type of epilepsy in humans. In most experiments, NBQX and the major antiepileptic drug valproate were used for comparison with the novel compounds. The novel non-NMDA receptor antagonists markedly differed in their AMPA and kainate receptor affinities from NBQX. Thus, while NBQX essentially did not bind to kainate receptors at relevant concentrations, several of the novel compounds exhibited affinity to rat brain kainate receptors or recombinant kainate receptor subtypes in addition to AMPA receptors. One compound, LU 97175, bound to native high affinity kainate receptors and rat GluR5-GluR7 subunits, i.e. low affinity kainate binding sites, with much higher affinities than to AMPA receptors. All compounds potently blocked AMPA-induced cell death in vitro and, except LU 97175, AMPA-induced convulsions in vivo. In the kindling model, compounds with a high affinity for GluR7 (LU 97175) or compounds (LU 115455, LU 136541) which potently bind to AMPA receptors and low affinity kainate receptor subunits were potent anticonvulsants in the kindling model, whereas the AMPA receptor-selective LU 112313 was the least selective compound in this model, indicating that non-NMDA antagonists acting at both AMPA and kainate receptors are more effective in this model than AMPA receptor-selective drugs. Three of the novel compounds, i.e. LU 97175, LU 115455 and LU 136541, exerted potent anticonvulsant effects without inducing motor impairment in the rotarod test.

Four patients presented with symptoms of hippocampal dysfunction (i.e. severe short-term memory loss) and three with extensive limbic dysfunction (i.e. confusion, seizures and suspected psychosis). Brain MRI and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET complemented each other but did not overlap in 50% of the patients. Combining both tests, all patients had temporal lobe abnormalities, five with additional areas involved. In one patient, FDG hyperactivity in the brainstem that was normal on MRI correlated with central hypoventilation; in another case, hyperactivity in the cerebellum anticipated ataxia. All patients had abnormal CSF: six pleocytosis, six had increased protein concentration, and three of five examined had oligoclonal bands. A tumour was identified and removed in four patients (mediastinal teratoma, thymoma, thymic carcinoma and thyroid cancer) and not treated in one (ovarian teratoma). An immunohistochemical technique that facilitates the detection of antibodies to cell surface or synaptic proteins demonstrated that six patients had antibodies to the neuropil of hippocampus or cerebellum, and one to intraneuronal antigens. Only one of the neuropil antibodies corresponded to voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibodies; the other five (two with identical specificity) reacted with antigens concentrated in areas of high dendritic density or synaptic-enriched regions of the hippocampus or cerebellum. Preliminary characterization of these antigens indicates that they are diverse and expressed on the neuronal cell membrane and dendrites; they do not co-localize with VGKCs, but partially co-localize with spinophilin. A target autoantigen in one of the patients co-localizes with a cell surface protein involved in hippocampal dendritic development. All patients except the one with antibodies to intracellular antigens had dramatic clinical and neuroimaging responses to immunotherapy or tumour resection; two patients had neurological relapse and improved with immunotherapy. Overall, the phenotype associated with the novel neuropil antibodies includes dominant behavioural and psychiatric symptoms and seizures that often interfere with the evaluation of cognition and memory, and brain MRI or FDG-PET abnormalities less frequently restricted to the medial temporal lobes than in patients with classical paraneoplastic or VGKC antibodies. When compared with patients with VGKC antibodies, patients with these novel antibodies are more likely to have CSF inflammatory abnormalities and systemic tumours (teratoma and thymoma), and they do not develop SIADH-like hyponatraemia. Although most autoantigens await characterization, all share intense expression by the neuropil of hippocampus, with patterns of immunolabelling characteristic enough to suggest the diagnosis of these disorders and predict response to treatment."}

Lipid peroxidation (LP) is involved in triggering postinjury CRMP2 proteolysis. We examined the hypothesis that propofol could attenuate LP, calpain-induced CRMP2 degradation, and brain injury after TBI.	A unilateral moderate controlled cortical impact injury was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were randomly divided into seven groups: Sham control group, TBI group, TBI + propofol groups (including propofol 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h groups), TBI + U83836E group and TBI + fat emulsion group. The LP inhibitor U83836E was used as a control to identify that antioxidation partially accounts for the potential neuroprotective effects of propofol. The solvent of propofol, fat emulsion, was used as the vehicle control. Ipsilateral cortex tissues were harvested at 24 h post-TBI. Immunofluorescent staining, Western blot analysis, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling were used to evaluate LP, calpain activity, CRMP2 proteolysis and programmed cell death.

We developed an integrated analysis of gene expression data to study the acute gene changes caused by the direct exposure to Meth treatment of astrocytes in vitro, and to better understand how astrocytes respond, what are the early molecular markers associated with this response. We examined the literature in search of similar changes in gene signatures that are found in central nervous system disorders.	We identified overexpressed gene networks represented by genes of an inflammatory and immune nature and that are implicated in neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. The overexpressed networks are linked to molecules that were highly upregulated in astrocytes by all doses of methamphetamine tested and that could play a role in the central nervous system. The strongest overexpressed signatures were the upregulation of MAP2K5, GPR65, and CXCL5, and the gene networks individually associated with these molecules.

Moreover, we identified the small fragment of C-terminal domain of p42 is sufficient to exhibit tumor suppressing activity of p42-WT, revealing that this small fragment (280-394) of p42 is required for the binding of both HSP70 and CHIP for a degradation of p85. Furthermore, we showed the small fragment of p42 markedly inhibited the tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of brain and breast cancer, resembling tumor suppressing activity of p42. Through identification of the smallest fragment of p42 that is responsible for its tumor suppressor activity, our findings represent a novel approach for targeted therapy of cancers that overexpress PI3K."}

Animal studies support multiple beneficial effects of vitamin B12 including the regeneration of nerves and the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes and other pain-signaling pathways. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated synergistic benefits of vitamin B12 combined with other pain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates. Clinical trials provide evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin B12 for the treatment of low back pain and neuralgia, although data is still fairly limited and optimal treatment regimens have not been identified.

MERTK plays a key role in renewal of photoreceptor outer segments (OS) by phagocytosis of shed OS tips. Mutations in MERTK cause impaired phagocytic activity and accumulation of OS debris in the interphotoreceptor space that ultimately leads to photoreceptor cell death. In the present study, we conducted a series of preclinical potency and GLP-compliant safety evaluations of an adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) vector expressing human MERTK cDNA driven by the retinal pigment epithelium-specific, VMD2 promoter. We demonstrate the potency of the vector in RCS rats by improved electroretinogram (ERG) responses in treated eyes compared with contralateral untreated controls. Toxicology and biodistribution studies were performed in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats injected with two different doses of AAV vectors and buffer control. Delivery of vector in SD rats did not result in a change in ERG amplitudes of rod and cone responses relative to balanced salt solution control-injected eyes, indicating that administration of AAV vector did not adversely affect normal retinal function. In vivo fundoscopic analysis and postmortem retinal morphology of the vector-injected eyes were normal compared with controls. Evaluation of blood smears showed the lack of transformed cells in the treated eyes. All injected eyes and day 1 blood samples were positive for vector genomes, and all peripheral tissues were negative. Our results demonstrate the potency and safety of the AAV2-VMD2-hMERTK vector in animal models tested. A GMP vector has been manufactured and is presently in clinical trial."}

Despite its well-documented efficacy, its biological basis remains largely elusive. In this study, we found that mechanical stimulation at the acupoint of Yanglingquan (GB34) promoted the autophagic clearance of α-synuclein (α-syn), a well known aggregation-prone protein closely related to Parkinson's disease (PD), in the substantia nigra par compacta (SNpc) of the brain in a PD mouse model. We found the protein clearance arose from the activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) in a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-independent approach. Further, we observed the recovery in the activity of dopaminergic neurons in SNpc, and improvement in the motor function at the behavior level of PD mice. Whereas acupuncture and rapamycin, a chemical mTOR inhibitor, show comparable α-syn clearance and therapeutic effects in the PD mouse model, the latter adopts a distinctly different, mTOR-dependent, autophagy induction process. Due to this fundamental difference, acupuncture may circumvent adverse effects of the rapamycin treatment. The newly discovered connection between acupuncture and autophagy not only provides a new route to understanding the molecular mechanism of acupuncture but also sheds new light on cost-effective and safe therapy of neurodegenerative diseases."}

Phase II is the recovery phase. Phase III is characterized by recurrent illness, progressive organ dysfunction, and elevated proinflammatory cytokines.	Male ICR mice were randomized (on Experiment Day 0, time = 0 h) into four initial groups (A-D): Control Group A received no zymosan and no IL-10. Group B received zymosan (1 mg/g mouse BW, t = 0) and no IL-10. Group C received no zymosan and IL-10 at t = 2 h. Group D received zymosan and IL-10 at t = 2 h. On Experiment Day 4, mice in Groups B-D were randomized into six further treatment groups (B1 and B2, C1 and C2, D1 and D2). Group B1 received no treatment. Group B2 received IL-10 when clinical signs of recurrent illness developed (Phase III, 12-18 days after zymosan treatment).

As an enzyme which is responsible for the majority of transglutaminase (TG) activity in the brain, TG2 is likely to play a modulatory role in nervous system development and has regulatory effect on neuronal cell death as well. Most importantly, numerous studies have presented data demonstrating that dysregulation of TG2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as well as nervous system injuries. Although TG2's involvement in these disease conditions is strongly suggested by various findings, such as the increase of TG2 mRNA expression, protein level and TG activity in the pathological process of these neurodegenerative disorders, as well as the therapeutic effect of TG2 genetic deletion in animal models of Huntington's disease, the precise mechanism underlying TG2's role remain unclear. TG2 was originally proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases by facilitating the formation of insoluble protein aggregates, however recent findings clearly indicate that this is likely not the case. Nonetheless, there is data to suggest that TG2 may play a role in neurodegenerative processes by stabilizing toxic oligomers of the disease-relevant proteins, although further studies are needed to validate these initial in vitro findings."}

The central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA) contains a high concentration of BDNF in terminals, originating from the pontine parabrachial nucleus. Since the spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid neural pathway is known to convey nociceptive information, we hypothesized a possible involvement of BDNF in supraspinal pain-related processes. To test this hypothesis, we generated localized deletion of BDNF in the parabrachial nucleus using local bilateral injections of adeno-associated viruses in adult floxed-BDNF mice. Basal thresholds of thermal and mechanical nociceptive responses were not altered by BDNF loss and no behavioural deficit was noticed in anxiety and motor tests. However, BDNF-deleted animals displayed a major decrease in the analgesic effect of morphine. In addition, intra-CeA injections of the BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc in control mice also decreased morphine-induced analgesia. Finally, the number of c-Fos immunoreactive nuclei after acute morphine injection was decreased by 45% in the extended amygdala of BDNF-deleted animals. The absence of BDNF in the parabrachial nucleus thus altered the parabrachio-amygdaloid pathway. Overall, our study provides evidence that BDNF produced in the parabrachial nucleus modulates the functions of the parabrachio-amygdaloid pathway in opiate analgesia."}

The same diet and exercise regime prescribed for PSSM1 is recommended for PSSM2; however, the benefit of these recommendations for PSSM2 is undocumented. The objectives of this study were to determine traits of PSSM2 Warmblood horses (WB), determine the changes in exercise responses that occur with a recommended low-starch/fat-supplemented diet and exercise regime, and determine if glycogen concentrations correspond to the severity of signs. Owners of PSSM2 WB (2008-2016), completed a retrospective questionnaire regarding their horse. Glycogen concentrations were analyzed in skeletal muscle of PSSM2 WB (n = 36) obtained prior to recommendations and in control WB with no evident myopathy (n = 23). Chi-square, Fisher's exact, McNemar's tests with Bonferroni correction and Mann Whitney testing were utilized. Abnormal exercise responses reported by owners, began at approximately 6 years of age and included a decline in performance, a reluctance to collect and reluctance to go forward in over 50% of horses. With the recommended diet and exercise regime, 80% of PSSM2 WB owners reported an overall improvement with significant decreases in the proportion of horses showing a decline in performance and rhabdomyolysis. However, 53% of PSSM2 WB were still not advancing as expected with reluctance to go forward and collect persisting in approximately one third of horses. Median muscle glycogen concentrations did not differ between PSSM2 WB and WB with no evident myopathy. PSSM2 WB with the highest glycogen concentrations were significantly more likely to show a decline in performance than those with lower glycogen concentrations. In conclusion, diet and exercise recommendations ideal for PSSM1 improve but do not eliminate the decline in performance and reluctance to go forward under saddle characteristic of PSSM2."}

Here we report that Abeta(1-42) treatment both in vitro and in vivo, as well as endogenous generation of Abeta in C100 and APP/PS1 transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease, stimulate neurogenesis of young adult subventricular zone precursors. The neurogenic effect of Abeta(1-42) was found to require expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) by the precursor cells, and activation of p75(NTR) by metalloprotease cleavage. However, precursors from 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice failed to respond to Abeta(1-42). Our results suggest that overstimulation of p75(NTR)-positive progenitors during early life might result in depletion of the stem cell pool and thus a more rapid decline in basal neurogenesis.

While oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are essential for generating oligodendrocytes for myelin repair, other cell types also participate in the damage and repair processes. The NG2 proteoglycan is expressed by OPCs, pericytes, and macrophages/microglia. In this report we investigate the effects of NG2 on these cell types during spinal cord demyelination/remyelination.	Demyelinated lesions were created by microinjecting 1% lysolecithin into the lumbar spinal cord. Following demyelination, NG2 expression patterns in wild type mice were studied via immunostaining. Immunolabeling was also used in wild type and NG2 null mice to compare the extent of myelin damage, the kinetics of myelin repair, and the respective responses of OPCs, pericytes, and macrophages/microglia. Cell proliferation was quantified by studies of BrdU incorporation, and cytokine expression levels were evaluated using qRT-PCR.	The initial volume of spinal cord demyelination in wild type mice is twice as large as in NG2 null mice. However, over the ensuing 5 weeks there is a 6-fold improvement in myelination in wild type mice, versus only a 2-fold improvement in NG2 null mice. NG2 ablation also results in reduced numbers of each of the three affected cell types. BrdU incorporation studies reveal that reduced cell proliferation is an important factor underlying NG2-dependent decreases in each of the three key cell populations. In addition, NG2 ablation reduces macrophage/microglial cell migration and shifts cytokine expression from a pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory phenotype.	Loss of NG2 expression leads to decreased proliferation of OPCs, pericytes, and macrophages/microglia, reducing the abundance of all three cell types in demyelinated spinal cord lesions. As a result of these NG2-dependent changes, the course of demyelination and remyelination in NG2 null mice differs from that seen in wild type mice, with both myelin damage and repair being reduced in the NG2 null mouse. These studies identify NG2 as an important factor in regulating myelin processing, suggesting that therapeutic targeting of the proteoglycan might offer a means of manipulating cell behavior in demyelinating diseases."}

The control group was treated with 0.9% saline (control group, s.c.). Another group of rats received pilocarpine (400mg/kg, s.c.) and both groups were sacrificed 24 h after the treatment. This work was performed to determine the alterations in monoamine levels (dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE)) and their metabolites (3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanilic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)) after pilocarpine-induced SE in hippocampus and frontal cortex of adult rats. The monoamines and their metabolites were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. DA and 5-HIAA concentrations were not altered in the hippocampus of the pilocarpine group, but in the same group the 5-HT (160%), DOPAC (316%) and HVA (21%) levels increased, whereas, the NE (47%) content declined. For the frontal cortex determinations, there was an increase of 20 and 72% in DA and DOPAC levels, respectively, and a decrease in NE (32%), 5-HT (33%) and 5-HIAA (19%) concentrations, but HVA content remained unaltered. These results indicate that pilocarpine-induced SE can alter monoamine levels in different ways depending on the brain area studied, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved."}

The rationale for this type of vaccine is that genes specifying an array of weakly immunogenic, unique tumor antigens associated with the malignant cells will be expressed in a highly immunogenic form by the transfected cells. Here, the immunotherapeutic properties of a vaccine prepared by transfection of mouse fibroblasts with DNA from a breast carcinoma (SB-5b) that arose spontaneously in a C3H/He mouse (H-2Kb) were tested in mice with intracerebral breast cancer. To augment their nonspecific immunogenic properties, before DNA transfer, the fibroblasts (of C3H/He mouse origin) were modified to express allogeneic MHC class I H-2Kb-determinants and to secrete IL-2, IL-18 or GM-CSF. The results indicate that C3H/He mice injected intracerebrally (i.c.) with the breast cancer cells and syngeneic/allogeneic-transfected fibroblasts modified to secrete IL-2 survived significantly longer (P < .005) than mice in various control groups, including mice injected i.c. with the breast cancer cells alone. The immunotherapeutic properties of transfected fibroblasts modified to secrete IL-18 or GM-CSF were less efficacious. The results of two independent in vitro cytotoxicity assays indicate that systemic cellular antitumor immunity was generated in mice injected i.c. with the transfected cells, and the immunity was mediated predominantly by CD8+ T cells."}

Our objective was to measure spinal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release during strychnine-allodynia and examine the effects of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthetase. Under halothane, rats were fitted with intrathecal and spinal microdialysis catheters, and microelectrodes implanted into the locus coeruleus for measurement of catechol oxidation current (CAOC) using voltammetry. Animals were then administered urethane and treated as follows: 1) baseline control 10 min, intrathecal strychnine (40 microg) 10 min, 10 min of hair deflection, and 2) 10-min control followed by intrathecal strychnine (40 microg) with hair deflection for 60 min. Spinal dialysate samples were collected for PGE2 levels determined by using immunoassay. In separate experiments, the effect of intrathecal strychnine (40 microg) followed by hair deflection was studied in rats pretreated with intrathecal l-NOARG (50 nmol). After intrathecal strychnine, hair deflection significantly increased spinal PGE2 release (619% +/- 143%), locus coeruleus CAOC (181% +/- 6%), and mean arterial pressure (123% +/- 2%) P < 0.05. Pretreatment with intrathecal l-NOARG significantly inhibited strychnine-allodynia. In this model, hair deflection evokes spinal PGE2 release, locus coeruleus activation, and an increase in mean arterial pressure. L-NOARG pretreatment attenuated the locus coeruleus CAOC, a biochemical index of strychnine-allodynia, suggesting a mediator role of nitric oxide. A mediator role of nitric oxide is also implicated, helping to explain the pathophysiology of this allodynic pain."}

One such emerging virus of public health concern is chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a member of the Togaviridae family, genus Alphavirus CHIKV pathogenesis is predominately characterized by acute febrile symptoms and severe arthralgia, which can persist in the host long after viral clearance. CHIKV has also been implicated in cases of acute encephalomyelitis, and its vertical transmission has been reported. Currently, no FDA-approved treatments exist for this virus. Recoding elements help expand the coding capacity in many viruses and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets in antiviral treatments. Here, we report the molecular and structural characterization of two CHIKV translational recoding signals: a termination codon read-through (TCR) element located between the nonstructural protein 3 and 4 genes and a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) signal located toward the 3' end of the CHIKV 6K gene. Using Dual-Luciferase and immunoblot assays in HEK293T and U87MG mammalian cell lines, we validated and genetically characterized efficient TCR and -1 PRF. Analyses of RNA chemical modification data with selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension (SHAPE) assays revealed that CHIKV -1 PRF is stimulated by a tightly structured, triple-stem hairpin element, consistent with previous observations in alphaviruses, and that the TCR signal is composed of a single large multibulged hairpin element. These findings illuminate the roles of RNA structure in translational recoding and provide critical information relevant for design of live-attenuated vaccines against CHIKV and related viruses."}

Noradrenaline formed from L-DOPA may stimulate alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. We assessed the involvement of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in actions of L-DOPA in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned macaques. In each animal, the minimal dose of L-DOPA required to alleviate parkinsonian symptoms was defined (12.5-25 mg/kg p.o.). The effects of coadministration of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin ([4-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-quinazolin-2-yl) piperazin-1-yl]-(2-furyl)methanone) on motor activity, parkinsonism, and dyskinesia were assessed. Antiparkinsonian benefit was accompanied by mild dyskinesia. L-DOPA also elicited hyperactivity, i.e., activity greater than that seen in normal animals. Coadministration of prazosin (0.16-0.63 mg/kg p.o.) with L-DOPA did not significantly affect either its antiparkinsonian actions or dyskinesia. However, prazosin significantly and dose-dependently attenuated L-DOPA-induced activity, reducing it to a level equivalent to that of normal animals. More specifically, during periods of pronounced L-DOPA-induced activity, prazosin attenuated the total and duration of activity by 80 and 76%, respectively. These actions of prazosin were expressed in the absence of sedation. Although activation of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors plays no major role in the antiparkinsonian and dyskinetic effects of L-DOPA per se, it does contribute to the induction of hyperactivity. alpha(1)-Adrenoceptors may be involved in pathological responses to L-DOPA treatment, including the dopamine dysregulation syndrome."}

Studies confirm that multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury lesions contain myelinating cells and their progenitors. Recruiting these endogenous cells to remyelinate may be of therapeutic value. This review addresses the use of antibodies reactive to CNS antigens to promote remyelination. Antibody-induced remyelination in a virus-mediated model of chronic spinal cord injury was initially observed in response to treatment with CNS reactive antisera. Monoclonal mouse and human IgMs, which bind to the surface of oligodendrocytes and myelin, were later identified that were functionally equivalent to antisera. A recombinant form of a human remyelination-promoting IgM (rHIgM22) targets areas of CNS injury and promotes maximal remyelination within 5 weeks after a single low dose (25 microg/kg). The IgM isoform of this reparative antibody is required for in vivo function. We hypothesize that the IgM clusters membrane domains and associated signaling molecules on the surface of target cells. Current therapies for MS are designed to modulate inflammation. In contrast, remyelination promoting IgMs are the first potential therapeutic molecules designed to induce tissue repair by acting within the CNS at sites of damage on the cells responsible for myelin synthesis."}

This discovery raises the encouraging prospect that therapeutic intervention prior to reperfusion may reduce the severity of ischaemic damage. Recently, the central role of oxygen-derived free radicals (oxyradicals) in reperfusion injury has been demonstrated. It appears that the adverse consequences of ischaemic diseases can be reduced by optimizing the anti-oxidant capability of tissues with anti-oxidant nutrients or drugs. The importance of oxyradicals in individual ischaemic diseases of the dog and cat, however, remains largely uninvestigated. Similarly, the best pharmaceutical and nutritional approaches to the therapy of oxyradical-mediated damage have yet to be devised."}

It has been reported that application of sciatic nerve conditioning injury plays a positive role in repairing the injury of the ascending spinal sensory pathway in laboratory animals. Because of the complexity of SCI and related ethics challenges, sciatic nerve conditioning injury cannot be applied in clinical therapy. Accordingly, it is extremely important to study its mechanism and develop replacement therapy. Based on empirical study and clinical trials, this article suggests that miR-142-3p is the key therapeutic target for repairing sensory function, based on the following evidence. Firstly, studies have reported that endogenous cAMP is the upstream regulator of 3 signal pathways that are partially involved in the mechanisms of sciatic nerve conditioning injury, promoting neurite growth. The regulated miR-142-3p can induce cAMP elevation via adenylyl cyclase 9 (AC9), which is abundant in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Secondly, compared with gene expression regulation in the injured spinal cord, inhibition of microRNA (miRNA) in DRG is less likely to cause trauma and infection. Thirdly, evidence of miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in many diseases has been reported. In this article we suggest, for the first time, imitating sciatic nerve conditioning injury, thereby enhancing central regeneration of primary sensory neurons via interfering with the congenerous upstream regulator AC9 of the 3 above-mentioned signal pathways. We hope to provide a new clinical treatment strategy for the recovery of sensory function in SCI patients."}

To find a treatment for APBD, we screened 1,700 FDA-approved compounds in fibroblasts derived from APBD-modeling GBE1-knockin mice. Capitalizing on fluorescent periodic acid-Schiff reagent, which interacts with polyglucosans in the cell, this screen discovered that the flavoring agent guaiacol can lower polyglucosans, a result also confirmed in APBD patient fibroblasts. Biochemical assays showed that guaiacol lowers basal and glucose 6-phosphate-stimulated glycogen synthase (GYS) activity. Guaiacol also increased inactivating GYS1 phosphorylation and phosphorylation of the master activator of catabolism, AMP-dependent protein kinase. Guaiacol treatment in the APBD mouse model rescued grip strength and shorter lifespan. These treatments had no adverse effects except making the mice slightly hyperglycemic, possibly due to the reduced liver glycogen levels. In addition, treatment corrected penile prolapse in aged GBE1-knockin mice. Guaiacol's curative effects can be explained by its reduction of polyglucosans in peripheral nerve, liver, and heart, despite a short half-life of up to 60 minutes in most tissues. Our results form the basis to use guaiacol as a treatment and prepare for the clinical trials in APBD."}

We now recognize that certain K+ channel subunits are directly gated to pain-relevant stimuli (Kv1.1, K2P) whereas others are specifically modulated by inflammatory processes (Kv7, BKCA, K2P). Genetic analyses illustrate that K+ channel gene variation can predict pain sensitivity (KCNS1, GIRKs), risk for persistent pain (KCNS1, GIRKs, TRESK) and analgesic effectiveness (GIRK2). Importantly, preclinical studies confirm that K+ channel dysfunction can be a pain trigger in traumatic neuropathies (Kv9.1/Kv2.1, Kv7, Kv1.2) and migraine (TRESK). Finally, emerging data suggest that even pain in diabetes, bone cancer and autoimmune neuropathies may have K+ channel dysfunction constituents.	There is a long-sought need for superior pharmacotherapy of pain syndromes. Although universal enhancement of K+ channel function in the periphery can decrease nociceptive excitability irrespective of the underlying cause, a more refined targeting of subunits with dominant nociceptive roles could yield highly efficacious treatments with fewer side-effects. The ongoing characterization of molecular interactions linking K+ channel dysfunction to pain is instrumental for identifying candidates with the most therapeutic potential."}

The animals were divided into four experimental groups: 1, saline control; 2, metaphit-injected; 3, metaphit + NMDA administered and 4, NMDA-treated. Upon the treatment, the rats were exposed to sound stimulation (100 +/- 3 dB, for 60 s) at hourly intervals and the incidence and severity (running, clonus and tonus) of seizures were analysed. In group 3, only the animals which did not exhibit any metaphit-induced audiogenic seizures over 8 h were given a subconvulsive NMDA dose after the eighth audiogenic testing. For EEG recordings, three gold-plated screws were implanted into the rat skull. In most animals, metaphit led to EEG abnormalities and elicited epileptiform activity recorded as spikes, polyspikes and spike-wave complexes. Maximum incidence and severity of metaphit-induced convulsions occurred 8 h after injection (incidence 9/12), abating gradually until disappearing 30 h later. NMDA alone provoked no seizure response but the initial signs characterized by isolated spike activity evolving into sporadic slow-wave complexes, thus representing a proconvulsive brain state, were observed. This compound led to stereotyped behaviour seen as asymmetric posture, loss of righting reflex and tonic hind limb extension lasting for 60-90 min. It also potentiated metaphit-induced audiogenic seizures. Potentiation of metaphit-related audiogenic seizures by NMDA was recorded in three out of 17 rats that had never displayed seizures in eight previous testings, with a maximum incidence of eight out of 17 animals, 13-14 h after metaphit administration and seizures lasted for 10 h."}

Ang II causes skeletal muscle wasting by reducing appetite and by enhancing catabolism. The serine/threonine kinase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions mainly as a sensor of cellular energy status. It is energy sparing and favors ATP generation. We hypothesized that Ang II induces muscle wasting in part by inhibiting AMPK signaling and altering cellular energy balance. Our results show that Ang II infusion in mice reduced gastrocnemius muscle weight by 26% and depleted ATP by 74%. In addition, Ang II upregulated protein phosphatase 2Cα by 2.6-fold and reduced AMPK phosphorylation and signaling in muscle. Importantly, the pharmacological AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside restored AMPK activity to levels of pair-fed controls and reversed Ang II-mediated ATP depletion and muscle wasting. Moreover, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside activated Akt and inhibited Ang II-induced increases in E3 ubiquitin ligase expression.

Here, we conduct a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded study to examine the therapeutic window of Cerebrolysin treatment of rats subjected to embolic stroke. Methods Male Wistar rats age 3-4 months (n = 100) were subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion. Animals were randomized to receive saline or Cerebrolysin daily for 10 consecutive days starting 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurological outcome was measured weekly with a battery of behavioral tests (adhesive removal test, modified neurological severity score (mNSS), and foot-fault test). Global test was employed to assess Cerebrolysin effect on neurological recovery with estimation of mean difference between Cerebrolysin and control-treated groups and its 95% confidence interval in the intent-to-treat population, where a negative value of the mean difference and 95% confidence interval < 0 indicated a significant treatment effect. All rats were sacrificed 28 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion and infarct volume was measured. Results Cerebrolysin treatment initiated within 48 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion onset significantly improved functional outcome; mean differences and 95% confidence interval were -11.6 (-17.7, -5.4) at 4 h, -7.1 (-13.5, -0.8) at 24 h, -8.4 (-14.2, -8.6) at 48 h, and -4.9 (-11.4, 1.5) at 72 h.

We checked trials included in relevant systematic reviews.	We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher with lower PUFA intakes in adults with or without cardiovascular disease that assessed effects over 12 months or longer. We included full texts, abstracts, trials registry entries and unpublished data. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and events, risk factors (blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure), and adverse events. We excluded trials where we could not separate effects of PUFA intake from other dietary, lifestyle or medication interventions.	Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We wrote to authors of included trials for further data. Meta-analyses used random-effects analysis, sensitivity analyses included fixed-effects and limiting to low summary risk of bias. We assessed GRADE quality of evidence.	We included 49 RCTs randomising 24,272 participants, with duration of one to eight years. Eleven included trials were at low summary risk of bias, 33 recruited participants without cardiovascular disease. Baseline PUFA intake was unclear in most trials, but 3.9% to 8% of total energy intake where reported. Most trials gave supplemental capsules, but eight gave dietary advice, eight gave supplemental foods such as nuts or margarine, and three used a combination of methods to increase PUFA.Increasing PUFA intake probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (risk 7.8% vs 7.6%, risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.07, 19,290 participants in 24 trials), but probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease events from 14.2% to 12.3% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, 15 trials, 10,076 participants) and cardiovascular disease events from 14.6% to 13.0% (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01, 17,799 participants in 21 trials), all moderate-quality evidence.

Critical steps in our strategy consist of two-dimensional electrophoresis-based protein separation and in vitro caspase-3 incubation of immobilized proteins to sort out direct substrates. Among 46 putative substrates identified in MN9D neuronal cells, we further evaluated whether caspase-3-mediated cleavage of anamorsin, a recently recognized cell death-defying factor in hematopoiesis, is a general feature of apoptosis. In vitro and cell-based cleavage assays indicated that anamorsin was specifically cleaved by caspase-3 but not by other caspases, generating 25- and 10-kDa fragments. Thus, in apoptosis of neuronal and non-neuronal cells induced by various stimuli including staurosporine, etoposide, or 6-hydroxydopamine, the cleavage of anamorsin was found to be blocked in the presence of caspase inhibitor. Among four tetrapeptide consensus DXXD motifs existing in anamorsin, we mapped a specific cleavage site for caspase-3 at DSVD(209)↓L. Intriguingly, the 25-kDa cleaved fragment of anamorsin was also detected in post-mortem brains of Alzheimer and Parkinson disease patients. Although the RNA interference-mediated knockdown of anamorsin rendered neuronal cells more vulnerable to staurosporine treatment, reintroduction of full-length anamorsin into an anamorsin knock-out stromal cell line made cells resistant to staurosporine-induced caspase activation, indicating the antiapoptotic function of anamorsin. Taken together, our approach seems to be effective to identify novel substrates for caspases and has the potential to provide meaningful insights into newly identified substrates involved in neurodegenerative processes."}

Here we report that a protein kinase A (PKA)-anchoring inhibitor, st-Ht31, induces robust cholesterol/phospholipid efflux, and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) greatly facilitates this process. Remarkably, we found that st-Ht31 completely reverses foam cell formation, and this process is ABCA1-dependent. The reversal is also accompanied by the restoration of well modulated inflammatory response to LPS. There is no detectable toxicity associated with st-Ht31, even when cells export up to 20% cellular cholesterol per hour. Using FRET-based PKA biosensors in live cells, we provide evidence that st-Ht31 drives cholesterol efflux by elevating PKA activity specifically in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, ABCA1 facilitates st-Ht31 uptake. This allows st-Ht31 to effectively remove cholesterol from ABCA1-expressing cells. We speculate that de-anchoring of PKA offers a novel therapeutic strategy to remove excess cholesterol from lipid-laden lesion macrophages."}

Here, we investigated to determine whether systematic administration of proteasome inhibitor, carbobenzoxy-L: -gamma-t-butyl-L: -glutamyl-L: -alanyl-L: -leucinal (PSI) protects against MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) neurotoxicity in mice. Three administrations of MPTP at 1-h intervals to mice reduced significantly the concentration of dopamine, DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) and HVA (homovanillic acid) in the striatum after 5 days. In contrast, PSI (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) prevented a significant decrease in dopamine, DOPAC and HVA contents of the striatum 5 days after MPTP treatment. In our Western blot analysis study, PSI at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg prevented a significant decrease in TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) protein and a significant increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein 5 days after MPTP treatment. Furthermore, our immunohistochemical study showed that PSI at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg prevented a significant loss in TH immunopositive neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra 5 days after MPTP treatment. In contrast, PSI caused a significant increase in the number of intense ubiquitin immunopositive cells in the striatum and substantia nigra 5 days after MPTP treatment. These results indicate that proteasome inhibitors can protect against MPTP neurotoxicity in mice. The neuroprotective effect of PSI against dopaminergic cell damage may be mediated by the elevation of ubiquitination. Thus, our findings provide further valuable information for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease."}

Although it is clear that glia contribute to the development of morphine tolerance, to date, the investigation of their role has been limited to spinal and medullary loci. Opioids induce a neuroinflammatory response that opposes acute and long-term analgesia, thereby limiting their efficacy as therapeutic agents. Recent data suggest that the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), along with its coreceptor myeloid differentiation factor-2 (MD-2), mediates these effects. To date, the brain loci through which TLR4 modulates morphine tolerance have not been identified. We have previously demonstrated that chronic subcutaneous morphine results in tolerance that is accompanied by increases in vlPAG glial cell activity. Using in vivo pharmacological manipulations of vlPAG glia and TLR4 in the adult male rat, we show that intra-vlPAG administration of the general glial cell metabolic inhibitor propentofylline or the astrocyte activity inhibitor fluorocitrate attenuate tolerance to morphine. Characterization of MD-2 expression within the PAG revealed dense MD-2 expression throughout the vlPAG. Further, antagonizing vlPAG TLR4 dose dependently prevented the development of morphine tolerance, and vlPAG microinjections of TLR4 agonists dose dependently produced a 'naive' tolerance to subsequent challenge doses of morphine. Finally, using a model of persistent inflammatory pain and pharmacological manipulation of TLR4 we demonstrate that systemic antagonism of TLR4 potentiated acute morphine antihyperalgesia. These results, together, indicate that vlPAG glia regulate morphine tolerance development via TLR4 signaling, and implicate TLR4 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pain."}

Considering the complex pathophysiology of TBI, we hypothesized that combination of neuroprotective compounds, targeting different events which appear during injury, may be a more promising approach for patients. In this context, both NMDAR antagonist memantine and free radical scavenger melatonin are safe in humans and promising agents for the treatment of TBI. Herein, we examined the effects of melatonin administered alone or in combination with memantine on the activation of signaling pathways, injury development and DNA fragmentation. Both compounds reduced brain injury moderately and the density of DNA fragmentation significantly. Notably, melatonin/memantine combination decreased brain injury and DNA fragmentation significantly, which was associated with reduced p38 and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation. As compared with melatonin and memantine groups, SAPK/JNK-1/2 phosphorylation was also reduced in melatonin/memantine combined animals. In addition, melatonin, memantine and their combination decreased iNOS activity significantly.

GH secretion is modulated by variations in the levels of free fatty acids (FFA). Recent studies in different clinical situations, have shown that reduction in FFA with acipimox (A) modifies somatotroph cell responsiveness. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of acute pharmacological reduction of plasma FFA on both basal GH levels and GHRH-mediated GH secretion in acromegalic patients.	Six acromegalic patients (four female, two male) aged 57 +/- 4 years., with active disease due to pituitary adenomas were studied. Four of the patients had been treated previously by surgery and/or radiotherapy. The diagnosis of active acromegaly was established by clinical assessment, increased serum IGF-I and impaired GH suppression after oral glucose.

Here, we further studied the protective effects of ME against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and demonstrated the protection against memory impairment in mice. The cytoprotective effects of ME were measured as cell viability and the reduction in ROS activity. In SK-N-SH cell cultures, 200 μg/ml ME could partially antagonize the effects of 150 or 300 µM H2O2 on cell viability, ROS level and caspase-3 activity.

Moreover, this increased coupling was present only between neurons of the same morphological cell class, i.e., among clusters of spiny neurons or between aspiny neurons. Combining intracellular labeling of spiny neurons with parvalbumin immunocytochemistry demonstrated that coupling did not occur between anatomically adjacent neurons that comprised immunocytochemically and morphologically distinct cell classes.

Increased activity of the enzymatic 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX, 5LO) pathway is a contributing factor in atherosclerosis and a 5-LOX inhibitor, MK-886, is beneficial in animal models of atherosclerosis. In the brain, MK-886 increases phosphorylation of the glutamate receptor subunit GluR1, and the increased phosphorylation of this receptor has been associated with antidepressant treatment. In this work, we evaluated the behavioral effects of MK-886 in an automated assay of mouse forced swimming, which identifies antidepressant activity as increased climbing behavior and/or decreased rest time. Whereas a single injection of MK-886 (3 and 10 mg/kg) did not affect forced swimming behaviors assayed 30 min later, six daily injections of 3 mg/kg MK-886 slightly increased climbing and significantly reduced rest time in wild-type mice but not in 5-LOX-deficient mice. A diet delivery of MK-886, 4 micro/(100 mg(body-weight)day), required 3 weeks to affect forced swimming; it increased climbing behavior. Climbing behavior was also increased in naive 5-LOX-deficient mice compared to naive wild-type controls. These results suggest that 5-LOX inhibition and deficiency may be associated with antidepressant activity. Increased climbing in a forced swimming assay is a typical outcome of antidepressants that increase noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity.

Typical ground squirrel hibernation is characterized by prolonged periods of torpor with significantly reduced heart rate, blood pressure, and blood flow, interrupted every few weeks by brief interbout arousals (IBA) during which blood flow fluctuates dramatically. These physiological conditions should increase the risk of stasis-induced blood clots and myocardial ischemia. However, ground squirrels have adapted to survive repeated bouts of torpor and IBA without forming lethal blood clots or sustaining lethal ischemic myocardial damage. The purpose of this study was to determine if ground squirrels are resistant to thrombosis and myocardial ischemia during hibernation. Blood markers of coagulation, fibrinolysis, thrombosis, and ischemia, as well as histological markers of myocardial ischemia were measured throughout the annual hibernation cycle. Hibernating ground squirrels were also treated with isoprenaline to induce myocardial ischemia. Thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) during hibernation, while D-dimer level remained unchanged throughout the annual cycle, both consistent with an antithrombotic state. During torpor, the ground squirrels were in a hyperfibrinolytic state with an elevated ratio of tissue plasminogen activator complexed with plasminogen activator inhibitor to total plasminogen activator inhibitor (p < 0.05). Histological markers of myocardial ischemia were reversibly elevated during hibernation with no increase in markers of myocardial cell death in the blood.

The present study transplanted OPCs into the spinal cord of rats with SCC and subsequently used the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) score to assess the functional recovery and pain scores. An miRNA assay was performed to detect differentially expressed miRNAs in the spinal cord of SCC rats transplanted with OPCs, compared with SCC rats transplanted with medium. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to verify significantly altered miRNA expression levels. The results demonstrated that OPC transplantation was able to improve motor recovery and relieve mechanical allodynia in rats with SCC. In addition, through a miRNA assay, 45 differentially expressed miRNAs (40 upregulated miRNAs and 5 downregulated miRNAs) were detected in the spinal cord of rats in the OPC group compared with in the Medium group. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified according to the following criteria: Fold change >2 and P<0.05. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to verify the most highly upregulated (miR‑375‑3p and miR‑1‑3p) and downregulated (miR‑363‑3p, miR‑449a‑5p and miR‑3074) spinal cord miRNAs that were identified in the miRNA assay.

Exercise training reduces oxidative stress, nitro-sative stress and improves neuroendocrine autoregulation which counteracts damages from stress- and age-related neuronal degeneration, brain ischemia and traumatic brain injury.

Despite the paucity of human research, basic animal models and clinical data overwhelmingly support the notion that exercise treatment is a major protective factor against neurodegeneration of varied etiologies.

Psychometric investigations were conducted in rats before and after corticosterone treatment using a holeboard test system. Rats were randomly attributed to 2 groups (n = 7) for daily subcutaneous injection of either 26.8 mg/kg body weight corticosterone or sesame oil (vehicle control). Treatment was continued for 60 days, followed by cognitive retesting in the holeboard system. For protein analysis, the hippocampal proteome was separated by 2D electrophoresis (2DE) followed by image processing, statistical analysis, protein identification via peptide mass fingerprinting and gel matching and subsequent functional network mapping and molecular pathway analysis. Differential expression of PEBP1 was additionally quantified by Western blot analysis. Results show that chronic corticosterone significantly decreased rat hippocampal PEBP1 expression and induced a working and reference memory dysfunction. From this, we derive the preliminary hypothesis that PEBP1 may be a novel molecular mediator influencing cognitive integrity during chronic corticosterone exposure in rat hippocampus."}

We have previously reported that treatment of rat brain synaptosomes with peroxynitrite induced post-translational modifications in pre- and post-synaptic proteins and stimulated soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion proteins attachment receptor complex formation and endogenous glutamate release. In this study we show that, following peroxynitrite treatment, the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin (SYP) can be both phosphorylated and nitrated in a dose-dependent manner. We found that tyrosine-phosphorylated, but not tyrosine-nitrated, SYP bound to the src tyrosine kinase and enhanced its catalytic activity. These effects were mediated by direct and specific binding of the SYP cytoplasmic C-terminal tail with the src homology 2 domain. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we mapped the SYP C-terminal tail tyrosine residues modified by peroxynitrite and found one nitration site at Tyr250 and two phosphorylation sites at Tyr263 and Tyr273. We suggest that peroxynitrite-mediated modifications of SYP may be relevant in modulating src signalling of synaptic terminal in pathophysiological conditions."}

Life has evolved complex mechanisms to maintain proteostasis and many of these that operate inside cells are now well understood. The same cannot yet be said of corresponding processes in extracellular fluids of the human body, where inappropriate protein aggregation is known to underpin many serious diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes and prion diseases. Recent research has uncovered a growing family of abundant extracellular chaperones in body fluids which appear to selectively bind to exposed regions of hydrophobicity on misfolded proteins to inhibit their toxicity and prevent them from aggregating to form insoluble deposits. These extracellular chaperones are also implicated in clearing the soluble, stabilized misfolded proteins from body fluids via receptor-mediated endocytosis for subsequent lysosomal degradation. Recent work also raises the possibility that extracellular chaperones may play roles in modulating the immune response. Future work will better define the in vivo functions of extracellular chaperones in proteostasis and immunology and pave the way for the development of new treatments for serious diseases."}

Bone marrow aspirates collected from iliac crests of 5 cadavers of young adult dogs.	Flow cytometric analysis was performed to evaluate cell surface markers and homogeneity of third-passage MSCs. Neural differentiation of canine MSCs was induced by use of dibutyryl cAMP and methyl-isobutylxanthine.

Third-passage canine MSCs appeared morphologically homogeneous and shared phenotypic characteristics with human and rodent MSCs. Immunocytochemical and western blot analyses revealed that canine MSCs constitutively expressed beta III-tubulin and GFAP. After induction of neural differentiation, increased expression of GFAP was found in all samples, whereas such change was inconsistent in beta III-tubulin expression. Myelin basic protein remained undetectable on canine MSCs for these culture conditions.	Canine bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells yielded an apparently homogeneous population of MSCs after expansion in culture. Expanded canine MSCs constitutively expressed neuron or astrocyte specific proteins.

However, it is unclear whether these sensory features are a causal phenomenon or a consequence of dystonia. The supplementary motor area proper (SMAp), a premotor cortical region, receives strong inputs from both the SC and basal ganglia. We hypothesized that disruption in sensory-motor integration within the SMAp may play a part in the pathophysiology of dystonia. Using a model of secondary dystonia obtained by 3-nitropropionic acid intoxication in rhesus monkeys, we first provide evidence that the SMAp was overexcitable in dystonic animals. Second, we show that proprioceptive inputs processed by SMAp neurons were dramatically increased with wider sensory receptive fields and a mismatch between sensory inputs and motor outputs. These findings suggest that abnormal sensory inputs impinging upon SMAp neurons play a critical role in the pathophysiology of dystonia."}

The dyskinesia develops over a period of exposure to L-dopa and is related to the dosage, therefore, the cause may involve inductive changes that produce toxic levels of metabolites, interfering with dopamine (DA) neurotransmission. Chronic L-dopa induces catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and methionine adenosyl transferase (MAT), enzymes involved in the methylation of catecholamines (CA). In addition, high levels of 3-O-methyl-dopa have been reported in the plasma of dyskinetic PD patients, treated with L-dopa, as compared to non-dyskinetic patients, therefore, the methyl metabolites of CA may be increased during L-dopa therapy and may be involved in the dyskinesia. Since large amounts of DA are produced from L-dopa, and DA is extensively methylated, the methyl metabolites of DA, 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) and 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamine (DIMPEA), may be also involved. The first step in knowing this, is to assess the behavioral and DA-receptor activities of 3-MT and DIMPEA. In the rat, the intraventricular injection of 0.5 micromol of DIMPEA increased the total distance traveled (TD) by over 100%, the number of movement (NM) made by 40% and the time spent moving (MT) by about 36%. Identical doses of 3-MT decreased the TD by 42%, NM by 22% and MT by 39%. DIMPEA (1 mM) increased the binding of DA with brain membranes by 44.7%, whereas 3-MT decreased it by 15.8%. The results show that 3-MT and DIMPEA are behaviorally active, and in parallel, they interact with the binding sites for DA, consequently, they may contribute to the side effects of L-dopa. L-dopa produces high levels of DA and induces MAT and COMT. It is proposed, therefore, that DA will be methylated to 3-MT and 3-MT to DIMPEA. At threshold level each product will inhibit, allosterically, its enzyme of methylation, causing sequential and rhythmic up and down regulation of its concentration. At peak levels these hydrophobic metabolites will modulate the actions of DA on synaptic membranes, causing abnormal movements, at times, resembling the 'on-off effects'."}

However, how neuroinflammation and TRPA1 and TRPV4 are linked to cause pain in paclitaxel-treated animals is not known.	Paclitaxel-induced pain was modelled by IP injection of paclitaxel (16 mg/kg) once a week for 5 weeks. The role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) in tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production and the effect of TNF-α on the expression of TRPA1 and TRPV4 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. TNF-α signalling in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was blocked by expressing soluble TNF receptor I (TNFsR) from a herpes simplex virus (HSV)-based vector (vTNFsR).	Paclitaxel treatment increased the expression and release of TNF-α in satellite glial cells and increased the expression of TRPA1 and TRPV4 in DRG neurons in animals. In vitro, paclitaxel enhanced the expression and release of TNF-α in enriched primary satellite glial cells, an effect that was blocked by an inhibitor of TLR-4. Direct application of TNF-α to primary DRG neurons in culture up-regulated the expression of TRPA1 and TRPV4. In vivo, vector-mediated TNFsR release from DRG neurons reduced paclitaxel-induced up-regulation of TRPA1 and TRPV4 expression and prevented paclitaxel-induced pain.	These results suggest that paclitaxel activation of TLR-4 to cause release of TNF-α from satellite glial cells increases the expression of TRPA1 and TRPV4 in DRG neurons to cause neuropathic pain."}

Scorpion sting is the most important arachnid envenomation causing adult morbidity and pediatric mortality. Important groups of spiders include the widow spiders (Latrodectus spp.), the recluse spiders (Loxosceles spp.), and two spiders confined to single countries: the Australian funnel web spider (Atrax and Hadronyche spp.) and the armed spider (Phoneutria spp.) from Brazil. There are four widow spider antivenoms available, including the Australian redback spider antivenom and the American black widow antivenom. Despite good in vitro animal work demonstrating effective neutralization with these antivenoms, and cross-reactivity between many species, there continues to be a reluctance to use them in some countries. They are both associated with a relatively low rate of allergic reactions. Redback antivenom is routinely used by the intramuscular route, which may not be as effective as intravenous use based on clinical experience and animal studies. Antivenoms are available for Loxosceles spp., but there is little evidence to support their effectiveness, particularly against local effects. The Australian funnel web spider causes severe neurotoxic envenomation, and antivenom appears to be effective in reported cases. An antivenom exists for the Brazilian armed spider, but is used in only a minority of cases. Many scorpion antivenoms exist worldwide, but there remains significant controversy regarding their efficacy. Animal and human venom level studies demonstrate neutralization of circulating venom in systemic envenomation. Clinical experience in countries where antivenom has been introduced suggests it has reduced pediatric mortality. However, three controlled trials demonstrated that antivenom was not effective, but these included few severe cases. Until controlled trials of antivenom in systemically envenomated patients are undertaken, antivenom use appears justified in severe envenomation. Although envenomation from arthropods is common, no antivenoms exist for these, excepting Lonomia caterpillars in South America, and Ixodes paralysis ticks in Australia."}

In parallel, 3xTgAD mice exhibited elevated expression of ketogenic markers, indicating a compensatory mechanism for energy production in brain. This compensatory response to generate an alternative fuel source was temporary and diminished with disease progression. To determine whether this compensatory alternative fuel system could be sustained, we investigated the impact of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a compound known to induce ketogenesis, on bioenergetic function and AD pathology burden in brain. 6-month-old female 3xTgAD mice were fed either a regular diet (AIN-93G) or a diet containing 0.04% 2-DG for 7 weeks. 2-DG diet significantly increased serum ketone body level and brain expression of enzymes required for ketone body metabolism. The 2-DG-induced maintenance of mitochondrial bioenergetics was paralleled by simultaneous reduction in oxidative stress. Further, 2-DG treated mice exhibited a significant reduction of both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers, which was paralleled by significantly increased α-secretase and decreased γ-secretase expression, indicating that 2-DG induced a shift towards a non-amyloidogenic pathway. In addition, 2-DG increased expression of genes involved in Aβ clearance pathways, degradation, sequestering, and transport. Concomitant with increased bioenergetic capacity and reduced β-amyloid burden, 2-DG significantly increased expression of neurotrophic growth factors, BDNF and NGF. Results of these analyses demonstrate that dietary 2-DG treatment increased ketogenesis and ketone metabolism, enhanced mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, reduced β-amyloid generation and increased mechanisms of β-amyloid clearance. Further, these data link bioenergetic capacity with β-amyloid generation and demonstrate that β-amyloid burden was dynamic and reversible, as 2-DG reduced activation of the amyloidogenic pathway and increased mechanisms of β-amyloid clearance. Collectively, these data provide preclinical evidence for dietary 2-DG as a disease-modifying intervention to delay progression of bioenergetic deficits in brain and associated β-amyloid burden."}

MEP consisted of direct and indirect waves generated by direct activation of pyramidal axons and indirect excitation of pyramidal neurons via cortical synapses, respectively. MEP, PmEP, and SEP disappeared on proximal occlusion. Following reperfusion after 1 to 3 hours of ischemia, the direct wave of MEP readily recovered but the indirect wave showed no improvement, suggesting a restored axonal conduction but impaired cortical synaptic transmission.

CORT increased the frequency and duration of epileptiform events within the first 24 hours of treatment, and this effect persisted for up to two weeks following termination of CORT injections. Interestingly, vehicle injection produced a transient spike in CORT levels - presumably due to the stress of injection - and a modest but significant increase in epileptiform activity.

In this study, we analyzed the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in the olfactory bulb (OB), and nigrostriatal regions of transgenic mice expressing human, mutant A53T alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn tg) and their non-transgenic (ntg) littermates using a sub-toxic, moderate dose of MPTP to determine if mutant human alpha-synuclein sensitizes the central dopaminergic systems to oxidative stress. We observed that after a single, sub-lethal MPTP injection, dopamine levels were reduced in striatum and SN in both the alpha-syn tg and ntg mice. In the olfactory bulb, a region usually resistant to MPTP toxicity, levels were reduced only in the alpha-syn tg mice. In addition, we identified a significant increase in dopamine metabolism in the alpha-syn transgenic, but not ntg mice. Finally, MPTP treatment of alpha-syn tg mice was associated with a marked elevation in the oxidative product, 3-nitrotyrosine that co-migrated with alpha-synuclein. Cumulatively, the data support the hypothesis that mutant alpha-synuclein sensitizes dopaminergic neurons to neurotoxic insults and is associated with greater oxidative stress. The alpha-syn tg line is therefore useful to study the genetic and environmental inter-relationship in PD."}

Both prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and lithium have been reported to protect neurons against ischemic injury. The present study was undertaken to examine if lithium could potentiate the neuroprotection of PGE1 against cerebral ischemia, and if the synergetic effects take place at the level of HSPs.	Brain ischemia was induced by a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in rats. Rats were pretreated with subcutaneous injection of lithium for 2 d and a single intravenous administration of PGE1 immediately after ischemic insult. Cerebrocortical blood flow of each group was closely monitored prior to onset of ischemia, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min and 60 min after surgical operation. Body temperature was measured before, 5 min, 2 h and 24 h after the onset of pMCAO. The infarct volume, brain edema and motor behavior deficits were analyzed 24 h after ischemic insult. Cytoprotective HSP70 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the striatum of the ipsilateral hemisphere were detected by immunoblotting. Brain sections from the striatum of the ipsilateral hemisphere were double-labeled with the anti-HSP70 antibody and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).	Treatment with PGE1 (8 and 16 microg/kg, iv) or lithium (0.5 mEq/kg, sc) alone reduced infarct volume, neurological deficits and brain edema induced by focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Moreover, a greater neuroprotection was observed when PGE1 and lithium were given together. Co-administration of PGE1 and lithium significantly upregulated cytoprotective HSP70 and HO-1 protein levels.	Lithium and PGE1 may exert synergistic effects in treatment of cerebral ischemia and thus may have potential clinical value for the treatment of stroke."}

Relative to mouse cortical neuron cultures pretreated (24h) with either E or Q (0.1-10μM), E+Q synergistically attenuated OGD-induced neuronal cell death. E, Q and E+Q (0.3μM) increased spare respiratory capacity but only E+Q (0.3μM) preserved this crucial parameter of neuronal mitochondrial function after OGD. These improvements were accompanied by corresponding increases in cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and the expression of CREB-target genes that promote neuronal survival (Bcl-2) and mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α). Consistent with these findings, E+Q (0.1 and 1.0μM) elevated mitochondrial gene expression (MT-ND2 and MT-ATP6) to a greater extent than E or Q after OGD. Q (0.3-3.0μM), but not E (3.0μM), elevated cytosolic calcium (Ca(2+)) spikes and the mitochondrial membrane potential. Conversely, E and E+Q (0.1 and 0.3μM), but not Q (0.1 and 0.3μM), activated protein kinase B (Akt). Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition with L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (1.0μM) blocked neuroprotection by E (0.3μM) or Q (1.0μM). Oral administration of E+Q (75mg/kg; once daily for 5days) reduced hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. These findings suggest E and Q activate Akt- and Ca(2+)-mediated signaling pathways that converge on NOS and CREB resulting in synergistic improvements in neuronal mitochondrial performance which confer profound protection against ischemic injury."}

Thus, TH is related to various neuro-psychiatric diseases such as TH deficiency, Parkinson's disease (PD), and schizophrenia. Four isoforms of human TH (hTH1-hTH4) are produced from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing in the N-terminal region, whereas two isoforms exist in monkeys and only a single protein exist in all non-primate mammals. A catalytic domain is located within the C-terminal two-thirds of molecule, whereas the part of the enzyme controlling enzyme activity is assigned to the N-terminal end as the regulatory domain. The catalytic activity of TH is end product inhibited by CA, and the phosphorylation of Ser residues (Ser(19), Ser(31), and especially Ser(40) of hTH1) in the N-terminus relieves the CA-mediated inhibition. Ota and Nakashima et al. have investigated the role of the N-terminus of TH enzyme in the regulation of both the catalytic activity and the intracellular stability by producing various mutants of the N-terminus of hTH1. The expression of the following three enzymes, TH, GTP cyclohydrolase I, which synthesizes the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor of TH, and aromatic-L: -amino acid decarboxylase, which produces DA from L: -dopa, were induced in the monkey striatum using harmless adeno-associated virus vectors, resulting in a remarkable improvement in the symptoms affecting PD model monkeys Muramatsu (Hum Gene Ther 13:345-354, 2002).

The present study examined the effect of the α1 adrenoceptors in the VLO on allodynia induced by SNI in the rats. The mechanical paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) was measured using von-Frey filaments. Microinjection of selective α1 adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (20, 50, 100 μg in 0.5 μl) into the VLO, contralateral to the site of nerve injury, increased PWT in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was antagonized by pre-microinjection of the selective α1 adrenoceptor antagonist benoxathian into the same VLO site, and blocked by electrolytic lesion of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG). Furthermore, pre-administration of non-selective glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid, phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, and protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine to the VLO also blocked methoxamine-induced inhibition of allodynia. These results suggest that activation of α1 adrenoceptors in the VLO can potentially reduce allodynia induced by SNI. This effect may be direct excitation of the VLO neurons, via PLC-PKC signaling pathway, projecting to the PAG or facilitating glutamate release and then indirectly exciting the VLO output neurons projecting to the PAG, leading to activation of the PAG-brainstem descending inhibitory system which depresses the nociceptive transmission at the spinal cord level."}

In addition to its role in PML, studies have demonstrated the transforming ability of the JCV early protein, T-antigen, and its association with some human cancers. JCV infection occurs in childhood and latent virus is thought to be maintained within the bone marrow, which harbors cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic lineages. Here we show that non-hematopoietic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from the bone marrow of JCV T-antigen transgenic mice give rise to JCV T-antigen positive cells when cultured under neural conditions. JCV T-antigen positive cells exhibited neural crest characteristics and demonstrated p75, SOX-10 and nestin positivity. When cultured in conditions typical for mesenchymal cells, a population of T-antigen negative cells, which did not express neural crest markers arose from the MSCs. JCV T-antigen positive cells could be cultured long-term while maintaining their neural crest characteristics. When these cells were induced to differentiate into neural crest derivatives, JCV T-antigen was downregulated in cells differentiating into bone and maintained in glial cells expressing GFAP and S100. We conclude that JCV T-antigen can be stably expressed within a fraction of bone marrow cells differentiating along the neural crest/glial lineage when cultured in vitro. These findings identify a cell population within the bone marrow permissible for JCV early gene expression suggesting the possibility that these cells could support persistent viral infection and thus provide clues toward understanding the role of the bone marrow in JCV latency and reactivation. Further, our data provides an excellent experimental model system for studying the cell-type specificity of JCV T-antigen expression, the role of bone marrow-derived stem cells in the pathogenesis of JCV-related diseases and the opportunities for the use of this model in development of therapeutic strategies."}

In this study, induction of c-Fos protein, which reflects neuronal activation (particularly inflammatory nociception), was investigated in the lumbar spinal cord with immunohistochemistry. Inflammatory monoarthritis was induced in 20 male Wistar rats (weighing 250-300 g) via intra-articular injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the tibiotarsal joint. Two phases of arthritis, early phase (18 h after adjuvant injection) and late phase (7 d after adjuvant injection), were studied in the rats. Pulsed-mode US (1 MHz, the spatial average temporal average intensity [I(SATA)] = 0.5 W/cm(2), 50% duty cycle) was applied for 5 min. The effects of US and sham treatments against these phases of arthritis were demonstrated by spinal c-Fos-like immunoreactivity (c-Fos-LI). All data were evaluated statistically with the paired t-test or analysis of variance with Bonferroni corrections. c-Fos-LI neurons were abundant (average 264.2 +/- 11.9) in the L3 and L4 neurons of the spinal cord in areas ipsilateral to the CFA-induced arthritic leg in the early phase, but few were present (average 40.4 +/- 4.5) in the late phase in sham-treated animals. Bonferroni corrections to the alpha level were used to check the group differences in spinal c-Fos expression, and significance was reached when p < 0.025. In the early inflammatory phase, US treatment significantly suppressed the increased number of c-Fos-LI neurons associated with CFA-induced arthritis in superficial laminae, nucleus proprius, deep laminae and ventral horn of the spinal cord. However, during the late inflammatory phase, US significantly triggered c-Fos expression in most laminae, particularly in the nucleus proprius, deep laminae and ventral horn of the spinal cord. The results of our study suggest that administration of US causes a reduction of early nociceptive inflammatory processing, as shown by a decrease in CFA-induced c-Fos-LI neurons at the level of the spinal cord. In contrast, the US did not suppress, but rather enhanced, the number of c-Fos-LI neurons during the late inflammatory phase. The peripheral influences of US on the central modulation of the spinal nociceptive processing system is suggested and may reflect the work being done through the neuroplasticity of spinal cord in response to peripheral stimulation of US. Therefore, we propose a difference in spinal expression of c-Fos-LI neurons between effects of peripheral US stimulation in arthritic models that underlie early and late inflammatory pain.

A mouse model of spared nerve injury (SNI) was used to test the hypothesis that nerve injury precipitates depression through the induction of inflammation in the brain, and that prior exposure to stress exacerbates the behavioral and neuroinflammatory consequences of nerve injury. As compared with sham surgery, SNI induced mechanical allodynia, and significantly increased depressive-like behavior. Moreover, SNI animals displayed increased interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) gene expression within the frontal cortex and concurrent increases in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) within the periaqueductal grey (PAG). Additionally, exposure to chronic restraint stress for 2 weeks before SNI exacerbated mechanical allodynia and depressive-like behavior, and resulted in an increase in IL-1beta gene expression in the frontal cortex and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression in PAG. Treatment with metyrapone (MET), a corticosteroid synthesis inhibitor, before stress eliminated deleterious effects of chronic stress on SNI. Finally, this study showed that interference with IL-1beta signaling, through administration of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), ameliorated the effects of neuropathic pain on depressive-like behavior. Taken together, these data suggest that peripheral nerve injury leads to increased cytokine expression in the brain, which in turn, contributes to the development of depressive-like behavior. Furthermore, stress can facilitate the development of depressive-like behavior after nerve injury by promoting IL-1beta expression."}

Two kinds of mechanisms may be involved: one in which insulin interacts directly with brain tissue and one in which insulin acts indirectly by reducing peripheral blood glucose levels. Animal data indicate that part of the former, direct mechanism is mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors. The direct effect appears to predominate in global ischemia. In focal ischemia, unlike global ischemia, the effect of insulin is predominantly via peripheral hypoglycemia, because neuroprotection is largely annulled by co-administration of glucose. The two clinical counterparts of global and focal ischemic models are, respectively, cardiac arrest encephalopathy and focal ischemic stroke. Insulin use in both of these clinical situations could be evaluated in clinical trials that attempt to reduce ischemic brain damage, because insulin has a long and safe history of human use in diabetes treatment."}

In preliminary studies, this compound demonstrates definite anti-mitotic properties, consistent with its nanomolar range efficiency towards purified CDK1 and CDK2. However, the actual intracellular targets of purvalanol remain to be identified, and a method for the determination of its in vivo selectivity was developed. In this technique, cell extracts were screened for purvalanol-interacting proteins by affinity chromatography on immobilized inhibitor. In addition to CDK1, p42/p44 MAPK were found to be two major purvalanol-interacting proteins in five different mammalian cell lines (CCL39, PC12, HBL100, MCF-7 and Jurkat cells), suggesting the generality of the purvalanol/p42/p44 MAPK interaction. The Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line CCL39 was used as a model to investigate the anti-proliferative properties of purvalanol. The compound inhibited cell growth with a GI(50) value of 2.5 microM and induced a G2/M block when added to exponentially growing cells. It did not appear to trigger massive activation of caspase. We next tested whether CDKs and p42/p44 MAPK were actually targeted by the compound in vivo. p42/p44 MAPK activity was visualized using an Elk-Gal4 luciferase reporter system and CDK1 activity was detected by the phosphonucleolin level.

In vivo microPET imaging showed no significant change in [(18)F]MPPF binding in the dorsal hippocampus over time, perhaps due to spatial resolution.

Exploration of the functional consequences of these serotoninergic modifications during the neurodegenerative process may have an impact on therapeutics targeting 5-HT(1A) receptors in AD."}

LOX-1 (lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1) is increasingly linked to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Transgenic mouse models for LOX-1 overexpression or gene knockout suggests that LOX-1 contributes to atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression. LOX-1 activation by oxidized LDL (low-density lipoprotein) binding stimulates intracellular signalling, gene expression and production of superoxide radicals. A key question is the role of leucocyte LOX-1 in pro-atherogenic lipid particle trafficking, accumulation and signalling leading to differentiation into foam cells, necrosis and plaque development. LOX-1 expression is elevated within vascular lesions and a serum soluble LOX-1 fragment appears diagnostic of patients with acute coronary syndromes. LOX-1 is increasingly viewed as a vascular disease biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in heart attack and stroke prevention."}

In experiment I, rats underwent 60 mins of normothermic intestinal ischemia (36-38 degrees C) plus 300 mins of reperfusion at either normothermia or moderate hypothermia (30-32 degrees C) with or without rewarming. Hemodynamics were measured invasively and survival was assessed. In experiment II, rats underwent 60 mins of normothermic ischemia plus 120 mins of reperfusion at either normothermia or moderate hypothermia. At kill, organs and a blood sample were collected.	In experiment I, all normothermic I/R rats died within 197 mins of reperfusion after developing severe tachycardia and hypotension, whereas hypothermic rats, with or without rewarming, were alive at 300 mins of reperfusion (p < .001 vs. I/R normothermia) and were hemodynamically stable. In experiment II, normothermic reperfusion caused histologic and biochemical damage to the gut, hepatic energy failure, and inflammatory infiltration of the lung. However, hypothermia reduced injury to the reperfused ileum and prevented distant organ injury by counteracting energy failure in the liver, systemic overproduction of nitric oxide, altered cardiac fatty acid metabolism, and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs.	Hypothermia applied as a rescue therapy for intestinal I/R abolishes mortality even after rewarming. Hypothermic protection during early reperfusion appears to be mediated by several pathways, including prevention of intestinal and pulmonary neutrophil infiltration, reduction of oxidative stress in the ileum, and preservation of cardiac and hepatic energy metabolism. Moderate hypothermia may improve outcome in clinical conditions associated with intestinal I/R."}

With the development of these treatments comes a need to assess the tissue to which they are applied, both in trialling of new treatments and as an aid to clinical decision making.

Based on 72 samples we found that mechanical and ultrasound parameters showed differences between fibrillated tissue, macroscopically normal tissue in osteoarthritic joints, and normal tissue, yet did were unable to differentiate degradation beyond that which was visible to the naked eye. Near-infrared spectroscopy showed a clear progression of degradation across the visibly normal osteoarthritic joint surface and as such, was the only technique considered useful for clinical application."}

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the NMDA-R is expressed by rat Schwann cells and functions independently and with LRP1 to regulate Schwann cell physiology. The NR1 (encoded by GRIN1) and NR2b (encoded by GRIN2B) NMDA-R subunits were expressed by cultured Schwann cells and upregulated in sciatic nerves following crush injury. The ability of LRP1 ligands to activate ERK1/2 (also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1, respectively) and promote Schwann cell migration required the NMDA-R. NR1 gene silencing compromised Schwann cell survival. Injection of the LRP1 ligands tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA, also known as PLAT) or MMP9-PEX into crush-injured sciatic nerves activated ERK1/2 in Schwann cells in vivo, and the response was blocked by systemic treatment with the NMDA-R inhibitor MK801. tPA was unique among the LRP1 ligands examined because tPA activated cell signaling and promoted Schwann cell migration by interacting with the NMDA-R independently of LRP1, albeit with delayed kinetics. These results define the NMDA-R as a Schwann cell signaling receptor for protein ligands and a major regulator of Schwann cell physiology, which may be particularly important in peripheral nervous system (PNS) injury."}

In the present study, we demonstrated that SCM198, a new compound based on the active component of Herba leonuri, significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced cell death in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells and attenuated apomorphine-elicited rotational behavior in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Pretreatment with SCM198 (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μM) concentration-dependently increased the cell viability as measured in MTT and LDH leakage assays compared with 6-OHDA-injured cells. Tocopherol, an antioxidant used as positive control, had similar effect at 10 μM to SCM198 1 μM. Furthermore, we assessed oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis, the critical players in dopaminergic neurodegeneration, with 0.1, 1, and 10 μM of SCM198 in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 6-OHDA. Pretreatment with SCM198 significantly increased antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase activity, ameliorated intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, prevented the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased apoptotic cell death in Hoechst 33258 staining, as well as down-regulated Bax and up-regulated Bcl-2 in both mRNA and protein levels compared with 6-OHDA damaged cells. Moreover, intragastrical administration of SCM198 (18 or 60 mg kg[-1] day[-1]) for 4 weeks significantly ameliorates apomorphine-induced contralateral rotations in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. These results support the neuroprotective effects of SCM198 against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity in vivo and in vitro with the underlying mechanisms of inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis. Therefore we suggest that SCM198 might provide a useful therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease."}

The role of interleukin (IL)-18, a new member of the IL-1 family, in brain trauma has not been reported to date. The authors investigated the posttraumatic release of IL-18 in murine brains following experimental closed head injury (CHI) and in CSF of CHI patients. In the mouse model, intracerebral IL-18 was induced within 24 hours by ether anesthesia and sham operation. Significantly elevated levels of IL-18 were detected at 7 days after CHI and in human CSF up to 10 days after trauma. Published data imply that IL-18 may play a pathophysiological role in inflammatory CNS diseases; therefore its inhibition may ameliorate outcome after CHI. To evaluate the functional aspects of IL-18 in the injured brain, mice were injected systemically with IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP), a specific inhibitor of IL-18, 1 hour after trauma. IL-18BP-treated mice showed a significantly improved neurological recovery by 7 days, accompanied by attenuated intracerebral IL-18 levels. This demonstrates that inhibition of IL-18 is associated with improved recovery. However, brain edema at 24 hours was not influenced by IL-18BP, suggesting that inflammatory mediators other than IL-18 induce the early detrimental effects of intracerebral inflammation."}

Dosing rats with SFN increased protein expression of all three transporters in brain capillaries and decreased by 50% brain accumulation of the P-glycoprotein substrate verapamil. Exposing rat or mouse brain capillaries to SFN increased P-glycoprotein, Bcrp, and Mrp2 transport activity and protein expression; SFN increased P-glycoprotein activity in mouse spinal cord capillaries. Inhibiting transcription or translation abolished upregulation of P-glycoprotein activity. No such effects were seen in brain capillaries from Nrf2-null mice, indicating Nrf2 dependence. Nrf2 signaled indirectly to increase transporter activity/expression. The p53 inhibitor pifithrin abolished the SFN-induced increase in transporter activity/expression, and the p53-activator nutlin-3 increased P-glycoprotein activity. SFN did not alter P-glycoprotein transport activity in brain and spinal cord capillaries from p53-null mice. Inhibitors of p38 MAPK and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) blocked the effects of SFN and nutlin-3 on P-glycoprotein activity. These results implicate Nrf2, p53, and NF-κB in the upregulation of P-glycoprotein, Bcrp, and Mrp2 at blood-CNS barriers.

We tested these hypotheses with planar and cylindrical culture models and found no evidence that the liquids lining airway surfaces were hypotonic or that salt concentrations differed between CF and normal cultures. In contrast, CF airway epithelia exhibited abnormally high rates of airway surface liquid absorption, which depleted the periciliary liquid layer and abolished mucus transport. The failure to clear thickened mucus from airway surfaces likely initiates CF airways infection.

We previously reported that TLR2 in corneal epithelium has an important role in the pathogenesis of fungal keratitis, however, how the corneal inflammation is modulated remains to be elucidated. This study aims to investigate the effect of targeting TLR2 on Aspergillus fumigatus keratitis in rats.

Production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration was assessed by myeloperoxidase activity. It was found that rat corneas treated with TLR2 siRNA showed a significant reduction of TLR2 expression in corneal epithelium. TLR2 siRNA treatment improved the outcome of keratitis, which was characterized by decreased corneal opacity, less corneal perforation, suppressed PMN infiltration, reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and less fungal burden.

Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) dysfunction is well documented in human TBI patients, yet the molecular mechanisms that underlie this neurovascular unit (NVU) pathology remains unclear. The apolipoprotein-E (apoE) protein has been implicated in controlling BBB integrity in an isoform dependent manner, via suppression of Cyclophilin A (CypA)-Matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) signaling cascades, however the contribution of this pathway in TBI-induced BBB permeability is not fully investigated.	We exposed C57Bl/6 mice to controlled cortical impact and assessed NVU and BBB permeability responses up to 21 days post-injury. We pharmacologically probed the role of the CypA-MMP-9 pathway in BBB permeability after TBI using Cyclosporin A (CsA, 20 mg/kg). Finally, as the apoE4 protein is known to be functionally deficient compared to the apoE3 protein, we used humanized APOE mice as a clinically relevant model to study the role of apoE on BBB injury and repair after TBI.	In C57Bl/6 mice there was an inverse relationship between soluble apoE and BBB permeability, such that damaged BBB stabilizes as apoE levels increase in the days following TBI. TBI mice displayed acute pericyte loss, increased MMP-9 production and activity, and reduced tight-junction expression. Treatment with the CypA antagonist CsA in C57Bl/6 mice attenuates MMP-9 responses and enhances BBB repair after injury, demonstrating that MMP-9 plays an important role in the timing of spontaneous BBB repair after TBI. We also show that apoe mRNA is present in both astrocytes and pericytes after TBI. We report that APOE3 and APOE4 mice have similar acute BBB responses to TBI, but APOE3 mice display faster spontaneous BBB repair than APOE4 mice. Isolated microvessel analysis reveals delayed pericyte repopulation, augmented and sustained MMP-9 expression at the NVU, and impaired stabilization of Zonula Occludens-1, Occludin and Claudin-5 expression at tight junctions in APOE4 mice after TBI compared to APOE3 mice.

While doing so MnPs could couple with cellular reductants and redox-active proteins. Reactive species are widely accepted as regulators of cellular transcriptional activity: minute, nanomolar levels are essential for normal cell function, while submicromolar or micromolar levels impose oxidative stress, which is evidenced in increased inflammatory and immune responses. By removing reactive species, MnPs affect redox-based cellular transcriptional activity and consequently secondary oxidative stress, and in turn inflammatory processes. The equal ability to reduce and oxidize superoxide during the dismutation process and recently accumulated results suggest that pro-oxidative actions of MnPs may also contribute to their therapeutic effects. All our data identify the superoxide dismutase-like activity, estimated by log k(cat)O2-*), as a good measure for the therapeutic efficacy of MnPs. Their accumulation in mitochondria and their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier contribute to their remarkable efficacy. We summarize herein the therapeutic effects of MnPs in cancer, central nervous system injuries, diabetes, their radioprotective action and potential for imaging. Few of the most potent modulators of cellular redox-based pathways, MnTE2-PyP5+, MnTDE-2-ImP5+, MnTnHex-2-PyP5+ and MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, are under preclinical and clinical development."}

It has been shown to improve the clinical benefits of levodopa plus an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (AADC) when given to patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose deterioration in the response to levodopa (the 'wearing off' phenomenon). The efficacy of entacapone is currently being assessed in patients with stable Parkinson's disease. In 2 well conducted trials of 6 months' duration and smaller short term studies, treatment with entacapone (200 mg with each dose of levodopa/AADC inhibitor) was associated with significant increases in daily 'on' time and decreases in 'off' time. Changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores concurred with changes in 'on' and 'off' times: entacapone improved total, activities of daily living and motor function scores, but it had no effect on mentation scores. Entacapone also provided benefits when given with controlled release levodopa/ AADC inhibitor or with standard levodopa/AADC inhibitor and selegiline in small trials. Dopaminergic events, including dyskinesia and nausea, are among the most common events with entacapone, and are related to the drug's ability to potentiate the effects of levodopa. Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation and urine discolouration are the most common nondopaminergic events, although the latter event is the only one to occur consistently more frequently with entacapone than with placebo. However, adverse events of any type infrequently led to study discontinuation.	The efficacy and tolerability of entacapone administered with levodopa/AADC inhibitor have not yet been compared with those of other strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, once the decision to initiate levodopa therapy has been made, studies generally support the use of entacapone as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease and the 'wearing off' phenomenon."}

Evidence suggests that inflammation plays a critical role in eclampsia, which contributes to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In the present study, possible anti-inflammation and neuro-protective effects of nicotine via α7-nAChRs have been investigated after inducing eclampsia-like seizures in rats.	Rat eclampsia-like models were established by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in pregnant rats. Rats were given nicotine from gestation day (GD) 14-19. Then, clinical symptoms were detected. Seizure severity was recorded by behavioral tests, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured by Luminex assays, microglia and astrocyte expressions were detected by immunofluorescence, and changes in neuronal number in the hippocampal CA1 region among different groups were detected by Nissl staining.	Our results revealed that nicotine effectively improved fetal outcomes. Furthermore, it significantly decreased systolic blood pressure, and maternal serum levels of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12P70) and an IL-17 cytokine (IL-17A), and dramatically increased eclampsia-like seizure threshold. Moreover, this attenuated neuronal loss and decreased the expression of microglial activation markers of the hippocampal CA1 region in the eclampsia-like group. Additionally, pretreatment with α-bungarotoxin, a selective α7-nAChR antagonist could prevent the protective effects of nicotine in eclampsia-like model rats.	Our findings indicate that the administration of nicotine may attenuate microglial activity and increase eclampsia-like seizure threshold in rat hippocampus through the α7 nicotinic receptor."}

An analytical emphasis on the relationship between the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway and nerve regeneration was explored. A total of 126 rats were divided into normal, sham, SCI, negative control (NC), PTC1-RNAi, PTC2-RNAi and PTC1/PTC2-RNAi groups. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale was employed to assess hind limb motor function. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to examine the mRNA and protein levels of PTC1, PTC2, Shh, glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli-1), Smo and Nestin. Tissue morphology was analyzed using immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescent staining was conducted to detect neurofilament protein 200 (NF-200) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group displayed higher BBB scores than the SCI and NC groups. Shh, Gli-1, Smo and Nestin expression levels were elevated in the PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group. PTC1 and PTC2 mRNA and protein expression was lower in the PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group than in the normal, sham and SCI groups. Among the seven groups, the PTC1/PTC2-RNAi group had the largest positive area of NF-200 staining, whereas the SCI group exhibited a larger GFAP-positive area than both the normal and the sham groups. The Shh pathway may provide new insights into therapeutic indications and regenerative recovery tools for the treatment of SCI. Activation of the Hh signaling pathway by silencing PTC1 and PTC2 may reduce inflammation and may ultimately promote SCI recovery."}

We describe a patient who developed partial and secondary generalized seizures during IFN-alpha therapy while displaying a focal disruption of her blood-brain barrier (BBB) corresponding with pathological electroencephalography (EEG). To test our hypothesis that IFN-alpha induces seizure activity, we exposed rat somatosensory cortices to clinically relevant concentrations of IFN-alpha in the acute in-vitro slice preparation or in-vivo. While acute exposure did not induce epileptic activity, recordings from slices exposed to IFN-alpha in-vivo one week prior to recordings revealed pronounced epileptiform activity in > 80% of the slices. We propose that cortical exposure to IFN-alpha leads to the generation of an epileptic cortex, which explains the weeks of latency in patients from initial treatment to seizures, and stressing the importance of identifying possible BBB disruption among high-risk patients administered peripherally acting drugs."}

In the present study, we found that protopanaxatriol ginsenoside Rh1 suppresses NO, ROS, and TNF-alpha production in IFN-gamma-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Rh1 inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of iNOS and TNF-alpha. To determine the regulatory mechanism of iNOS gene expression by Rh1, promoter analysis was performed. Rh1 significantly suppressed IFN-gamma-induced iNOS promoter activity by inhibiting DNA binding of several transcription factors, such as NF-kappaB, IRF-1, and STAT1. Furthermore, Rh1 inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK1, STAT1, STAT3, and ERK, which are upstream signaling molecules for IFN-gamma-induced iNOS gene expression. The present study demonstrates that Rh1 inhibits IFN-gamma-induced JAK/STAT and ERK signaling pathways and downstream transcription factors, and thereby iNOS gene expression.

The purpose of this study was to examine whether depression would lead to a decreased sensitivity to noxious stimuli in rats with spontaneous pain.	The olfactory bulbectomized rats were used as a model of depression. The depression-like behaviors were assessed by open field test and changes in body weight. Formalin solution was injected into the rat hindpaw to produce ongoing pain. Noxious thermal stimuli were applied onto the hindpaw contralateral to formalin injection, and the withdrawal thresholds were measured.	In non-depressive rats, the formalin-treated paw developed hypoalgesia to noxious stimuli while the contralateral paw was not affected. The depressive rats, however, showed a significantly lower sensitivity to noxious thermal stimulus, represented as higher withdrawal thresholds of the contralateral paw, when compared to the non-depressive rats.	These results demonstrate that depression can alleviate the stimulus-evoked pain even in the context of formalin inflammatory pain, consistent with the previous clinical observations that patients suffering from both depression and persistent pain have decreased sensitivities to noxious experimental stimuli.	近年来, 人们对抑郁症和疼痛之间的相互作用日益关注。 本研究通过观察抑郁对福尔马林注射大鼠的伤害性阈值的影响, 探讨抑郁能否降低伴有自发痛的大鼠对伤害性刺激的感受性。	通过嗅球切除术建立大鼠抑郁模型, 并采用旷场测试和体重变化来评价抑郁行为。 在大鼠后肢足底注射福尔马林溶液诱导持续性疼痛。 在福尔马林注射的对侧后肢足底施加伤害性辐射热刺激, 测定其抬脚阈值。	在非抑郁大鼠中, 福尔马林注射肢对伤害性刺激表现出痛觉减退, 而对侧肢的伤害性阈值则不受影响。 然而, 与非抑郁大鼠相比, 抑郁大鼠对伤害性热辐射刺激的感受性显著降低, 表现为对侧后肢抬脚潜伏期延长。	上述结果表明, 在伴有福尔马林炎症痛的条件下, 抑郁同样能降低机体对诱发痛的敏感性。 该结果与临床上关于同时患有抑郁与慢性痛患者对实验性痛刺激感受性下降的观察结果一致。"}

Following dopaminergic denervation, pallidothalamic-projecting neurons are known to be hyperactive, whereas a reduction in GPi activity is typically observed in lesioned animals showing levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Besides the mRNAs coding for GABAergic markers (GAD65 and GAD67), we show that all GPi neurons innervating thalamic targets also express transcripts for the isoforms 1 and 2 of the vesicular glutamate transporter (vGlut1 and vGlut2 mRNA). Indeed, dual immunofluorescent detection of GAD67 and vGlut1/2 confirmed the data gathered from in situ hybridization experiments, therefore demonstrating that the detected mRNAs are translated into the related proteins. Furthermore, the dopaminergic lesion resulted in an up-regulation of expression levels for both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA within identified pallidothalamic-projecting neurons. This was coupled with a down-regulation of GAD65/67 mRNA expression levels in GPi neurons innervating thalamic targets in monkeys showing levodopa-induced dyskinesia. By contrast, the patterns of gene expression for both vGlut1 and vGlut2 mRNAs remained unchanged across GPi projection neurons in control, MPTP-treated and dyskinetic monkeys. In summary, both GABAergic and glutamatergic markers were co-expressed by GPi efferent neurons in primates. Although the status of the dopaminergic system directly modulates the expression levels of GAD65/67 mRNA, the observed expression of vGlut1/2 mRNA is not regulated by either dopaminergic removal or by continuous stimulation with dopaminergic agonists."}

Because various arthritic inflammatory disorders are highly prevalent in diabetic patients, we aimed to examine the type of interaction between metformin and several conventional and adjuvant analgesic drugs (ibuprofen, aspirin, tramadol, and pregabalin) in a rat model of somatic inflammatory hyperalgesia.	Inflammation of the rat hind paw was induced by an intraplantar injection of carrageenan (0.1 mL, 1%). The antihyperalgesic effects of metformin (intraperitoneally), analgesics (orally or intraperitoneally), and 2-drug metformin-analgesic combinations were assessed with an electronic Von Frey anesthesiometer, by measuring the change in paw withdrawal thresholds induced by carrageenan (n = 6 rats in drug/drug combination-treated groups). First, we determined the doses of individual drugs needed to produce an antihyperalgesic effect of 50% (ED50 values). In combination experiments, drugs were coadministered in fixed-dose fractions (1/16, 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2) of their individual ED50 values and the type of interaction between components was determined by isobolographic analysis.	Metformin (50-200 mg/kg) significantly and dose-dependently reduced carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia with a maximal antihyperalgesic effect (mean ± SEM) of 62 ± 6% (all P ≤ .024). Ibuprofen (25-150 mg/kg), aspirin (100-400 mg/kg), tramadol (0.5-5 mg/kg), and pregabalin (2.5-20 mg/kg) also produced significant and dose-dependent antihyperalgesic effects (all P ≤ .042) of similar magnitude to metformin (the maximal antihyperalgesic effects were 73 ± 4% for ibuprofen, 62 ± 4.2% for aspirin, 69 ± 5.9% for tramadol, and 56 ± 3.9% for pregabalin). In combination experiments, administration of 2-drug metformin-analgesic combinations led to a significant and dose-dependent reduction of carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia (all P ≤ .027). The isobolographic analysis revealed that metformin interacted synergistically with the examined analgesics (experimental ED50 values of 2-drug combinations were significantly lower than theoretical additive ED50 values; all P < .05) and that there was a similar, approximately 5-fold, reduction of doses of both drugs in all tested combinations.	Our results suggest that in patients who are already receiving metformin therapy, lower doses of ibuprofen/aspirin/tramadol/pregabalin might be sufficient for achieving satisfactory pain relief. Metformin-aspirin combination might be particularly useful because it may achieve multiple therapeutic goals (glucoregulation, pain relief, and cardioprotection)."}

Interestingly, we found that CFAV infection significantly enhanced replication of DENV, and vice versa, DENV infection significantly enhanced replication of CFAV in mosquito cells. We have shown that CFAV infection leads to increase in the expression of ribonuclease kappa (RNASEK), which is known to promote infection of viruses that rely on endocytosis and pH-dependent entry.

Treatment with triheptanoin, the triglyceride of heptanoate, is a promising approach to provide alternative fuel to improve oxidative phosphorylation and aid ATP generation. Heptanoate can be metabolized to propionyl-CoA, which after carboxylation can produce succinyl-CoA and thereby re-fill the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (anaplerosis). Here we tested the hypothesis that treatment with triheptanoin prevents motor neuron loss and delays the onset of disease symptoms in female mice overexpressing the mutant human SOD1G93A (hSOD1G93A) gene. When oral triheptanoin (35% of caloric content) was initiated at P35, motor neuron loss at 70 days of age was attenuated by 33%. In untreated hSOD1G93A mice, the loss of hind limb grip strength began at 16.7 weeks. Triheptanoin maintained hind limb grip strength for 2.8 weeks longer (p<0.01). Loss of balance on the rotarod and reduction of body weight were delayed by 13 and 11 days respectively (both p<0.01). Improved motor function occurred in parallel with alterations in the expression of genes associated with muscle metabolism. In gastrocnemius muscles, the mRNA levels of pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate and succinate dehydrogenases and methyl-malonyl mutase were reduced by 24-33% in 10 week old hSOD1G93A mice when compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that TCA cycling in skeletal muscle may be slowed in this ALS mouse model at a stage when muscle strength is still normal. At 25 weeks of age, mRNA levels of succinate dehydrogenases, glutamic pyruvic transaminase 2 and the propionyl carboxylase β subunit were reduced by 69-84% in control, but not in triheptanoin treated hSOD1G93A animals.

Minocycline induces antihypernociceptive effects in a wide range of animal models of nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic pain. In this study, we discuss the antihypernociceptive activity of tetracyclines and summarise its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms."}

Here, we report that ADAM8 is abundantly expressed in breast tumors and derived metastases compared to normal tissue, especially in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Furthermore, high ADAM8 levels predicted poor patient outcome. Consistently, ADAM8 promoted an aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in culture. In a mouse orthotopic model, tumors derived from TNBC cells with ADAM8 knockdown failed to grow beyond a palpable size and displayed poor vascularization. Circulating tumor cells and brain metastases were also significantly reduced. Mechanistically, ADAM8 stimulated both angiogenesis through release of VEGF-A and transendothelial cell migration via β1-integrin activation. In vivo, treatment with an anti-ADAM8 antibody from the time of cell inoculation reduced primary tumor burden and metastases. Furthermore, antibody treatment of established tumors profoundly decreased metastases in a resection model. As a non-essential protein under physiological conditions, ADAM8 represents a promising novel target for treatment of TNBCs, which currently lack targeted therapies and frequently progress with fatal dissemination."}

The aims of the present study were to investigate the acute effects of SS on the shear elastic moduli of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles and to examine the differences in these acute effects between young and elderly women.	This study included 15 healthy young women (age: 23.1 ± 3.4 years) and 15 healthy elderly women (age: 75.9 ± 2.8 years) with no history of neuromuscular disease or musculoskeletal injury involving the lower limbs. The shear elastic moduli of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles (MG and LG, respectively) were measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography at 30° plantar flexion, 0°, and 20° dorsiflexion before and immediately after 5 min of SS with the knee extended.	The shear elastic moduli of the MG and LG in all ankle position decreased after SS in both the young and elderly women, and there were no significant differences in the percent changes in the shear elastic moduli of the MG and LG at all ankle positions between the young and elderly women.	These results suggested that 5 min of SS might be effective for decreasing shear elastic modulus in both young and elderly women and that the effects on shear elastic modulus are similar between young and elderly women."}

Therapeutic hypothermia ameliorates neuronal injury in the newborn.	Inhibition of Src kinase concurrently with hypothermia further attenuates the hypoxia-induced increased activation of CaM kinase IV compared with hypothermia alone.	Ventilated piglets were exposed to HI, received saline or a selective Src kinase inhibitor (PP2), and were cooled to 33°C. Neuropathology, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) concentrations, and CaM kinase IV activity were determined.

The hypoxic groups with and without hypothermia or Src kinase inhibitor were comparable in the levels of ATP and PCr, indicating that they were similar in their degree of energy failure prior to treatments. Hypothermia or Src kinase inhibitor (PP2) did not restore the ATP and PCr levels.	Hypothermia and Src kinase inhibition attenuated apoptotic cell death and improved neuropathology after hypoxia.

During these episodes, newly produced virions may also reach the central nervous system (CNS), causing productive but generally asymptomatic infections. Epidemiological and experimental findings suggest that HSV-1 might contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder is related to an overproduction of amyloid beta (Aβ) and other neurotoxic peptides, which occurs during amyloidogenic endoproteolytic processing of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP). The aim of our study was to identify the effects of productive HSV-1 infection on APP processing in neuronal cells. We found that infection of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and rat cortical neurons is followed by multiple cleavages of APP, which result in the intra- and/or extra-cellular accumulation of various neurotoxic species. These include: i) APP fragments (APP-Fs) of 35 and 45 kDa (APP-F35 and APP-F45) that comprise portions of Aβ; ii) N-terminal APP-Fs that are secreted; iii) intracellular C-terminal APP-Fs; and iv) Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42). Western blot analysis of infected-cell lysates treated with formic acid suggests that APP-F35 may be an Aβ oligomer. The multiple cleavages of APP that occur in infected cells are produced in part by known components of the amyloidogenic APP processing pathway, i.e., host-cell β-secretase, γ-secretase, and caspase-3-like enzymes. These findings demonstrate that HSV-1 infection of neuronal cells can generate multiple APP fragments with well-documented neurotoxic potentials. It is tempting to speculate that intra- and extracellular accumulation of these species in the CNS resulting from repeated HSV-1 reactivation could, in the presence of other risk factors, play a co-factorial role in the development of AD."}

The purpose of our experiment was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ebselen on experimental SCI. Twenty-two rats subjected to SCI were randomly subjected to SCI with no further treatment (n = 10) or intragastric administration of ebselen (10 mg/kg) immediately and 24 hours after SCI. Behavioral changes were assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale and footprint test during 12 weeks after SCI. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of spinal cords and brains were performed at 12 weeks after SCI. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of spinal cords was also performed at 12 weeks after SCI. Rats treated with ebselen presented only limited neurobehavioral progress as well as reduced spinal cord injuries compared with the control group, namely length of lesions (cysts/scars) visualized histopathologically in the spinal cord sections was less but cavity area was very similar. The same pattern was found in T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (cavities) and diffusion-weighted images (scars). The number of FluoroGold retrogradely labeled neurons in brain stem and motor cortex was several-fold higher in ebselen-treated rats than in the control group.

Whether P2X(7)R overexpression is driving microglial activation or, conversely, P2X(7)R overexpression is a consequence of microglial activation is not known. We report that overexpression alone of a purinergic P2X(7)R, in the absence of pathological insults, is sufficient to drive the activation and proliferation of microglia in rat primary hippocampal cultures. The trophic responses observed in microglia were found to be P2X(7)R specific as the P2X(7)R antagonist, oxidized ATP (oxATP), was effective in markedly attenuating microgliosis. oxATP treatment of primary hippocampal cultures expressing exogenous P2X(7)Rs resulted in a significant decrease in the number of activated microglia. P2X(7)R is unusual in exhibiting two conductance states, a cation channel and a plasma membrane pore, and there are no pharmacological agents capable of cleanly discriminating between these two states. We used a point mutant of P2X(7)R (P2X7RG345Y) with intact channel function but ablated pore-forming capacity to establish that the trophic effects of increased P2X(7)R expression are exclusively mediated by the pore conductance. Collectively, and contrary to previous reports describing P2X(7)R as a 'death receptor,' we provide evidence for a novel trophic role for P2X(7)R pore in microglia."}

BBB is a selective barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain extracellular fluid. In its neuroprotective function, BBB prevents the entry of toxins, as well as most of anticancer agents and is the main impediment for brain targeted drug delivery approaches. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems provide an attractive strategy to cross the BBB and reach the central nervous system (CNS). The incorporation of anticancer agents in various nanovehicles facilitates their delivery across the BBB. Moreover, a more powerful tool in brain tumor therapy has relied surface modifications of nanovehicles with specific ligands that can promote their passage through the BBB and favor the accumulation of the drug in CNS tumors. This review describes the physiological and anatomical features of the brain tumor and the BBB, and summarizes the recent advanced approaches to deliver anticancer drugs into brain tumor using nanobiotechnology-based drug carrier systems. The role of specific ligands in the design of functionalized nanovehicles for targeted delivery to brain tumor is reviewed.

These diseases are associated with intraneuronal protein aggregates. Heat-inducible chaperones like HSP70 and HSP27 suppress poly(Q) aggregation and/or toxicity/cell death. Heat shock transcription factors, including HSF-1, regulate HSP70 and HSP27 expression. HSF-1 activity is reduced by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and enhanced by GSK-3 inhibitors, like lithium. Thus, we hypothesized that lithium treatment may partially rescue death in Huntington's disease cell models. LiCl reduced poly(Q) toxicity in neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines, but this was not associated with elevation of HSP70 or HSP27. The protective effect of lithium involved GSK-3beta inhibition, since poly(Q) toxicity was also reduced by SB216763, a GSK-3beta inhibitor, and by overexpression of a dominant-negative GSK-3beta mutant. LiCl and SB216763 increased beta-catenin-dependent T-cell factor-mediated transcription. Since beta-catenin overexpression protected cells from poly(Q) toxicity, we tested whether this pathway was impaired by a poly(Q) expansion mutation. Cells expressing expanded repeats had reduced beta-catenin levels associated with a parallel decrease in T-cell factor-mediated transcription, compared with cells expressing wild type constructs. Since LiCl can protect against polyglutamine toxicity in cell lines, it is an excellent candidate for further in vivo therapeutic trials."}

The disorder is caused by transcriptional shutdown in neurons of thefragile X mental retardation 1gene product, fragile X mental retardation protein. Fragile X mental retardation protein is a repressor of dendritic mRNA translation and its silencing leads to dysregulation of synaptically driven protein synthesis and impairments of intellect, cognition, and behavior, and FXS is a disorder that currently has no effective therapeutics. Here, young fragile X mice were treated with chronic bryostatin-1, a relatively selective protein kinase Cεactivator, which induces synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation/repair. Chronic treatment with bryostatin-1 rescues young fragile X mice from the disorder phenotypes, including normalization of most FXS abnormalities in 1) hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, 2) postsynaptic density-95 levels, 3) transformation of immature dendritic spines to mature synapses, 4) densities of the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, and 5) spatial learning and memory. The therapeutic effects were achieved without downregulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 5 in the hippocampus and are more dramatic than those of a late-onset treatment in adult fragile X mice. mGluR5 expression was in fact lower in fragile X mice and its expression was restored with the bryostatin-1 treatment. Our results show that synaptic and cognitive function of young FXS mice can be normalized through pharmacological treatment without downregulation of mGluR5 and that bryostatin-1-like agents may represent a novel class of drugs to treat fragile X mental retardation at a young age and in adults."}

Therefore, there is an emerging need on the development of new techniques for the treatment of brain injuries. In this study we propose to combine the above stem cell based methods and then evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the new method. Mice were randomly divided into four groups: group 1 (brain injury alone); group 2 (osthole); group 3 (stem cell transplantation); and group 4 (osthole combined with stem cell transplantation). We carried out water maze task to exam spatial memory. Immunocytochemistry was used to test the inflammatory condition of each group, and the differentiation of stem cells. To evaluate the condition of the damaged blood brain barrier restore, we detect the Evans blue (EB) extravasation across the blood brain barrier. The result shows that osthole and stem cell transplantation combined therapeutic method has a potent effect on improving the spatial memory. This combined method was more effective on inhibiting inflammation and preventing neuronal degeneration than the single treated ones. In addition, there was a distinct decline of EB extravasation in the combined treatment groups, which was not observed in single treatment groups. Most importantly, the combined usage of osthole and stem cell transplantation provide a better treatment for the traumatic brain injury caused by neuroendoscopy. The collective evidence indicates osthole combined with neural stem cell transplantation is superior than either method alone for the treatment of traumatic brain injury caused by neuroendoscopy."}

Previously reports have shown that microRNA-335 (miR-335) resided on chromosome 7q32 is deregulated in many cancers; however, the biological function of miR-335 in astrocytoma has yet to be elucidated.	We report that miR-335 acts as a tumor promoter in conferring tumorigenic features such as growth and invasion on malignant astrocytoma. The miR-335 level is highly elevated in C6 astrocytoma cells and human malignant astrocytomas. Ectopic expression of miR-335 in C6 cells dramatically enhances cell viability, colony-forming ability and invasiveness. Conversely, delivery of antagonist specific for miR-335 (antagomir-335) to C6 cells results in growth arrest, cell apoptosis, invasion repression and marked regression of astrocytoma xenografts. Further investigation reveals that miR-335 targets disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1(Daam1) at posttranscriptional level. Moreover, silencing of endogenous Daam1 (siDaam1) could mimic the oncogenic effects of miR-335 and reverse the growth arrest, proapoptotic and invasion repression effects induced by antagomir-335. Notably, the oncogenic effects of miR-335 and siDAAM1 together with anti-tumor effects of antagomir-335 are also confirmed in human astrocytoma U87-MG cells.

To address this limitation, nerve growth factor (NGF) was incorporated into NGCs of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-methyl methacrylate), P(HEMA-co-MMA). The NGCs were synthesized by a liquid-liquid centrifugal casting process and three different methods of protein incorporation were compared in terms of protein distribution and NGF release profile: (1) NGF was encapsulated (with BSA) in biodegradable poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) 85/15 microspheres, which were combined with a PHEMA polymerization formulation and coated on the inside of pre-formed NGCs by a second liquid-liquid centrifugal casting technique; (2) pre-formed NGCs were imbibed with a solution of NGF/BSA and (3) NGF/BSA alone was combined with a PHEMA formulation and coated on the inside of pre-formed NGCs by a second liquid-liquid centrifugal casting technique. Using a fluorescently labelled model protein, the distribution of proteins in NGCs prepared with a coating of either protein-loaded microspheres or protein alone was found to be confined to the inner PHEMA layer. Sustained release of NGF was achieved from NGCs with either NGF-loaded microspheres or NGF alone incorporated into the inner layer, but not from channels imbibed with NGF.

The stimulation of endothelial cells by cytokines secreted by tumor cells such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces their proliferation and migration. This is a prominent feature of high-grade gliomas. The secretion of VEGF is greatly upregulated under conditions of hypoxia because of the transcription factor hypoxiainducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, which controls the expression of many genes, allowing rapid adaptation of cells to their hypoxic microenvironment. Flavopiridol, a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, has been attributed with antiangiogenic properties in some cancer cell lines by its ability to inhibit VEGF production. Here, we show that flavopiridol treatment of human U87MG and T98G glioma cell lines decreases hypoxia-mediated HIF-1alpha expression, VEGF secretion, and tumor cell migration. These in vitro results correlate with reduced vascularity of intracranial syngeneic GL261 gliomas from animals treated with flavopiridol. In addition, we show that flavopiridol downregulates HIF-1alpha expression in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, an agent that normally results in the accumulation and overexpression of HIF-1alpha.

Excitation stimulates the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from nerves in the muscle. Since CGRP stimulates the Na+-K+ pump, this may contribute to the excitation-induced force recovery. Indeed, reducing CGRP content by capsaicin pre-treatment or prior denervation prevented both the excitation-induced force recovery and the drop in intracellular Na+. 5. The data suggest that activation of the Na+-K+ pump in contracting muscles counterbalances the depressing effect of reductions in the chemical gradients for Na+ and K+ on excitability."}

Non-traumatized animals served as controls. TBI resulted in a midline shift and a decrease in Apparent Diffusion Coefficient, indicating a hemispheric enlargement due to cytotoxic edema. The tight junction protein Zona Occludens-1 was decreased (-25%) and associated with an increased IgG permeability (+20%) in the perilesional brain tissue in accordance with a BBB breakdown. The total amount of AQP4 protein decreased (-20%). The disruption of the BBB lasted for 4 days while the impact on AQP4 levels disappeared between day 1 and 4. Our findings shows that blunt focal brain injury results in an early development of brain edema involving both cytotoxic and vasogenic components, a persistent BBB breakdown and a temporary decrease in AQP4, and indicates that both types of edemas and mechanisms should be targeted in TBI treatment."}

In addition, the possible interaction between ALC and vincristine antineoplastic action was assessed.	Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) was induced in different groups of rats. The effect of ALC was evaluated both when its administration was started together with the administration of anticancer drugs ('preventive' protocol) and when ALC administration was started later on during treatment ('curative' protocol).	The ALC treatment significantly prevented the lowering of the mechanical nociceptive threshold when the administration started concomitantly and, respectively, with cisplatin, paclitaxel and vincristine as compared to each drug alone. Furthermore, when ALC administration was started later on during treatment, at well-established neuropathy, ALC was able to restore the mechanical nociceptive threshold within a few days. Finally, experiments indicated that ALC does not interfere with the antitumor effects of vincristine.	Considering the absence of any satisfactory treatment currently available for CIPN in a clinical setting, these are important observations, opening up the possibility of using ALC to treat a wide range of patients who have undergone chemotherapy and developed sensory peripheral neuropathy."}

The chitosan scaffold based on immobilization of BDNF by genipin (GP) as a crosslinking agent referred to hereafter as a CGB scaffold was prepared by freezing-drying technique. hUC-MSCs were co-cultured with the CGB scaffold. Fluorescent nuclear staining (Hoechst 33342) was employed to determine the attachment of the hUC-MSCs to CGB scaffolds on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 10th day of co-culture. The viability of hUC-MSCs adhered to the CGB scaffold was determined by digesting with 0.25% trypsin and evaluating with the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). Prior to this, the diameter and porosity of CGB scaffolds were measured. The amount of BDNF released from CGB over a 30 day period was determined by ELISA. Finally, we investigated whether the released BDNF can induce NSC to differentiate into neurons. There were no significant differences in diameter and porosity of individual CGB scaffolds (P > 0.05). There were on average more cells on the CGB scaffold on the first day than on any other day sampled (P < 0.05). The CGB scaffolds released BDNF in a uniform profile, whereas the CB scaffolds only released BDNF during the first 3 days. BDNF released from CGB scaffold promoted neuronal differentiation of NSCs and led to significant differences in differentiation rate and average neuron perimeter compared with the control group. The results of this study demonstrate that CGB scaffolds are biocompatible with hUC-MSCs and that granular CGB scaffolds covered with hUC-MSCs are expected to generate new advances for future treatment of traumatic brain injury."}

We show that AN stimulation at relatively high current disrupted the acquisition of contextual fear conditioning and impaired performance on a spatial alternating task in rats. This has not been observed at parameters generating a charge density that approximated the one used in clinical practice. At settings that impaired behavior, AN stimulation induced a functional depolarization block nearby the electrode, increased c-Fos expression in cerebral regions projecting to and receiving projections from the AN, and influenced hippocampal activity. This suggests that complex mechanisms might be involved in the effects of AN DBS, including a local target inactivation and the modulation of structures at a distance. Though translating data from animals to humans has to be considered with caution, our study underscores the need for carefully monitoring memory function while selecting stimulation parameters during the clinical evaluation of AN DBS."}

It is a common post-translational modification that serves multiple functions in cell differentiation, signaling and intercellular communication. Unlike DNA/RNA/protein, the addition of complex carbohydrates is not-template driven and it is conceivable that both genetics and environmental factors might interact to influence glycosylation machinery in several pathological processes. Over the last few decades, the recognition of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) as an increasing number of genetic diseases of glycosylation with almost constant nervous system involvement, dramatically illustrated the consequences of abnormal glycosylation as improper CNS development and function. In addition, CDG recognition contributed to postulate that aberrant glycosylation processes might play a role in multifactorial, complex CNS diseases. On this context, CNS glycomics explores the effects of possible aberrant glycosylation to identify potential glyco-biomarkers useful for the diagnosis and ultimately for potential intervention strategies in neurological diseases. Up to date, CNS glycomics is an emerging, still uncharted area because of the specificity of CNS glycosylation, the complexity of the neurological disorders and for the inaccessibility and invasiveness of disease relevant samples.

Many studies suggest that catamenial seizures are caused by fluctuations in gonadal hormones during the menstrual cycle, but this has been difficult to study in rodent models of epilepsy because the ovarian cycle in rodents, called the estrous cycle, is disrupted by severe seizures. Thus, when epilepsy is severe, estrous cycles become irregular or stop. Therefore, we modified kainic acid (KA)- and pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) models of epilepsy so that seizures were rare for the first months after SE, and conducted video-EEG during this time. The results showed that interictal spikes (IIS) occurred intermittently. All rats with regular 4-day estrous cycles had IIS that waxed and waned with the estrous cycle. The association between the estrous cycle and IIS was strong: if the estrous cycles became irregular transiently, IIS frequency also became irregular, and when the estrous cycle resumed its 4-day pattern, IIS frequency did also. Furthermore, when rats were ovariectomized, or males were recorded, IIS frequency did not show a 4-day pattern. Systemic administration of an estrogen receptor antagonist stopped the estrous cycle transiently, accompanied by transient irregularity of the IIS pattern. Eventually all animals developed severe, frequent seizures and at that time both the estrous cycle and the IIS became irregular. We conclude that the estrous cycle entrains IIS in the modified KA and pilocarpine SE models of epilepsy. The data suggest that the ovarian cycle influences more aspects of epilepsy than seizure susceptibility."}

As a positive-strand RNA virus, dengue virus relies on the host cell metabolism for its translation, replication, and egress. Therefore, a better understanding of the host cell metabolic pathways required for dengue virus infection offers the opportunity to develop new approaches for therapeutic intervention. In a recently described screen of known drugs and bioactive molecules, we observed that methotrexate and floxuridine inhibited dengue virus infections at low micromolar concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that all serotypes of dengue virus, as well as West Nile virus, are highly sensitive to both methotrexate and floxuridine, whereas other RNA viruses (Sindbis virus and vesicular stomatitis virus) are not. Interestingly, flavivirus replication was restored by folinic acid, a thymidine precursor, in the presence of methotrexate and by thymidine in the presence of floxuridine, suggesting an unexpected role for thymidine in flavivirus replication. Since thymidine is not incorporated into RNA genomes, it is likely that increased thymidine production is indirectly involved in flavivirus replication. A possible mechanism is suggested by the finding that p53 inhibition restored dengue virus replication in the presence of floxuridine, consistent with thymidine-less stress triggering p53-mediated antiflavivirus effects in infected cells. Our data reveal thymidine synthesis pathways as new and unexpected therapeutic targets for antiflaviviral drug development."}

Mounting evidence from in vivo AD models has demonstrated that physical activity can exert a neuroprotective role in AD. In addition, autophagy is strictly regulated by the mTOR signaling pathway. In this article, the regulation of the functional status of autophagy through the mTOR signaling pathway during physical activity is systematically discussed for the prevention and treatment of AD.

PtdCho homeostasis is regulated by the balance between hydrolysis and synthesis. PtdCho is hydrolyzed by phospholipase A2 (PLA2), PtdChospecific phospholipase C (PtdCho-PLC), and phospholipase D (PLD). PtdCho synthesis is rate-limited by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), which makes CDP-choline. The final step of PtdCho synthesis is catalyzed by CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase. PtdCho synthesis in the brain is predominantly through the CDP-choline pathway. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) significantly increased PLA2 activity, secretory PLA2 (sPLA2)-IIA mRNA and protein levels, PtdCho-PLC activity, and PLD2 protein expression following reperfusion. CDP-choline treatment significantly attenuated PLA2 activity, sPLA2-IIA mRNA and protein levels, and PtdCho-PLC activity, but did not affect PLD2 protein expression. tMCAO also resulted in loss of CCT activity and CCTalpha protein, which were partially restored by CDP-choline. No changes were observed in cytosolic PLA2 or calcium-independent PLA2 tMCAO. protein levels after Up-regulation of PLA2, PtdCho-PLC, and PLD and regulation of CCT collectively down-resulted in loss of PtdCho, which was significantly restored by CDP-choline treatment.

Sublocalization of this protein may be relevant for the formation of multimeric α-syn oligomeric configurations, insoluble aggregates that form Lewy bodies in PD brains. Processing of this protein aggregation is regulated by associations with distinct lipid classes. For instance, instability of lipid raft (LR) microdomains, membrane regions with a particular lipid composition, is an early event in the development of PD. However, the relevance of membrane microdomains in the regulation and trafficking of the distinct α-syn configurations associated with PD remains unexplored. In this study, using 6- and 14-month-old healthy and MPTP-treated animals as a model of PD, we have investigated the putative molecular alterations of raft membrane microstructures, and their impact on α-syn dynamics and conformation. A comparison of lipid analyses of LR microstructures and non-raft (NR) fractions showed alterations in gangliosides, cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and phospholipids in the midbrain and cortex of aged and MPTP-treated mice. In particular, the increase of PUFA and phosphatidylserine (PS) during aging correlated with α-syn multimeric formation in NR. In these aggregates, α-syn was phosphorylated in pSer129, the most abundant post-transductional modification of α-syn promoting toxic aggregation. Interestingly, similar variations in PUFA and PS content correlating with α-syn insoluble accumulation were also detected in membrane microstructures from the human cortex of incidental Parkinson Disease (iPD) and PD, as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, structural changes in membrane lipid microenvironments may induce rearrangements in raft-interacting proteins involved in other neuropathologies. Therefore, we also investigated the dynamic of other protein markers involved in cognition and memory impairment such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), ionotropic NMDA receptor (NMDAR2B), prion protein (PrPc) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose activity depends on membrane lipid organization.

Bioluminescence showed that the engineered S. typhimurium accumulated in glioma tumors and disappeared in the normal reticuloendothelial tissues 3 days after intravenous injection. MRI showed that the tumor volume in the S. typhimurium with ClyA group were significantly reduced compared to the bacteria alone and no bacteria groups 7 days post-doxycycline treatment (P<0.05), while the necrotic tumor volume in the S. typhimurium with ClyA group and S. typhimurium alone group increased significantly compared to the control group (P<0.01). In addition, the survival time was significantly prolonged in the bacteria-treated group compared to the PBS-treated control group (P<0.01).	The engineered S. typhimurium can significantly induce cancer cell apoptosis in the tumor center and inhibit cancer cell proliferation in the outer zone of advanced glioma tumor, leading to a prolonged survival time in rats. In addition, the engineered S. typhimurium that carried the antitumor and imaging genes controlled by the TetR-regulated promoter have high delivery efficiency with tolerable side effects in rats."}

We scaled up from a rodent model to a larger primate model using a highly controllable, friction-free, electronically-driven actuator to generate unilateral C6-C7 spinal cord injuries. Graded contusion lesions with varying degrees of functional recovery, depending upon pre-set impact parameters, were produced in nine NHPs. Protocols and pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to optimize the predictability of outcomes by matching impact protocols to the size of each animal's spinal canal, cord, and cerebrospinal fluid space. Post-operative MRI confirmed lesion placement and provided information on lesion volume and spread for comparison with histological measures. We evaluated the relationships between impact parameters, lesion measures, and behavioral outcomes, and confirmed that these relationships were consistent with our previous studies in the rat. In addition to providing multiple univariate outcome measures, we also developed an integrated outcome metric describing the multivariate cervical SCI syndrome. Impacts at the higher ranges of peak force produced highly lateralized and enduring deficits in multiple measures of forelimb and hand function, while lower energy impacts produced early weakness followed by substantial recovery but enduring deficits in fine digital control (e.g., pincer grasp). This model provides a clinically relevant system in which to evaluate the safety and, potentially, the efficacy of candidate translational therapies."}

At the protein level, UVB irradiation downregulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Due to lacking of a global analysis of UVB-modulated corneal proteome, we investigate in vitro the mechanism of UVB-induced corneal damage to determine whether hyaluronic acid (HA) is able to reduce UVB irradiation-induced injury in human corneal epithelial cells. Accordingly, human corneal epithelial cell lines (HCE-2) were irradiated with UVB, followed by incubation with low molecular weight HA (LMW-HA, 100 kDa) or high molecular weight HA (HMW-HA, 1,000 kDa) to investigate the physiologic protection of HMW-HA in UVB-induced corneal injury, and to perform a global proteomic analysis. The data demonstrated that HA treatment protects corneal epithelial cells in the UVB-induced wound model, and that the molecular weight of HA is a crucial factor. Only HMW-HA significantly reduces the UVB-induced cytotoxic effects in corneal cells and increases cell migration and wound-healing ability. In addition, proteomic analysis showed that HMW-HA might modulate cytoskeleton regulation, signal transduction, biosynthesis, redox regulation, and protein folding to stimulate wound healing and to prevent these UVB-damaged cells from cell death. Further studies evidenced membrane-associated progesterone receptor component 1 (mPR) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) play essential roles in protecting corneal cells from UVB irradiation. This study reports on UVB-modulated cellular proteins that might play an important role in UVB-induced corneal cell injury and show HMW-HA to be a potential substance for protecting corneal cells from UVB-induced injury."}

Five weeks after syringomyelia was induced by the injection of kaolin into the cisterna magna in Japanese white rabbits, ventriculosubgaleal shunting or syringoepidural shunting were performed. After 1 week magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and histological examination were then carried out. Five of 11 shunted animals showed postoperative reduction of syrinx size on MR imaging. Grossly, some specimens showed cavity collapse and parenchymal healing, and others showed a small residual syrinx in the dorsal horn. The most dramatic histological changes occurred in the gray matter. Specimens with syrinx collapse showed rarefaction and tearing of the gray matter, with mild glial reaction. The edematous gray matter showed both degeneration and regeneration, with neuronal processes surrounded by edema fluid. Reactive astrocytes were observed mainly at the margin of the residual syrinx. Some astrocytic processes invested the extraaxonal space and gray matter lacked supportive tissue. Greater reduction of the syrinx after shunting operation was correlated with more regeneration and less degeneration, and the white matter was edematous and histological changes were milder. Syrinx shrinkage occurred after shunting in this experimental model of syringomyelia. The selective vulnerability of gray matter even after shunting may explain discrepancies between imaging findings and clinical features in this disease. The study supports the potential benefit from early treatment, considering the associated morphological findings of regeneration."}

Furosemide has been shown to improve pulmonary gas exchange and intrapulmonary shunt in animal models of ARDS by preferential perfusion of nonedematous lung units. We hypothesized that continuous dose furosemide would improve lung injury during resuscitation from oleic acid-induced lung injury in canines.	Ten mongrel dogs were anesthetized and given intravenous oleic acid (0.1 mg/kg) to induce lung injury. Once lung injury was established (2 h) the control animals (n = 6) were continued on standard supportive therapy, and the study animals (n = 4) were started on continuous dose furosemide at 0.2 mg/kg/h. Cardiac filling pressures were maintained in all animals by infusion of isotonic saline solution. Data collected included lung injury score (LIS), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), urine output (UO), volume of resuscitation (VR), and pulmonary shunt fraction (Qs/Qt). Data were collected at baseline, established lung injury (2 h), and end of protocol (6 h). Data were compared between groups at various stages of the model using one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures.	All 10 animals survived the protocol. There was no difference between the experimental and control groups at baseline or established lung injury (2 h) for CI, SVI, PCWP, or VR. There was a significant improvement in PO2/FIO2 and reduction of PEEP values in the furosemide group.

However, the mechanism governing its therapeutic effect is still under debate. To shed light on the basic mechanism of deep brain stimulation (DBS), we performed microstimulation in the GP of a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated monkey while recording with other microelectrodes in the same nucleus. We used robust methods to reduce the stimulus artifact, and 600-3000 repetitions of a single stimulus and of high-frequency short trains (10-40 stimuli), enabling high temporal resolution analysis of neural responses. Low-frequency stimulation yielded a typical three-stage response: short-term (2-3 msec duration) activity, followed by mid-term (15-25 msec) inhibition, and occasionally longer-term (30-40 msec) excitation. Trains of high-frequency stimuli elicited complex locking of the response to the stimuli in most neurons. The locking displayed a stereotypic temporal structure consisting of three short-duration (1-2 msec) phases: an initial (mean latency = 2.9 msec) excitation followed by an inhibition (4.6 msec) and a second excitation (6.3 msec). The change in the mean firing rate was mixed; the majority of the neurons displayed partial inhibition during the stimulus train. Slow inhibitory and excitatory multiphase changes in the firing rate were observed after the stimulus trains. The activity of neurons recorded simultaneously displayed rate correlations but no spike-to-spike correlations. Our results suggest that the effect of DBS on the GP is not complete inhibition but rather a complex reshaping of the temporal structure of the neuronal activity within that nucleus."}

Ponicidin preferentially activated HSV-1-specific TK but not cellular kinases. In HSV-infected cells, ponicidin significantly accumulated the phosphorylated metabolites of GCV and suppressed the extracellular release of GCV. These data suggested that the cytotoxicities of ACV and GCV in HSV-TK-expressing cells might be potentiated by ponicidin. After transfected with the HSV-1 TK gene, COS-1 and several human cancer cells became highly sensitive to the cytotoxic properties of the nucleoside analogs. When ponicidin at the concentration without antiviral activities (0.2 microg/mL) was combined with ACV or GCV, the cytotoxic levels in HSV-TK-expressing cells were enhanced by 3- to 87-fold and 5- to 52-fold, respectively, compared with the nucleoside alone. When the stability of the bioactivity of ponicidin in the blood of mice was evaluated, the substance showed relatively long-lasting effects on the potentiation of the anti-herpetic and cytotoxic activities of GCV after intravenous administration.

Lumican-deficient mice (Lum(-/-)) develop abnormally thick collagen fibrils, translucent corneas and fragilities of the skin and the tendon. In addition to modulating interstitial ECM structure, here we hypothesized that lumican regulates proliferation and apoptosis of cells residing in the interstitium. Corneal and embryonic fibroblasts from the Lum(-/-) mouse show increased growth in culture. Lum(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), compared to their wild type counterparts, display increased rates of proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Ectopic expression of lumican in Lum(-/-) MEF or exogenous recombinant lumican in the culture medium reduces proliferation to rates seen in the Lum(+/+) MEF. We further investigated the implications of lumican's proliferation and apoptosis regulatory role in the cornea where lumican is a major component of the stromal matrix. Stromal keratocytes undergo proliferation and apoptosis during corneal maturation and in the healing of injured cornea. The Lum(-/-) mouse shows increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of stromal keratocytes during postnatal corneal maturation at the 10-day age. Apoptosis is also significantly down regulated in Lum(-/-) vis-à-vis Lum(+/+) mice during stromal wound healing in the adult 6-week age. Lumican appears to regulate these cellular functions by modulating specific cell growth and apoptosis mediators. Thus, Lum(-/-) MEF have decreased p21(WAF1/CIP1), a universal inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases and a consequent increase in cyclins A, D1 and E. Furthermore, the tumor suppressor p53, an upstream regulator of p21 is down regulated in the MEF and the cornea of Lum(-/-) mice. The evidence suggests regulation of p21 by lumican in a p53-dependent way. The MEF and the cornea of Lum(-/-) mice also show a dramatic decrease in Fas (CD95). The Lum(-/-) MEF fail to induce Fas upon treatment with Fas ligand. Fas-Fas ligand interaction is an initiating event in apoptosis and its disruption in lumican-deficiency may partly explain the observed decrease in apoptosis. Fas-Fas ligand mediated apoptosis is critical for maintaining the immune privileged status of the cornea, which implies a new and exciting role for lumican in the cornea."}

Despite being widely used to screen antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), both models have so far failed to detect potentially useful AEDs for treating drug-resistant epilepsies. Here we investigated whether the acute induction of MES and PTZ seizures in epileptic rats might yield a distinct screening profile for AEDs.	Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal pilocarpine injection (Pilo, 320 mg/kg, i.p.). One month later, controls or naive animals (Cont) that did not develop SE postpilocarpine (N-Epi) and pilocarpine-epileptic rats (Epi) received one of the following: phenobarbital (PB, 40 mg/kg), phenytoin (PHT, 50 mg/kg), or valproic acid (VPA, 400 mg/kg). Thirty min later the animals were challenged with either subcutaneous MES or PTZ (50 mg/kg, s.c.).	VPA, PB, and PHT were able to prevent MES in all groups tested (Cont, N-Epi, and Epi groups), whereas for the PTZ model, only the Cont group (naive animals) had seizure control with the same AEDs. In addition, Epi and N-Epi groups when challenged with PTZ exhibited a higher incidence of severe seizures (scores IV-IX) and SE (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test).

The experimental neurotoxicology of aluminum has been shown to recapitulate many of the pathophysiological features of AD and therefore represents a useful model to study the mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration. The present study investigated the effects of aluminum maltolate (Al-maltol) on the delicate balance that exists between pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins using primary brain rotation-mediated aggregate cultures. Aggregates were treated with Al-maltol (5-150 microM) on day 15 in vitro for 72 h. Cell death increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner reaching significance in aggregates treated with 150 microM Al-maltol in 48 h and 50 microM by 72 h. Analysis of gene expression at 72 h revealed a concentration-dependent increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) suggestive of a state of inflammation. In contrast, a dramatic concentration-dependent decrease in the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was observed. In fact, NGF expression could not be detected in aggregates treated with 50 and 150 microM Al-maltol. These changes in gene expression correlated with a decrease in aggregate size and an increase in neurodegeneration as indicated by Fluoro-Jade B staining. The results indicated a differential regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins in brain tissue following treatment with Al-maltol. Such findings provide insight into the possible involvement of deregulation of the cytokine/neurotrophin balance in the etiology of neurodegeneration."}

To gain insight into these mechanisms, we examined these interrelationships in aged non-mutant genomic human Tau mice, with established Tau pathology and neuron loss. We also examined how these interrelationships changed with an intervention by feeding mice either a control diet or one containing the brain permeable beta-amyloid and Tau aggregate binding molecule curcumin. Transgene-dependent elevations in soluble and insoluble phospho-Tau monomer and soluble Tau dimers accompanied deficits in behavior, hippocampal excitatory synaptic markers, and molecular chaperones (heat shock proteins (HSPs)) involved in Tau degradation and microtubule stability. In human Tau mice but not control mice, HSP70, HSP70/HSP72, and HSP90 were reduced in membrane-enriched fractions but not in cytosolic fractions. The synaptic proteins PSD95 and NR2B were reduced in dendritic fields and redistributed into perikarya, corresponding to changes observed by immunoblot. Curcumin selectively suppressed levels of soluble Tau dimers, but not of insoluble and monomeric phospho-Tau, while correcting behavioral, synaptic, and HSP deficits. Treatment increased PSD95 co-immunoprecipitating with NR2B and, independent of transgene, increased HSPs implicated in Tau clearance. It elevated HSP90 and HSC70 without increasing HSP mRNAs; that is, without induction of the heat shock response.

AST included local iron chelator (2,2'-dipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid) injection and 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate application to the lesion core. In previous studies, this treatment promoted long-distance regeneration of cut corticospinal tract axons, neuroprotection of projecting cortical neurons and functional improvement of treated rats [N.

Treatment yielded significantly enhanced regrowth of descending serotonergic (5-HT), catecholaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase; TH), corticospinal and rubrospinal axons into the lesion zone, as assessed by anterograde tracing and immunohistochemistry followed by quantification of axon profiles at 5 and 12 weeks post-injury. In addition, the determination of axons crossing the proximal borderline from uninjured tissue into fibrous scar area revealed a significant AST-promoted increase of intersecting fibres for 5-HT, TH and calcitonin gene-related peptide containing ascending sensory fibres. For a prolonged time period after lesion, the delayed (secondary) scar developing in treated rats is significantly more permeable for all analysed axon tracts than the initial (primary) scar forming in injured control animals lacking treatment.

In this study, we demonstrated that hippocampal GPR30 expression was reduced in middle-aged mice compared with young adult mice. GPR30 agonist G1 improved both fear and spatial memory in both male and female middle-aged mice, but not in young adult mice, which were blocked by the GPR30 antagonist G15. Interestingly, a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG)-induced long-term depression (LTD) in mossy fiber-cornu ammonis 3 (MF-CA3) synapses but not Schaffer collateral-CA1 (SC-CA1) synapses was facilitated in brain slices from G1-treated middle-aged mice. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in SC-CA1 synapses was not affected in slices from G1-treated mice. The effects of GPR30 activation on memory and DHPG-LTD in MF-CA3 synapses were further confirmed by viral expression of GPR30 in the CA3. The regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by G1 treatment might be related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling, as G15 also blocked G1-induced activation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway. Moreover, we found that DHPG triggered GluA internalization in slices from G1-treated mice but not control mice. Pharmacological experiments showed that G1-mediated facilitation of DHPG-induced LTD in MF-CA3 synapses was dependent on protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor), and TrkB signaling.

The data regarding long-term clinical outcomes are variable, with some studies demonstrating marked improvement whereas others fail to demonstrate improved outcomes when compared with patients who receive standard of care. Although adverse sequalae were uncommon, IT and IVt administration and therapy were associated with adverse effects including headache, meningitis, and hydrocephalus.	Given the findings presented in these studies, IT, IVt, and intracisternal (pellet) nicardipine administration can be useful treatment adjuncts for vasospasm following aSAH, especially in cases refractory to conventional forms of treatment.

Molecular analyses demonstrated that hyperactivation of type 1 angiotensin II (AT1) receptor mediates cardiac hypertrophy induced by AAS and also induces down-regulation of myocardial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP), resulting in loss of exercise-induced cardioprotection. Exposure to AAS during adolescence promoted long-term cardiovascular dysfunctions, such as dysautonomia. We tested the hypothesis that chronic AAS exposure in the pre/pubertal phase increases the susceptibility to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury in adult rats. Male Wistar rats (26day old) were treated with vehicle (Control, n=12) or testosterone propionate (TP) (AAS, 5mgkg[-1] n=12) 5 times/week during 5 weeks. At the end of AAS exposure, rats underwent 23days of washout period and were submitted to euthanasia. Langendorff-perfused hearts were submitted to IR injury and evaluated for mechanical dysfunctions and infarct size. Molecular analysis was performed by mRNA levels of α-myosin heavy chain (MHC), βMHC and brain-derived natriuretic peptide (BNP), ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of AT1 receptor and KATP channel subunits (Kir6.1 and SURa) was analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western Blot. NADPH oxidase (Nox)-related reactive oxygen species generation was assessed by spectrofluorimetry. The expression of antioxidant enzymes was measured by qRT-PCR in order to address a potential role of redox unbalance. AAS exposure promoted long-term cardiac hypertrophy characterized by increased expression of βMHC and βMHC/αMHC ratio. Baseline derivative of pressure (dP/dt) was impaired by AAS exposure. Postischemic recovery of mechanical properties was impaired (decreased left ventricle [LV] developed pressure and maximal dP/dt; increased LV end-diastolic pressure and minimal dP/dt) and infarct size was larger in the AAS group. Catalase mRNA expression was significantly decreased in the AAS group. In conclusion, chronic administration of AAS during adolescence promoted long-term pathological cardiac hypertrophy and persistent increase in the susceptibility to myocardial IR injury possible due to disturbances on catalase expression."}

Eighteen dogs received tracheostomy under general anesthesia and were randomly divided into 3 groups: the OSA group (OSA was simulated via clamping of the endotracheal tube at end expiration for 1.5 minutes every 10 minutes, n=6), the LL-TS + OSA group (simulated OSA plus LL-TS, at 80% of the slowing sinus rate, n=6), and the control group (sham surgery without stimulation, n=6). The effective refractory period was significantly shortened after 1 hour of simulated OSA, and the window of vulnerability and plasma norepinephrine levels were both markedly increased in the OSA group. OSA dramatically increased the neural function and activity of the intrinsic and extrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system, including the superior left ganglionated plexus, the left stellate ganglion, and the left renal sympathetic nerve. OSA also significantly upregulated the expression levels of c-fos and nerve growth factor in the superior left ganglionated plexus and the left stellate ganglion. However, LL-TS markedly improved these parameters.	These findings suggest that the intrinsic and extrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system plays crucial roles in the acute stage of OSA-induced AF. Noninvasive LL-TS suppressed shortening of atrial refractoriness and autonomic remodeling, which prevented OSA-induced AF."}

Regenerative stem cell therapy could potentially restore normal hearing and slow the progression of hearing loss in patients. Preclinical animal studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could be a promising new therapy for this condition. These findings have prompted investigators to begin human clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of MSCs for the treatment of SNHL. The objective of the proposed systematic review is to examine the efficacy of MSCs as a therapy for SNHL in animal models.	We will include preclinical animal studies of SNHL in which MSCs are administered, and outcomes are compared against MSC-naïve controls. The primary outcome will include audiologic tests that are routinely used in experimental studies of hearing loss, such as auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions testing (DPOAE). Secondary outcomes will include histology, microscopy, gene protein expression, and behavioral responses of animals. Electronic searches of MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) will be performed. Search results will be screened independently and in duplicate. Data from eligible studies will be extracted, pooled, and analyzed using random effects models. Risk of bias and publication bias will be assessed using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool and Funnel Plots/Egger's regression tests, respectively.	This systematic review will provide a summary of the efficacy of MSC therapy in animal models of SNHL, utilizing functional hearing assessment as a primary outcome. Findings from this review are important because they can elucidate research gaps that should be addressed in future preclinical studies and in turn can be translated into clinical studies.

Comparative efficiency of human insulin and two bacterial antigens, lipopolysacharide from Escherichia coli and glycoprotein extract from Klebsiella pneumoniae.^\nAs oral administration of insulin reduces the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice, and to achieve a better approximation of oral insulin trials being developed for human studies which will use human insulin, we attempted to determine the preventive efficacy of oral administration of human insulin rather than resorting to the animal insulins used in previous studies. As the strength of prevention obtained by oral insulin has not been adequately demonstrated, we determined whether the protection persisted after the oral treatment was discontinued and whether it was resistant to a diabetogenic injection of cyclophosphamide (CY). We also determined whether the effect of insulin could be increased by oral administration of lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli (LPS) or another immunostimulant (glycoprotein extracts from Klebsiella pneumoniae, GEKP) which may be more feasible for human application. Female NOD mice were fed once a week (from 35 to 300 days of age) with insulin, LPS, GEKP, insulin plus LPS, insulin plus GEKP, or PBS. A decreased incidence of diabetes were observed in animals fed human insulin (p < 0.01 incidence of diabetes at 300 days of age: 31% in mice fed with insulin and 65% in those fed PBS). Prevention by insulin was not enhanced by oral LPS or GEKP. Yet unexpectedly, mice fed with LPS alone or GEKP alone displayed decreases in diabetes incidence (p < 0.01). The severity of insulitis was reduced in animals fed insulin, LPS, GEKP or combinations of insulin and either immunostimulant (p < 0.02). Although the oral treatments were stopped at 300 days of age, the incidence of diabetes at 360 days remained lower in mice previously fed insulin, LPS, GEKP or combinations of insulin and either immunostimulant (p < 0.01). In mice previously fed PBS, CY injection (60 days after withdrawal of the oral treatment) led to a final incidence of diabetes of 90% (sum of the incidence during the initial 360 days and the further CY-induced incidence). Previous feedings with insulin, LPS, GEKP or combinations of insulin and either immunostimulant did not protect against CY-induced diabetes since incidences reached the final control incidence. T splenocytes from animals fed insulin, LPS, or GEKP, similarly reduced the capacity of T cells from diabetic mice to transfer the disease (p < 0.01). It is concluded that oral treatment with human insulin to be used in human trials reduces the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice. Equivalent preventive efficacy was obtained through feedings with LPS or GEKP (even though no cumulative efficiency was observed with insulin). The latter results suggest that it would be advisable to evaluate the efficiency of oral bacterial antigens for the prevention of human Type 1 diabetes. The protection afforded by oral treatments with insulin or bacterial antigens may be attributed to cellular suppression, persists for some time after treatments are stopped, but is not resistant to major immune stimulation such as injection of CY."}

Accumulation of amyloid beta and mitochondrial dysfunction leads to oxidative stress. In this study, neuroprotective effect of Artemisiaamygdalina against H2O2-induced death was studied in differentiated N2a and SH-SY5Ycells. Cells were treated with H2O2 to induce toxicity which was attenuated by Artemisia amygdalina. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an emerging regulator of cellular resistance to oxidants. It controls the basal and induced expression of antioxidant response element-dependent genes. Further, we demonstrated that Artemisia amygdalina protects neurons through upregulation of Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential loss formed by H2O2 was attenuated by Artemisia amygdalina. Thus, Artemisia amygdalina may have the possibility to be a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer disease."}

With the identification of the ERM family protein NF2 as a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma, we investigated roles for other ERM proteins in this malignancy. Here, we report that overexpression of moesin occurs generally in high-grade glioblastoma in a pattern correlated with the stem cell marker CD44. Unlike NF2, moesin acts as an oncogene by increasing cell proliferation and stem cell neurosphere formation, with its ectopic overexpression sufficient to shorten survival in an orthotopic mouse model of glioblastoma. Moesin was the major ERM member activated by phosphorylation in glioblastoma cells, where it interacted and colocalized with CD44 in membrane protrusions. Increasing the levels of moesin competitively displaced NF2 from CD44, increasing CD44 expression in a positive feedback loop driven by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Therapeutic targeting of the moesin-CD44 interaction with the small-molecule inhibitor 7-cyanoquinocarcinol (DX-52-1) or with a CD44-mimetic peptide specifically reduced the proliferation of glioblastoma cells overexpressing moesin, where the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was activated.

To determine whether dendritic spine remodeling contributes to neuronal hyperexcitability and neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury, we analyzed dendritic spine morphology and functional influence in lamina IV-V dorsal horn neurons after sham, chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, and CCI treatment with NSC23766, a selective inhibitor of Rac1, which has been implicated in dendritic spine development. 10 days after CCI, spine density increased with mature, mushroom-shaped spines preferentially distributed along dendritic branch regions closer to the cell body. Because spine morphology is strongly correlated with synaptic function and transmission, we recorded the response of single units to innocuous and noxious peripheral stimuli and performed behavioral assays for tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Wide dynamic range dorsal horn neurons of CCI animals exhibited hyperexcitable responses to a range of stimuli. They also showed reduced nociceptive thresholds in the ipsilateral hind paw. 3-day treatment with NSC23766 significantly reduced post-CCI spine dimensions and densities, and attenuated injury-induced hyperexcitability. Drug treatment reduced behavioral measures of tactile allodynia, but not for thermal hyperalgesia. Together, our results demonstrate that peripheral nerve injury induces Rac1-regulated remodeling of dendritic spines on dorsal horn neurons, and suggest that this spine remodeling contributes to neuropathic pain."}

The production of reactive oxygen species has been shown to be increased in patients with diabetes. The possible sources for the overproduction of reactive oxygen species is widespread and include enzymatic pathways, autoxidation of glucose and the mitochondria. Increase in oxidative stress has clearly been shown to contribute to the pathology of vascular disease not only in diabetes but also in hypertension, stroke and ischemia. Since the etiology of diabetic neuropathy is considered to have a large vascular component, prevention of oxidative stress in diabetes is considered by many investigators to be a primary defense against the development of diabetic vascular disease.

Disruption of the Hh-signaling pathway in humans can lead to the spectral disorder of Holoprosencephaly (HPE), which is often characterized by a variety of craniofacial defects including midline facial clefting and cyclopia 12. Previous work has uncovered a role for Hh-signaling in zebrafish dorsal neurocranium patterning and chondrogenesis, however Hh-signaling mutants have not been described with respect to the ventral pharyngeal arch (PA) skeleton. Lipid-modified Hh-ligands require the transmembrane-spanning receptor Dispatched 1 (Disp1) for proper secretion from Hh-synthesizing cells to the extracellular field where they act on target cells. Here we study chameleon mutants, lacking a functional disp1(con/disp1).	con/disp1 mutants display reduced and dysmorphic mandibular and hyoid arch cartilages and lack all ceratobranchial cartilage elements. CNCC specification and migration into the PA primorida occurs normally in con/disp1 mutants, however disp1 is necessary for post-migratory CNCC patterning and differentiation. We show that disp1 is required for post-migratory CNCC to become properly patterned within the first arch, while the gene is dispensable for CNCC condensation and patterning in more posterior arches. Upon residing in well-formed pharyngeal epithelium, neural crest condensations in the posterior PA fail to maintain expression of two transcription factors essential for chondrogenesis, sox9a and dlx2a, yet continue to robustly express other neural crest markers. Histology reveals that posterior arch residing-CNCC differentiate into fibrous-connective tissue, rather than becoming chondrocytes. Treatments with Cyclopamine, to inhibit Hh-signaling at different developmental stages, show that Hh-signaling is required during gastrulation for normal patterning of CNCC in the first PA, and then during the late pharyngula stage, to promote CNCC chondrogenesis within the posterior arches. Further, loss of disp1 disrupted normal expression of bapx1 and gdf5, markers of jaw joint patterning, thus resulting in jaw joint defects in con/disp1 mutant animals.	This study reveals novel requirements for Hh-signaling in the zebrafish PA skeleton and highlights the functional diversity and differential sensitivity of craniofacial tissues to Hh-signaling throughout the face, a finding that may help to explain the spectrum of human facial phenotypes characteristic of HPE."}

Recent evidence suggests that rapamycin regulates T-cell differentiation. Herein, we tested whether administration of rapamycin could enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy utilizing Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Ad-Flt3L) and thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (Ad-TK/GCV). Using the refractory rat RG2 glioma model, we demonstrate that administration of rapamycin with Ad-Flt3L + Ad-TK/GCV immunotherapy enhanced the cytotoxic activity of antitumor CD8(+) T cells. Rats treated with rapamycin + Ad-Flt3L + Ad-TK/GCV exhibited massive reduction in the tumor volume and extended survival. Rapamycin administration also prolonged the survival of Ad-Flt3L + Ad-TK/GCV-treated GL26 tumor-bearing mice, associated with an increase in the frequency of tumor-specific and IFNγ(+) CD8(+) T cells. More importantly, rapamycin administration, even for a short interval, elicited a potent long-lasting central memory CD8(+) T-cell response. The enhanced memory response translated to an increased frequency of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells within the tumor and IFNγ release, providing the mice with long-term survival advantage in response to tumor rechallenge. Our data, therefore, point to rapamycin as an attractive adjuvant to be used in combination with immunotherapy in a phase I clinical trial for GBM."}

Incidence of IFIS and change in pupil size after IPH administration in those eyes of group 2 requiring IPH because of significant miosis or iris prolapse.	Signs of IFIS were observed in 88.09% of eyes in group 2. No signs of IFS were noted in group 1 (P < 0.001). Significant miosis, iris prolapse, or both occurred in 54.76% of eyes in group 2, although the condition was successfully reverted with IPH, with a significant increase in pupil size after IPH administration (from 4.77±0.88 mm to 6.68±0.93 mm; P=0.000). No intraoperative complications occurred. No significant differences in ECC, BCVA, or IOP were detected between IPH-treated and nontreated eyes.

Endogenous molecular systems regulating these inflammatory processes have recently been investigated to identify molecules that can potentially influence the course of the disease. These include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), PPARγ coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1α), and kynurenine pathway metabolites. Although all PPARs ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), recent evidence suggests that PPARα, PPARβ/δ agonists have less pronounced immunomodulatory effects and, along with PGC-1α, are not biomarkers of neuroinflammation in contrast to PPARγ. Small clinical trials with PPARγ agonists have been published with positive results. Proposed as immunomodulatory and neuroprotective, the therapeutic use of PGC-1α activation needs to be assessed in EAE/MS. The activation of indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism, plays crucial immunomodulatory roles. Indeed, Trp metabolites have therapeutic relevance in EAE and drugs with structural analogy to kynurenines, such as teriflunomide, are already approved for MS. Further studies are required to gain deeper knowledge of such endogenous immunomodulatory pathways with potential therapeutic implications in MS."}

Understanding the mechanisms underlying renal tubular epithelial cell survival is important for the prevention of kidney failure associated with glucotoxicity. Autophagy is a cellular pathway involved in protein and organelle degradation. It is associated with many types of cellular homeostasis and human diseases. To date, little is known of the association between high concentrations of glucose and autophagy in renal tubular cells. In the present study, we investigated high glucose-induced toxicity in renal tubular epithelial cells by means of several complementary assays, including cell viability, cell death assays and changes in ultrastructure in an immortalized human kidney cell line, HK-2 cells. The extent of apoptosis was significantly increased in the HK-2 cells following treatment with high levels of glucose. In addition, in in vivo experiments using diabetic rats, high glucose exerted harmful effects on the tissue structure of the kidneys in the diabetic rats. Chronic exposure of the HK-2 cells and tubular epithelial cells of nephritic rats to high levels of glucose induced autophagy. Liraglutide inhibited these effects; however, treatment witht a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP‑1R) antagonist enhanced these effects. Our results also indicated that the exposure of the renal tubular epithelial cells to high glucose concentrations in vitro led to the downregulation of GLP-1R expression. Liraglutide reversed this effect, while the GLP-1R antagonist promoted it, promoting autophagy, suggesting that liraglutide exerts a renoprotective effect in the presence of high glucose, at least in part, by inhibiting autophagy and increasing GLP-1R expression in the HK-2 cells and kidneys of diabetic rats."}

Glaucoma belongs to a group of optic neuropathies that is characterized by chronic degeneration of the optic nerve along with its supporting glia and vasculature. Despite significant advances in the field, there is no available cure for glaucoma. The trabecular meshwork has been implicated as the primary site for regulation of intraocular pressure, the only known modifiable factor in glaucoma development. In this review, we describe the current models for glaucoma studies, primary culture, anterior eye segments, and animal studies and their limitations. These models, especially anterior eye segments and animal tissues, often require careful interpretation given the inter-species variation and are cumbersome and expensive. The lack of an available in vitro 3D model to study trabecular meshwork cells and detailed mechanisms of their regulation of intraocular pressure has limited progress in the field of glaucoma research. In this paper, we review the current status of knowledge of the trabecular meshwork and how the current advances in tissue engineering techniques might be applied in an effort to engineer a synthetic trabecular meshwork as a 3D in vitro model to further advance glaucoma research. In addition, we describe strategies for selection and design of biomaterials for scaffold fabrication as well as extracellular matrix components to mimic and support the trabecular architecture. We also discuss possible uses for a bioengineered trabecular meshwork for both developing a fundamental understanding of trabecular meshwork biology as well as high-throughput screening of glaucoma drugs."}

In most patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) the CPG is undamaged. To date, there are no noninvasive approaches for activating the CPG. Recently we developed a noninvasive technique, tail nerve electrical stimulation (TANES), which can induce positive hind limb movement of SCI rats. The purpose of this study is to introduce the novel technique and examine the effect of TANES on CPG activation. A 25 mm contusion injury was produced at spinal cord T10 of female, adult Long-Evans rats by using the NYU impactor device. Rats received TANES (approximately 40 mA at 4 kHz) 7 weeks after injury. During TANES all injured rats demonstrated active body weight-supported stepping of hind limbs with left-right alternation and occasional front-hind coordination, resulting in significant, temporary increase in BBB scores (p<0.01). However, there is no response to TANES from rats with L2 transection, consistent with other reports that the CPG may be located at L1-2. S1 transection negatively implies the key role of TANES in CPG activation. The TANES not only renders paralyzed rats with a technique-induced ability to walk via activating CPG, but also is likely to be used for locomotor training. It has more beneficial effects for physical training over other training paradigms including treadmill training and invasive functional electrical stimulation. Therefore the TANES may have considerable potential for achieving improvement of functional recovery in animal models and a similar method may be suggested for human study."}

However, the neurological mechanism of berberine remains untapped in the light of its P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated gut efflux properties responsible for reduced bioavailability. Verapamil, a well known L-type calcium channel blocker, has additional inhibitory activity against P-gp efflux pump. Thus, there is a strong scientific rationale to explore the interaction of berberine with verapamil as a possible neuroprotective strategy.	The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of berberine, verapamil, and their combination on behavioral alterations, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and histopathological modifications in intracerebroventricular streptozocin (ICV-STZ)-induced sporadic dementia of Alzheimer's type in rats.	Single bilateral ICV-STZ (3 mg/kg) administration was used as an experimental model of sporadic dementia of Alzheimer's type.	Berberine (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, oral gavage) or verapamil (2.5 and 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) were used as treatment drugs, and memantine (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was used as a standard. Berberine and verapamil significantly attenuated behavioral, biochemical, cellular, and histological alterations, suggesting their neuroprotective potential. Further, treatment of berberine (25 and 50 mg/kg) with verapamil (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) combinations respectively significantly potentiated their neuroprotective effect which was significant as compared to their effect per se in ICV-STZ-treated animals.	The augmentative outcome of verapamil on the neuroprotective effect of berberine can be speculated due to the inhibition of P-gp efflux mechanism and the prevention of calcium homeostasis alteration. Additionally, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of both berberine and verapamil could also contribute in their protective effect."}

Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to balloon injury of the left common carotid artery and treated for 4 weeks with exendin-4 or vehicle. Intimal hyperplasia and vessel wall elasticity were monitored noninvasively by high-frequency ultrasound, and re-endothelialization was evaluated upon sacrifice using Evans blue dye.	Exendin-4 selectively reduced the proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and intimal hyperplasia in vivo without affecting the re-endothelialization process, but treatment with exendin-4 improved arterial wall elasticity. Our data also show that exendin-4 significantly decreased the proliferation and increased the apoptosis of SMCs in vitro, effects that appear to be mediated through cAMP signaling and endothelial nitric oxide synthase following GLP-1 receptor activation.

It is proposed that exogenous ACTH acts via negative feedback to suppress the synthesis of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a possible endogenous convulsant in infant brain tissue. The aim of this study was to determine whether systemic ACTH treatment in infant rats down-regulates the hippocampal CRH system, including CRH, CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP), and CRH receptors (CRH-R1 and CRH-R2). Daily i.p. injection of ACTH for 7 consecutive days (postnatal days 3-9) elevated serum corticosterone levels 20-fold measured on postnatal day 10, indicating systemic absorption and circulation of the ACTH. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR demonstrated that both CRH and CRH-BP mRNA obtained from the hippocampi of ACTH-injected infant rats was significantly depressed relative to saline-injected animals. Comparable reductions in both CRH and CRH-BP synthesis were further demonstrated with radioimmunoassay. In contrast, neither CRH-R1 nor CRH-R2 mRNA was altered by ACTH treatment, relative to saline-injected rats. This latter finding was confirmed electrophysiologically by measuring the enhancement of hippocampal population spikes by exogenous CRH, also showing no differences between ACTH- and saline-injected rats. The results of this study support the proposal that systemic ACTH treatment down-regulates CRH expression in infant brain, perhaps contributing to the therapeutic efficacy observed during treatment of infantile spasms."}

In line with the hypothesis, we found that PEGylation CoNps administration enhanced TH, DCX and MAP-2 expression in the hippocampus.

We investigated whether treatment with the heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) inducer, cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP), could modulate the local effects and expression of MOR, DOR, or CB2R during chronic inflammatory pain. In mice with inflammatory pain induced by the subplantar administration of complete Freund's adjuvant, we evaluated the effects of the intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg/kg CoPP on the antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic actions of locally administered MOR (morphine), DOR (DPDPE {[d-Pen(2),d-Pen(5)]-enkephalin}), or CB2R [JWH-015 {(2-methyl-1-propyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1-naphthalenylmethanone}] agonists and its reversion with the HO-1 inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP). The effect of CoPP treatment on the dorsal root ganglia expression of HO-1, MOR, DOR, and CB2R was also assessed.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether extracts from L. barbarum have neuroprotective effects against toxicity of fibrillar Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(25-35) fragments. Primary rat cortical neurons exposed to Abeta peptides resulted in apoptosis and necrosis. Pre-treatment with extract isolated from L. barbarum significantly reduced the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In addition, it attenuated Abeta peptide-activated caspases-3-like activity. The extract elicited a typical dose-dependent neuroprotective effect. Effective dosage of this extract was wider than that of a well-known western neuroprotective medicine lithium chloride (LiCl). We have further examined the underlying mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects. In agreement with other laboratories, Abeta peptides induce a rapid activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by phosphorylation. Pre-treatment of aqueous extract markedly reduced the phosphorylation of JNK-1 (Thr183/Tyr185) and its substrates c-Jun-I (Ser 73) and c-Jun-II (Ser 63).

Although considered an important target for therapeutic design, gamma-secretase has been neither well-characterized nor definitively identified. Previous studies in our laboratory using substrate-based difluoro ketone and difluoro alcohol transition-state analogue inhibitors suggest that gamma-secretase is an aspartyl protease with loose sequence specificity. To further characterize the active site of gamma-secretase, we prepared a series of difluoro ketone peptide analogues with varying steric bulkiness in the P1 position and tested the ability of these compounds to inhibit Abeta production in APP-transfected cells. Incorporation of bulky, aliphatic P1 side chains, such as sec-butyl or cyclohexylmethyl, led to increased gamma-secretase inhibitory potency, suggesting a large S1 pocket to accommodate these substituents and providing further evidence for loose sequence specificity. The cyclohexylmethyl P1 substituent allowed N-terminal truncation to a low-molecular-weight compound (<600 Da) that effectively blocked Abeta production (IC(50) approximately 5 microM). This finding suggests that optimal S1 binding may allow the development of potent inhibitors with ideal pharmaceutical properties.

We found increased G protein coupling for delta opioid receptor (DOR) and mu opioid, but not other Gi/o coupled receptors, in the striatum of Gpr88 knockout mice. We also found modifications in gene transcription, dopamine and serotonin contents, and dendritic morphology inside and outside the striatum. Behavioral testing confirmed striatal deficits (hyperactivity, stereotypies, motor impairment in rotarod). In addition, mutant mice performed better in spatial tasks dependent on hippocampus (Y-maze, novel object recognition, dual solution cross-maze) and also showed markedly reduced levels of anxiety (elevated plus maze, marble burying, novelty suppressed feeding). Strikingly, chronic blockade of DOR using naltrindole partially improved motor coordination and normalized spatial navigation and anxiety of Gpr88(-/-) mice.	We demonstrate that GPR88 is implicated in a large repertoire of behavioral responses that engage motor activity, spatial learning, and emotional processing. Our data also reveal functional antagonism between GPR88 and DOR activities in vivo. The therapeutic potential of GPR88 therefore extends to cognitive and anxiety disorders, possibly in interaction with other receptor systems."}

A possible therapeutic target for neuroprotection in peripheral nerve pathology.^\nDespite the favorable treatment of cranial nerve neuropathology in adulthood, some cases are resistant to therapy leading to permanent functional impairments. In many cases, suitable treatment is problematic as the therapeutic target remains unknown. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF-2) is involved in neuronal maintenance and wound repair following nervous system lesions. It is one of few neurotrophic molecules acting in autocrine, paracrine and intracrine fashions depending upon specific circumstances. Peripheral cranial somatic motor neurons, i.e. hypoglossal (XII) neurons, may offer a unique opportunity to study cellular FGF-2 mechanisms as the molecule is present in the cytoplasm of neurons and in the nuclei of astrocytes of the central nervous system. FGF-2 may trigger differential actions during development, maintenance and lesion of XII neurons because axotomy of those cells leads to cell death during neonatal ages, but not in adult life. Moreover, the modulatory effects of astroglial FGF-2 and the Ca+2-binding protein S100β have been postulated in paracrine mechanisms after neuronal lesions. In our study, adult Wistar rats received a unilateral crush or transection (with amputation of stumps) of XII nerve, and were sacrificed after 72h or 11 days. Brains were processed for immunohistochemical localization of neurofilaments (NF), with or without counterstaining for Nissl substance, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, as a marker of astrocytes), S100β and FGF-2. The number of Nissl-positive neurons of axotomized XII nucleus did not differ from controls. The NF immunoreactivity increased in the perikarya and decreased in the neuropil of axotomized XII neurons 11 days after nerve crush or transection. An astrocytic reaction was seen in the ipsilateral XII nucleus of the crushed or transected animals 72h and 11 days after the surgery. The nerve lesions did not change the number of FGF-2 neurons in the ipsilateral XII nucleus; however, the nerve transection increased the number of FGF-2 glial profiles by 72h and 11 days. Microdensitometric image analysis revealed a short lasting decrease in the intensity of FGF-2 immunoreactivity in axotomized XII neurons by 72h after nerve crush or transection and also an elevation of FGF-2 in the ipsilateral of glial nuclei by 72h and 11 days after the two lesions. S100β decreased in astrocytes of 11-day-transected XII nucleus. The two-color immunoperoxidase for the simultaneous detection of the GFAP/FGF-2 indicated FGF-2 upregulation in the nuclei of reactive astrocytes of the lesioned XII nucleus. Astroglial FGF-2 may exert paracrine trophic actions in mature axotomized XII neurons and might represent a therapeutic target for neuroprotection in peripheral nerve pathology."}

However, the anti-cholinergic and antispasmodic properties of 4-ethylamino-2-butynyl(2-cyclohexyl-2-phenyl)glycolate hydrochloride (N-desethyloxybutynin: DEOB), a metabolite of oxybutynin, have not been clarified. Therefore, in the present study, we studied these properties by using rat urinary bladder specimens in comparison with oxybutynin. Moreover, the effect of DEOB on rhythmic urinary bladder contraction was also evaluated using anesthetized rats. DEOB and oxybutynin concentration-dependently inhibited the carbachol-induced contraction, the pA(2) values being 7.19 and 7.11, respectively. DEOB and oxybutynin also concentration-dependently inhibited the 100 mM KCl-induced contraction, the ED(50) values being 12.1 and 10.4 microM, respectively. Intravenously administered DEOB and oxybutynin dose-dependently (0.03 - 0.3 mg/kg) inhibited the amplitude of the rhythmic bladder contraction to similar degrees, but had no affect on the frequency. From the above results, it was determined that DEOB has anti-cholinergic and antispasmodic properties and that these activities were almost equal to those of oxybutynin. Therefore, DEOB may play an important role during oxybutynin therapy for neurogenic bladder disorder."}

The SH3TC2 protein has been implicated in promyelination signaling through axonal neuregulin-1 and the ERBB2 Schwann cell receptor. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the SH3TC2 gene. We performed computational and functional analyses that revealed two cis-acting regulatory elements at SH3TC2-one at the promoter and one ∼150 kb downstream of the transcription start site. Both elements direct reporter gene expression in Schwann cells and are responsive to the transcription factor SOX10, which is essential for peripheral nervous system myelination. The downstream enhancer harbors a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that causes an ∼80% reduction in enhancer activity. The SNP resides directly within a predicted binding site for the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and we demonstrate that this regulatory element binds to CREB and is activated by CREB expression. Finally, forskolin induces Sh3tc2 expression in rat primary Schwann cells, indicating that SH3TC2 is a CREB target gene. These findings prompted us to determine if SNP genotypes at SH3TC2 are associated with differential phenotypes in the most common demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, CMT1A. Interestingly, this revealed several associations between SNP alleles and disease severity. In summary, our data indicate that SH3TC2 is regulated by the transcription factors CREB and SOX10, define a regulatory SNP at this disease-associated locus and reveal SH3TC2 as a candidate modifier locus of CMT disease phenotypes."}

Additionally, recent publications demonstrated that, differing from busulfan, treosulfan administration does not present severe organ or hemato toxicities. Currently, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients are treated with chronic immunosuppression for muscle precursor cell transplantation (MT). We have developed a safe tolerance approach within this cellular allotransplantation therapy background. Thus, we have conditioned, prior to a donor BALB/c MT, the dystrophic mouse model C57Bl10J mdx/mdx, with our treatment based on a donor-specific transfusion, then a treosulfan treatment combined with single cyclophosphamide dose, and finally a donor bone marrow transplantation (TTCB). A first MT was performed in all mixed chimeric mice resulting from the TTCB treatment in the left tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. A second MT from the same donor strain was performed 100 days later in the right TA without any additional therapy. Results show that all treated mice developed permanent mixed chimerism. Long-lasting donor-positive fibers were present in both TAs of the mice, which received MT after the TTCB treatment. Only a basal level of infiltration was observed around donor fibers and mixed chimeric mice rejected third-party haplotype skin grafts. Thus, mixed chimerism development with this TTCB conditioning regimen promotes donor-specific stable tolerance, avoiding costimulatory blockade antibodies or irradiation use and side effects of sustained immunosuppressive treatments. This protocol could be eventually applied for MT to DMD patients or others tissue transplantations."}

The present study was designed to observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment on spinal cytokines neurotrophic factors in chronic neuropathic pain rats. The chronic neuropathic pain was established by chronic constrictive injury (CCI). EA treatment was applied at Zusanli (ST36) and Yanglingquan (GB34) (both bilateral) once a day, for 30 min. IL-1β mRNA, TNF-α mRNA, and IL-1 mRNA were detected by quantitative real-time PCR, and the proteins of BDNF, NGF, and NT3/4 were detected by Western blot. The expression levels of cytokines such as IL-1β mRNA, TNF-α mRNA, IL-6 mRNA, and neurotrophic factors such as BDNF, NGF, and NT3/4 in the spinal cord were increased significantly after CCI. The astrocytes released more IL-1β and BDNF after CCI. Repeated EA treatment could suppress the elevated expression of IL-1β mRNA, TNFα mRNA, and BDNF, NGF, and NT3/4 but had no effect on IL-6 mRNA.

Recently its effects on neurotransmission and underlying mechanisms have generated interest. In the present study, we investigate the effects of PACAP on catecholamine storage and secretion in PC12 cells with amperometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). PACAP increases quantal release induced by high K+ without significantly regulating the frequency of vesicle fusion events. TEM data indicate that the increased volume of the vesicle is mainly the result of enlargement of the fluidic space around the dense core. Moreover, the number of docked vesicles isn't modulated by PACAP. When cells are acutely treated with L-DOPA, the vesicular volume and quantal release both increase dramatically. It is likely that the characteristics of amperometric spikes from L-DOPA treated cells are associated with increased volume of individual vesicles rather than a direct effect on the mechanics of exocytosis. Treatment with PACAP versus L-DOPA results in different profiles of the dynamics of exocytosis. Release via the fusion pore prior to full exocytosis was observed with the same frequency following treatment with PACAP and L-DOPA. However, release events have a shorter duration and higher average current after PACAP treatment compared to L-DOPA. Furthermore, PACAP reduced the proportion of spikes having rapid decay time and shortened the decay time of both fast and slow spikes. In contrast, the distributions of the amperometric spike decay for both fast and slow spikes were shifted to longer time following L-DOPA treatment. Compared to L-DOPA, PACAP may produce multiple favorable effects on dopaminergic neurons, including protecting dopaminergic neurons against neurodegeneration and potentially regulating dopamine storage and release, making it a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of PD."}

Supplement^\nDrug-enhanced spinal stimulation for pain: a new strategy.^\nNeuropathic pain is notoriously difficult to manage and only a few classes of drugs may provide adequate benefits. Thus, in many cases spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is considered; however, in this group of patients, between 30-50% of the cases offered a percutaneous SCS trial may fail to obtain a satisfactory effect. Additionally, a certain number of patients with a good initial effect, report that after a period the benefits are reduced necessitating additional peroral drug therapy. Based on animal studies of transmitters and receptors involved in the effects of SCS in neuropathic pain, the GABA-B receptor seems to play a pivotal role for the effect and, moreover, the agonist baclofen injected intrathecally in rats potentiated the SCS effect in animals not responsive to SCS per se. Based on these and further studies, 48 patients with neuropathic pain and inadequate response to SCS were given intrathecal (i.t.) baclofen (ITB) in bolus doses as an adjuvant. In this group 7 patients enjoyed such a good effect that they were implanted with both SCS and drug delivery systems for ITB. Four additional cases received baclofen pumps alone. Some other patients were given intrathecal (i.t.) adenosine in combination with SCS and initially preferred this to baclofen. The chronic use of this drug in a pump however proved to be technically problematic and all the adenosine cases were eventually terminated. At follow-ups, in average 32 and 67 months after start of SCS + baclofen therapy, more than 50% still enjoy a very good effect. The daily dose of baclofen needed to maintain the effects was approximately doubled during the observation period. There were few and mild side-effects. However, in a group of three patients with peroral baclofen therapy and SCS, complaints of side-effects were common and this therapy was terminated. Informal reports from collegues support the negative experience with additional peroral baclofen. In conclusion, in patients with neuropathic pain demonstrating inadequate response to SCS (small VAS reduction; short duration) a trial of intrathecal baclofen in combination with SCS may be warranted."}

A large lesion volume was produced in diabetic animals after 2-h MCAO and 24-h reperfusion. Diabetic animals also had an elevated basal level of apoptotic cells that are bilaterally distributed. Apoptosis was further increased over basal after 2-h MCAO and 24-h reperfusion. The acute administration of IGF-1 30-min before or 2 h after MCAO followed by 24-h reperfusion decreased the lesion volume as well as the number of apoptotic cells in the cortical penumbra.

During the last 2 decades, much evidence concerning the specific distribution patterns of XMET, their induction by xenobiotics and endobiotics and their genetic variations have made cerebral ABC transporters and CYP enzymes key elements in the way individual patients respond to centrally acting drugs."}
{"pmid": "22666178", "text": "PLoS biology^\nCommon features at the start of the neurodegeneration cascade.^\nAmyloidogenic neurodegenerative diseases are incurable conditions with high social impact that are typically caused by specific, largely disordered proteins. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive to established techniques. A favored hypothesis postulates that a critical conformational change in the monomer (an ideal therapeutic target) in these 'neurotoxic proteins' triggers the pathogenic cascade. We use force spectroscopy and a novel methodology for unequivocal single-molecule identification to demonstrate a rich conformational polymorphism in the monomer of four representative neurotoxic proteins. This polymorphism strongly correlates with amyloidogenesis and neurotoxicity: it is absent in a fibrillization-incompetent mutant, favored by familial-disease mutations and diminished by a surprisingly promiscuous inhibitor of the critical monomeric β-conformational change, neurotoxicity, and neurodegeneration. Hence, we postulate that specific mechanostable conformers are the cause of these diseases, representing important new early-diagnostic and therapeutic targets. The demonstrated ability to inhibit the conformational heterogeneity of these proteins by a single pharmacological agent reveals common features in the monomer and suggests a common pathway to diagnose, prevent, halt, or reverse multiple neurodegenerative diseases."}

The current experiment validated CBD's anticonvulsant effect using the acute pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) model. Furthermore, it tested whether CBD reduces seizure activity by interacting with either the serotonergic 5HT1A or 5HT2A receptor. 120 male adolescent Wistar-Kyoto rats were randomly assigned to 8 treatment groups in two consecutive experiments. In both experiments, subjects received either CBD (100mg/kg) or vehicle 60min prior to seizure testing. In Experiment 1, subjects received either WAY-100635 (1mg/kg), a 5HT1A antagonist, or saline vehicle injection 80min prior to seizure testing. In Experiment 2, subjects received either MDL-100907 (0.3mg/kg), a specific 5HT2A antagonist, or 40% DMSO vehicle 80min prior to seizure testing. 85mg/kg of PTZ was administered to induce seizure, and behavior was recorded for 30min. Seizure behaviors were subsequently coded using a 5-point scale of severity. Across both experiments, subjects in the vehicle control groups exhibited high levels of seizure activity and mortality. In both experiments, CBD treatment significantly attenuated seizure activity. Pre-treatment with either WAY-100635 or MDL-100907 did not block CBD's anticonvulsant effect. WAY-100635 administration, by itself, also led to a significant attenuation of seizure activity. These results do not support the hypothesis that CBD attenuates seizure activity through activation of the 5HT1A or 5HT2A receptor. While this work further confirms the anticonvulsant efficacy of CBD and supports its application in the treatment of human seizure disorders, additional research on CBD's mechanism of action must be conducted."}

Measurements during stimulation were compared with those at baseline for each patient.	While the VNS therapy pulse generator was delivering stimulation, the heart rates of four children increased significantly (p < 0.01), decreased for one child, and increased at the end of the stimulation for one child. The heart rates of four children did not change. Changes in heart rate varied during VNS, within stimulation cycles for individual children and from one child to another. Changes in heart rate differed between rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep states. Respiratory changes (increases in frequency and decreases in amplitude) were concomitant with the changes in heart rate.	In this case series of children with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, cardiorespiratory variations occurred while the VNS therapy pulse generator was delivering stimulation. Understanding these variations may allow further optimization of VNS parameters."}

This is of particular importance since the number of SGCs is considered to be among the factors defining the efficacy of cochlear implants. A device for local inner ear treatment is therefore of great interest. As described previously, we modified a Contour(TM) cochlear implant electrode, to examine the inbuilt canal to be used for fluid release [Paasche, G., Gibson, P., Averbeck, T., Becker, H., Lenarz, T., Stöver, T., 2003. Technical report: modification of a cochlear implant electrode for drug delivery to the inner ear. Otol. Neurotol. 24, 222-227]. In the present study, three different electrode prototypes with openings of the delivery channel at various locations along the electrode array were examined to determine distribution of dye in a cochlea model over time. We compared dye delivery with: (a) release of the dye at the tip, (b) release of the dye at the tip and the side of the electrode, and (c) release of the dye only at the side of the electrode (6 mm from the tip). A mechanical pump was used to drive the system at pump rates of 100, 10, and 1 microl/h. Dye concentration changes along the length of the whole cochlea were investigated. Mean values for all experimental conditions show that the distribution along the array is fastest with two outlets whereas the distribution via a single outlet at the side of the electrode array is not considered to be sufficient. The established experimental setup provides the possibility of investigating prototypes of a fluid based drug delivery system for the treatment of inner ear pathologies in combination with electrical stimulation."}

Cell physiology^\nRegulation of VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.^\nEndothelial migration is a crucial aspect of a variety of physiologic and pathologic conditions including atherosclerosis and vascular repair. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as second messengers during endothelial migration. Multiple intracellular sources of ROS are regulated by cellular context, external stimulus, and the microenvironment. However, the predominant source of ROS during endothelial cell (EC) migration and the mechanisms by which ROS regulate cell migration are incompletely understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondria-derived ROS (mtROS) regulate EC migration. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, VEGF increased mitochondrial metabolism, promoted mtROS production, and induced cell migration. Either the targeted mitochondrial delivery of the antioxidant, vitamin E (Mito-Vit-E), or the depletion of mitochondrial DNA abrogated VEGF-mediated mtROS production. Overexpression of mitochondrial catalase also inhibited VEGF-induced mitochondrial metabolism, Rac activation, and cell migration. Furthermore, these interventions suppressed VEGF-stimulated EC migration and blocked Rac1 activation in endothelial cells. Constitutively active Rac1 reversed Mito-Vit-E-induced inhibition of EC migration. Mito-Vit-E also attenuated carotid artery reendothelialization in vivo. These results provide strong evidence that mtROS regulate EC migration through Rac-1."}

FDG PET has shown that HIV-1 infection progresses by distinct anatomical steps, with involvement of the upper torso preceding involvement of the lower part of the torso, and that the degree of FDG uptake relates to viral load. The former finding suggests that lymphoid tissues are engaged in a predictable sequence and that diffusible mediators of activation might be important targets for vaccine or therapeutic intervention strategies. In lipodystrophic HIV-infected patients, limited available data support the hypothesis that stavudine-related lipodystrophy is associated with increased glucose uptake by adipose tissue as a result of the metabolic stress of adipose tissue in response to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). Finally, in early AIDS-related dementia complex (ADC), striatal hypermetabolism is observed, whereas progressive ADC is characterized by a decrease in subcortical and cortical metabolism. In the clinical setting, PET has been shown to allow the differentiation of AIDS-related opportunistic infections and malignancies, and to allow monitoring of side effects of HAART. However, in patients suffering from HIV infection and presenting with extracerebral lymphoma or other human malignancies, knowledge of viraemia is essential when interpreting FDG PET imaging."}

Structural/anatomic factors that constrict space for the soft tissues surrounding the pharynx and its lumen are crucial to the development of OSA in many patients. Enlargement of soft tissues enveloping the pharynx, including hypertrophied tonsils, adenoids, and tongue, is also an important factor predisposing to UA collapse, inasmuch as this can impinge on the pharyngeal lumen and narrow it during sleep. Other factors, including impairment of UA mechanoreceptor sensitivity and reflexes that maintain pharyngeal patency and respiratory control system instability, have also been identified as possible mechanisms facilitating UA instability. This suggests that OSA may be a heterogeneous disorder, rather than a single disease entity. Therefore, the extent to which various pathogenic factors contribute to the phenomenon of repetitive collapse of the UA during sleep probably varies from patient to patient. Further elucidation of specific pathogenic mechanisms in individuals with OSA may facilitate the development of new therapies that can be tailored to individual patient needs according to the underlying mechanism(s) of their disease."}

A nine-amino acid peptide derived from ADNF (Ser-Ala-Leu-Leu-Arg-Ser-Ile-Pro-Ala; ADNF-9) captured the activity of the parent protein and has been reported to protect cultured neurons from multiple neurotoxins. Antibodies recognizing ADNF-9 produced neuronal apoptosis, and identified an additional, structurally related, glia-derived peptide, Asn-Ala-Pro-Val-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln (NAP). Previous comparative studies have characterized s.c.-injected NAP as most efficacious in protecting against developmental retardation and learning impairments in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. This study was designed to assess 1) neuroprotection after intranasal administration of ADNF-9 and NAP to rats treated with the cholinotoxin ethylcholine aziridium; and 2) bioavailability and pharmacokinetics after intranasal administration. Results showed significant improvements in short-term spatial memory, as assessed in a water maze, after daily intranasal administration of 1 microg of peptide (ADNF-9 or NAP) per animal. However, a 5-day pretreatment with ADNF-9 did not improve performance measured after cessation of treatment. Compared with rats treated with ADNF-9, NAP-pretreated animals exhibited a significantly better performance. Furthermore, NAP (and not ADNF-9) protected against loss of choline acetyl transferase activity. Significant amounts of (3)H-labeled NAP reached the brain, remained intact 30 min after administration, and dissipated 60 min after administration. This study revealed efficacy for ADNF-related peptides in rodent models for neurodegeneration. The small size of the molecules, the low dosage required, the noninvasive administration route, and the demonstrated activity in a relevant paradigm suggest NAP as a lead compound for future drug design."}

This double-lumen multiorifice catheter was compared to a Bunegin-Albin multiorifice catheter for flow characteristics, air aspiration efficiency, and efficacy in resuscitating swine from a lethal VAE.	Flow characteristics of both catheters were determined by aspirating both agitated and unagitated citrated swine blood with a 50-ml syringe. Swine were anesthetized with halothane and positioned to approximate a modified sitting craniotomy position (45-degree elevation). By a random block method, 24 swine were assigned to either catheter (n = 12 each catheter) for the initial air aspiration. Catheters were positioned, using intravenous electrocardiography, with the distal aspiration orifice in the high right atrium. A 5-ml/kg air embolism was administered over 30 s into the sagittal sinus, and the swine were resuscitated by aspirating air through the multiorifice catheters and then positioning the swine horizontally. Surviving animals were allowed to recover for 60 min. The initial catheter was exchanged and repositioned in the high right atrium using intravenous electrocardiography. A 5-ml/kg air embolus was administered, and the swine were resuscitated as in the first challenge. Surviving swine recovered for 60 min, repositioned, and administered a third 5-ml/kg air embolism. On this final challenge, no attempt was made to resuscitate the animal by aspirating the multiorifice catheter.	Flow characteristics of both catheters were similar in the unagitated blood (195.3 +/- 1.9 vs. 196.7 +/- 2.5 ml/min). The flow rate of agitated blood through the double-lumen multiorifice catheter was 14% greater than through the Bunegin-Albin catheter (136.3 +/- 6.8 vs. 117 +/- 5.9 ml/min, P = 0.001). Forty-three air embolism trials were conducted at 5 ml/kg. All nine trials at 5 ml/kg without air aspiration resulted in death. Five animals died during the embolism dose determination trials, and four died during the third embolism challenge. The use of a multiorifice catheter for aspiration after a VAE enhanced survival after a 5-ml/kg sagittal sinus air embolus (14/34 vs. 0/9, P = 0.02). Although the double-lumen multiorifice catheter was more efficient than the Bunegin-Albin catheter in percentage of air retrieved (37.7 +/- 12.0 vs. 29.7 +/- 10.1, P = 0.042). Aspiration of the VAE with the double-lumen multiorifice catheter successfully rescued 9 of the 15 trials, and aspiration using the Bunegin-Albin catheter resuscitated 5 of the 19 (P = 0.08).	Multiorifice catheters are effective in resuscitating swine from a lethal VAE. The double-lumen multiorifice catheter evaluated aspirated a larger percentage of the VAE but was not statistically more effective than the Bunegin-Albin catheter in resuscitating the animals. Based on these findings of improved flow rate and efficiency in air aspiration, further investigation of this double-lumen multiorifice catheter is warranted."}

However, experience from a recent clinical trial of a candidate Abeta vaccine has suggested that it is important to develop techniques to induce high titer antibodies against Abeta associated with vaccine efficacy while reducing the T cell responses against Abeta that were potentially responsible for serious side effects. We have previously demonstrated that immunization with self- and foreign antigens arrayed in a repetitive fashion on the surface of virus-like particles (VLPs) induces high titer antibody responses at low doses and in the absence of potentially inflammatory adjuvants. In this study, we examined the antibody and T cell responses upon immunization with human papillomavirus VLP- and Qbeta bacteriophage-based Abeta vaccines. Immunization with Abeta conjugated to VLPs or Qbeta elicited anti-Abeta antibody responses at low doses and without the use of adjuvants. The flexibility of these virus-based display systems allowed us to link and induce antibodies against short Abeta-derived peptides from the amino- and carboxyl-termini of the peptide. Immunization of mice with Abeta peptide in combination with Freund's adjuvant elicited predominantly IgG2c antibodies and strong T cell proliferative responses against Abeta. In contrast, VLP-conjugated Abeta peptides elicited more balanced isotype responses, dominated by IgG1. Both VLP and Qbeta-based Abeta vaccines induced weak or negligible T cell responses against Abeta. T cell responses were largely directed against linked viral epitopes.

Peripheral administration of Ro 60-0175 (3 mg/kg ip) decreased EPN neuronal firing rate in 6-OHDA rats compared to sham-depleted rats. Such an effect was also observed when the agonist (0.2 μg/20 nl) was locally applied onto EPN neurons. These data demonstrate the contribution of EPN to hypersensitized responses to 5-HT agonists in a rat model of PD."}

It has been shown to be involved in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells and is a strong candidate as a biomarker for endocrine tumors, stroke, and eventually psychiatric conditions. Secretagogin has been hypothesized to exert a neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. The expression pattern of Secretagogin is not conserved from rodents to humans. We used brain tissue and primary neuronal cell cultures from rat to further characterize this CBP in rodents and to perform a few functional assays in vitro. Immunohistochemistry on rat brain slices revealed a high density of Secretagogin-positive cells in distinct brain regions. Secretagogin was found in the cytosol or associated with subcellular compartments. We tested primary neuronal cultures for their suitability as model systems to further investigate functional properties of Secretagogin. These cultures can easily be manipulated by treatment with drugs or by transfection with test constructs interfering with signaling cascades that might be linked to the cellular function of Secretagogin. We show that, like in pancreatic beta cells and insulinoma cell lines, also in neurons the expression level of Secretagogin is dependent on extracellular insulin and glucose. Further, we show also for rat brain neuronal tissue that Secretagogin interacts with the microtubule-associated protein Tau and that this interaction is dependent on Ca(2+). Future studies should aim to study in further detail the molecular properties and function of Secretagogin in individual neuronal cell types, in particular the subcellular localization and trafficking of this protein and a possible active secretion by neurons."}

Progesterone receptor (PR) expression and mifepristone treatment was highly discussed for meningiomas. However, much less is known in regard to progesterone actions in gliomas despite PR expression strongly correlates with their grade. Meningiomas and gliomas may grow faster during gestation; but paradoxically, parousity reduces lifetime risk of gliomas which can be explained with dichotomous cell growth-stimulating and inhibitory actions of progesterone at low versus high levels. Progesterone levels gradually increase in gestation up to 200-fold and the incidence of highly angiogenic brain tumors decreases in the last trimester. Indeed, progesterone stimulates glial tumor cell growth at low doses (10 nM) while induces cell kill at higher doses. During gestation, some immune pathways are activated to protect the mother and the fetus against microbial pathogens. In parallel, high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) used in treatment of endometrial carcinoma decreases tumoral expression of PR-B and increases infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. MPA also synergies with IL-2 in clinical treatment of renal cancer. In both glioma and meningioma, the dominant cytosolic PR is PR-B which increases cell growth, while PR-A limits cell growth. This seems also paradoxical at the first glance due to opposite behavior of these tumors in diverse endocrine conditions. High-dose progestins may inhibit brain tumor growth by downregulating PR-B, yet the dosage thresholds may differ between glial and meningeal tumors due to higher total PR expression in meningiomas. Supporting this proposal, certain progestins were reported to stimulate meningioma growth in anecdotal reports, but same agents at much higher doses reduced meningioma cell proliferation in pilot clinical studies. PR antagonist mifepristone reduced meningioma growth in some clinical studies, but lacked efficacy in others. In fact, mifepristone also has partial PR agonist efficacy and acts in synergy with MPA to block EC growth. Hence, a similar mechanism of receptor downregulation may also account for mifepristone. Both MPA and mifepristone also harbor myeloprotective features against chemotherapy. Ulipristal is another contraceptive PR antagonist and exerts promising anticancer activity on drug-resistant ovarian cancer and BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells, which can be tested in animal glioblastoma models. We propose that progestins strongly deserve to be investigated in experimental models of glioblastoma alone and in combination with immunostimulating agents."}

The pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the brain damage in these patients are virtually unknown. However, they may be due to the neurotoxic actions of EMA. Therefore, in the present work we investigated whether chronic exposure of EMA during early development (from 5th to 28th day of life) could alter the behavioral performance of adult rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) and elevated plus maze tasks. Control rats were treated with saline in the same volumes. We observed that adult rats pretreated with EMA presented impairment in the learning and memory in water maze task spending significantly less time in the training quadrant. However, chronic EMA administration did not affect rat performance in the elevated plus maze tasks, suggesting that anxiety-like behavior was not changed by EMA. We also evaluated the in vitro effect of EMA on lipoperoxidation and on creatine kinase (CK) activity in rat hippocampus and observed that this metabolite induced lipid peroxidation and diminished creatine kinase activity. The results provide evidence that early chronic EMA treatment induces long-lasting spatial behavioral deficit that may be possibly related to a secondary bioenergetics dysfunction and/or increase of free radical production caused by this organic acid."}

Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms driving invasion may lead to the development of improved therapies for glioblastoma patients. Here, we investigated the role of procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2), an enzyme catalyzing collagen cross-linking, in the biology of glioblastoma invasion. PLOD2 mRNA was significantly overexpressed in glioblastoma compared to low-grade tumors based on the Oncomine datasets and REMBRANDT database for human gliomas. Kaplan-Meier estimates based on the TCGA dataset demonstrated that high PLOD2 expression was associated with poor prognosis. In vitro, hypoxia upregulated PLOD2 protein in U87 and U251 human glioma cell lines. siRNA knockdown of endogenous HIF-1α or treatment of cells with the HIF-1α inhibitor PX-478 largely abolished the hypoxia-mediated PLOD2 upregulation. Knockdown of PLOD2 in glioma cell lines led to decreases in migration and invasion under normoxia and hypoxia. In addition, levels of phosphorylated FAK (Tyr 397), an important kinase mediating cell adhesion, were reduced in U87-shPLOD2 and U251-shPLOD2 cells, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Finally, orthotopic U251-shPLOD2 xenografts were circumscribed rather than locally invasive. In conclusion, the results indicated that PLOD2 was a gene of clinical relevance with implications in glioblastoma invasion and treatment strategies."}

At the centrosome core are a pair of centrioles, structures that act as the duplicating elements of this organelle. Centrioles function to recruit and organize pericentriolar material which nucleates microtubules. While centrioles are relatively simple in construction, the mechanics of centriole biogenesis remain an important yet poorly understood process. More mysterious still are the regulatory mechanisms that oversee centriole assembly. The fidelity of centriole duplication is critical as defects in either the assembly or number of centrioles promote aneuploidy, primary microcephaly, birth defects, ciliopathies and tumorigenesis. In addition, some pathogens employ mechanisms to promote centriole overduplication to the detriment of the host cell.

Cells were incubated with 1 microM of insoluble CT105 aggregates or aged A beta1-40 peptide deposits which were mainly composed of stable monomeric and dimeric forms as assessed on Western blots. The levels of mRNAs were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Highest levels of both IL-1beta and IL-6 transcripts were detected in the culture exposed to CT105 aggregates for 4 days. CT105 aggregates markedly increased IL-1beta mRNA level by 3.5 fold of the control level and this effect was more potent than that produced by aged A beta1-40 peptides. Furthermore, CT105 strongly induced accumulation of IL-6 mRNA level by 2 fold of the value potentiated by A beta1-40. Such induction was not observed with A beta 12-28 treatment. On the other hand, CT105 did not significantly alter either APP or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA levels. These results together imply that CT peptide besides its cytotoxic potency may act as a potent immunological component, strongly inducing both IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA levels in the cultured glial cells. This CT peptide associated exacerbation of cytokine expression may be in part responsible for chronic inflammation linked to slowly progressive neurodegeneration characteristic to AD."}

The main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of an altered ambiance in utero, on the development of thirst mechanisms in the offspring. Female rats underwent a partial ligature of the aorta (PAL), which induces an intrinsic activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), thirst and sodium appetite. A second group of female rats was treated with desoxycorticosterone (DOCA) which depresses the RAS. The offspring of these two groups were tested for their responses to several thirst stimuli at 2, 4 and 6 days of age. The offspring from PAL mothers responded like their controls to cellular dehydration (NaCl hypertonic injection) at 2 days of age, and also did to extracellular dehydration by polyethyleneglycol at 4 days. Nevertheless, they responded more to isoproterenol at 6 days of age in comparison to their control group. The offspring from DOCA treated mothers did not show statistically significant responses (in comparison with vehicle injected pups) to hypertonic NaCl at two days nor to polyethyleneglycol at four days. Water intake at 6 days of age after isoproterenol administration in DOCA was statistically enhanced, but not differently from the response obtained from pseudo-DOCA treated pups. In particular, rats developed in a hypereninemic ambiance (O-PAL) during gestation, responded with higher water intake when treated with a strong RAS and thirst activator (isoproterenol) but responded normally to a more gentle and complex stimulus (PG). Therefore it seems that in utero conditions can determine the chronology and intensity of thirst responses in offspring."}

This state causes tissue damage in the blood vessels, heart, kidneys, retina and nerves through copper-mediated oxidative stress. This author now considers this copper-overload state to provide an important new target for therapeutic intervention, the objective of which is to prevent or reverse the diabetic complications. Triethylenetetramine (TETA) has recently been identified as the first in a new class of anti-diabetic molecules through the original work reviewed here, thus providing a new use for this molecule, which was previously approved by the US FDA in 1985 as a second-line treatment for Wilson's disease. TETA acts as a highly selective divalent copper (Cu(II)) chelator that prevents or reverses diabetic copper overload, thereby suppressing oxidative stress. TETA treatment of diabetic animals and patients has identified and quantified the interlinked defects in copper metabolism that characterize this systemic copper overload state. Copper overload in diabetes mellitus differs from that in Wilson's disease through differences in their respective causative molecular mechanisms, and resulting differences in tissue localization and behaviour of the excess copper. Elevated pathogenetic tissue binding of copper occurs in diabetes. It may well be mediated by advanced-glycation endproduct (AGE) modification of susceptible amino-acid residues in long-lived fibrous proteins, for example, connective tissue collagens in locations such as blood vessel walls. These AGE modifications can act as localized, fixed endogenous chelators that increase the chelatable-copper content of organs such as the heart and kidneys by binding excessive amounts of catalytically active Cu(II) in specific vascular beds, thereby focusing the related copper-mediated oxidative stress in susceptible tissues. In this review, summarized evidence from our clinical studies in healthy volunteers and diabetic patients with left-ventricular hypertrophy, and from nonclinical models of diabetic cardiac, arterial, renal and neural disease is used to construct descriptions of the mechanisms by which TETA treatment prevents injury and regenerates damaged organs. Our recent phase II proof-of-principle studies in patients with type 2 diabetes and in nonclinical models of diabetes have helped to define the pathogenetic defects in copper regulation, and have shown that they are reversible by TETA. The drug tightly binds and extracts excess systemic Cu(II) into the urine whilst neutralizing its catalytic activity, but does not cause systemic copper deficiency, even after prolonged use. Its physicochemical properties, which are pivotal for its safety and efficacy, clearly differentiate it from all other clinically available transition metal chelators, including D-penicillamine, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and clioquinol. The studies reviewed here show that TETA treatment is generally effective in preventing or reversing diabetic organ damage, and support its ongoing development as a new medicine for diabetes. Trientine (TETA dihydrochloride) has been used since the mid-1980s as a second-line treatment for Wilson's disease, and our recent clinical studies have reinforced the impression that it is likely to be safe for long-term use in patients with diabetes and related metabolic disorders. There is substantive evidence to support the view that diabetes shares many pathogenetic mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Indeed, the close epidemiological and molecular linkages between them point to Alzheimer's disease/vascular dementia as a further therapeutic target where experimental pharmacotherapy with TETA could well find further clinical application."}

The mice were subsequently treated with rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. The rhodopsin mRNA and protein expression level in the retina and the photoreceptor outer segment (OS) length in immunohistochemical stainings were measured, and visual function was recorded by electroretinography. Inflammatory cytokines, their related molecules, mTOR, and LC3 levels were measured by real-time PCR and/or immunoblotting. Leukocyte adhesion during inflammation was analyzed using concanavalin A lectin.	The post-transcriptional reduction in the visual pigment of rod photoreceptor cells, rhodopsin, OS shortening, and rod photoreceptor cell dysfunction during inflammation were suppressed by rapamycin. Activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and induction of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and the activation of the downstream signaling protein, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which reduces rhodopsin in the retina during inflammation, were attenuated by rapamycin. Increased leukocyte adhesion was also attenuated by rapamycin. Interestingly, although mTOR activation was observed after NF-κB activation, mTOR inhibition suppressed NF-κB activation at the early phase, indicating that the basal level of activated mTOR was sufficient to activate NF-κB in the retina. In addition, the inhibition of NF-κB suppressed mTOR activation, suggesting a positive feedback loop of mTOR and NF-κB during inflammation. The ratio of LC3II to LC3I, which reflects autophagy induction, was not changed by inflammation but was increased by rapamycin.	Our results propose the potential use of rapamycin as a neuroprotective therapy to suppress local activated mTOR levels, related inflammatory molecules, and the subsequent visual dysfunction during retinal inflammation."}

Piperine (PIP) is a Chinese medicine with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of PIP on rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in SK-N-SH cells, primary rat cortical neurons, and in a mouse model. Mice were administered rotenone (10mg/kg) for 6 weeks; PIP (25mg/kg, 50mg/kg) was subsequently administered for 4 weeks. We found that PIP treatment attenuated rotenone-induced motor deficits, and rescued the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. PIP increased cell viability and restored mitochondrial functioning in SK-N-SH cells and primary neurons. In addition, PIP induced autophagy by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1(mTORC1) via activation of protein phosphotase 2A (PP2A). However, inhibiting PP2A activity with okadaic acid reduced these protective effects, suggesting that PP2A is a target of PIP. These findings demonstrate that PIP exerts neuroprotective effects in PD models via induction of autophagy, and may be an effective agent for PD treatment."}

The nuclei were strongly acidophilic in the presence of a high concentration of DNA (strong Feulgen reaction), and acidophilia could not be induced in normal neuronal nuclei by chemical extraction of nucleic acids. The cytoplasmic acidophilia of degenerating hippocampal neurons was due to a protein rich in lysine (extinguished by alkalinity, easily prevented by deamination, and unaffected by benzil). Stainable RNA was absent from the perikarya of the affected cells, but normal neuronal cytoplasm did not become acidophilic after extraction of nucleic acids. We suggest that kainate-induced cell death is preceded by increased production of basic proteins, which become concentrated in the nucleus and perikaryon.

Despite the recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, ROP remains a major cause of childhood blindness in developed countries. The etiology of pathogenesis of advanced ROP is currently unknown. In the past, many causative factors such as length of time exposed to supplemental oxygen, excessive ambient light exposure and hypoxia have been suggested but evidence for these as independent risk factors in recent years is not compelling. It is not clear why ROP in a subset of infants with low birth-weight progresses to a severe stage (retinal detachment) despite timely intervention whereas in other infants with similar clinical characteristics ROP regresses spontaneously. Recent research with candidate gene approach, higher concordance rate in monozygotic twins and other clinical and experimental animal studies, suggest a strong genetic predisposition to ROP besides environmental factors such as prematurity. Three genes, which are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, are mutated in both FEVR and in a small percentage of ROP disorder. However, none of the genetic factors identified thus far in ROP, account for a substantial number of patient population. Future studies involving genomics, bioinformatics and proteomics may provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology and management of ROP."}

Elucidating the assembly pathways of these specific aggregates is essential for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing knowledge-based therapies. However, these assemblies cannot be monitored in vivo, and there has been no reliable in vitro monitoring method at low protein concentration. We have developed a highly sensitive in vitro monitoring method using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and toxicity assays. Using Aβ labeled at the N terminus or Lys(16), we uncovered two distinct assembly pathways. One leads to highly toxic 10-15-nm spherical Aβ assemblies, termed amylospheroids (ASPDs). The other leads to fibrils. The first step in ASPD formation is trimerization. ASPDs of ∼330 kDa in mass form from these trimers after 5 h of slow rotation. Up to at least 24 h, ASPDs remain the dominant structures in assembly reactions. Neurotoxicity studies reveal that the most toxic ASPDs are ∼128 kDa (∼32-mers). In contrast, fibrillogenesis begins with dimer formation and then proceeds to formation of 15-40-nm spherical intermediates, from which fibrils originate after 15 h. Unlike ASPD formation, the Lys(16)-labeled peptide disturbed fibril formation because the Aβ(16-20) region is critical for this final step. These differences in the assembly pathways clearly indicated that ASPDs are not fibril precursors. The method we have developed should facilitate identifying Aβ assembly steps at which inhibition may be beneficial."}

The mechanisms how exogenous ubiquitin exerts these effects remain unclear. Some studies revealed ubiquitin's immune modulatory abilities; therefore, we hypothesized that ubiquitin influences the local innate inflammatory response after CCII.	Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to CCII and randomized to either 1.5 mg/kg ubiquitin or 0.9% NaCl intravenously within 5 minutes after CCII. Immune cells were immunohistochemically stained with OX-42, myeloperoxidase (MPO), HIS48, ED1, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Apoptosis was analyzed by using terminal desoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) were quantified using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR).	ED1-positive cells were significantly increased in the pericontusional cortex after ubiquitin treatment at day 7 (823±182 cells/mm² vs. 550±246 cells/mm²; p=0.04). IL-10 expression after 3 days was significantly lower in the verum group (1.065¹⁰⁻⁵±0.6093¹⁰⁻⁵ vs. 2.266¹⁰⁻⁵±1.244¹⁰⁻⁵ relative messenger RNA expression; p=0.04) and TNF-α-levels tended to be higher in the verum group (22.01¹⁰⁻⁵±10.87¹⁰⁻⁵ vs. 9.34¹⁰⁻⁵±4.44¹⁰⁻⁵ relative messenger RNA; p=0.096). Quantification of apoptotic cells did not differ between the groups.	Exogenous ubiquitin modulates the immune response by influencing the infiltration of macrophages or activated microglia and the expression of IL-10 and possibly TNF-α after CCII.

However, since it has yet to be explored whether NPY affects GH secretion in acromegaly in vivo, in this study we attempted to examine the effect of intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of 100 microg of human NPY on plasma GH levels in 15 patients with active acromegaly, trying to find a possible correlation among GH responses to NPY, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH;500 microg, i.v.), luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH;100 microg, i.v.), and bromocriptine (Br;2.5 mg, per os). NPY significantly increased GH secretion (more than twice the basal level) in 4 (27%) patients, and all of them were responsive to LHRH and non-responsive to Br. In contrast, 3 (20%) acromegalics showed a significant decrease in GH levels (less than half the baseline) after NPY, and all these patients were responsive to both TRH and Br. From these results, we hypothesize that the NPY-induced increase in GH release may be a feature of somatotroph-like pituitary adenoma causing acromegaly, whereas the NPY-induced decrease in GH secretion may be a feature of lactotroph-like adenoma."}

Prevailing evidence suggests that abnormal autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction participate in the process of PD. However, many damages of neuronal functions are regulated by intracellular Ca[2+] signaling and the contribution of mitochondrial Ca[2+] to the process of neurodegeneration is still unclear. MPP[+], the metabolite of a neurotoxin MPTP, causes symptom of PD in animal models by selectively destroying dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. Here we report that mitochondrial Ca[2+] uniporter (MCU) participated in MPP[+]-induced autophagic cell death in SH-SY5Y cells. Pharmacological agonist of MCU or exogenous expressed MCU can partially reduce MPP[+]-induced autophagic cell death. Down-regulation of MCU enhanced autophagic cell death via AMPK activation, which was independent of Beclin1 and PI3K. These findings show that the mitochondrial calcium dyshomeostasis contributes to MPP[+]-induced neuronal degeneration, and MCU may be a potential therapeutic target of PD through the prevention of pathological autophagy."}

Most studies on glia and pain focused on the potential detrimental role of glial cells following noxious stimulus/insults manifested as an 'activation' or a 'reactive' state (increase in glial marker expression and production of proinflammatory/nociceptive molecules). Therefore, 'activated' or 'reactive' glial cells became a target for the future generation of drugs to treat chronic pain. Several glial modulators that reduce the activation of glial cells have shown great efficacy in multiple animal (rodents mostly) models of pain (acute, subacute, chronic, inflammatory, neuropathic, surgical, etc.). These encouraging findings inspired clinical trials that have been completed in the last 5 years. Unfortunately, all clinical trials with these glial modulators have failed to demonstrate efficacy for the treatment of pain. New lines of investigation and elegant experimental designs are shedding light on alternative glial functions, which demonstrate that 'glial reactivity' is not necessarily deleterious in some pathological conditions. New strategies to validate findings through our current animal models are necessary to enhance the translational value of our preclinical studies. Also, more studies using human subjects would enhance our understanding of glial cells in the context of pain. This chapter explores the available literature to objectively ponder the potential role of glial cells in human pain conditions."}

In the present study the effectiveness of a complementary peptide designed to inhibit the PGP chemoattractants (arginine-threonine-arginine [RTR] tetrameric peptide) and an apo A-1 mimicking peptide (5F) was investigated in the alkali-injured rabbit eye.	(L)-RTR tetramer, (D)-RTR tetramer, and 5F were tested in vitro for their effects on neutrophil polarization. Synthetic 5F was also tested in vitro for its effect on the neutrophil respiratory burst. In the alkali-injured rabbit eye model, the right corneas of 48 rabbits were exposed to 1 N NaOH for 35 seconds. Sixteen animals were randomly assigned to each of three groups: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control; 800 microM RTR (dextrorotatory) tetramer in PBS alternating each hour with 1.5 mM RTR (levorotatory) tetramer in PBS; and 12 microM 5F in PBS. One topical drop of each substance was administered hourly (14 times per day) for 33 days. The experiment was continued until day 42 with no additional drops administered.	(L)-RTR tetramer and (D)-RTR tetramer inhibited neutrophil polarization activated by the PGP chemoattractants in vitro. Synthetic 5F did not inhibit neutrophil polarization in the presence of Ac-PGP or the respiratory burst of neutrophils in the presence of a metabolic stimulant derived from alkali-degraded corneas. During the entire animal experiment, statistically fewer ulcers occurred in the RTR tetramer group than in the PBS control group (43.8% vs. 87.5%, P = 0.0046). The frequency of ulceration in the 5F group (68.8%) was not significantly different from the PBS control group.	The reduction in the frequency of corneal ulceration by the RTR tetramer possibly resulted from its complementary binding to Ac-PGP and Me-PGP in the cornea shortly after alkali injury, leading to a reduction in the early and late infiltration of neutrophils. RTR tetramer appears to hold enough promise to warrant additional study as a therapeutic drug for the alkali-injured eye."}
{"pmid": "16379585", "text": "Journal of neurotrauma^\nElectrical stimulation of the vagus nerve enhances cognitive and motor recovery following moderate fluid percussion injury in the rat.^\nIntermittent, chronically delivered electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (VNS) is an FDA-approved procedure for the treatment of refractory complex/partial epilepsy in humans. Stimulation of the vagus has also been shown to enhance memory storage processes in laboratory rats and human subjects. Recent evidence suggests that some of these effects of VNS may be due to the activation of neurons in the nucleus locus coeruleus resulting in the release of norepinephrine (NE) throughout the neuraxis. Because antagonism of NE systems has been shown to delay recovery of function following brain damage, it is possible that enhanced release of NE in the CNS may facilitate recovery of function. To evaluate this hypothesis the lateral fluid percussion injury (LFP) model of traumatic brain injury was used and a variety of motor and cognitive behavioral tests were employed to assess recovery in pre-trained stimulated, control, and sham-injured laboratory rats. Two hours following moderate LFP, vagus nerve stimulation (30.0-sec trains of 0.5 mA, 20.0 Hz, biphasic pulses) was initiated. Stimulation continued in each animal's home cage at 30-min intervals for a period of 14 days, with the exception of brief periods when the animals were disconnected for behavioral assessments. Motor behaviors were evaluated every other day following LFP and tests included beam walk, locomotor placing, and skilled forelimb reaching. In each measure an enhanced rate of recovery and /or level of final performance was observed in the VNS-LFP animals compared to nonstimulated LFP controls. Behavior in the Morris water maze was assessed on days 11-14 following injury. Stimulated LFP animals showed significantly shorter latencies to find the hidden platform than did controls. Despite these behavioral effects, neurohistological examination did not reveal significant differences in lesion extent, density of fluorojade positive neurons, reactive astrocytes or numbers of spared neurons in the CA3 subarea of the hippocampus, at least at the one time point studied 15 days post-injury. These results support the idea that vagus nerve stimulation enhances the neural plasticity that underlies recovery of function following brain damage and provides indirect support for the hypothesis that enhanced NE release may mediate the effect. Importantly, since VNS facilitated both the rate of recovery and the extent of motor and cognitive recovery, these findings suggest that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve may prove to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment for traumatic brain injury."}

The neuronal isoform (NOS-I, encoded by NOS1) is the main source of NO in the central nervous system (CNS). Animal studies suggest that nitrinergic dysregulation may lead to behavioral abnormalities. Unfortunately, the large number of animal studies is not adequately reflected by publications concerning humans. These include post-mortem studies, determination of biomarkers, and genetic association studies. Here, we review the evidence for the role of NO in psychiatric disorders by focusing on the human NOS1 gene as well as biomarker studies. Owing to the complex regulation of NOS1 and the varying function of NOS-I in different brain regions, no simple, unidirectional association is expected. Rather, the 'where, when and how much' of NO formation is decisive. Present data, although still preliminary and partially conflicting, suggest that genetically driven reduced NO signaling in the prefrontal cortex is associated with schizophrenia and cognition. Both NOS1 and its interaction partner NOS1AP have a role therein. Also, reduced NOS1 expression in the striatum determined by a length polymorphism in a NOS1 promoter (NOS1 ex1f-VNTR) goes along with a variety of impulsive behaviors. An association of NOS1 with mood disorders, suggested by animal models, is less clear on the genetic level; however, NO metabolites in blood may serve as biomarkers for major depression and bipolar disorder. As the nitrinergic system comprises a relevant target for pharmacological interventions, further studies are warranted not only to elucidate the pathophysiology of mental disorders, but also to evaluate NO function as a biomarker."}

This virus is the aetiological agent of West Nile fever, which has recently emerged in the western hemisphere. The rapid spread of WNV throughout North America, as well as the constantly changing epidemiology and transmission of the virus by blood transfusion and transplantation, have raised major public-health concerns. Currently, there are no effective treatments for WNV or vaccine for human use. We previously identified a novel, continuous B-cell epitope from domain III of the WNV envelope protein, termed Ep15. To test whether this epitope can protect against WNV infection, we synthesized a linear chimeric peptide composed of Ep15 and the heat-shock protein 60 peptide, p458. The p458 peptide is an effective carrier peptide for subunit vaccines against other infectious agents. We now report that mice immunized with the chimeric peptide, p458-Ep15, were resistant to lethal challenges with three different WNV strains. Moreover, their brains were free of viral genome and infectious virus. Mice immunized with Ep15 alone or with p431-Ep15, a control conjugate, were not protected. The chimeric p458-Ep15 peptide induced WNV-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies that neutralized the virus and induced the secretion of interferon-gammain vitro. Challenge of chimeric peptide-immunized mice considerably enhanced WNV-specific neutralizing antibodies. We conclude that this chimeric peptide can be used for formulation of a human vaccine against WNV."}

However, what is not known is the effect of either antagonist on behavioral outcome. Therefore, this work was designed to test the effects of endothelin receptor A and B antagonism on behavioral outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI).	A total of 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats (400-450 g) were used in this study. Four groups (n = 12 per group) were generated as follows: sham operation, trauma+vehicle (0·9% saline), trauma+40 nmol BQ-123 (a selective endothelin receptor A antagonist) and trauma +20 nmol BQ-788 (a selective endothelin receptor B antagonist). All treatments were delivered via intracerebroventricular injection. Trauma was induced using a weight acceleration impact device. Twenty-four hours post-injection animals were tested for 21 days on a radial arm maze task to determine cognitive outcome.	Our data indicated that endothelin receptor A antagonism significantly reduced the extent of behavioral deficits following TBI while endothelin receptor B and vehicle injection had no effect.

It remains unclear how and why the electroencephalographic (EEG) states that constitute SWS might predispose the HPC to this type of pathological activity. Recently our laboratory has described a novel state of deactivated hippocampal EEG activity that occurs during both SWS and urethan anesthesia: the slow oscillation (SO). This activity is characterized by a high-amplitude approximately 1-Hz signal, high synchrony within the hippocampus, and a dynamic coordination with neocortical SO. To assess how this activity state might influence epileptiform discharges, we studied the properties of stimulation-evoked and spontaneous epileptiform events elicited in the HPC of urethan-anesthetized rats. We compared those elicited during the SO to those occurring during the theta rhythm. The average duration but not the amplitude of evoked afterdischarges (ADs) was consistently larger during the SO. In addition, spontaneous epileptiform events were more frequent and of higher amplitude during the SO. Last, the bilateral propagation of both ADs and spontaneous events in the hippocampus was enhanced during the SO. These results imply that the threshold for the generation and propagation of epileptiform activity in the hippocampus is lowered during the SO and that this state may be a seed for the initiation, maintenance, and generalization of MTL epilepsy. Further examination of the pathophysiology of sleep-epilepsy interactions in the HPC will be of benefit for an understanding of the mechanisms, prognosis, and therapy for this form of epilepsy."}

We discuss here the potential of antisense-mediated RNA targeting approaches. We mainly focus on those that manipulate splicing (exon skipping and exon inclusion), but will also briefly discuss mRNA targeting. Classic knockdown of expression by mRNA targeting is only one possible application of antisense oligonucleotides (AON) in the control of gene function. Exon skipping and inclusion are based on the interference of AONs with splicing of pre-mRNAs. These are powerful, specific and particularly versatile techniques, which can be used to circumvent pathogenic mutations, shift splice variant expression, knock down proteins, or to create molecular models using in-frame deletions. Pre-mRNA targeting is currently used both as a research tool, e.g., in models for motor neuron disease, and in clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. AONs are particularly promising in relation to brain research, as the modified AONs are taken up extremely fast in neurons and glial cells with a long residence, and without the need for viral vectors or other delivery tools, once inside the blood brain barrier. In this review we cover (1). The principles of antisense-mediated techniques, chemistry, and efficacy.

In addition to genetic factors, environmental issues such as stress may also play a critical role in the etiology of AD. This study examined the effect of chronic psychosocial stress in an at-risk (treatment with a subpathogenic dose of Aβ; 'subAβ') rat model of AD on long-term memory by three techniques: memory tests in the radial arm water maze, electrophysiological recordings of synaptic plasticity in anesthetized rats, and immunoblot analysis of learning- and long-term memory-related signaling molecules. Chronic psychosocial stress was induced using a rat intruder model. The subAβ rat model of AD was induced by continuous infusion of 160 pmol/day Aβ(1-42) via a 14-day i.c.v. osmotic pump. All tests showed that subAβ rats were not different from control rats. Result from behavioral tests and electrophysiological recordings showed that infusion of subAβ in chronically stressed rats (stress/subAβ group) caused significant impairment of cognitive functions and late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP). Molecular analysis of various signaling molecules after expression of L-LTP, revealed an increase in the levels of p-CREB in control, stress, and subAβ rats, but not in the stress/subAβ rats. These findings suggest that the chronic stress-induced molecular alteration may accelerate the impairment of cognition and synaptic plasticity in individuals 'at-risk' for AD."}

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of valproic acid (200 μM) on TTX-resistant sodium currents in mPFC pyramidal neurons. Valproic acid inhibited the maximal amplitude and did not change the activation parameters of TTX-resistant sodium currents. Moreover, valproic acid (2 μM and 200 μM) shifted the TTX-resistant sodium channel inactivation curve towards hyperpolarisation. In the presence of valproic acid, TTX-resistant sodium currents recovered from inactivation more slowly. Valproic acid did not influence the use-dependent blockade of TTX-resistant sodium currents. This study suggests that a potential new mechanism of the antiepileptic action of valproic acid is, among others, inhibition of TTX-resistant sodium currents."}

Brain Abeta levels are controlled by the action of several proteolytic enzymes such as neprilysin (NEP), insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) and plasmin. While up-regulation of these enzymes increased clearance of Abeta in transgenic mouse models of AD, these enzymes have other natural substrates and multiple cleavage sites in Abeta complicating their use for treating AD. Alternatively, immunotherapeutic approaches to clear Abeta are gaining interest. Active and passive immunization studies with Abeta can reduce plaque burden and memory loss, but clinical trials were stopped due to meningioencephalitis in some patients. Naturally occurring proteolytic antibodies have been shown to cleave Abeta, and their serum titers are increased in patients with AD reflecting a protective autoimmune response. These antibodies however cannot cross the blood brain barrier and depend entirely on peripheral clearance to clear Abeta. A potentially non-inflammatory approach to facilitate Abeta clearance and reduce toxicity is to promote hydrolysis of Abeta at its alpha-secretase site using affinity matured single chain antibody fragments (scFvs). Bispecific antibodies consisting of a proteolytic scFv and a targeting scFv can be engineered to selectively supplement and target extracellular alpha-secretase activity and to target toxic Abeta forms facilitating their degradation and clearance without generating an immune response. This strategy represents a suitable paradigm for treating other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's Disease, Lou Gehrig's Disease, and spongiform encephalopathies."}

The cause and mechanism of AD are not well understood. Inhalational anesthetics have been suggested to induce neurotoxicity, leading to memory deficits and the progression of AD. However, recent data have shown that inhalational anesthetics may protect against neurotoxicity and are not associated with an increased risk of AD. We used a Drosophila model to directly investigate the neurologic effects of the inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane on AD. Five- to six-day-old control and AD-transgenic flies were exposed to 2.1% or 3% sevoflurane 4 and 16 times for 1 hour each time. Electroretinograms (ERG), retinal immunohistochemistry, climbing ability, and survival were analyzed after sevoflurane treatment. The data were evaluated using Student's t-test or a one-way ANOVA with a supplementary Fisher's LSD (Least Significant Difference) test. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. The ΔERG, climbing ability, and survival were lower in AD-transgenic flies. Exposure to 2.1% sevoflurane 4 and 16 times and to 3% sevoflurane 16 times rescued the ΔERG in AD-transgenic flies. Sevoflurane exposure did not attenuate the climbing ability or survival of control and AD-transgenic flies. The inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane might not have exerted neurotoxic effects on control and AD-transgenic flies; in fact, sevoflurane might confer selective neuroprotection on the retinal function of AD-transgenic flies. These results suggest the need for future studies to determine the potential effects of anesthetics on AD-associated neuroprotection or neurotoxicity."}

Despite recent studies about antioxidants accelerating the progression of lung cancer and melanoma, antioxidants may still play a role in cancer prevention. Both tumor and antioxidants types influence the actual efficacy. However, little is known about the impact of different types of antioxidants on primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including non-mitochondrial- and mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants. Utilizing mouse models of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis, we showed that administration of non-mitochondria-targeted antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and the soluble vitamin E analog, Trolox, prevented tumorigenesis, whereas administration of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants SS-31 (the mitochondria-targeted peptide) and Mito-Q (a derivative of ubiquinone) facilitated tumorigenesis. RNA sequencing revealed that NAC and SS-31 caused very different changes in the oxidation-reduction state and DNA damage response. In diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-treated primary hepatocytes, NAC and Trolox alleviated DNA damage by activating ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) for DNA repair whereas SS-31 and Mito-Q aggravated damage by inactivating them. Interestingly, partial recovery of SS-31-scavengened mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) could alleviate SS-31-aggravated DNA damage. Localization of ATM between mitochondria and nuclei was altered after NAC and SS-31 treatment. Furthermore, blockage of phospho-ATR (p-ATR) led to the recurrence of NAC-ameliorated DEN HCC. In contrast, reactivation of p-ATR blocked SS-31-promoted DEN HCC. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the type of antioxidants plays a previously unappreciated role in hepatocarcinogenesis, and provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring the therapeutic use of antioxidants for liver cancer.

Increased HO-1 expression was assessed either by transient hyperthermia or by HO-1 lentiviral infection. One day after the thermic shock, we observed a fourfold and a threefold increase in HSP70/72 and HO-1 levels, respectively. This treatment protected 30% of cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis in vitro. When porcine MPC were heat-shocked prior to grafting, we improved cell survival by threefold at 5 days after autologous transplantation (26.3 +/- 5.5% surviving cells). After HO-1 lentiviral transduction, almost 60% of cells expressed the transgene and kept their myogenic properties to proliferate and fuse in vitro. Apoptosis of HO-1 transduced cells was reduced by 50% in vitro after staurosporine induction. Finally, a fivefold enhancement in cell survival was observed after transplantation of HO-1-group (47.5 +/- 9.1% surviving cells) as compared to the nls-LacZ-group or control group.

Consequently, a precise genetic diagnosis is now possible in the majority of cases, thus allowing proper genetic counseling. Although, unfortunately, treatment is still unavailable for all types of CMT, several cellular and animal models have been developed and some compounds have proved effective in these models.

In addition, motor-sensory function was evaluated.	Compared to sham-vehicle rats, SAH-vehicle animals displayed a four-times greater increase in pial venular intraluminal leukocyte adhesion. Treatment with fingolimod largely reduced the intravascular leukocyte adhesion. Vehicle-treated SAH animals displayed a significant decrease in pial arteriolar responses to all the vasodilators tested and vascular reactivity was preserved, to a significant degree, in the presence of fingolimod. In addition, neurological scores obtained at 48 hours post-SAH indicated significant neurological deficits in the vehicle-treated group (versus sham-vehicle surgical control). Those deficiencies were partially reduced by fingolimod (P < 0.0001 compared to the vehicle-treated SAH group).	Treatment of rats with fingolimod was associated with a marked limitation in the intravascular adhesion of leukocytes to pial venules, preserved pial arteriolar dilating function, and improved neurological outcome in rats subjected to SAH."}

{"pmid": "21358968", "text": "Current neuropharmacology^\nMelatonin metabolism in the central nervous system.^\nThe metabolism of melatonin in the central nervous system is of interest for several reasons. Melatonin enters the brain either via the pineal recess or by uptake from the blood. It has been assumed to be also formed in some brain areas. Neuroprotection by melatonin has been demonstrated in numerous model systems, and various attempts have been undertaken to counteract neurodegeneration by melatonin treatment. Several concurrent pathways lead to different products. Cytochrome P(450) subforms have been demonstrated in the brain. They either demethylate melatonin to N-acetylserotonin, or produce 6-hydroxymelatonin, which is mostly sulfated already in the CNS. Melatonin is deacetylated, at least in pineal gland and retina, to 5-methoxytryptamine. N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine is formed by pyrrole-ring cleavage, by myeloperoxidase, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and various non-enzymatic oxidants. Its product, N(1)-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine, is of interest as a scavenger of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, mitochondrial modulator, downregulator of cyclooxygenase-2, inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, neuronal and inducible NO synthases. Contrary to other nitrosated aromates, the nitrosated kynuramine metabolite, 3-acetamidomethyl-6-methoxycinnolinone, does not re-donate NO. Various other products are formed from melatonin and its metabolites by interaction with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The relative contribution of the various pathways to melatonin catabolism seems to be influenced by microglia activation, oxidative stress and brain levels of melatonin, which may be strongly changed in experiments on neuroprotection. Many of the melatonin metabolites, which may appear in elevated concentrations after melatonin administration, possess biological or pharmacological properties, including N-acetylserotonin, 5-methoxytryptamine and some of its derivatives, and especially the 5-methoxylated kynuramines."}

A TUNEL-based apoptosis kit was used for evaluating apoptosis in the spinal cord samples and hematoxylinand eosin-stained specimens were used for light microscopic examination.	Carvedilol reduced apoptosis and regulated oxidant and antioxidant status by increasing SOD and GSH levels and reducing MPO and MDA levels in the spinal tissue homogenate. Neurological examination of rats revealed statistically significant improvement 24 hours after the trauma.	Carvedilol has a statistically significant therapeutic effect, especially on functional recovery, and we found that carvedilol reduced secondary damage by inhibiting apoptosis and regulating the oxidant and antioxidant status."}

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been shown to promote the migration of bone marrow stromal cells; however, cytokines need to be released at a steady rate to maintain a stable concentration in vivo. Therefore, new methods are needed to maintain an optimal concentration of cytokines over an extended period of time to effectively promote seed cell localization, proliferation and differentiation. In the present study, a partition-type tubular scaffold matching the anatomical features of the thoracic 8-10 spinal cord of the rat was fabricated using chitosan and then subsequently loaded with chitosan-encapsulated PDGF-BB microspheres (PDGF-MSs). The PDGF-MS-containing scaffold was then examined in vitro for sustained-release capacity, biocompatibility, and its effect on neural progenitor cells differentiated in vitro from multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cells (MUSE-NPCs). We found that pre-freezing for 2 hours at -20°C significantly increased the yield of partition-type tubular scaffolds, and 30 μL of 25% glutaraldehyde ensured optimal crosslinking of PDGF-MSs. The resulting PDGF-MSs cumulatively released 52% of the PDGF-BB at 4 weeks in vitro without burst release. The PDGF-MS-containing tubular scaffold showed suitable biocompatibility towards MUSE-NPCs and could promote the directional migration and growth of these cells. These findings indicate that the combination of a partition-type tubular scaffold, PDGF-MSs and MUSE-NPCs may be a promising model for the fabrication of tissue-engineered spinal cord grafts."}

Here, we have investigated its effects on experimental ischaemic brain injury.	The effects of dexpramipexole on bioenergetics, Ca[2+] fluxes, electrophysiological functions and death were evaluated in primary neural cultures and hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Effects on infarct volumes and neurological functions were also evaluated in mice following proximal or distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Distribution of dexpramipexole within the ischaemic brain was evaluated by means of mass spectrometry imaging.	Dexpramipexole increased mitochondrial ATP production in cultured neurons or glia and reduces energy failure, prevents intracellular Ca[2+] overload and affords cytoprotection when cultures are exposed to OGD. This compound also counteracted ATP depletion, mitochondrial swelling, anoxic depolarization, loss of synaptic activity and neuronal death in hippocampal slices subjected to OGD. Post-ischaemic treatment with dexpramipexole, at doses consistent with those already used in ALS patients, reduced brain infarct size and ameliorated neuroscore in mice subjected to transient or permanent MCAo. Notably, the concentrations of dexpramipexole reached within the ischaemic penumbra equalled those found neuroprotective in vitro.	Dexpramipexole, a compound able to increase mitochondrial F1Fo ATP-synthase activity reduced ischaemic brain injury. These findings, together with the excellent brain penetration and favourable safety profile in humans, make dexpramipexole a drug with realistic translational potential for the treatment of stroke.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive cognitive decline associated with inflammation. Evidence indicates that the initiation and progression of AD is linked to aberrant cholesterol metabolism and inflammation. Activation of LXR can regulate neuroinflammation and decrease amyloid-β peptide accumulation. Here, we highlight the role of LXR in orchestrating lipid homeostasis and neuroinflammation in the brain.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia have similar social cognitive deficits, although age of onset in each disorder is different. Pathogenesis of these disorders is complex and contains several features, including genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors, and sites of abnormalities in the brain. Although several hypotheses have been postulated, they seem to be insufficient to explain how brain alterations associated with symptoms in these disorders develop at distinct developmental stages. Development of ASD appears to be related to cerebellar dysfunction and subsequent thalamic hyperactivation in early childhood. By contrast, schizophrenia seems to be triggered by thalamic hyperactivation in late adolescence, whereas hippocampal aberration has been possibly initiated in childhood. One of the possible culprits is metal homeostasis disturbances that can induce dysfunction of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Thalamic hyperactivation is thought to be induced by microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and abnormalities of intracerebral environment. Consequently, it is likely that the thalamic hyperactivation triggers dysregulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for lower brain regions related to social cognition. In this review, we summarize the brain aberration in ASD and schizophrenia and provide a possible mechanism underlying social cognitive deficits in these disorders based on their distinct ages of onset."}

Ogiku et al. reported that one such inhibitor, imidapril, significantly prolonged survival in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The present study was designed to investigate the effect of imidapril on cerebral blood vessels in SHRSP to clarify role of the ACE inhibitor in mechanisms of cerebral thrombosis and stroke. Imidapril was administered orally at 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks from the age of 7 weeks, and was shown to prevent the usual increase in blood pressure seen in these animals. It also delayed He-Ne laser-induced cerebral thrombosis and increased significantly the plasma concentration of nitric oxide metabolites (NO2/NO3). To confirm the association between nitric oxide (NO) and these effects of imidapril, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) was dissolved in drinking water and administered to the animals for 3 weeks. Four of six rats died from stroke when L-NAME was given alone. When imidapril (5.0 mg/kg/day) was administered with L-NAME, however, the animals showed no signs or symptoms of stroke. In these instances, therefore, the concurrent administration of L-NAME with imidapril reversed significantly the effects of imidapril. Intravenous injection of imidaprilat (100 microg/kg), an active metabolite of imidapril, also decreased blood pressure significantly and increased the plasma levels of NO2/NO3 after 5 min. Moreover, imidaprilat enlarged arteriolar diameters and caused an increase in red cell velocity and mean blood flow in pial arterioles after 15 min. The results strongly suggested that imidapril protects cerebral vessels in SHRSP by elevating the release of NO, thereby improving the cerebral circulation and reducing the tendency to thrombosis and stroke."}

Following calorie restriction or consumption of a ketogenic diet, there is notable improvement in mitochondrial function, a decrease in the expression of apoptotic and inflammatory mediators and an increase in the activity of neurotrophic factors. However, despite these intriguing observations, it is not yet clear which of these mechanisms account for the observed neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, limited compliance and concern for adverse effects hamper efforts at broader clinical application. Recent research aimed at identifying compounds that can reproduce, at least partially, the neuroprotective effects of the diets with less demanding changes to food intake suggests that ketone bodies might represent an appropriate candidate. Ketone bodies protect neurons against multiple types of neuronal injury and are associated with mitochondrial effects similar to those described during calorie restriction or ketogenic diet treatment. The present review summarizes the neuroprotective effects of calorie restriction, of the ketogenic diet and of ketone bodies, and compares their putative mechanisms of action."}

Decreased brain energy and glucose metabolism occurs before the appearance of AD symptoms and worsens while the disease progresses. Deregulated brain insulin signaling has also been found in AD recently.

However, the molecular mechanisms of the beneficial effects remain elusive. In the present study, we treated the 3xTg-AD mice, a widely used mouse model of AD, with pioglitazone and rosiglitazone for 4 months and studied the effects of the treatments on cognitive performance and AD-related brain alterations.

Given the need for novel adjunctive therapies for HAND, we hypothesized that ibudilast would inhibit Tat-induced excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) in microglial cells. Ibudilast is a non-selective cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor that has recently shown promise as a treatment for neuropathic pain via its ability to attenuate glial cell activation. Accordingly, here we demonstrate that pre-treatment of both human and mouse microglial cells with increasing doses of ibudilast inhibited Tat-induced synthesis of TNFα by microglial cells in a manner dependent on serine/threonine protein phosphatase activity. Ibudilast had no effect on Tat-induced p38 MAP kinase activation, and blockade of adenosine A(2A) receptor activation did not reverse ibudilast's inhibition of Tat-induced TNFα production. Interestingly, ibudilast reduced Tat-mediated transcription of TNFα, via modulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, as shown by transcriptional activity of NF-κB and analysis of inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IκBα) stability. Together, our findings shed light on the mechanism of ibudilast's inhibition of Tat-induced TNFα production in microglial cells and may implicate ibudilast as a potential novel adjunctive therapy for the management of HAND."}

In the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome, excessive GABAergic neurotransmission results in local over-inhibition of hippocampal circuits, which dampens hippocampal synaptic plasticity and contributes to cognitive impairments. Treatments with several GABA(A) receptor antagonists result in increased plasticity and improved memory deficits in Ts65Dn mice. These GABA(A) receptor antagonists are, however, not suitable for clinical applications. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, in contrast, is a widely prescribed antidepressant that can also enhance plasticity in the adult rodent brain by lowering GABAergic inhibition. For these reasons, we wondered if an adult-onset 4-week oral fluoxetine treatment restores spatial learning and memory impairments in Ts65Dn mice. Fluoxetine did not measurably improve behavioral impairments of Ts65Dn mice. On the contrary, we observed seizures and mortality in fluoxetine-treated Ts65Dn mice, raising the possibility of a drug × genotype interaction with respect to these adverse treatment outcomes.

In Kawasaki disease, IVIG plays a major, proven, and effective role in decreasing aneurysm formation, which represents an aberrant inflammatory response to an infectious trigger in a genetically predisposed individual. In immune thrombocytopenia, IVIG targets the underlying increased platelet destruction and decreased platelet production. Although theoretically promising, IVIG shows no clear clinical benefit in the prophylaxis and treatment of neonatal sepsis. Limitations in research design combined with the unique neonatal immunologic environment offer explanations for this finding. Inflammation from aberrant immune activation underlies the myelinotoxic effects of Guillain-Barré syndrome. HIV-1 exerts a broad range of immunologic effects and was found to decrease serious bacterial infections in the pre-highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) era, although its practical relevance in the post-HAART era has waned. Clinical and experimental data support the role of immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of childhood epilepsy. IVIG exerts anti-epileptic effects through targeting upregulated cytokine pathways and antibodies thought to contribute to epilepsy. Applications in six additional pediatric diseases including pediatric asthma, atopic dermatitis, cystic fibrosis, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS), autism, and transplantation will also be briefly reviewed.

Previously, we demonstrated increased oxidative damage and lowered antioxidant function in substantia nigra during aging making it vulnerable to degeneration associated with Parkinson's disease. To understand whether aging contributes to the vulnerability of brain regions in Alzheimer's disease, we assessed the oxidant and antioxidant markers, glutathione (GSH) metabolic enzymes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression and mitochondrial complex I (CI) activity in hippocampus (HC) and frontal cortex (FC) compared with cerebellum (CB) in human brains with increasing age (0.01-80 years).

However, long-term IFN-α treatment frequently causes depression, which limits its clinical utility. The precise molecular and cellular mechanisms of IFN-α-induced depression are not currently understood. Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampus continuously generate new neurons, and some evidence suggests that decreased neurogenesis plays a role in the neuropathology of depression. We previously reported that IFN-α treatment suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis and induced depression-like behaviors via its receptors in the brain in adult mice. However, it is unclear how systemic IFN-α administration induces IFN-α signaling in the hippocampus. In this study, we analyzed the role of microglia, immune cells in the brain, in mediating the IFN-α-induced neurogenic defects and depressive behaviors. In vitro studies demonstrated that IFN-α treatment induced the secretion of endogenous IFN-α from microglia, which suppressed NSC proliferation. In vivo treatment of adult mice with IFN-α for 5 weeks increased the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-α, and reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Both effects were prevented by simultaneous treatment with minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation. Furthermore, minocycline treatment significantly suppressed IFN-α-induced depressive behaviors in mice. These results suggest that microglial activation plays a critical role in the development of IFN-α-induced depression, and that minocycline is a promising drug for the treatment of IFN-α-induced depression in patients, especially those who are low responders to conventional antidepressant treatments."}

We investigated the role of neuronal maturity on cell survival, differentiation, and long-term sensorimotor recovery in stroke-injured rats using a population of human cortically-specified neuroepithelial progenitor cells (cNEPs) delivered in a biocompatible, bioresorbable hyaluronan/methylcellulose hydrogel. We demonstrate that transplantation of immature cNEPs result in the greatest tissue and functional repair, relative to transplantation of more mature neurons. The transplantation process itself resulted in the least cell death and phenotypic changes in the immature cNEPs, and the greatest acute cell death in the mature cells. The latter negatively impacted host tissue and negated any potential positive effects associated with cell maturity and the hydrogel vehicle, which itself showed some functional and tissue benefit.

Heart and circulatory physiology^\nThe role of reactive oxygen species in the hearts of dystrophin-deficient mdx mice.^\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by deficiency of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to the skeletal muscle damage in DMD; however, little is known about the role of oxidative damage in the pathogenesis of the heart failure that occurs in DMD patients. The dystrophin-deficient (mdx) mouse is an animal model of DMD that also lacks dystrophin. The current study investigates the role of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on mdx cardiomyocyte function, Ca(2+) handling, and the cardiac inflammatory response. Treated mice received 1% NAC in their drinking water for 6 wk. NAC had no effect on wild-type (WT) mice. Immunohistochemistry experiments revealed that mdx mice had increased dihydroethidine (DHE) staining, an indicator of superoxide production; NAC-treatment reduced DHE staining in mdx hearts. NAC treatment attenuated abnormalities in mdx cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) handling. Mdx cardiomyocytes had decreased fractional shortening and decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity; NAC treatment returned mdx fractional shortening to WT values but did not affect the Ca(2+) sensitivity. Immunohistochemistry experiments revealed that mdx hearts had increased levels of collagen type III and the macrophage-specific protein, CD68; NAC-treatment returned collagen type III and CD68 expression close to WT values. Finally, mdx hearts had increased NADPH oxidase activity, suggesting it could be a possible source of increased reactive oxygen species in mdx mice. This study is the first to demonstrate that oxidative damage may be involved in the pathogenesis of the heart failure that occurs in mdx mice. Therapies designed to reduce oxidative damage might be beneficial to DMD patients with heart failure."}

One conceptualization gaining media and research attention in recent years is that foods, particularly hyperpalatable (e.g., high-fat, high sugar) ones, may possess addictive qualities. Stress is an important factor in the development of addiction and in addiction relapse, and may contribute to an increased risk for obesity and other metabolic diseases. Uncontrollable stress changes eating patterns and the salience and consumption of hyperpalatable foods; over time, this could lead to changes in allostatic load and trigger neurobiological adaptations that promote increasingly compulsive behavior. This association may be mediated by alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and other appetite-related hormones and hypothalamic neuropeptides. At a neurocircuitry level, chronic stress may affect the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and other brain regions involved in stress/motivation circuits. Together, these may synergistically potentiate reward sensitivity, food preference, and the wanting and seeking of hyperpalatable foods, as well as induce metabolic changes that promote weight and body fat mass. Individual differences in susceptibility to obesity and types of stressors may further moderate this process. Understanding the associations and interactions between stress, neurobiological adaptations, and obesity is important in the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for obesity and related metabolic diseases."}

Cognitive deficits associated with CNS picornavirus infection result from injury and death of neurons that may occur due to direct viral infection or during the immune responses to virus in the brain. Previous studies have concluded that apoptosis of hippocampal neurons during picornavirus infection is a cell-autonomous event triggered by direct neuronal infection. However, these studies assessed neuron death at time points late in infection and during infections that lead to either death of the host or persistent viral infection. In contrast, many neurovirulent picornavirus infections are acute and transient, with rapid clearance of virus from the host. We provide evidence of hippocampal pathology in mice acutely infected with the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis picornavirus. We found that CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibited several hallmarks of apoptotic death, including caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and chromatin condensation within 72 hours of infection. Critically, we also found that many of the CA1 pyramidal neurons undergoing apoptosis were not infected with virus, indicating that neuronal cell death during acute picornavirus infection of the CNS occurs in a non-cell-autonomous manner. These observations suggest that therapeutic strategies other than antiviral interventions may be useful for neuroprotection during acute CNS picornavirus infection."}

Mutant huntingtin protein (Htt(exp)) specifically binds to and activates type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1), an intracellular Ca(2+) release channel.

Mammalian metallothioneins I and II (MT-I&II) have significant neuroprotective functions, but the precise mechanisms underlying these effects are still unknown. To gain insight in this regard, we have evaluated whether a distant, most likely single-domain MT (Drosophila MTN) functions similarly to mammalian MT-I&II (recombinant mouse MT-I and human MT-IIa and native rabbit MT-II) after cryogenic injury to the cortex in Mt1&2 KO mice. All the recombinant proteins showed similar neuroprotective properties to native MT-II, significantly reducing brain inflammation (macrophages, T cells, and pro-inflammatory cytokines), oxidative stress, neurodegeneration, and apoptosis. These results in principle do not support specific protein-protein interactions as the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of these proteins because a non-homologous and structurally unrelated MT such as Drosophila MTN functions similarly to mammalian MTs. We have also evaluated for the first time the neurobiologic effects of exogenous MT-III, a major CNS MT isoform. Human rMT-III, in contrast to human nMT-IIa, did not affect inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, and showed opposite effects on several growth factors, neurotrophins, and markers of synaptic growth and plasticity. Our data thus highlight specific and divergent roles of exogenous MT-III vs. the MT-I&II isoforms that are consistent with those attributed to the endogenous proteins, and confirm the suitability of recombinant synthesis for future therapeutic use that may become relevant to clinical neurology."}

Neuropathic pain arising from peripheral nerve lesions is known to be dependent on the emergence of spontaneous and evoked hyperexcitability in damaged nerves. Here, we report that the potassium channel subunit Kv9.1 is expressed in myelinated sensory neurons, but is absent from small unmyelinated neurons. Kv9.1 expression was strongly and rapidly downregulated following axotomy, with a time course that matches the development of spontaneous activity and pain hypersensitivity in animal models. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knock-down of Kv9.1 in naive rats led to neuropathic pain behaviors. Diminished Kv9.1 function also augmented myelinated sensory neuron excitability, manifested as spontaneous firing, hyper-responsiveness to stimulation, and persistent after-discharge. Intracellular recordings from ex vivo dorsal root ganglion preparations revealed that Kv9.1 knock-down was linked to lowered firing thresholds and increased firing rates under physiologically relevant conditions of extracellular potassium accumulation during prolonged activity. Similar neurophysiological changes were detected in animals subjected to traumatic nerve injury and provide an explanation for neuropathic pain symptoms, including poorly understood conditions such as hyperpathia and paresthesias. In summary, our results demonstrate that Kv9.1 dysfunction leads to spontaneous and evoked neuronal hyperexcitability in myelinated fibers, coupled with development of neuropathic pain behaviors."}

LPS was unilaterally injected into the substantia nigra (SN) in the absence or presence of CAP or capsazepine (CZP, a TRPV1 antagonist). The SN tissues were prepared for immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, western blot analysis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability evaluation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection. We found that CAP prevented the degeneration of nigral dopamine neurons in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the LPS-lesioned SN. CAP shifted the proinflammatory M1 microglia/macrophage population to an anti-inflammatory M2 state as demonstrated by decreased expression of M1 markers (i.e., inducible nitric oxide synthase; iNOS and interleukin-6) and elevated expression of M2 markers (i.e., arginase 1 and CD206) in the SN. RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated decreased iNOS expression and increased arginase 1 expression in the CAP-treated LPS-lesioned SN. Peroxynitrate production, reactive oxygen species levels and oxidative damage were reduced in the CAP-treated LPS-lesioned SN. The beneficial effects of CAP were blocked by CZP, indicating TRPV1 involvement. The present data indicate that CAP regulated the M1 and M2 activation states of microglia/macrophage in the LPS-lesioned SN, which resulted in the survival of dopamine neurons. It is therefore likely that TRPV1 activation by CAP has therapeutic potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases, that are associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, such as PD."}

We evaluated the hypothesis that hyperalgesia and priming induced by opioids are mediated by similar nociceptor mechanisms. In male rats, we first evaluated the role of nociceptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in OIH and priming induced by systemic low-dose morphine (LDM, 0.03 mg/kg). Intrathecal oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to TLR4 mRNA (TLR4 AS-ODN) prevented OIH and prolongation of prostaglandin E2 hyperalgesia (priming) induced by LDM. In contrast, high-dose morphine (HDM, 3 mg/kg) increased nociceptive threshold (analgesia) and induced priming, neither of which was attenuated by TLR4 AS-ODN. Protein kinase C ε (PKCε) AS-ODN also prevented LDM-induced hyperalgesia and priming, whereas analgesia and priming induced by HDM were unaffected. Treatment with isolectin B4 (IB4)-saporin or SSP-saporin (which deplete IB4[+] and peptidergic nociceptors, respectively), or their combination, prevented systemic LDM-induced hyperalgesia, but not priming. HDM-induced priming, but not analgesia, was markedly attenuated in both saporin-treated groups. In conclusion, whereas OIH and priming induced by LDM share receptor and second messenger mechanisms in common, action at TLR4 and signaling via PKCε, HDM-induced analgesia, and priming are neither TLR4 nor PKCε dependent. OIH produced by LDM is mediated by both IB4[+] and peptidergic nociceptors, whereas priming is not dependent on the same population. In contrast, priming induced by HDM is mediated by both IB4[+] and peptidergic nociceptors.

We demonstrate that OIH and priming induced by systemic low-dose morphine (LDM) share action at Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and signaling via protein kinase C ε (PKCε) in common, whereas systemic high-dose morphine (HDM)-induced analgesia and priming are neither TLR4 nor PKCε dependent. OIH produced by systemic LDM is mediated by isolectin B4-positive (IB4[+]) and peptidergic nociceptors, whereas priming is dependent on a different class of nociceptors. Priming induced by systemic HDM is, however, mediated by both IB4[+] and peptidergic nociceptors. Our findings may provide useful information for the use of low-dose opioids combined with nonopioid analgesics to treat pain and opioid use disorders."}

Targeted toxins are highly potent - one single molecule of toxin is enough to cause cell death. Toxins are able to kill tumor cells independent of any malignancy-associated genetic alterations and/or mutations. The blood-brain barrier has been a major obstacle for using targeted toxins for treatment of malignant glioma. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED), a method for delivery of large molecules to brain tissue via continuous interstitial microinfusion, has permitted direct administration of toxins to brain tumors or to surrounding brain tissue infiltrated by tumor cells. Four targeted toxins advanced to at least phase II clinical trials and are being used for treatment of adult or pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma. These are IL4-P. aeruginosa exotoxin (IL4-PE, NBI-3001), tumor growth factor (TGF)alpha-P. aeruginosa exotoxin (TP-38), IL13-P. aeruginosa exotoxin (IL13-PE38), and transferrin-C. diphtheriae toxin (TransMID(trade mark), Tf-CRM107).

ATM encodes a protein kinase that is activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates many proteins, including those involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Characteristic biological and molecular functions of ATM observed in mammals are conserved in Drosophila melanogaster. As an example, conditional loss-of-function ATM alleles in flies cause progressive neurodegeneration through activation of the innate immune response. However, unlike in mammals, null alleles of ATM in flies cause lethality during development. With the goals of understanding biological and molecular roles of ATM in a whole animal and identifying candidate therapeutics for A-T, we performed a screen of 2400 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs, natural products, and bioactive compounds, for modifiers of the developmental lethality caused by a temperature-sensitive ATM allele (ATM8) that has reduced kinase activity at non-permissive temperatures. Ten compounds reproducibly suppressed the developmental lethality of ATM8 flies, including Ronnel, which is an organophosphate. Ronnel and other suppressor compounds are known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction or to inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which controls the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, suggesting that detrimental consequences of reduced ATM kinase activity can be rescued by inhibiting the function of mitochondria or increasing acetylcholine levels. We carried out further studies of Ronnel because, unlike the other compounds that suppressed the developmental lethality of homozygous ATM8 flies, Ronnel was toxic to the development of heterozygous ATM8 flies. Ronnel did not affect the innate immune response of ATM8 flies, and it further increased the already high levels of DNA damage in brains of ATM8 flies, but its effects were not harmful to the lifespan of rescued ATM8 flies.

This review synthesizes human and animal data linking maternal obesity and high-fat diet consumption to abnormal fetal brain development and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric morbidity in offspring. In addition, it highlights key mechanisms by which maternal obesity and maternal diet might impact fetal and offspring neurodevelopment, including neuroinflammation; increased oxidative stress, dysregulated insulin, glucose, and leptin signaling; dysregulated serotonergic and dopaminergic signaling; and perturbations in synaptic plasticity. Finally, the review summarizes available evidence regarding investigational therapeutic approaches to mitigate the harmful effects of maternal obesity on fetal and offspring neurodevelopment. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}

However, the experiments so far undertaken have not addressed the need for tissue-type matching to achieve graft-mediated remyelination. Examination of MHC expression (main determinant of allograft rejection) by OPCs showed nondetectable levels under standard culture conditions and upregulation of MHC Class I expression only upon exposure to interferon gamma. We therefore hypothesized that MHC matching of OPC grafts may not be crucial to achieve transplant-mediated remyelination. Transplant experiments performed using a nonself repairing toxin-induced demyelination model showed that, similarly to allogeneic neurons, survival of allogeneic oligodendrocyte lineage cells is influenced by donor-host haplotype combination and graft composition. Transplantation of allogeneic mixed glial cell cultures resulted in remyelination failure by 1 month postengraftment due to a rejection response targeting both myelinating oligodendrocytes and OPCs, suggesting that inflammation-induced upregulation of OPC MHC I expression results in susceptibility to cytotoxic T cell attack. In contrast, remyelination persisted for at least 2 months following transplantation of OPC-enriched cultures whose overall MHC expression level was significantly decreased. While OPC-enriched preparations elicited delayed type hypersensitivity responses in hosts sensitized to alloantigens, allografting of such preparations into a central nervous system demyelinating lesion did not result in recipient priming. We conclude that while allografted oligodendrocyte lineage cells become targets of a graft rejection response once this response has been initiated, transplantation of OPC-enriched preparations can evade priming against alloantigens and graft rejection. This finding indicates that close tissue matching may not be an essential requirement for successful transplant-mediated remyelination."}

The current lack of effective treatments for ALS is partially due to the lack of appropriate biomarkers that aide in assessing drug efficacy during clinical trials independent of clinical outcome measures, such as increased survival. In this review we will summarize the opportunities for biomarker development specifically targeted to the newly discovered C9orf72 repeat expansion.

Administration of NSCs into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) offers a nontraumatic transplantation method into the brain. However, cell survival and intraparenchymal migration of the transplants are limited. Furthermore, CSF was recently reported to be an important milieu for controlling stem cell processes in the brain. We studied the effects of adult human leptomeningeal CSF on the behavior of fetal rat NSCs. CSF increased survival of NSCs compared with standard culture media during stem cell maintenance and differentiation. The presence of CSF enhanced NSC differentiation, leading to a faster loss of self-renewal capacity and faster and stronger neurite outgrowth. Some of these effects (mainly cell survival, neurite brancing) were blocked by addition of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) inhibitor noggin. After differentiation in CSF, significantly fewer MAP2ab(+) neurons were found, but there were more GFAP(+) astroglia compared with standard media. By RT-PCR analysis, we determined a decrease of mRNA of the NSC marker gene Nestin but an increase of Gfap mRNA during differentiation up to 72 hr in CSF compared with standard media. Our data demonstrate that adult human leptomeningeal CSF enhances cell survival of fetal rat NSCs during proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, CSF provides a stimulus for gliogenesis but inhibits neurogenesis from fetal NSCs. Our data suggest that CSF contains factors such as BMPs regulating NSC behavior, and we hypothesize that fast differentiation of NSCs in CSF leads to a rapid loss of migration capacity of intrathecally transplanted NSCs."}

Oxidation of lipids in neural membranes by reactive oxygen species is involved in the mechanism responsible for iron-induced seizures as a model of posttraumatic epilepsy. In this study, we examined the effect of trimetazidine (TMZ) and deferoxamine (DFO) on lipid peroxidation after cortical injection of 5 microliters of an aqueous solution containing 100 mM of ferric chloride (FeCl3) in rats. Animals were divided into four groups (n = 7 each) and treated as follows: group 1, saline injection into the cortex (control group); group 2, iron injection into the cortex (injury group); group 3, iron injection into the cortex plus TMZ; group 4, iron injection into the cortex plus DFO. The animals were killed 3 h after injections, and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a lipid peroxidation product, and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured. A significant elevation of MDA was observed in group 2 (P < 0.05). MDA levels were found to be lower in both the TMZ-treated (P < 0.05) and DFO-treated (P < 0.05) groups than in the injury group. Tissue GSH levels were significantly decreased in group 2 (P < 0.05). GSH levels were increased in the TMZ-treated (P < 0.05) and DFO-treated (P < 0.05) groups compared to the injury group. The results of our study suggest that lipid peroxidation is a critical event in iron-induced epilepsy and that treatment with TMZ and DFO is effective in preventing the formation of free radicals and reducing lipoperoxides in brain tissue."}

DDHD2(-/-) mice show age-dependent TAG elevations in the central nervous system, but not in several peripheral tissues. Large lipid droplets accumulated in DDHD2(-/-) brains and were localized primarily to the intracellular compartments of neurons. These metabolic changes were accompanied by impairments in motor and cognitive function. Recombinant DDHD2 displays TAG hydrolase activity, and TAGs accumulated in the brains of wild-type mice treated subchronically with a selective DDHD2 inhibitor. These findings, taken together, indicate that the central nervous system possesses a specialized pathway for metabolizing TAGs, disruption of which leads to massive lipid accumulation in neurons and complex HSP syndrome."}

The patent document describes a non-embryo-destructive process to harvest embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass (ICM) during the blastocyst development stage. The patent application was filed with the German Patent Office in Munich on December 23, 2004 and the patent claim was published in 2006. The patent was granted on August 1, 2013. Processing the patent application was a lengthy affair due to the fact that, for a long time, the prevailing opinion in Germany was that genetic screening of embryos (preimplantation genetic diagnosis) was prohibited under the German Embryo Protection Act (ESchG). A ruling by the German Federal Court in 2010 proved this opinion to be false. Animal studies have provided the evidence that the described procedure is technically feasible; healthy offspring were born after stem cells were harvested from the blastocyst and stored. We report here on a technique for the non-embryo-destructive extraction of pluripotent embryonic stem cells together with potential future applications for stem cells harvested in this manner.

We previously demonstrated that loss of sarcoglycans in smooth muscle leads to constrictions of the microvasculature that contributes to the cardiac phenotype. It is unclear how vasculature abnormalities affect skeletal muscle. We injected recombinant beta- or delta-sarcoglycan adenoviruses into skeletal muscles of corresponding null mice. We hypothesized that the adenoviruses would not transduce vascular smooth muscle, and we would only target skeletal muscle. Indeed, sustained expression of intact sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex was noted at the sarcolemma, neuromuscular junction, myotendinous junction, and in peripheral nerve, but not in vascular smooth muscle. Gene transfer of the corresponding deleted sarcoglycan gene preserved sarcolemmal integrity, prevented pathological dystrophy and hypertrophy, and protected against exercised-induced damage. We conclude that vascular dysfunction is not a primary cause of beta- and delta-sarcoglycan-deficient muscular dystrophy. In addition, we show successful functional rescue of entire muscles after adenovirus-mediated gene delivery.

Several reports have shown that the expression of these transporters within the CNS may be altered in patients with certain neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, in the CNS the monoamine transporters are major targets for existing and developmental drugs. The best known drugs targeting these transporters are the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. citalopram, Celexa) that are most frequently used in the treatment of clinical depression. Selective NE reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) have also found use for the treatment of depression and other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) disorder. Given that the NE transporter (NET) is also a binding site for cocaine and drugs of abuse, there is a great need for a probe to assess the densities of NET in vivo by brain imaging with either positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission tomography (SPET). PET in particular has the potential to measure NET densities quantitatively and with high resolution in the human brain in vivo. The quality of a PET image depends crucially on the radioligand used in the emission measurement. Commonly used radionuclides in PET radioligands are carbon 11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) and fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.8 min).

In Parkinson's disease, postmortem examination reveals a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra associated with a massive astrogliosis and the presence of activated microglial cells. Recent evidence suggests that the disease may progress even when the initial cause of neuronal degeneration has disappeared, suggesting that toxic substances released by the glial cells may be involved in the propagation and perpetuation of neuronal degeneration. Glial cells can release deleterious compounds such as proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, Il-1beta, IFN-gamma), which may act by stimulating nitric oxide production in glial cells, or which may exert a more direct deleterious effect on dopaminergic neurons by activating receptors that contain intracytoplasmic death domains involved in apoptosis. In line with this possibility, an activation of proteases such as caspase-3 and caspase-8, which are known effectors of apoptosis, has been reported in Parkinson's disease. Yet, caspase inhibitors or invalidation of TNF-alpha receptors does not protect dopaminergic neurons against degeneration in experimental models of the disease, suggesting that manipulation of a single signaling pathway may not be sufficient to protect dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, the antiinflammatory drugs pioglitazone, a PPAR-gamma agonist, and the tetracycline derivative minocycline have been shown to reduce glial activation and protect the substantia nigra in an animal model of the disease. Inhibition of the glial reaction and the inflammatory processes may thus represent a therapeutic target to reduce neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease."}

Here, we examined the role of the sympathetic innervation in the inflammation of L5 DRGs of Wistar rats following transection of the sciatic nerve, comparing the effects of specific surgical interventions 10-14 days prior to the nerve lesion with those of chronic administration of adrenoceptor antagonists. Immunohistochemistry was used to define the invading immune cell populations 7 days after sciatic transection. Removal of sympathetic activity in the hind limb by transecting the preganglionic input to the relevant lumbar sympathetic ganglia (ipsi- or bilateral decentralization) or by ipsilateral removal of these ganglia with degeneration of postganglionic axons (denervation), caused less DRG inflammation than occurred after a sham sympathectomy. By contrast, denervation of the lymph node draining the lesion site potentiated T-cell influx. Systemic treatment with antagonists of α1-adrenoceptors (prazosin) or β-adrenoceptors (propranolol) led to opposite but unexpected effects on infiltration of DRGs after sciatic transection.

We evaluated the protective effects of GK against neuronal apoptosis by assessing its ability to sustain mitochondrial integrity and function. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that Drp1 binding to GSK-3β was increased after an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) insult in cultured neuroblastoma cells. This induced Drp1 and GSK-3β translocation to mitochondria and mitochondrial dysfunction, which was attenuated by GK. GK also reduced mitochondrial fission by increasing Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser637 and inhibiting mitochondrial Drp1 recruitment. In addition, GK exposure induced GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser9 and enhanced the interaction between adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and p-GSK-3β. This interaction suppressed the interaction between ANT and cyclophilin D (CypD), which inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. Similarly, suppression of mitochondrial fission by Mdivi-1 also inhibited GSK-3β-induced mPTP opening. Treating mice with GK prevented GSK-3β and Drp1 translocation to mitochondria and attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction after middle cerebral artery occlusion.

The ED(50) of NT69L for hypothermia was 390 microgram/kg. NT69L (up to 5 mg/kg i.p.) did not produce catalepsy. However, when given before haloperidol, NT69L, but not clozapine, completely prevented catalepsy. When given after haloperidol, NT69L, but not clozapine, reversed haloperidol's cataleptic effects with an ED(50) of 260 microg/kg. There was no significant difference between the ED(50)s for hypothermia and anticataleptic effects of NT69L. However, the ED(50) for blocking the effects of apomorphine was significantly lower than the other two.

Whether accumulating NAA, absence of NAA-derived acetate, or absence of any unknown functions of the ASPA enzyme is responsible for the pathology of the disease is not fully understood. We generated ASPA-deficient (Aspa(nur7/nur7)) mice that are also deficient for NAA synthase Nat8L (Nat8L(-/-)/Aspa(nur7/nur7)). These mice have no detectable NAA. Nevertheless, they exhibited normal myelin content, myelin sphingolipid composition, and full reversal of spongy myelin and axonal degeneration. Surprisingly, although pathology was fully reversed, the survival time of the mice was not prolonged. In contrast, Aspa(nur7/nur7) mice with only one intact Nat8L allele accumulated less NAA, developed a less severe pathology, phenotypic improvements, and, importantly, an almost normal survival time. Therefore, inhibition of NAA synthase is a promising therapeutic option for CD. The reduced survival rate of Nat8L(-/-)/Aspa(nur7/nur7) mice, however, indicates that complete inhibition of NAA synthase may bear unforeseeable risks for the patient.

The importance of establishing a diagnosis however, becomes even more important as advances are made in effective therapy. Molecular methods of detection, in particular, PCR, are being used routinely and have established a place in the arsenal of tools for diagnosis of CNS infections. In this study a viral etiological agent was detected by PCR in 340 of the total 2,357 specimens from patients who exhibited symptoms of encephalitis or meningitis. The detection rate increased from 8.9% during the first year of the study to 14.8% during the second year of the study with improved methodology and an expanded panel of viral agents. Methods were enhanced by developing real-time PCR assays (some multiplexed), using increased automation, superior nucleic acid extraction, and reverse transcription (RT) methods, and incorporation of an internal extraction control. Additionally, adenovirus and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) were added to the original panel of 10 viruses that included enteroviruses, herpesviruses, and arboviruses. The most common viruses detected were enteroviruses (129; 5.5%), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (85; 3.6%), herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) 1 and 2 (67; 2.8%), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) (44; 1.9%)."}

We tested mannan-peptide conjugates for targeting myelin peptides to APC to induce T cell tolerance and resistance to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Myelin peptides conjugated to mannan in oxidized (OM) or reduced (RM) forms protected mice against EAE in prophylactic and therapeutic protocols, with OM-conjugated peptides giving best results. Protection was peptide-specific and associated with reduced antigen-specific T cell proliferation, but not alterations in Th1, Th17 and Treg cell differentiation or T cell apoptosis compared to EAE controls. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) loaded with OM-MOG showed up-regulated expression of co-stimulatory molecules, reduced PD-L1 expression and enhanced CD40-inducible IL-12 and IL-23 production compared to MOG DC, features consistent with immunogenic DC. OM-MOG induced active T cell tolerance because i.d. administration or passive transfer of OM-MOG DC suppressed ongoing EAE, while OM-MOG-vaccinated mice did not reduce the proliferation of transferred MOG-specific T cells. As in vivo, MOG-specific T cells cultured with OM-MOG DC showed reduced proliferation and equal Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation compared to those with MOG DC, but surprisingly cytokine production was unresponsive to CD40 engagement. Impaired effector T cell function was further evidenced in spinal cord sections from OM-MOG-vaccinated EAE mice, where markedly reduced numbers of CD3(+) T cells were present, restricted to leptomeninges and exceptional parenchymal lesions. Our results show that mannan-conjugated myelin peptides protect mice against EAE through the expansion of antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 cells with impaired proliferation responses and APC-induced co-stimulatory signals that are required for licensing them to become fully pathogenic T cells."}

This has been attributed to: the selection of drug targets that have yet to be shown as causal to the disease as distinct from being the result of the disease process, a lack of congruence in the animal models of Alzheimer's disease, wild-type and transgenic, to the human disease, and the enrollment of patients in proof of concept clinical trials who are at too advanced a stage of the disease to respond to any therapeutic. The development of validated biomarkers that can be used for disease diagnosis and progression is anticipated to improve patient enrollment in clinical trials, to develop new animal models and to identify new disease targets for drug discovery.

At first it was thought that ATP was most likely to play a role in acute pain, following its release from damaged or stressed cells and since then a wide variety of experimental techniques and approaches have been used to study this possibility. Whilst it is clear that exogenous and endogenous ATP can indeed acutely stimulate sensory neurones, more recent reports using gene knockout and antisense oligonucleotide technologies, and a novel, selective P2X3 antagonist, A-317491, all indicate that ATP and P2X3 receptors are more likely to be involved in chronic pain conditions, particularly chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. These reports indicate that P2X3 receptors on sensory nerves may be tonically activated by ATP released from nearby damaged or stressed cells, or perhaps from the sensory nerves themselves. This signal, when transmitted to the CNS, will be perceived consciously as chronic pain. In addition, it is now clear that several subtypes of P2Y receptor are also expressed in sensory neurones. Although their distribution and functions have not been as widely studied as P2X receptors, the effects that they mediate indicate that they might also be considered as therapeutic targets in the treatment of pain. Although our ability to treat persistent painful conditions, such as chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain, has improved in recent years, these conditions are often resistant to currently available therapies, such as opioids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This reflects a limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. It is now clear that the development and maintenance of chronic pain are mediated by multiple factors, but many of these factors, and the receptors and mechanisms through which they act, remain to be identified. Chronic pain is debilitating and can greatly decrease quality of life, not just due to the pain per se, but also because of the depression that can often ensue. Thus a greater understanding of the mechanisms that underlie chronic pain will help identify new targets for novel analgesics, which will be of great therapeutic benefit to many people."}

To target this complicated multifaceted signaling cascade, the most promising therapeutics target multiple pathways involved in the secondary injury cascade, such as neuroinflammation, the generation of ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. Compelling experimental data demonstrates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pivotal link in the neuropathological sequelae of brain injury. A group of PPAR agonists, specifically rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have shown an extreme amount of promise in the realm of drug discovery for CNS injury due to their ability to increase functional recovery and decrease lesion volumes following injury. The therapeutic effects of these PPAR agonists are thought to be a direct result of PPAR activity however new data is arising that shows some of the effects may be independent of PPAR activity, targeting a novel mitochondrial protein called mitoNEET.

Therefore, immunohistochemistry with an anti-DNA receptor antibody was performed on MRL.MpJ-Fas(lpr) (MRL/lpr) autoimmune mice to determine 1) which inner ear structures contain DNA receptors and 2) whether the receptor staining pattern changes as autoimmune disease progresses and hearing thresholds increase.	A prospective study of the progression of hearing loss in autoimmune mice and correlated alterations in immunostaining for the inner ear DNA receptor.	One group of MRL/lpr mice (n = 10) was allowed to develop autoimmune disease, and auditory brainstem response (ABR) audiometry was performed at 4, 6, and 9 months of age to measure the progression of hearing loss. A second group (n = 5) was tested for ABR thresholds at 2 months of age and immediately killed to assess receptor staining before the onset of autoimmune disease and hearing loss. The inner ears from all mice were immunohistochemically stained with an anti-DNA receptor antibody, and a qualitative analysis of the staining of cochlear structures was performed.	Auditory brainstem response audiometry revealed a significant 20- to 30-dB elevation of thresholds as systemic disease progressed. Anti-DNA receptor staining was heaviest in the spiral ligament and less intense in the spiral ganglion and cochlear nerve. Both groups showed a similar pattern of staining in these structures. The stria vascularis and hair cells also stained in both groups. However, the stria cells of normal-hearing mice showed diffuse intracellular immunoreactivity, whereas older mice displayed less staining that was confined to the cell membranes.	The inner ears of MRL/lpr mice contain DNA receptors. Autoimmune hearing loss was correlated with weaker overall intracellular staining in the stria vascularis and hair cells but increased staining of the cell membranes. This suggested DNA receptors have impaired endocytosis and more receptors remain on the cell membrane, possibly as a result of binding by circulating autoantibodies."}

Hemodynamic variables, blood lactate, and glucose levels were monitored throughout the 40 min NCFI occlusion period. After 48 h, rats were killed and the extent of neuronal injury was determined in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. Hemodynamic variables recorded during ischemia improved with clonidine treatment in both normo- and hyperglycemic groups. Glutamate and aspartate levels were greatly increased over control values during normo- and hyperglycemic NCFI treatment. Clonidine pretreatment suppressed the release of both glutamate and aspartate during NCFI in normo- and hyperglycemic rodents when compared with NCFI-treated normo- and hyperglycemic rats without the drug. Significant neuroprotection of cells in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus was also observed in drug-treated animals 48 h postischemia. The combined effects of diminished glutamate release after NCFI and reduced neuronal injury in both normo- and hyperglycemic states suggests that clonidine treatment during NCFI is neuroprotective. The neuroprotective effect of clonidine during ischemia may be ascribed to both a sensitization of central sympathetic activity and a reduced release of glutamate thereby reducing NMDA receptor activation and neuronal damage."}

Translocation of GLUT8 to the plasma membrane (PM) was found in insulin-treated mouse blastocysts. Using overexpression of GLUT8 in adipocytes and neuronal cells however, insulin treatment or depolarization of the cells did not lead to GLUT8 PM translocation in other studies. In addition, other experiments showing dynamin-dependent endocytosis of GLUT8 suggested that GLUT8 recycles between an endosomal compartment and the PM. To reveal the functional/physiological role of GLUT8, we studied its subcellular localization in 3T3L1, HEK293 and CHO cells. We show that GLUT8 does not co-localize with GLUT4 and does not redistribute to the PM after treatment with insulin, ionophores or okadaic acid in these cell lines. Once endocytosed, GLUT8 does not recycle to the PM. GLUT8 localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes. An interspecies GLUT8 - sequence alignment revealed the presence of a highly conserved late endosomal/lysosomal-targeting motif ([DE]XXXL[LI]). Changing the glutamate to arginine as found in GLUT4 (RRXXXLL) alters GLUT8 endocytosis and retains the transporter at the PM. Furthermore, sorting GLUT8 to late endosomes/lysosomes does not require prior presence of GLUT8 at the PM followed by its endocytosis. In summary, GLUT8 does not reside in a recycling vesicle pool and is distinct from GLUT4. From our data, we postulate a role for GLUT8 in transport of hexoses across intracellular membranes, for example in specific compartments of GLUT8 expression such as the acrosome of mature spermatozoa or secretory granules in neurons. Furthermore, a role for GLUT8 in hexose transport across the lysosomal membrane, a transport mechanism that has long been suggested but unexplained, is discussed."}

It is primarily due to the degeneration of highly specialised mechanosensory cells in the cochlea, the so-called hair cells. Hearing problems can also be caused or further aggravated by the death of auditory sensory neurons that convey the information from the hair cells to the brain stem. Despite the discovery of stem/progenitor cells in the mammalian cochlea, no regeneration of either damaged hair cells or auditory neurons has been observed in mammals, in contrast to what is seen in avians and non-mammalian vertebrates. The reasons for this divergence have not yet been elucidated, although loss of stem cells and/or loss of their phenotypic plasticity in adult mammals have been put forward as possible explanations. Given the high incidence of this disorder and its economic and social implications, a considerable number of research lines have been set up aimed towards the regeneration of cochlear sensory cell types. This review summarizes the various routes that have been explored, ranging from the genetic modification of endogenous cells remaining in the inner ear in order to promote their transdifferentiation, to the implantation of exogenous stem or progenitor cells and their subsequent differentiation within the host tissue. Prophylactic treatments to fight against progressive sensory cell degeneration in the inner ear are also discussed."}

Most patients die within 3-5 years due to respiratory paralysis. Although the death of motor neurons is a hallmark of ALS, other organs may also contribute to the disease progression. We examined the gut of an ALS mouse model, G93A, which expresses mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1(G93A)), and discovered a damaged tight junction structure and increased permeability with a significant reduction in the expression levels of tight junction protein ZO-1 and the adherens junction protein E-cadherin. Furthermore, our data demonstrated increased numbers of abnormal Paneth cells in the intestine of G93A mice. Paneth cells are specialized intestinal epithelial cells that can sense microbes and secrete antimicrobial peptides, thus playing key roles in host innate immune responses and shaping the gut microbiome. A decreased level of the antimicrobial peptides defensin 5 alpha was indeed found in the ALS intestine. These changes were associated with a shifted profile of the intestinal microbiome, including reduced levels of Butyrivibrio Fibrisolvens, Escherichia coli, and Fermicus, in G93A mice. The relative abundance of bacteria was shifted in G93A mice compared to wild-type mice.

One neuroendocrinological theory of aging is based on findings that the loss of hypothalamic neurotransmitter functions and an imbalance in hormonal secretion contribute to the cessation of reproductive cycles and the development of mammary and pituitary tumors. One potential cause of immunosenescence is an age-related decline in the regulatory functions of sympathetic noradrenergic nerve fibers whose neurotransmitters signal lymphoid cells in the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. In addition to impairment caused by the generation of free radicals during numerous biochemical processes, there is a shift in the pro-oxidant/anti-oxidant balance resulting in cellular oxidative stress and hastening the aging process. Altered interactions between the neuroendocrine system and the immune system are associated with increased incidence, development, and growth of breast cancer and other neoplastic diseases. We have demonstrated that the disruption in the neuroendocrine-immune interactions in old rats, and in female rats with mammary tumors, can be reversed by deprenyl, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Deprenyl treatment leads to enhanced central and peripheral catecholaminergic activity and a readjustment of immunological responses.

Additionally, an intervention switching to a ketogenic diet following 8 weeks of high-fat diet was performed to compare how a control diet, exercise, or a ketogenic diet affects metabolic syndrome-induced neural complications. When challenged with a ketogenic diet, mice had reduced bodyweight and fat mass compared to high-fat-fed mice, and were similar to exercised, high-fat-fed mice.

One such anti-diabetic agent is sitagliptin, which acts through inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV to increase GLP-1 levels. Given this action, sitagliptin would be predicted to reduce AD pathology. Accordingly, we investigated whether sitagliptin is effective in attenuating AD pathologies, focusing on tau phosphorylation in the OLETF type 2 diabetic rat model. Unexpectedly, we found that sitagliptin was not effective against pathological tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus of OLETF type 2 diabetes rats, and instead aggravated it. This paradoxically increased tau phosphorylation was attributed to activation of the tau kinase, GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β). Sitagliptin also increased ser-616 phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, suggesting increased insulin resistance in the brain. These phenomena were recapitulated in primary rat cortical neurons treated with sitagliptin, further confirming sitagliptin's effects on AD-related pathologies in neurons. These results highlight the need for caution in considering the use of sitagliptin in AD therapy."}

The results suggested that brain COX-2 mRNA levels were markedly increased in the hippocampal neurons and the concentration of PGE2 was elevated significantly, and that the incidence of AD and seizure behavior induction and the total AD duration were significantly decreased under conditions of COX-2 deficiency. Therefore, we concluded that inducible COX-2 facilitates the recurrence of hippocampal seizures."}

Most infections begin at mucosal surfaces, and this is certainly not only a stroke of good fortune if mother's milk serves as a natural delivery vehicle for antibodies protecting the gastrointestinal tract of nursing infants. Mammary gland or other mucous secretions containing numerous antibody specificities provide an efficient mean to immediately protect a mucosal surface against pathogens, which have never been encountered by the host. From a public health perspective, topical passive immunization of mucosal surfaces with monoclonal antibodies can block entry and transmission of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that infect humans, and thus defeat some key immune evasion strategies designed by many pathogens. The chief antibody on most mucosal surfaces is secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), a polypeptide complex comprising dimeric IgA, the connecting J chain, and the secretory component. The molecular stability, tetravalency, and strong anti-inflammatory properties make SIgA particularly well suited to fulfill the function of passive protective immunity when applied exogenously to mucosal surfaces. The review will give an overview of the basic concepts underlying mucosal immunity, present the molecular mechanisms whereby SIgA prevents mucosal infections, cover the last advances in the topic of recombinant SIgA production, and examine how structure-function relationship in SIgA will help designing molecules with novel properties for passive immunotherapy."}

RCWs with an elevated sole construction often induce leg length discrepancy (LLD) that could significantly affects plantar pressure (PP) distribution in diabetic patients with neuropathy.	To study the additional effect of walking speed on PP abnormalities induced by LLD.	The study included 16 patients with diabetes (59±8.8years; 8 men and 8 women), with unilateral CN offloaded by RCW. In-shoe PP distribution was measured using F-scan (Tekscan Inc.), whilst patients walked at their normal speed (53±4 steps/min), versus short slow steps (24±3/min) under the two walking conditions: (1) neglected LLD, and (2) corrected LLD.	The greatest reduction in PP was seen during reduction of walking speed, with corrected LLD, followed by corrected LLD with normal walking speed, followed by neglected LLD with slowing of walking speed. The highest PP was found when the patient remain on their normal walking speed and LLD was neglected.	The contralateral foot of CN offloaded with RCW, is subjected to high pressure loads beneath the hallux, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th metatarsal heads. As such, care should be taken not only to avoid minor LLD, but to also advise the patient to practice short slow steps while walking, so that pressure overload on contralateral limb and its possible contribution to the development of bilateral Charcot, could be minimized."}

Previously, two hallmarks of AD pathology including extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) inside neurons have been identified. With a better understanding of this disease, neuroinflammation has been a focus, and as its initial event, innate immune activation plays an indispensable role. In brain, as an endogenous stimulator, extracellular Aβ deposition activates innate immunity through binding to the pattern recognition receptors (PRR), thus leading to the production and release of substantial inflammatory mediators (NO and ROS) and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-10, IL-33 and TNF-α) contributing to the development of AD. Epidemiologic evidence has suggested an affirmative influence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on delaying the progression of AD. Therefore, blocking the inflammatory process may be an effective way to delay or even cure AD. In this review, we mainly elucidate the mechanism underlying these immune responses in AD pathogenesis and attempt to seek the therapeutic methods targeting neuroinflammation."}

In addition to a possible direct antioxidant effect, quercetin may also act by stimulating cellular defenses against oxidative stress. Two such pathways include the induction of Nrf2-ARE and induction of the antioxidant/anti-inflammatory enzyme paraoxonase 2 (PON2).

To predict chemosensitivity in each patient with colorectal cancer, we developed an evaluation method using the primary tumor-initiating cells (TIC, aka cancer stem cells) xenografted in nude mice subcutaneously (patient-derived spheroid xenografts; PDSX). Simultaneously, we also prepared the conventional patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from the same patients' tumors and compared the dosing results with those of PDSXs. We further compared the chemosensitivities of PDSXs with those of 7 patients who had been given regimens such as FOLFOX and FOLFIRI to treat their metastatic lesions. As per the results, the PDSX method provided much more precise and predictable tumor growth with less variance than conventional PDX, although both retained the epithelial characteristics of the primary tumors. Likewise, drug-dosing tests showed essentially the same results in PDXs and PDSXs, with stronger statistical power in PDSXs. Notably, the cancer chemosensitivity in each patient was precisely reflected in that of the PDSX mice along the clinical course until the resistance emerged at the terminal stage. This 'paraclinical' xenograft trials using PDSXs may help selection of chemotherapy regimens efficacious for each patient, and, more importantly, avoiding inefficient ones by which the patient can lose precious time and QOL.

These models have shown that the initial traumatic injury to cord tissue is followed by a long period of secondary injury that includes a number of cellular and biochemical cascades. These secondary injury processes are potential targets for therapies. Continued refinement of rat and mouse models of SCI, along with more detailed analyses of the biology of the lesion in these models, points to both necrotic and apoptotic mechanisms of cell death after SCI. In this chapter, we review recent evidence for long-term apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes in long tracts undergoing Wallerian degeneration following SCI. This process appears to be related closely to activation of microglial cells. It is has been thought that microglial cells might be the source of cytotoxic cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), that kill oligodendrocytes. However, more recent evidence in vivo suggests that TNF-alpha by itself may not induce necrosis or apoptosis in oligodendrocytes. We review data that suggests other possible pathways for apoptosis, such as the neurotrophin receptor p75 which is expressed in both neurons and oligodendrocytes after SCI in rats and mice. In addition, it appears that microglial activation and TNF-alpha may be important in acute SCI. Ninety minutes after a moderate contusion lesion, microglia are activated and surround dying neurons. In an 'atraumatic' model of SCI, we have now shown that TNF-alpha appears to greatly potentiate cell death mediated by glutamate receptors. These studies emphasize that multiple mechanisms and interactions contribute to secondary injury after SCI. Continued study of both contusion models and other new approaches to studying these mechanisms will be needed to maximize strategies for acute and chronic therapies, and for neural repair."}

Although data assimilation has been used to study other biological systems, the study of the sleep-wake regulatory network has yet to benefit from this toolset. We present a data assimilation framework based on the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for combining sparse measurements together with a relatively high-dimensional nonlinear computational model to estimate the state of a model of the sleep-wake regulatory system. We demonstrate with simulation studies that a few noisy variables can be used to accurately reconstruct the remaining hidden variables. We introduce a metric for ranking relative partial observability of computational models, within the UKF framework, that allows us to choose the optimal variables for measurement and also provides a methodology for optimizing framework parameters such as UKF covariance inflation. In addition, we demonstrate a parameter estimation method that allows us to track non-stationary model parameters and accommodate slow dynamics not included in the UKF filter model. Finally, we show that we can even use observed discretized sleep-state, which is not one of the model variables, to reconstruct model state and estimate unknown parameters. Sleep is implicated in many neurological disorders from epilepsy to schizophrenia, but simultaneous observation of the many brain components that regulate this behavior is difficult. We anticipate that this data assimilation framework will enable better understanding of the detailed interactions governing sleep and wake behavior and provide for better, more targeted, therapies."}

Recent studies of the electrophysiology and immunology of these diseases suggest that antibody-induced reversible dysfunction of nodes of Ranvier may play a role in conduction block and disability which responds to immunotherapy more rapidly than would be expected for demyelination or axonal damage per se. Clinical reports suggest that in some cases, the effects of each dose of IVIG may be transient, wearing-off before the next dose is due. These observations lead us to hypothesize that that therapeutic IgG acts by competing with pathologic autoantibodies and that individual patients may require different IgG levels for optimal therapeutic effects. Frequent IVIG dosing and weekly subcutaneous IgG have been tried as ways of continuously maintaining high serum IgG levels, resulting in stabilization of neuromuscular function in small case series.

The therapeutic target, amyloid β (Aβ), starts to accumulate in AD brains long before the onset of cognitive decline. γ-secretase inhibitors, γ-secretase modulators, and β-secretase inhibitors aim to reduce the production of toxic Aβ species by modifying the processing of amyloid precursor protein. Another strategy is to eliminate accumulated Aβ by active or passive immunotherapeutic approaches. Therapeutic strategies targeting tau protein are also currently emerging. Despite these efforts, successful disease-modifying therapies for AD have not yet been developed. Recently, very early interventional trials targeting preclinical stages of AD have begun; the paradigm shift in AD therapies from cure to prevention could be key to the success of disease modification."}

However, the data on the existence of monoenzymatic neurons in the striatum remain controversial, and little is known about their functional significance. The aim of this study was to test our hypothesis that monoenzymatic TH-containing neurons produce DA in cooperation with the neurons containing AADC, which might help to compensate DA deficiency under the failure of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Using a combination of techniques: retrograde tracing, qPCR and immunolabeling for TH, AADC and MAP2, we showed that the striatum of mice with normal and degraded dopaminergic system comprises of monoenzymatic TH- and AADC-containing neurons. To provide evidence for cooperative synthesis of DA, we used an ex vivo model of inhibiting of DA synthesis by blocking transport of l-DOPA, produced in monoenzymatic TH-containing neurons, to neurons containing AADC by means of l-leucine, a competitive inhibitor of the membrane transporter of large neutral amino acids, and l-DOPA. With this original approach, cooperative synthesis of DA in the striatum was proven in MPTP-treated mice but not in the control. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the proportion of DA produced through cooperative synthesis in the striatum of MPTP-treated mice increases as the degradation of dopaminergic system proceeds. An increase in the proportion of cooperative synthesis of DA alongside degradation of the dopaminergic system is also proved by an increase of both TH gene expression and the number of TH-immunoreactive structures in the striatum. Thus, these data suggest that the cooperative synthesis of DA in the degraded striatum is an up-regulated compensatory reaction, which plays an increasing role as DA deficiency rises, and might be considered among the principal mechanisms of neuroplasticity in neurodegenerative diseases."}

Exposing the cells to MPP+ triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation within 60 min of treatment and the said effect was blocked by mazindol, a dopamine uptake blocker. In addition, pretreatment with 50-100 microM of selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, significantly suppressed MPP+-mediated ROS generation. These effects of MPP+ result in the generation of ROS, which may be involved in neuronal degeneration seen in Parkinson's disease."}

Although such Ig products were shown to be effective, with both nutritional and antidiarrheal benefits, interest waned because of their cost and because of the perceived risk of bovine serum encephalitis (BSE). BSE is no longer considered a barrier to use of oral Ig, because the WHO has declared the United States to be BSE-free since the early 2000s. Low-cost bovine-derived products with high Ig content have been developed and are regulated as medical foods. These new products, called serum bovine Igs (SBIs), facilitate the management of chronic or severe gastrointestinal disturbances in both children and adults and are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Well-established applications for use of SBIs include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated enteropathy and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. However, SBIs and other similar products could potentially become important components of the treatment regimen for other conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, by aiding in disease control without immunosuppressive side effects. In addition, SBIs may be helpful in conditions associated with the depletion of circulating and luminal Igs and could potentially play an important role in critical care nutrition. The rationale for their use is to facilitate intraluminal microbial antibody coating, an essential process in immune recognition in the gut which is disturbed in these conditions, thereby leading to intestinal inflammation. Thus, oral Ig may emerge as an important 'add-on' therapy for a variety of gastrointestinal and nutritional problems during the next decade."}

Neither the specificity nor the mechanisms triggering or perpetuating the immune response are understood. Genetic studies have so far not identified therapeutic targets outside the HLA complex, but epidemiological and immunological studies have suggested putative pathogenetic factors which may be important in therapy or prevention, including the Epstein-Barr virus and vitamin D. Advances in the treatment of MS have been reached by manipulating the immune response where the pathogenesis of MS intersects experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, most recently by blocking T-cell migration through the blood-brain barrier. Antigen-specific approaches are effective in experimental models driven by a focused immune response against defined autoantigens, but MS may not fit into this concept. Novel candidate autoantigens which are not constitutively expressed in the brain, such as protein alpha-B crystallin or IgG V-region idiotopes, as well as evidence of pathogenetic heterogeneity and complexity, suggest that treating MS by tolerizing the immune system against an universal MS antigen may be a fata morgana. Further characterization of MS subtypes may lead to individualized treatment. However, shared immunological features, such as intrathecal production of oligoclonal IgG, suggest that potential therapeutic targets may be shared by most MS patients."}

Muscle is the major metabolic organ&mdash;it consumes more calories than other organs&mdash;and therefore, there is a clear need to discuss these interactions and provide some direction for future research areas regarding muscle pathologies. In addition, new experiments and manuscripts continually reveal additional highly intricate, reciprocal interactions between metabolism and muscle. These reciprocal interactions include exercise, age, sex, diet, and pathologies including atrophy, hypoxia, obesity, diabetes, and muscle myopathies. Central to this review are the metabolic changes that occur in the skeletal muscle cells of muscular dystrophy patients and mouse models. Many of these metabolic changes are pathogenic (inappropriate body mass changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and increased Ca[2+]) and others are compensatory (increased phosphorylated AMP activated protein kinase (pAMPK), increased slow fiber numbers, and increased utrophin). Therefore, reversing or enhancing these changes with therapies will aid the patients. The multiple therapeutic targets to reverse or enhance the metabolic pathways will be discussed. Among the therapeutic targets are increasing pAMPK, utrophin, mitochondrial number and slow fiber characteristics, and inhibiting reactive oxygen species. Because new data reveals many additional intricate levels of interactions, new questions are rapidly arising. How does muscular dystrophy alter metabolism, and are the changes compensatory or pathogenic? How does metabolism affect muscular dystrophy? Of course, the most profound question is whether clinicians can therapeutically target nutrition and metabolism for muscular dystrophy patient benefit? Obtaining the answers to these questions will greatly aid patients with muscular dystrophy."}

The roles of intraplatelet BH(4) in platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, however, are unknown. Accordingly, we investigated whether intraplatelet BH(4) is involved in regulating cyclic flow variations (CFVs) and platelet aggregation in a canine model with stenosed and endothelium-injured coronary arteries that mimics acute coronary syndromes in humans.	After developing CFVs, dogs received saline or BH(4) (10 or 30 mg/kg) intravenously. Intraplatelet BH(4) and cGMP levels were decreased and intraplatelet nitrotyrosine production was increased during CFVs. ADP- and U46619-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation and platelet P-selectin expression were augmented during CFVs. BH(4) administration restored intraplatelet BH(4) and cGMP levels and decreased intraplatelet nitrotyrosine production, resulting in reduced CFVs and inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation and platelet P-selectin expression. CFVs again developed after N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of NOS, in BH(4)-treated dogs.

Addition of alpha-sialylcholesterol stimulated high K (50 mM)-evoked acetylcholine (ACh) release from synaptosomes at concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 microM. The beta-anomer of the sialyl compound also increased the neurotransmitter release at 5 microM, but the effect was much smaller than that of the alpha-anomer. Beta-sialylcholesterol appeared to increase high-affinity choline uptake and Ach synthesis, resulting in an increment in the release of ACh. On the other hand, alpha-sialylcholesterol did not change the synthetic rate of ACh, and instead it increased the depolarization=induced influx of calcium ions into synaptosomes, while the beta-anomer did not affect the divalent cation influx. The enhanced calcium influx is thought to increase ACh release from synaptosomes treated with alpha-sialylcholesterol. These results imply that the two anomers of sialylcholesterol may modulate the synaptic membrane machinery differently, that is, the alpha-anomer may activate voltage-dependent calcium channels and the beta-anomer may facilitate high-affinity choline uptake. In order to evaluate the ameliorating effect of sialylcholesterol, alpha-sialylcholesterol was applied to the synaptosomes from aged mice (34 months old), which have been shown to have a decreased ACh release (Tanaka et al., 1995, J Neurosci Res, in press [1]). The reduced neurotransmitter release recovered to the levels of younger animals, suggesting that sialylcholesterol might have a potential therapeutic use for restoring synaptic function that occurs in aged brains."}

RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool to silence gene expression and a potential therapy for virus infection. In this study, the antiviral ability of eight shRNA expression plasmids targeting different sites of the NS3 and NS4A genes of JEV was determined in BHK21 cells and mice. The pGP-NS3-3 and pGP-NS4A-4 suppressed 93.9% and 82.0% of JEV mRNA in cells, respectively. The virus titer in cells was reduced approximately 950-fold by pretreating with pGP-NS3-4, and 640-fold by pretreating with pGP-NS4A-4. The results of western blot and immunofluorescence analysis showed JEV E protein and viral load in cells were remarkably inhibited by shRNA expression plasmids. The viral load in brains of mice pretreated with pGP-NS3-4 or pGP-NS4A-4 were reduced approximately 2400-fold and 800-fold, respectively, and the survival rate of mice challenged with JEV were 70% and 50%, respectively. However, the antiviral ability of shRNA expression plasmids was decreased over time. This study indicates that RNAi targeting of the NS3 and NS4A genes of JEV can sufficiently inhibit the replication of JEV in vitro and in vivo, and NS3 and NS4A genes might be potential targets of molecular therapy for JEV infection."}

This study aimed to explore their anti-migraine effect and active constituents. A nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced migraine model in rats was established to evaluate pharmacological effects. Cerebral blood flow was detected by a laser Doppler perfusion monitor. The levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), nitric oxide (NO), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and β-endorphin (β-EP) were quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CGRP and c-Fos mRNA expression were quantified with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of active constituents in rat serum and cerebral cortex. CRCR significantly increased cerebral blood flow, decreased the levels of ET-1, GABA and NOS, and increased the levels of 5-HT, 5-HIAA and β-EP in NTG-induced migraine rats. CGRP levels and CGRP mRNA expression, as well as c-Fos mRNA expression in the brainstem were markedly down-regulated with the treatment of CRCR. After oral administration of CRCR, ferulic acid (FA), senkyunolide A (SA), 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), Z-ligustilide (LIG), Z-3-butylidenephthalide (BDPH), cyperotundone (CYT), nookatone (NKT) and α-cyperone (CYP) were qualified in rat serum and cerebral cortex. The above results suggested that CRCR showed powerfully therapeutic effects on migraine via increasing the cerebral blood flow, decreasing the expression of CGRP and c-Fos mRNA, and regulating the releasing of ET-1, GABA, NOS, 5-HT, 5-HIAA, CGRP and β-EP in the serum and brainstem, consequently relieving neurogenic inflammation. The active constituents in CRCR for treating migraine were FA, SA, NBP, LIG, BDPH, CYT, NKT and CYP. These findings contributed for the further use of CRCR as a combinational and complementary phytomedicine for migraine treatment."}

There are few treatments and none reverse the loss of vision. Photoreceptor replacement by transplantation is proposed as a broad treatment strategy applicable to all degenerations. Recently, we demonstrated restoration of vision following rod-photoreceptor transplantation into a mouse model of stationary night-blindness, raising the critical question of whether photoreceptor replacement is equally effective in different types and stages of degeneration. We present a comprehensive assessment of rod-photoreceptor transplantation across six murine models of inherited photoreceptor degeneration. Transplantation is feasible in all models examined but disease type has a major impact on outcome, as assessed both by the morphology and number of integrated rod-photoreceptors. Integration can increase (Prph2(+/Δ307)), decrease (Crb1(rd8/rd8), Gnat1(-/-), Rho(-/-)), or remain constant (PDE6β(rd1/rd1), Prph2(rd2/rd2)) with disease progression, depending upon the gene defect, with no correlation with severity. Robust integration is possible even in late-stage disease. Glial scarring and outer limiting membrane integrity, features that change with degeneration, significantly affect transplanted photoreceptor integration. Combined breakdown of these barriers markedly increases integration in a model with an intact outer limiting membrane, strong gliotic response, and otherwise poor transplantation outcome (Rho(-/-)), leading to an eightfold increase in integration and restoration of visual function. Thus, it is possible to achieve robust integration across a broad range of inherited retinopathies. Moreover, transplantation outcome can be improved by administering appropriate, tailored manipulations of the recipient environment."}

White matter (WM) reactive astrocytes are important players in amplifying autoimmune demyelination and may exhibit different changes in transcriptome profiles and cell function in a disease-context dependent manner. However, their transcriptomic profile has not yet been defined because they are difficult to purify, compared to gray matter astrocytes. Here, we isolated WM astrocytes by laser capture microdissection (LCM) in a murine model of multiple sclerosis to better define their molecular profile focusing on selected genes related to inflammation. Based on previous data indicating anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen only at high nanomolar doses, we also examined mRNA expression for enzymes involved in steroid inactivation.	Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in female C57BL6 mice with MOG35-55 immunization. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of a portion of individual spinal cords at peak disease was used to assess the composition of immune cell infiltrates. Using custom Taqman low-density-array (TLDA), we analyzed mRNA expression of 40 selected genes from immuno-labeled laser-microdissected WM astrocytes from lumbar spinal cord sections of EAE and control mice. Immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence on control and EAE mouse spinal cord sections were used to confirm protein expression in astrocytes.	The spinal cords of EAE mice were infiltrated mostly by effector/memory T CD4+ cells and macrophages. TLDA-based profiling of LCM-astrocytes identified EAE-induced gene expression of cytokines and chemokines as well as inflammatory mediators recently described in gray matter reactive astrocytes in other murine CNS disease models. Strikingly, SULT1A1, but not other members of the sulfotransferase family, was expressed in WM spinal cord astrocytes. Moreover, its expression was further increased in EAE. Immunohistochemistry on spinal cord tissues confirmed preferential expression of this enzyme in WM astrocytic processes but not in gray matter astrocytes.	We described here for the first time the mRNA expression of several genes in WM astrocytes in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Besides expected pro-inflammatory chemokines and specific inflammatory mediators increased during EAE, we evidenced relative high astrocytic expression of the cytoplasmic enzyme SULT1A1. As the sulfonation activity of SULT1A1 inactivates estradiol among other phenolic substrates, its high astrocytic expression may account for the relative resistance of this cell population to the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of estradiol. Blocking the activity of this enzyme during neuroinflammation may thus help the injured CNS to maintain the anti-inflammatory activity of endogenous estrogens or limit the dose of estrogen co-regimens for therapeutical purposes."}

Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that can infect any mammalian nucleated cell with average worldwide seroprevalence rates of 30%. Infection by Toxoplasma is characterized by the lifelong presence of parasitic cysts within neurons in the brain, requiring a competent immune system to prevent parasite reactivation and encephalitis. In the immunocompetent individual, Toxoplasma infection is largely asymptomatic, however many recent studies suggest a strong correlation with certain neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in the primary astrocytic glutamate transporter, GLT-1, following infection with Toxoplasma. Using microdialysis of the murine frontal cortex over the course of infection, a significant increase in extracellular concentrations of glutamate is observed. Consistent with glutamate dysregulation, analysis of neurons reveal changes in morphology including a reduction in dendritic spines, VGlut1 and NeuN immunoreactivity. Furthermore, behavioral testing and EEG recordings point to significant changes in neuronal output. Finally, these changes in neuronal connectivity are dependent on infection-induced downregulation of GLT-1 as treatment with the ß-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone, rescues extracellular glutamate concentrations, neuronal pathology and function.

The pathophysiology of chronic pain shows alterations of normal physiological pathways, giving rise to hyperalgesia or allodynia. After integration in the spinal cord, nociceptive information is transferred to thalamic structures before it reaches the somatosensory cortex. Each of these levels of the CNS contain modulatory mechanisms. The two most important systems in modulating nociception and antinociception, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and opioid receptor system, show a close distribution pattern in nearly all CNS regions, and activation of NMDA receptors has been found to contribute to the hyperalgesia associated with nerve injury or inflammation. Apart from substance P (SP), the major facilitatory effect in nociception is exerted by glutamate as the natural activator of NMDA receptors. Stimulation of ionotropic NMDA receptors causes intraneuronal elevation of Ca2+ which stimulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the production of nitric oxide (NO). NO as a gaseous molecule diffuses out from the neuron and by action on guanylyl cyclase, NO stimulates in neighboring neurons the formation of cGMP. Depending on the expression of cGMP-controlled ion channels in target neurons, NO may act excitatory or inhibitory. NO has been implicated in the development of hyperexcitability, resulting in hyperalgesia or allodynia, by increasing nociceptive transmitters at their central terminals. Among the three subtypes of opioid receptors, mu- and delta-receptors either inhibit or potentiate NMDA receptor-mediated events, while kappa opioids antagonize NMDA receptor-mediated activity. Recently, CRH has been found to act at all levels of the neuraxis to produce analgesia. Modulation of nociception occurs at all levels of the neuraxis, thus, eliciting the multidimensional experience of pain involving sensory-discriminative, affective-motivational, cognitive and locomotor components."}

AD exacts a considerable toll in direct medical costs, quality of life, and caregiver burden for persons and society. In addition to the obvious clinical benefit, therapeutic agents for AD and related dementias represent a considerable market opportunity for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. There are currently 8-10 million AD sufferers in the seven major pharmaceutical markets. The market will grow rapidly in coming decades, as the developed world experiences an enormous increase in its elderly population. Given the great need for new therapeutic agents to manage and prevent AD, the Institute for the Study of Aging and the Fidelity Foundation organized a workshop, 'Barriers to the Discovery and Development of Drugs for Alzheimer's Disease,' to examine ways to expedite drug discovery and development. The identified barriers and potential solutions will be discussed here and in the accompanying articles in more detail."}

Allopurinol (ALLO), a xanthine oxidase (XO) enzyme inhibitor, has been found to reduce proinflammatory molecules and oxidative stress in the vasculature. We here examined the effect of pre-treatment with allopurinol on the cortical microinfarction. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a permanent single penetrating arteriole occlusion induced by two-photon laser irradiation. Infarction volume, the activation of glial cells and nitrosative stress in the ischemic brain was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Pre-treatment with ALLO achieved 42% reduction of infarct volume and significantly reduced microglia infiltration, astrocyte proliferation and nitrosative stress in the ischemic brain. These data indicate that ALLO protects against microinfarcts possibly through inhibition of nitrosative stress and attenuation of microglia infiltration as well as astrocytes reactivation."}

Even after decades of AD research, there are still limited options for treating dementia. Mounting evidence has indicated that AD patients develop central and peripheral metabolic dysfunction, and the underpinnings of such events have recently begun to emerge. Basic and preclinical studies have unveiled key pathophysiological mechanisms that include aberrant brain stress signaling, inflammation, and impaired insulin sensitivity. These findings are in accordance with clinical and neuropathological data suggesting that AD patients undergo central and peripheral metabolic deregulation. Here, we review recent basic and clinical findings indicating that metabolic defects are central to AD pathophysiology. We further propose a view for future therapeutics that incorporates metabolic defects as a core feature of AD pathogenesis. This approach could improve disease understanding and therapy development through drug repurposing and/or identification of novel metabolic targets."}

The effect of phenytoin on the generation and spread of seizure activity was studied in a rat model of this type of seizures. Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats were implanted with a stimulation and recording electrode in the basolateral amygdala. Naive Sprague-Dawley rats showed an increase in current intensity necessary for eliciting afterdischarges (afterdischarge threshold) of about 200% after administration of phenytoin (75 mg/kg i.p.), while seizure severity at threshold was increased compared to controls. Afterdischarge and seizure durations were significantly prolonged under phenytoin. This result suggests that phenytoin can exert a potent anticonvulsant effect on the generation of focal seizure activity, but it does not suppress or may even increase ongoing afterdischarge activity once it occurs. Following amygdala kindling in Wistar rats, administration of phenytoin again resulted in an increase in the afterdischarge threshold. However, all rats still showed generalized seizures, and epileptic afterdischarges could be recorded in various limbic brain regions at threshold current. This result suggests that phenytoin can increase the threshold for generation of epileptic discharges in kindled rats, but is not able to prevent the development of generalized seizure activity and the spread of afterdischarges within the limbic system when focal activity is initiated. We conclude that phenytoin is able to suppress focal seizure activity in the amygdala kindling model of the rat. However, it does not prevent the spread of seizure activity originating in the limbic system. Therefore, a decrease in focal seizure susceptibility seems to be the primary target for phenytoin's anticonvulsant action."}

A predominance of type 2 T cell responses was demonstrated in splenic T cells of mice infected with 3.0 LD(50) of influenza virus, although these responses were minimal in mice infected with 0.5 LD(50) of the virus. After the treatment with the mixture of type 2 cytokines, an increase in the type 2 T cell responses in mice exposed to 0.5 LD(50) of the virus was shown.

Cerebral blood flow (autoradiography [(14)C]-iodoantipyrine), number of perfused capillaries (FITC-dextran fluorescence technique), brain water content (wet vs. dry weight) and the blood to brain transfer constant K(i) for [(51)Cr]-EDTA were analyzed in the injured and the contralateral cortex.

The number of perfused capillaries decreased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. K(i) increased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. Brain water content was lower in the L-arginine group than in the vehicle group 3 h after trauma and there was no difference between the groups 24 h after trauma. We conclude that L-arginine reduces brain edema formation and improves cortical blood flow in the early phase after a brain trauma, whereas no circulatory effects can be seen after prolonged treatment."}

NF-kappaB is a common element of the promoter region of inflammatory cytokines which can be stimulated by ethanol. Recently, we have shown that PDTC can ameliorate cerebrovascular damage, brain cortical damage, leukocyte adhesion and rolling, and stroke induced by ethanol. We, therefore, tested the effects of preincubation with PDTC on alcohol-induced changes in intracellular free calcium ions ([Ca2+]i) in cultured canine cerebral smooth muscle cells. These vascular cells, chronically treated with ethanol (10-100 mM) for 24 and 72 h, exhibited concentration-dependent rises in [Ca2+]i. PDTC (0.1 microM) itself failed to influence resting levels of [Ca2+]i in these vascular muscle cells. PDTC (0.1 microM) pretreatment, however, inhibited completely the elevations in [Ca2+]i induced by chronic ethanol (10-100 mM).

The mechanisms responsible for this improvement are not fully understood. Indirect anatomical evidence suggests that attention of abnormal motor behavior is attributed, at least in part, to the secretion of trophic factors from the transplanted NPCs. However, there is little direct evidence supporting this hypothesis. Here we show that NPCs isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of neonatal mice are highly teratogenic when transplanted into the neural tube of developing chick embryos and are neuroprotective for fetal dopaminergic neurons in culture because they release sonic hedgehog (Shh). In addition, the neuroprotective properties of NPCs can be exploited to promote better long-term survival of transplanted fetal neurons in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. Thus, cultured NPCs isolated from the SVZ can secrete at least one potent mitogen (Shh) that dramatically affects the fate of neighboring cells. This trait may account for some of the improvement in motor behavior often reported in animal models of neurodegeneration after transplantation of cultured NPCs that were isolated from the SVZ."}

Successful treatment has usually been recorded in immunodeficiencies, and insufficient results have been obtained in the other cases.

However, its use is hindered by difficulties in delivery to the brain due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Among larvae that fed, those in the dark treated with neomycin caught fewer Artemia (~5 prey h(-1); P<0.05) than controls (16 prey h(-1) at 10 dph; 72 prey h(-1) at 20 dph). In the light, by contrast, neomycin treatment had no significant effect on prey capture by larvae age 13 to 20 dph, but did inhibit feeding of 10 dph larvae. Verification that neomycin was specifically ablating the hair cells of superficial neuromasts and not affecting either neuromast innervation, olfactory pits, or taste cells was achieved by a combination of staining with FM1-43FX and immunocytochemistry for tubulin and the calcium binding proteins, S100 and calretinin."}

However, the mechanism of JNK activation leading to aggravation of injury after ICH remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed that using NIMoEsh to inhibit JNK activation effectively reduced the level of brain injury following ICH. We evaluated brain outcomes by histology, immunofluorescence, Luxol fast blue/Cresyl violet staining and other experimental methods. We found that NIMoEsh could significantly inhibit the activity of JNK and thus improve inflammation, white-matter damage and neuronal cell death after ICH in mice. Our results suggest that JNK activation plays an important role of brain damage after acute stage of ICH and that NIMoEsh may be a potential target drug for the treatment of ICH."}

This study examined the effects of unilateral STN HFS (2 hr of continuous stimulation) in intact and hemiparkinsonian awake rats on STN neuron metabolic activity and on neurotransmitter-related gene expression in the basal ganglia, by means of in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunocytochemistry. In both intact and hemiparkinsonian rats, this stimulation was found to induce c-fos protein expression but to decrease cytochrome oxidase subunit I mRNA levels in STN neurons. STN HFS did not affect the dopamine lesion-mediated overexpression of enkephalin mRNA or the decrease in substance P in the ipsilateral striatum. The lesion-induced increases in intraneuronal glutamate decarboxylase 67 kDa isoform (GAD67) mRNA levels on the lesion side were reversed by STN HFS in the substantia nigra, partially antagonized in the entopeduncular nucleus but unaffected in the globus pallidus. The stimulation did not affect neuropeptide or GAD67 mRNA levels in the side contralateral to the dopamine lesion or in intact animals. These data furnish the first evidence that STN HFS decreases the metabolic activity of STN neurons and antagonizes dopamine lesion-mediated cellular defects in the basal ganglia output structures. They provide molecular substrate to the therapeutic effects of this stimulation consistent with the current hypothesis that HFS blocks STN neuron activity. However, the differential impact of STN HFS on the effects of dopamine lesion among structures receiving direct STN inputs suggests that this stimulation may not cause simply interruption of STN outflow."}

Using optical stimulation, we observed that motor cortical output maps underwent massive changes after injury and that hindlimb cortical areas were recruited to control the forelimb over time. Furthermore, a greater cortical area was dedicated to controlling the forelimb in Ryk conditional knockout mice than in controls (wild-type or heterozygotes). In the absence of weekly task-specific training, recruitment of ectopic cortical areas was greatly reduced and there was no significant functional recovery even in Ryk conditional knockout mice.

There is currently no treatment for this debilitating disorder and thus a pressing need to develop preventative therapies. RNA interference (RNAi) has proven effective at halting disease progression in several models of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), including SCA types 1 and 3. However, in SCA6 and other dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders, RNAi-based strategies that selectively suppress expression of mutant alleles may be required. Using a Ca(V)2.1 mini-gene reporter system, we found that pathogenic CAG expansions in Ca(V)2.1 enhance splicing activity at the 3'end of the transcript, leading to a CAG repeat length-dependent increase in the levels of a polyQ-encoding Ca(V)2.1 mRNA splice isoform and the resultant disease protein. Taking advantage of this molecular phenomenon, we developed a novel splice isoform-specific (SIS)-RNAi strategy that selectively targets the polyQ-encoding Ca(V)2.1 splice variant. Selective suppression of transiently expressed and endogenous polyQ-encoding Ca(V)2.1 splice variants was achieved in a variety of cell-based models including a human neuronal cell line, using a new artificial miRNA-like delivery system. Moreover, the efficacy of gene silencing correlated with effective intracellular recognition and processing of SIS-RNAi miRNA mimics. These results lend support to the preclinical development of SIS-RNAi as a potential therapy for SCA6 and other dominantly inherited diseases."}

This is supported by the discovery of steroid hormone receptors in the heart and vasculature. More controversial is the area of sex-related differences in cardiac metabolism and function. A number of human and animal studies have demonstrated that estrogen and testosterone have cardiac metabolic effects. Additionally, research shows females have higher heart rates and various indices of function, including cardiac output and stroke volume, compared with males. However, some controversy exists, as other studies report that function in isolated muscle preparations is lower in females versus males. The reasons for these differences may reflect effects of sex hormones that are dependent on the conditions being studied. Cardiac function is reduced in postmenopausal females, suggesting that female sex hormones, specifically estrogen and progesterone, influence cardiac function. Apart from its well-documented vasodilatory effects, estrogen has also been shown to have negative inotropic effects and to reduce Ca(2+) transients in cardiomyocytes. Similar results have been found for progesterone. Several studies show that testosterone administration appears to increase cardiac performance, while others show that it increases the stiffness of the ventricle due to increased collagen synthesis, thereby reducing diastolic performance. This review will discuss current evidence suggesting sex-related differences in cardiac metabolism and its energetics and function and will present the potential role of the principal sex steroid hormones."}

Fifty-six lamotrigine (LTG)-resistant kindled Wistar rats were divided into five experimental (four pregnant and one non-pregnant) and 2 positive controls (pregnant and non-pregnant) groups and eight intact Wistar rats were put in the negative pregnant control group. Experimental groups received daily ZNS 50mg/kg by oral gavage and 30min later, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (30mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneal (i.p) on Gestational Days 10-15 (in rats with or without ZNS or methanol and ethyl acetate as a ZNS solvent challenge in days -5 to 0) or Days 15-20 and for six days in the non-pregnant group. The positive control groups received the ZNS solvent for the same number of days, but the negative pregnant control group did not receive any treatment.

Cultures were treated either at an early (day 5 to day 14) or at an advanced (day 20 to day 28) developmental stage, and assayed for changes in the activities of the cell type-specific enzymes choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), glutamine synthetase (GS) and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNP). Five drugs (carbamazepine, diazepam, phenobarbital, phenytoin and valproate), currently used in the treatment of epileptic patients, were tested together with losigamone, a recently developed anticonvulsant. The results show distinct, concentration-dependent patterns of biochemical changes for the different drugs. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, losigamone and diazepam greatly reduced GAD, ChAT and AChE activities, indicating a relatively high neuron-specific toxic potential. Diazepam produced a more general pattern of toxicity and, in contrast to the anticonvulsants, showed higher toxicity in less-differentiated cultures. Phenobarbital and valproate slightly but significantly increased the activities of several enzymes.

One clade of venomous cone snails, Asprella, appears to be significantly enriched in conantokins, antagonists of N-methyl d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Here, we describe the characterization of two novel conantokins from Conus rolani, including conantokin conRl-B that has shown an unprecedented selectivity for blocking NMDARs that contain NR2B subunits. ConRl-B shares only some sequence similarity with the most studied NR2B selective conantokin, conG. The divergence between conRl-B and conG in the second inter-Gla loop was used to design analogues for structure-activity studies; the presence of Pro10 was found to be key to the high potency of conRl-B for NR2B, whereas the ε-amino group of Lys8 contributed to discrimination in blocking NR2B- and NR2A-containing NMDARs. In contrast to previous findings for Tyr5 substitutions in other conantokins, conRl-B[L5Y] showed potencies on the four NR2 NMDA receptor subtypes that were similar to those of the native conRl-B. When delivered into the brain, conRl-B was active in suppressing seizures in the model of epilepsy in mice, consistent with NR2B-containing NMDA receptors being potential targets for antiepileptic drugs. Circular dichroism experiments confirmed that the helical conformation of conRl-B is stabilized by divalent metal ions. Given the clinical applications of NMDA antagonists, conRl-B provides a potentially important pharmacological tool for understanding the differential roles of NMDA receptor subtypes in the nervous system.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that intranasally delivered hypoxia-preconditioned BMSCs could reach the brain, promote tissue repair and improve functional recovery after ICH. Hemorrhagic stroke was induced in adult C57/B6 mice by injection of collagenase IV into the striatum. Animals were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, intranasal BMSC treatment group, and vehicle treatment group. BMSCs were pre-treated with hypoxic preconditioning (HP) and pre-labeled with Hoechst before transplantation. Behavior tests, including the mNSS score, rotarod test, adhesive removal test, and locomotor function evaluation were performed at varying days, up to 21days, after ICH to evaluate the therapeutic effects of BMSC transplantation. Western blots and immunohistochemistry were performed to analyze the neurotrophic effects. Intranasally delivered HP-BMSCs were identified in peri-injury regions. NeuN+/BrdU+ co-labeled cells were markedly increased around the hematoma region, and growth factors, including BDNF, GDNF, and VEGF were significantly upregulated in the ICH brain after BMSC treatment. The BMSC treatment group showed significant improvement in behavioral performance compared with the vehicle group. Our data also showed that intranasally delivered HP-BMSCs migrated to peri-injury regions and provided growth factors to increase neurogenesis after ICH. We conclude that intranasal administration of BMSC is an effective treatment for ICH, and that it enhanced neuroregenerative effects and promoted neurological functional recovery after ICH. Overall, the investigation supports the potential therapeutic strategy for BMSC transplantation therapy against hemorrhagic stroke."}

In this review, the author provides an overview of the rational drug discovery approaches that are designed to prevent the onset or alter the course of the disease, and/or target its non-motor symptoms.	Largely due to the intertwined etiology that is a hallmark of PD's pathology, neuroprotective drug discovery is challenging, while very limited targeting strategies exist for the non-motor symptoms that afflict sufferers of PD. Rational approaches toward PD neurotherapeutics should target previously identified or emerging pathological pathways that are discovered in the course of investigating the underlying mechanisms in PD disease progression.

An important step in designing strategies to treat this disease is to understand whether increasing the frataxin levels by gene therapy would simply be beneficial or detrimental, because previous studies, mostly based on animal models, have reported conflicting results. Here, we have exploited an inducible model, which we developed using the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology, to study the effects of frataxin overexpression in human cells and monitor how the system recovers after overexpression. Using new tools, which range from high-throughput microscopy to in cell infrared, we prove that overexpression of the frataxin gene affects the cellular metabolism. It also leads to a significant increase of oxidative stress and labile iron pool levels. These cellular alterations are similar to those observed when the gene is partly silenced, as occurs in Friedreich's ataxia patients. Our data suggest that the levels of frataxin must be tightly regulated and fine-tuned, with any imbalance leading to oxidative stress and toxicity."}

It has, however, proven difficult to identify which neurophysiological changes that ultimately lead to motor dysfunctions. To clarify this, we have here recorded neuronal activity throughout the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits in freely behaving rats during periods of immobility following acute dopaminergic manipulations, involving both vesicular dopamine depletion and antagonism of D1 and D2 type dopamine receptors. Synchronized and rhythmic activities were detected in the form of betaband oscillations in local field potentials and as cortical entrainment of action potentials in several basal ganglia structures. Analyses of the temporal development of synchronized oscillations revealed a spread from cortex to gradually also include deeper structures. In addition, firing rate changes involving neurons in all parts of the network were observed. These changes were typically relatively balanced within each structure, resulting in negligible net rate changes. Animals treated with D1 receptor antagonist showed a rapid onset of hypokinesia that preceded most of the neurophysiological changes, with the exception of these balanced rate changes. Parallel rate changes in functionally coupled ensembles of neurons in different structures may therefore be the first step in a cascade of neurophysiological changes underlying motor symptoms in the parkinsonian state. We suggest that balanced rate changes in distributed networks are possible mechanism of disease that should be further investigated in conditions involving dopaminergic dysfunction."}

NF-κB related signaling molecules were investigated by Western blotting. In vivo study, the effects of shikonin on MMPs and TIMP-1 were determined at the gene level and the cartilage damage was evaluated at the histological level after the rabbits sacrificed. We found that shikonin significantly reversed the elevated expression of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13 and the reduced expression of TIMP-1 at both gene and protein levels in IL-1β induced chondrocytes. Additionally, the reduction of IκBα and the activation of NF-κB p65 induced by IL-1β were subsided by shikonin in rabbit chondrocytes. In vivo, both the cartilage damage and the elevated expression of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13 and the decreased expression of TIMP-1 were ameliorated in shikonin intra-articular injection knees compared to vehicle knees. Our findings indicated that shikonin have anti-inflammatory and chondro-protective effects and may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of OA."}

While bradykinesia (slow execution of movements) is present in less affected PD patients and aggravates as the disease severity increases, hypokinesia (reduction of movement) seems to emerge prominently only in the more affected patients. Here we developed a model based on the central infusion of low dose (40μg) 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in mice in an attempt to discriminate bradykinesia (accessed through forelimb inability) from hypokinesia (accessed through locomotor and exploratory activities). The potential beneficial effects of succinobucol against 6-OHDA-induced forelimb inability were also evaluated. One week after the beginning of treatment with succinobucol (i.p. injections, 10mg/kg/day), mice received a single i.c.v. infusion of 6-OHDA (40μg/site). One week after 6-OHDA infusion, general locomotor/exploratory activities (open field test), muscle strength (grid test), forelimb skill (single pellet task), as well as striatal biochemical parameters related to oxidative stress and cellular homeostasis (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and NADH dehydrogenases activities, lipid peroxidation and TH levels), were evaluated. 6-OHDA infusions did not change locomotor/exploratory activities and muscle strength, as well as the evaluated striatal biochemical parameters. However, 6-OHDA infusions caused significant reductions (50%) in the single pellet reaching task performance, which detects forelimb skill inability and can be used to experimentally identify bradykinesia. Succinobucol partially protected against 6-OHDA-induced forelimb inability. The decreased forelimb ability with no changes in locomotor/exploratory behavior indicates that our 6-OHDA-based protocol represents a useful tool to mechanistically study the dissociation of bradykinesia and hypokinesia in PD."}

However, the implantation procedure was difficult, as the cuff electrode had to be located on the distal branches of a multi-fascicular nerve to exclude muscle afferent and efferent activities. This paper proposes a new gait phase detection scheme that can be applied to a proximal nerve root that includes cutaneous afferent fibers as well as muscle afferent and efferent fibers. To test the feasibility of this scheme, electroneurogram (ENG) signals were measured from the rat sciatic nerve during treadmill walking at several speeds, and the signal properties of the sciatic nerve were analyzed for a comparison with kinematic data from the ankle joint. On the basis of these experiments, a wavelet packet transform was tested to define a feature vector from the sciatic ENG signals according to the gait phases. We also propose a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifier and investigate whether it could be used successfully to discriminate feature vectors into the stance and swing phases. In spite of no significant differences in the rectified bin-integrated values between the stance and swing phases, the sciatic ENG signals could be reliably classified using the proposed wavelet packet transform and GMM classification methods."}

However, the relative contribution of SMN-depleted motor neurons to the disease process is uncertain and it is possible that their characteristic loss and the overall SMA phenotype is a consequence of low protein in multiple cell types including neighboring spinal neurons and non-neuronal tissue. To explore the tissue-specific requirements for SMN and, especially, the salutary effects of restoring normal levels of the protein to neuronal tissue of affected individuals, we have selectively expressed the protein in neurons of mice that model severe SMA. Expressing SMN pan-neuronally in mutant mice mitigated specific aspects of the disease phenotype. Motor performance of the mice improved and the loss of spinal motor neurons that characterizes the disease was arrested. Proprioceptive synapses on the motor neurons were restored and defects of the neuromuscular junctions mitigated. The improvements at the cellular level were reflected in a four-fold increase in survival. Nevertheless, mutants expressing neuronal SMN did not live beyond three weeks of birth, a relatively poor outcome compared to the effects of ubiquitously restoring SMN. This suggests that although neurons and, in particular, spinal motor neurons constitute critical cellular sites of action of the SMN protein, a truly effective treatment of severe SMA will require restoring the protein to multiple cell types including non-neuronal tissue."}

In 30 volunteers, sustained burning pain was produced in the palmar forearm through a continuous intradermal pressure infusion of a phosphate-buffered isotonic solution (pH 5.2). In 5 different, double-blind, randomized cross-over studies with 6 volunteers each, the flow rate of the syringe pump was individually adjusted to result in constant pain ratings of around 20% (50% in study 4) on a visual analog scale (VAS). The painful skin area was then covered with either placebo or the drugs which had been dissolved in diethylether. In the first study on 6 volunteers, ASA (60 mg/ml) or lactose (placebo) in diethylether (10 ml) was applied, using both arms at 3-day intervals. Both treatments resulted in sudden and profound pain relief due to the cooling effect of the evaporating ether. With lactose, however, the mean pain rating was restored close to the baseline within 6-8 min while, with ASA, it remained significantly depressed for the rest of the observation period (another 20 min). This deep analgesia was not accompanied by a loss of tactile sensation. The further studies served to show that indomethacin (4.5 mg/ml) and SA (60 mg/ml) were equally effective as ASA (each 92-96% pain reduction) and that the antinociceptive effects were due to local but not systemic actions, since ASA and SA dis not reach measurable plasma levels up to 3 h after topical applications. With a higher flow rate of acid buffer producing more intense pain (VAS 50%). ASA and SA were still able to significantly reduce the ratings by 90% or 84%, respectively. On the other hand, by increasing the flow rate by a factor of 2 on average, during the period of fully developed drug effect it was possible to overcome the pain suppression, which suggests a competitive mechanism of (acetyl-) salicylic antinociception."}

Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) are found to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and normalize the age- or dementia-related cognitive function decline. In the paper we investigate the ceramide, sphingomyelin (SM) and phosphatidylserine (PS) levels in the hippocampus of 3-month-old-32-month-old rats as well as the correction of sphingolipid turnover in the brain of old rats by means of the dietetic fish oil and PS. To study the lipid turnover, the [(14)C]-labeled SM and palmitic acid were used. The [(14)C]ceramide level significantly increased while those of the [(14)C]SM, SM and PS levels decreased in the hippocampus of aged rats as compared with 3-month-old animals. Treatment of the rats with the fish oil or PS reduced the [(14)C]ceramide content and neutral SMase activity in the hippocampus of the 24-month-old animals with respect to control rats of the same age. These results suggest that dietary n-3 PUFA can prevent the age-dependent abnormalities of sphingolipid turnover via increased PS content in the hippocampus of old rats."}

Among the nine AAV serotypes (AAV1-9) screened in vitro and four serotypes (AAV1, 2, 6, 9) evaluated in vivo, AAV6 showed the strongest transgene expression. As for promoters, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) early enhancer/chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter resulted in more robust transduction than the CMV promoter. Regarding delivery routes, intratracheal administration resulted in strong transgene expression in the lung, whereas the intravenous and intranasal administration routes yielded negligible expression.

Dose and frequency of administration were selected based on the drug potency against equine sEH to produce plasma concentrations within the range of 30 nmol L(-1) and 2.5 μmol L(-1) . Pain scores decreased sharply and remarkably following t-TUCB administration and blood pressure progressively decreased to physiologic normal values. Plasma concentrations of t-TUCB, measured daily, were within the expected range, whereas phenylbutazone and gabapentin plasma levels were below the suggested efficacious concentrations.	No adverse effects were detected on clinical and laboratory examinations during and after t-TUCB administration. No new episodes of laminitis have been noted up to the time of writing (120 days following treatment).	Inhibition of sEH with t-TUCB was associated with a significant improvement in pain scores in one horse with laminitis whose pain was refractory to the standard of care therapy.

Interaction of these immune cells with platelets and endothelial cells facilitates microvascular dysfunction and leads to secondary infarct growth. We recently showed that blocking of platelet glycoprotein (GP) receptor Ib improves stroke outcome without increasing the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Until now, it has been unclear whether GPIb only mediates thrombus formation or also contributes to the pathophysiology of local inflammation.	Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in C57BL/6 mice by a 60-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Animals were treated with antigen-binding fragments (Fab) against the platelet surface molecules GPIb (p0p/B Fab). Rat immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fab was used as control treatment. Stroke outcome, including infarct size and functional deficits as well as the local inflammatory response, was assessed on day 1 after tMCAO.	Blocking of GPIb reduced stroke size and improved functional outcome on day 1 after tMCAO without increasing the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. As expected, disruption of GPIb-mediated pathways in platelets significantly reduced thrombus burden in the cerebral microvasculature. In addition, inhibition of GPIb limited the local inflammatory response in the ischemic brain as indicated by lower numbers of infiltrating T cells and macrophages and lower expression levels of inflammatory cytokines compared with rat IgG Fab-treated controls.	In acute ischemic stroke, thrombus formation and inflammation are closely intertwined ('thrombo-inflammation'). Blocking of platelet GPIb can ameliorate thrombo-inflammation."}

We hypothesized that stimulation of NHE1 after cerebral ischemia contributes to the disruption of Na+ homeostasis and neuronal death. In the present study, expression of NHE1 was detected in cultured mouse cortical neurons. Three hours of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 21 h of reoxygenation (REOX) led to 68 +/- 10% cell death. Inhibition of NHE1 with the potent inhibitor cariporide (HOE 642) or genetic ablation of NHE1 reduced OGD-induced cell death by approximately 40-50% (p < 0.05). In NHE1(+/+) neurons, OGD caused a twofold increase in [Na+]i, and 60 min REOX triggered a sevenfold increase. Genetic ablation of NHE1 or HOE 642 treatment had no effects on the OGD-mediated initial Na+(i) rise but reduced the second phase of Na+(i) rise by approximately 40-50%. In addition, 60 min REOX evoked a 1.5-fold increase in [Ca2+]i in NHE1(+/+) neurons, which was abolished by inhibition of either NHE1 or reverse-mode operation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange. OGD/REOX-mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and cytochrome c release were attenuated by inhibition of NHE1 activity. In an in vivo focal ischemic model, 2 h of left middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion induced 84.8 +/- 8.0 mm3 infarction in NHE1(+/+) mice. NHE1(+/+) mice treated with HOE 642 or NHE1 heterozygous mice exhibited a approximately 33% decrease in infarct size (p < 0.05).

The aim of the present work was to assess whether this pathway also operates in vivo and to provide a mechanism to explain post-SAH fever. To this end, PGE2 concentration was determined in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of conscious rabbits chronically cannulated in the lateral ventricle and cisterna magna, following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 10 microg or 100 microg of commercial rabbit bicrystallized Hb as a model of SAH.

Results show that in nine rabbits injection of 10 microg Hb did not significantly modify body temperature or significantly alter CSF PGE2 content. On the contrary, in nine rabbits, injection of 100 microg Hb produced a significant increase in core temperature which was accompanied by a significant increase in CSF PGE2. When data related to these two parameters from the 9 control and 18 Hb-treated rabbits were analyzed as a single group, a linear, positive, and highly significant correlation was found. These findings indicate that, once Hb is released into the subarachnoid space during SAH, it enhances CSF PGE2 content and elicits hyperthermia, thus offering an explanation for the fever that is an aggravating condition in most SAH patients."}

Nucleic acids^\nRNA Nanotherapeutics for the Amelioration of Astroglial Reactivity.^\nIn response to injuries to the CNS, astrocytes enter a reactive state known as astrogliosis, which is believed to be deleterious in some contexts. Activated astrocytes overexpress intermediate filaments including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin (Vim), resulting in entangled cells that inhibit neurite growth and functional recovery. Reactive astrocytes also secrete inflammatory molecules such as Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), which perpetuate reactivity and adversely affect other cells of the CNS. Herein, we report proof-of-concept use of the packaging RNA (pRNA)-derived three-way junction (3WJ) motif as a platform for the delivery of siRNAs to downregulate such reactivity-associated genes. In vitro, siRNA-3WJs induced a significant knockdown of Gfap, Vim, and Lcn2 in a model of astroglial activation, with a concomitant reduction in protein expression. Knockdown of Lcn2 also led to reduced protein secretion from reactive astroglial cells, significantly impeding the perpetuation of inflammation in otherwise quiescent astrocytes. Intralesional injection of anti-Lcn2-3WJs in mice with contusion spinal cord injury led to knockdown of Lcn2 at mRNA and protein levels in vivo. Our results provide evidence for siRNA-3WJs as a promising platform for ameliorating astroglial reactivity, with significant potential for further functionalization and adaptation for therapeutic applications in the CNS."}

We recently demonstrated a protective effect of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUCB-MSCs) in a rat model of ischemic stroke. The treatment attenuated apoptosis and prevented DNA damage. A collection of published studies, including several from our laboratory, indicated the induction and detrimental role for several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in post-stroke brain injury. We hypothesized that the HUCB-MSCs treatment after focal cerebral ischemia prevents the dysregulation of MMPs and induces the expression of endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) to neutralize the elevated activity of MMPs.	To test our hypothesis, we administered HUCB-MSCs (0.25 million cells/animal and 1 million cells/animal) intravenously via tail vein to male Sprague-Dawley rats that were subjected to a transient (two-hour) right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and one-day reperfusion. Ischemic brain tissues obtained from various groups of rats seven days after reperfusion were subjected to real-time PCR, immunoblot, and immunofluorescence analysis.	HUCB-MSCs treatment prevented the induction of MMPs, which were upregulated in ischemia-induced rats that received no treatment. HUCB-MSCs treatment also prevented the induction of TIMPs expression. The extent of prevention of MMPs and TIMPs induction by HUCB-MSCs treatment is similar at both the doses tested.	Prevention of stroke-induced MMPs upregulation after HUCB-MSCs treatment is not mediated through TIMPs upregulation."}

Its vectorial capacity is directly affected by its reproductive feeding behaviors, such as host seeking, blood feeding, resting, and egg laying. In mosquitoes, these gonotrophic behaviors are odor-mediated and regulated following blood feeding. Immediately after a blood meal, female mosquitoes show reduced olfactory responsiveness and flight activity, as they enter a resting state. Insights into antennal chemosensory gene regulation at this time period can provide a foundation to identify targets involved in the state switch between host seeking and resting.	This study used quantitative gene expression analyses to explore blood meal induced regulation of chemosensory gene families in the antennae of 6 days post-emergence C. quinquefasciatus females. Improved annotations for multiple chemosensory gene families, and a quantitative differential gene expression analysis between host seeking and 24 h post- blood fed females of the same age, allowed for the detection of transcripts that potentially play a role in the switch from host seeking to resting, in C. quinquefasciatus. The expression profiles of chemosensory genes varied significantly between the two treatments.	Annotations for chemosensory gene repertoires in C. quinquefasciatus have been manually curated and corrected for 3' exon choice and transcript length, through sequence and transcriptome analyses. The gene expression analyses identified various molecular components of the peripheral olfactory system in C. quinquefasciatus, including odorant receptors, ionotropic receptors, odorant binding proteins and chemosensory proteins, that are regulated in response to blood feeding, and could be critical for the behavioral switch from host seeking to resting. Functional characterization of these proteins in the future can identify targets essential for the females' gonotrophic behaviors, and can be used to design novel vector control strategies."}

American volume^\nEarly Surgical Decompression Restores Neurovascular Blood Flow and Ischemic Parameters in an in Vivo Animal Model of Nerve Compression Injury.^\nChronic nerve compression neuropathies result in decreased blood flow at the site of compression. Surgical decompression of the nerve often has variable postoperative results. The current study examines whether the timing of surgical intervention is an important variable in reversing the compression-induced ischemia and associated changes in biochemical markers.	An established model of chronic nerve compression injury was created in 100 C57BL/6 mice, and serial electrophysiological examinations were used to confirm the creation of a chronic nerve compression injury. Laser speckle imaging was used to measure neural blood flow. Nerves in the animals that did not undergo decompression were harvested at two, four, and six weeks after injury and analyzed for hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9. Surgical decompression in other animals was performed at either an early (two-week) or late (six-week) time point after injury, with specimens harvested at multiple time points after decompression. One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction was performed.	Chronic nerve compression injury initially induced hyperemia (1.37 ± 0.50 times that in the contralateral, uninjured nerve) followed by a decline in neural blood flow by four weeks (0.66 ± 0.14, p = 0.0313). In parallel, HIF1α, catalase, and SOD were elevated early after compression, whereas extracellular matrix-altering proteins were elevated later in the disease. Although early decompression yielded a return of blood flow to a hyperemic state (1.35 ± 0.16, p = 0.0057), late decompression did not result in reversal of the abnormal neurovascular flow. With late decompression, an MMP9-mediated structural alteration of the extracellular matrix was seen, producing irreversible changes in blood flow parameters. Although nerve conduction velocity measurements returned to normal two weeks after decompression irrespective of the timing of the surgical intervention, distal latency returned to normal only after early decompression (0.97 ± 0.06 msec compared with 1.22 ± 0.06 msec for late decompression, p = 0.009).	Chronic nerve compression injuries decreased neurovascular flow and induced ischemia by upregulating HIF1α, catalase, and MMP9. Early surgical intervention offered better return to normal electrophysiological parameters compared with late intervention.	These data present a clinical correlate to the variable functional outcomes seen following surgical release of chronic nerve compression injuries and provide early support for using distal latency as a predictor of outcomes following surgical release."}

We have found that acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a senile plaque component, increases amyloid fibril assembly with the formation of highly toxic complexes (Abeta-AChE). The neurotoxic effect induced by Abeta-AChE complexes was higher than that induced by the Abeta peptide alone as shown both in vitro (hippocampal neurons) and in vivo (rats injected with Abeta peptide in the dorsal hippocampus). Interestingly, treatment with Abeta-AChE complexes decreases the cytoplasmic beta-catenin level, a key component of Wnt signaling. Conversely, the activation of this signaling pathway by Wnt-3a promotes neuronal survival and rescues changes in Wnt components (activation or subcellular localization). Moreover Frzb-1, a Wnt antagonist reverses the Wnt-3a neuroprotection effect against Abeta neurotoxicity.

NO effects were not related to changes in intracellular Ba(2+). NO did not modify the duration of feet. Effects were evident even on pre-fusioned granules, observed under hypertonic conditions, suggesting that the fusion pore is not the target for NO, which probably acts by modifying the affinity of catecholamines for the intragranular matrix.

Due to a lack of energy reserves, the brain relies on continuous delivery of blood flow to its active regions in accordance with their dynamic metabolic needs. Hypertension disrupts these vital regulatory mechanisms, leading to the neuronal dysfunction and damage underlying cognitive impairment. Elucidating the cellular bases of these impairments is essential for developing new therapies. Perivascular macrophages (PVMs) represent a distinct population of resident brain macrophages that serves key homeostatic roles but also has the potential to generate large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we report that PVMs are critical in driving the alterations in neurovascular regulation and attendant cognitive impairment in mouse models of hypertension. This effect was mediated by an increase in blood-brain barrier permeability that allowed angiotensin II to enter the perivascular space and activate angiotensin type 1 receptors in PVMs, leading to production of ROS through the superoxide-producing enzyme NOX2. These findings unveil a pathogenic role of PVMs in the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction associated with hypertension and identify these cells as a putative therapeutic target for diseases associated with cerebrovascular oxidative stress."}

Because various insults may trigger a neuroinflammatory response that leads to secondary damage to the brain, the current study tested whether this extremely low dose of THC could protect the brain from inflammation-induced cognitive deficits. Mice received a single injection of THC (0.002 mg/kg) 48 hr before or 1-7 days after treatment with lipopolysccharide (LPS; 10 mg/kg) and were examined with the object recognition test 3 weeks later. LPS caused long-lasting cognitive deficits, whereas the application of THC before or after LPS protected the mice from this LPS-induced damage. The protective effect of THC was blocked by the cannabinoid (CB) 1 receptor antagonist SR14176A but not by the CB2 receptor antagonist SR141528 and was mimicked by the CB1 agonist ACEA but not by the CB2 agonist HU308. The protective effect of THC was also blocked by pretreatment with GW9662, indicating the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Biochemical examination of the brain revealed a long-term (at least 7 weeks) elevation of the prostaglandin-producing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 in the hippocampus and in the frontal cortex following the injection of LPS. Pretreatment with the extremely low dose of THC tended to attenuate this elevation.

Because the expression of the EPO and EPO-R network is poorly investigated in the central nervous system, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the resident EPO and EPO-R network is activated in the injured nervous system.	A well-standardized model of compressive spinal cord injury in rats was used.

In noninjured spinal cord, weak immunohistochemical expression of EPO and EPO-R was observed in neuronal and glial cells as well as in endothelial and ependymal cells. In injured rats, a marked increase of expression of EPO and EPO-R was observed in neurons, vascular endothelium, and glial cells at 8 hours after injury, peaking at 8 days, after which it gradually decreased. Two weeks after injury, EPO immunoreactivity was scarcely detected in neurons, whereas glial cells and vascular endothelium expressed strong EPO-R immunoreactivity.	These observations suggest that the local EPO and EPO-R system is markedly engaged in the early stages after nervous tissue injury.

However, whether the spinal NR2B-containing NMDA (NMDA-2B) receptors are involved still remains largely unclear. Using behavioral test and in vivo extracellular electrophysiological recording in L5 spinal nerve-ligated (SNL) neuropathic rats, we investigate the roles of spinal cord NMDA-2B receptors in the development of neuropathic pain. Our study showed that intrathecal (i.t.) injection of Ro 25-6981, a selective NMDA-2B receptor antagonist, had a dose-dependent anti-allodynic effect without causing motor dysfunction. Furthermore, i.t. application of another NMDA-2B receptor antagonist ifenprodil prior to SNL also significantly inhibited the mechanical allodynia but not the thermal hyperalgesia. These data suggest that NMDA-2B receptors at the spinal cord level play an important role in the development of neuropathic pain, especially at the early stage following nerve injury. In addition, spinal administration of Ro 25-6981 not only had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the C-fiber responses of dorsal horn wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in both normal and SNL rats, but also significantly inhibited the long-term potentiation (LTP) in the C-fiber responses of WDR neurons induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) applied to the sciatic nerve. These results indicate that activation of the dorsal horn NMDA-2B receptors may be crucial for the spinal nociceptive synaptic transmission and for the development of long-lasting spinal hyperexcitability following nerve injury. In conclusion, the spinal cord NMDA-2B receptors play a role in the development of central sensitization and neuropathic pain via the induction of LTP in dorsal horn nociceptive synaptic transmission. Therefore, the spinal cord NMDA-2B receptor is likely to be a target for clinical pain therapy."}

The intriguing behavioral effects of DCS have been linked to its unique pharmacological profile among NMDA receptor subtypes (GluN1/2A-D), in which DCS is a superagonist at GluN2C-containing receptors compared with glycine and a partial agonist at GluN2B-containing receptors. Here, we identify (R)-2-amino-3-(4-(2-ethylphenyl)-1H-indole-2-carboxamido)propanoic acid (AICP) as a glycine site agonist with unique GluN2-dependent differences in agonist efficacy at recombinant NMDA receptor subtypes. AICP is a full agonist at GluN1/2A (100% response compared with glycine), a partial agonist at GluN1/2B and GluN1/2D (10% and 27%, respectively), and a highly efficacious superagonist at GluN1/2C receptors (353%). Furthermore, AICP potencies are enhanced compared with DCS with EC50 values in the low nanomolar range (1.7 nM at GluN1/2C). We show that GluN1/2C superagonism of AICP and DCS is mediated by overlapping but distinct mechanisms and that AICP selectively enhances responses from recombinant GluN1/2C receptors in the presence of physiological glycine concentrations. This functional selectivity of AICP for GluN2C-containing NMDA receptors is more pronounced compared with DCS, suggesting that AICP can be a useful tool compound for uncovering the roles of GluN2C subunits in neuronal circuit function and in the development of new therapeutic strategies."}

However, in these studies damage was evaluated at most a few days after the insult. Here, we have explored the long-term consequences of two routes of GDNF delivery to the rat striatum prior to stroke induced by 30 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO): striatal transduction with a recombinant lentiviral vector or transduction of the substantia nigra with a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector and subsequent anterograde transport of GDNF to striatum. Despite high GDNF levels, stereological quantification of striatal neuron numbers revealed no protection at 5 or 8 weeks after MCAO. In fact, anterograde GDNF delivery exacerbated neuronal loss. Moreover, supply of GDNF did not alleviate the striatum-related behavioral deficits. Thus, we demonstrate that the actions of GDNF after stroke are more complex than previously believed and that high levels of this factor, which are neuroprotective in models of Parkinson's disease, can increase ischemic damage. Our findings also underscore the need for quantitative assessment of long-term neuronal survival and behavioral changes to evaluate the therapeutic potential of factors such as GDNF."}

Cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and the followed activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 are the important steps. Now, a new mitochondrial protein, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), has been shown to have relationship with the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of propofol through inhibiting AIF-mediated apoptosis induced by whole cerebral I/R injury in rats. 120 Wistar rats that obtained the permission of the animal care committee of Harbin Medical University were randomly divided into three groups: sham group (S group), cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury group (I/R group), and propofol treatment group (P group). Propofol (1.0mg/kg/min) was administered intravenously for 1h before the induction of ischemia in P group. The apoptotic rate in three groups was detected by flow cytometry after 24h of reperfusion. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) changes were detected via microplate reader. The expressions of B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and AIF were evaluated using Western blot after 6h, 24h and 48h of reperfusion. The results of our study showed that apoptotic level was lower in P group compared with I/R group and propofol could protect MMP. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was significantly higher in P group compared with I/R group. The translocation of AIF from mitochondrial to nucleus was lower in P group than that in I/R group. Our findings suggested that the protective effects of propofol on cerebral I/R injury might be associated with inhibiting translocation of AIF from mitochondrial to the nucleus in hippocampal neurons."}

In addition, NMDA receptor antagonists are of potential interest for the clinical management of neuropathic pain and preventing the development of tolerance to opiate analgesics. A potentially serious obstacle to the development of NMDA antagonists as neurotherapeutic drugs is the paradoxical fact that whereas these agents do have significant neurotherapeutic potential, they also have psychotogenic and neurotoxic properties. We have been intensively investigating the mechanisms underlying these adverse properties and have discovered several methods of suppressing or preventing their expression. In addition, we have been exploring the possibility that a common mechanism may underlie the psychotogenic and neurotoxic actions of these agents and that this mechanism may have relevance to the pathogenesis of idiopathic psychotic processes such as schizophrenia. In this chapter, we will review our findings pertaining to NMDA antagonists in the dual context of their value as tools for exploring mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disturbances, particularly schizophrenia, and their potential promise as therapeutic agents.

Neuroprotection ameliorates cognitive impairment induced by hyperglycemia in diabetic encephalopathy (DE). Astaxanthin has been widely studied in diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications due to its hypoglycemic, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. However, whether astaxanthin can alleviate cognition deficits induced by DE and its precise mechanisms remain undetermined. In this study, DE was induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 150 mg/kg) in ICR mice. We observed the effect of astaxanthin on cognition and investigated its potential mechanisms in DE mice. Results showed that astaxanthin treatment significantly decreased the latency and enhanced the distance and time spent in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, neuronal survival was significantly increased in the hippocampal CA3 region and the frontal cortex following treatment with astaxanthin. Meanwhile, immunoblotting was used to observe the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) p65 and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The results indicated that astaxanthin could inhibit NF-κB nuclear translocation and downregulate TNF-α expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Overall, the present study implied that astaxanthin could improve cognition by protecting neurons against inflammation injury potentially through inhibiting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and down-regulating TNF-α."}

This pilot study aimed to test the effectiveness of an acute treatment with a long-chain omega-3 lipid emulsion (Omegaven 10%®, OGV) that contains fish oil (DHA 18 mg/ml; EPA 21 mg/ml) and α-tocopherol (0.2 mg/ml) in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of ischemic stroke in mice. For this purpose, female CD-1 mice were anesthetized and subjected to 90 minutes of MCAO. To reflect a clinically relevant situation for an acute treatment, either after induction of stroke or after reperfusion, a single dose of OGV was injected intravenously into the tail vein (5 ml/kg b.w.). A neurological severity score was used to assess motor function and neurological outcome. Stroke-related parameters were determined 24 hours after MCAO. Microdialysis was used to collect samples from extracellular space of the striatum. Mitochondrial function was determined in isolated mitochondria or dissociated brain cells. Inflammation markers were measured in brain homogenate. According to control experiments, neuroprotective effects could be attributed to the long-chain omega-3 content of the emulsion. Intravenous injection of OGV reduced size and severity of stroke, restored mitochondrial function, and prevented excitotoxic glutamate release. Increases of pro-inflammatory markers (COX-2 and IL-6) were attenuated. Neurological severity scoring and neurochemical data demonstrated that acute OGV treatment shortly after induction of stroke was most efficient and able to improve short-term neurological outcome, reflecting the importance of an acute treatment to improve the outcome. Summarising, acute treatment of stroke with a single intravenous dose of OGV provided strong neuroprotective effects and was most effective when given immediately after onset of ischemia. As OGV is an approved fishoil emulsion for parenteral nutrition in humans, our results may provide first translational data for a possible early management of ischemic stroke with administration of OGV to prevent further brain damage."}

The aim of the present study was to validate the lentiviral vector as a gene delivery system in the mouse midbrain in the perspective of screening biotherapeutic molecules in mouse models of Parkinson's disease. A preliminary study with a LacZ-encoding vector injected above the substantia nigra of C57BL/6j mice indicated that lentiviral vectors can infect approximately 40,000 cells and diffuse over long distances. Based on these results, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was assessed as a neuroprotective molecule in a 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease. Lentiviral vectors carrying the cDNA for GDNF or mutated GDNF were unilaterally injected above the substantia nigra of C57BL/6j mice. Two weeks later, the animals were lesioned ipsilaterally with 6-hydroxydopamine into the striatum. Apomorphine-induced rotation was significantly decreased in the GDNF-injected group compared to control animals. Moreover, GDNF efficiently protected 69.5% of the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced toxicity compared to 33.1% with control mutated GDNF. These data indicate that lentiviral vectors constitute a powerful gene delivery system for the screening of therapeutic molecules in mouse models of Parkinson's disease."}

We investigated the influence of S129 phosphorylation on interactions of metal-ion induced asyn oligomers with small unilamellar lipid vesicles (SUV) composed of POPC and DPPC applying the phosphorylation mimic asyn129E. Confocal single-particle fluorescence techniques were used to monitor membrane binding at the single-particle level.	Binding of asyn129E monomers to gel-state membranes (DPPC-SUV) is slightly reduced compared to wild-type asyn, while no interactions with membranes in the liquid-crystalline state (POPC-SUV) are seen for both asyn and asyn129E. Conversely, metal-ion induced oligomer formation is markedly increased in asyn129E. Surprisingly, membrane binding to POPC-SUV is nearly absent in Fe(3+) induced asyn129E oligomers and markedly reduced in Al(3+) induced oligomers.	The protective effect of pseudophosphorylation seen in animal models may be due to impeded oligomer membrane binding.

We show that in fibroblast cultures derived from SMA patients treated with therapeutic doses (0.5-500 microM) of valproic acid (VPA), the level of full-length SMN2 mRNA/protein increased 2- to 4-fold. Importantly, this up-regulation of SMN could be most likely attributed to increased levels of Htra2-beta 1 which facilitates the correct splicing of SMN2 RNA as well as to an SMN gene transcription activation. Especially at low VPA concentrations, the restored SMN level depended on the number of SMN2 copies. Moreover, VPA was able to increase SMN protein levels through transcription activation in organotypic hippocampal brain slices from rats. Finally, VPA also increased the expression of further SR proteins, which may have important implications for other disorders affected by alternative splicing. Since VPA is a drug highly successfully used in long-term epilepsy therapy, our findings open the exciting perspective for a first causal therapy of an inherited disease by elevating the SMN2 transcription level and restoring its correct splicing."}

We have performed a detailed functional analysis of dystrophin structural domains and show that multiple regions of the protein can be deleted in various combinations to generate highly functional mini- and micro-dystrophins. Studies in transgenic mdx mice, a model for DMD, reveal that a wide variety of functional characteristics of dystrophy are prevented by some of these truncated dystrophins. Muscles expressing the smallest dystrophins are fully protected against damage caused by muscle activity and are not morphologically different from normal muscle. Moreover, injection of adeno-associated viruses carrying micro-dystrophins into dystrophic muscles of immunocompetent mdx mice results in a striking reversal of histopathological features of this disease. These results demonstrate that the dystrophic pathology can be both prevented and reversed by gene therapy using micro-dystrophins."}

A variety of evidence points to the importance of Abeta-membrane interactions in the mechanism of Abeta neurotoxicity and indicates that cholesterol and gangliosides are particularly important for Abeta aggregation and binding to membranes. We investigated the effects of cholesterol and sialic acid depletion on Abeta-induced GTPase activity in cells, a step implicated in the mechanism of Abeta toxicity, and Abeta-induced cell toxicity. Cholesterol reduction and depletion of membrane-associated sialic acid residues both significantly reduced the Abeta-induced GTPase activity. In addition, cholesterol and membrane-associated sialic acid residue depletion or inhibition of cholesterol and ganglioside synthesis protected PC12 cells from Abeta-induced toxicity.

To define better the contribution of fibrinogen to large vessel thrombus formation, we studied carotid artery thrombosis in wild-type mice, mice lacking fibrinogen (fbg-/-), mice treated with 7E9 (a blocking antibody to the fibrinogen gamma-chain C-terminus), and mice expressing a mutant fibrinogen (gamma delta 5) that lacks the gamma-chain platelet-binding motif QADGV. In control mice, thrombus formation resulted in occlusion in 8 +/- 2 minutes (mean +/- SD). In fbg-/- mice, thrombi grew to large sizes, but then they abruptly embolized, confirming previous observations by others in an arteriolar thrombus model. In contrast, mice treated with 7E9 and gamma delta 5 mice developed only small, nonoclusive mural thrombi and embolization was limited. These findings reveal that a fibrinogen antibody, 7E9, or a fibrinogen mutant retaining clotting function, can limit thrombus formation more effectively than the complete absence of fibrinogen. We hypothesize that the smaller thrombi in these animals result from the ability of fibrin to bind and sequester thrombin and/or the ability of the altered fibrinogen molecules, which cannot recruit platelets, to bind to and passivate the surface."}

However, recent Women's Health Initiative trials in post-menopausal women report an increased stroke risk on hormone replacement therapy. An influence of gender is also apparent on stroke outcome in animal models: female rats exposed to transient MCA (middle cerebral artery) occlusion sustain less brain damage than age-matched males, with loss of protection following ovariectomy. The major hormone thought to be responsible for beneficial influences on stroke incidence and outcome is oestrogen, and a large preclinical literature now exists where exogenously administered oestrogen has been studied in male and ovariectomized female rats using a range of stroke models and outcome measures. Most of these studies administer oestrogen prior to the stroke, use a model of transient ischaemia followed by reperfusion and report a significant oestrogen-induced neuroprotection. However, in some studies where the MCA is permanently occluded, oestrogen pre-treatment in ovariectomized female rats has been shown to significantly exacerbate ischaemic damage. Therefore preclinical results demonstrate harmful as well as beneficial influences of oestrogen on the ischaemic brain, highlighting the need for further study to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for both detrimental and beneficial influences. Ultimately, this could lead to the development of new classes of oestrogenic compounds with improved risk/benefit profiles, designed to selectively activate pathways inducing only the beneficial effects of oestrogen in vivo."}

Nebulin mutations are the main cause of nemaline myopathy (NEM), with typical adult patients having low expression of nebulin, yet the roles of nebulin in adult muscle remain poorly understood. To establish nebulin's functional roles in adult muscle, we studied a novel conditional nebulin KO (Neb cKO) mouse model in which nebulin deletion was driven by the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promotor. Neb cKO mice are born with high nebulin levels in their skeletal muscles, but within weeks after birth nebulin expression rapidly falls to barely detectable levels Surprisingly, a large fraction of the mice survive to adulthood with low nebulin levels (<5% of control), contain nemaline rods and undergo fiber-type switching toward oxidative types. Nebulin deficiency causes a large deficit in specific force, and mechanistic studies provide evidence that a reduced fraction of force-generating cross-bridges and shortened thin filaments contribute to the force deficit. Muscles rich in glycolytic fibers upregulate proteolysis pathways (MuRF-1, Fbxo30/MUSA1, Gadd45a) and undergo hypotrophy with smaller cross-sectional areas (CSAs), worsening their force deficit. Muscles rich in oxidative fibers do not have smaller weights and can even have hypertrophy, offsetting their specific-force deficit. These studies reveal nebulin as critically important for force development and trophicity in adult muscle. The Neb cKO phenocopies important aspects of NEM (muscle weakness, oxidative fiber-type predominance, variable trophicity effects, nemaline rods) and will be highly useful to test therapeutic approaches to ameliorate muscle weakness."}

A number of genes have been implicated in glioblastoma including mutation and deletion of PTEN. PTEN is a regulator of PI3K-mediated Akt signaling pathways and has been recognized as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma. To achieve potent therapeutic inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway in glioblastoma, it is essential to understand the interplay between the regulators of its activation. Here, ectopic expression of PTEN in the U-87MG human glioblastoma-astrocytoma cell line is shown to result in the depletion of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and to cause growth retardation and senescence. These effects are likely to be associated with PTEN-mediated cooperative perturbation of Akt and Stat3 signals. Using an in vivo rat model of glioblastoma, we showed that PTEN-overexpressing U-87MG cells failed to induce tumor formation, while untreated U-87MG cells did so. Furthermore, cells expressing the phosphorylated form of Stat3 were completely absent from the brain of rats implanted with PTEN-overexpressing U-87MG cells. Based on these results, PTEN appears to function as a crucial inhibitor of GSCs and as an inducer of senescence, suggesting that functional enhancement of the PTEN pathway will be useful to provide a therapeutic strategy for targeting glioblastoma."}

However, the functional restoration of more specific gait-related patterns such as skilled walking, balance, and individual limb movements have been insufficiently studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the behavioural effects of intrastriatal DA grafts on different aspects of normal and skilled walking in rats following unilateral 6-OHDA lesions of the medial forebrain bundle. Rats were subjected to drug-induced rotation, detailed footprint analysis, and assessment of skilled walking in the ladder rung walking test prior and after the transplantation of E14 ventral mesencephalon-derived progenitor cells. Good DAergic graft survival, as revealed by immunohistochemistry, was accompanied by a compensation of drug-induced rotational asymmetries. Interestingly, the analysis of walking patterns displayed a heterogeneous graft-induced response in skilled and non-skilled limb use. Grafted animals made fewer errors with their contralateral limbs in skilled walking than the sham-transplanted rats, and they improved their ipsi- and contralateral limb rotation. However, the parameter distance between feet showed a delayed recovery, and the stride length was not affected by the DA grafts at all. These findings indicate that ectopic intrastriatal transplantation of E14 ventral mesencephalon-derived cells promotes recovery of gait balance and stability, but does not ameliorate the shuffling gait pattern associated with 6-OHDA lesions.

Clinical reports have documented the effectiveness of estrogens to attenuate symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, and to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular stroke. This evidence is corroborated by numerous experimental studies documenting the protective role of female sex hormones both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, estrogens have been shown to promote survival and differentiation of several neuronal populations maintained in culture, and to reduce cell death associated with excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, serum deprivation or exposure to beta-amyloid. The neuroprotective effects of estrogens have been widely documented in animal models of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as cerebral ischemia. Although estrogens are known to exert several direct effects on neurones, the cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in their protective actions on the brain are not completely understood. Thus, on the basis of clinical and experimental evidence, in this review, we discuss recent findings concerning the neuronal effects of estrogens that may contribute to their neuroprotective actions. Both estrogen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms will be described. These include modulation of cell death regulators, such as Bcl-2, Akt and calpain, as well as interaction with growth factors, such as BDNF, NGF, IGF-I and their receptors.

Only in the extracellular space, neuropeptides act on G-protein coupled receptors to exert a relatively slow action both pre- and postsynaptically. Consequently, neuropeptide modulators are ideal candidates to influence epileptic tissue overexcited during seizures. Indeed, a number of neuropeptides have receptors implicated in epilepsy and many of them are considered to participate in endogenous neuroprotective actions. Neuropeptide receptors, present in the hippocampus, the most frequent focus of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy, received the largest attention as potential anti-epileptic targets. Receptors of hippocampal neuropeptides, somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, galanin, dynorphin, enkephalin, substance P, cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and receptors of some neuropeptides, which are also hormones such as ghrelin, angiotensins, corticotropin- releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, oxytocin and vasopressin involved in epilepsy are discussed in the review article.

Unfortunately, regardless of ASD etiology, existing drugs are poorly effective against core symptoms. For nearly a century a ketogenic diet (KD) has been used to treat seizures, and recent insights into mechanisms of ASD and a growing recognition that immune/inflammatory conditions exacerbate ASD risk has increased interest in KD as a treatment for ASD.

Consistent with an ASD phenotype of a higher incidence in males, control diet-fed MIA male offspring were not social and exhibited high levels of repetitive self-directed behaviors; female offspring were unaffected. However, KD feeding partially or completely reversed all MIA-induced behavioral abnormalities in males; it had no effect on behavior in females.

Although diffusion anisotropy was present in optic structures of the youngest animal, myelin-sensitive histologic staining did not show myelin before 12 days; electron microscopy confirmed lack of any myelin or its precursors during the earliest maturational stage.

Our findings provide two pieces of supporting data for the hypothesis that nonstructural changes are responsible for early anisotropic diffusion: electron microscopy shows no evidence of myelin despite diffusion anisotropy, and inhibiting the sodium-channel pump appears to remove the directional preference of water motion.

Cultured HBMECs were subjected to HP, followed 16 h later by complete oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) for 8 h; cell viability was quantified at 20 h of reoxygenation (RO) by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. HBMECs were examined at various times after HP or OGD/RO using immunoblotting and confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence microscopy for appearance of apoptotic markers and expression of phosphorylated (p)-Akt and p-survivin. Causal evidence for the participation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway in HP-induced protection and p-survivin upregulation was assessed by the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002. HP significantly reduced OGD/RO-induced injury by 50% and also significantly reduced the OGD-induced translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to nucleus and the concomitant cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). PI3-kinase inhibition blocked HP-induced increases in Akt phosphorylation, reversed the effects of HP on OGD-induced AIF translocation and PARP-1 cleavage, blocked HP-induced survivin phosphorylation, and ultimately attenuated HP-induced protection of HBMECs from OGD.

The cause and mechanisms underlying the demise of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons are not completely clarified, but interactions between genes and environmental factors are recognized to play a critical role in modulating the vulnerability to PD. Current evidence points to reactive glia as a pivotal factor in PD, but whether astroglia activation may protect or exacerbate DAergic neuron loss is presently the subject of much debate. Astrocytes and microglia are the key players in neuroinflammatory responses, by secreting an array of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, anti-oxidant and neurotrophic factors. Here, the contribution of astrocytes and their ability to influence DAergic neurodegeneration, neuroprotection and neurorepair will be discussed. In particular, the dynamic interplay between astrocyte-derived factors and neurogenic signals in MPTP-induced plasticity of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons will be summarized together with recent findings showing that reactive astrocytes may contribute to promote DAergic neurogenesis from midbrain adult neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs). Within a host of astrocyte- derived factors, we unveiled Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin signalling was unveiled, as a strong candidate in MPTP-induced DAergic neuroplasticty/neurorepair. Understanding the intrinsic plasticity of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons and decifering the signals facilitating the crosstalk between astrocytes and midbrain neuroprogenitors may have implications for the role of stem cells technology in PD and for identifying potential therapeutic targets to promote endogenous neurorepair."}

The literature points to high noise content (i.e., poor signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) as the primary reason for not using bipolar NCEs to record neural activity. In fact, over the past several decades, the pseudo-tripolar NCEs, the symmetric configuration of this electrode array (i.e., electrically-shorted side contacts) makes it very difficult to obtain directional information from the recorded neural activity (efferent vs. afferent). In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using a bipolar NCE to achieve low-noise, directionally-sensitive recording of peripheral nerve activity."}

However, no data are available as to whether 5-LO is elevated in human tauopathy or if it directly influences tau pathology in a relevant model of the disease.	We assayed 5-LO levels in brain samples from patients with tauopathy and transgenic tau mice, and we evaluated the effect of 5-LO pharmacologic inhibition on the phenotype of these mice.	The 5-LO protein is upregulated in human tauopathy and transgenic tau mice brains. Pharmacologic blockade of 5-LO in tau mice resulted in significant memory improvement, rescue of synaptic integrity and dysfunction, and reduction of tau pathology via a cdk5-dependent mechanism.	These results establish a key role of 5-LO in the development of the tau pathology phenotype and demonstrate it to be a novel viable therapeutic target for the pharmacologic treatment of human tauopathy."}

Adult male CD1 mice were treated with MA (5 mg/kgi.p.) or vehicle 30-min prior to mTBI, conducted by dropping a 30 g metal weight onto the temporal skull, anterior the right ear. At 15 min after mTBI, animals were put into locomotor activity chambers for up to 72 h. During the first 3 h, mTBI alone, compared with vehicle control, did not alter total distance travelled. Treatment with MA significantly increased locomotor activity in the control animals during the first 3 h; mTBI reduced MA-induced hyperactivity. In contrast, at 2 and 3 days after injury, mTBI or MA alone reduced locomotor activity. Co-treatment with MA and mTBI further reduced this activity, suggesting a differential and temporal behavioral interaction between MA and mTBI during acute and subacute phases after injury. Dopamine and DOPAC levels in striatal tissue were analyzed using HPLC-ECD. At 1h after mTBI or injection, DA was not altered but DOPAC level and DOPAC/DA turnover ratios were significantly reduced. Co-treatment with MA further reduced the DOPAC/DA ratio. At 36 h after injury, mTBI increased tissue DA levels, but reduced DOPAC levels and DOPAC/DA ratios. Co-treatment with MA further reduced DOPAC/DA ratios in striatum. In conclusion, our data suggest that low dosage of MA worsens the suppression of locomotor responses and striatal dopamine turnover after mTBI."}

Zafirlukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, is claimed to be effective in asthma. However, it is not known whether these leukotrienes are involved in nociceptive and peripheral inflammation. The present study aimed to assess the role of cysteinyl leukotrienes in nociceptive and inflammatory conditions in experimental animals. Central nociception was assessed with tail-flick and hot-plate methods and peripheral nociception was assessed by acetic acid-induced chemonociception in mice. Local administration (intraplantar) of carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia and inflammation, measured by paw withdrawal latency and paw volumes, respectively. Zafirlukast (2.5--20 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a significant and dose-dependent antinociceptive and antiinflammatory effect against acetic acid-induced chemonociception in mice and carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rats, respectively. Zafirlukast (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, p.o.) also attenuated the carrageenan-provoked hyperalgesia but did not alter the pain threshold in central nociception up to 20 mg/kg. Zafirlukast (5 and 10 mg/kg) significantly inhibited exudate formation and migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in carrageenan-induced pleurisy. Further, zafirlukast (5 mg/kg) also reduced myeloperoxidase activity in carrageenan-treated paw. When nimesulide (2 mg/kg, p.o.) was co-administered with zafirlukast, the antinociceptive, antihyperalgesic and antiinflammatory effects of nimesulide were significantly increased as compared to the per se effect. The results indicate that cysteinyl leukotrienes are involved in nociceptive/inflammatory conditions. It is expected that combination of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist with cyclooxygenase inhibitor would prove to be a novel approach to treat complex inflammatory conditions."}

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HJG exerts neurotrophic factor-like effects to ameliorate memory impairment in Alzheimer disease (AD) model rats. First, we describe that HJG acts to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (a rat pheochromocytoma cell line) like nerve growth factor (NGF) in a concentration-dependent manner (3 μg/ml HJG, p < 0.05; 10-500 μg/ml HJG, p < 0.001). While six herbal constituents of HJG, Rehmannia root, Dioscorea rhizome, Rhizoma Alismatis, Poria sclerotium, Moutan bark, and Cinnamon bark, could induce neurite outgrowth effects, the effect was strongest with HJG (500 μg/ml). Second, we demonstrated that HJG-induced neurite outgrowth was blocked by an inhibitor of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), KG-501 (10 μM, p < 0.001). Moreover, HJG was observed to induce CREB phosphorylation 20-90 min after treatment (20 min, 2.50 ± 0.58-fold) and CRE-mediated transcription in cultured PC12 cells (500 μg/ml, p < 0.01; 1000 μg/ml, p < 0.001). These results suggest a CREB-dependent mechanism underlies the neurotrophic effects of HJG. Finally, we examined improvements of memory impairment following HJG treatment using a Morris water maze in AD model animals (CI + Aβ rats). Repeated oral administration of HJG improved memory impairment (300 mg/kg, p < 0.05; 1000 mg/kg, p < 0.001) and induced CREB phosphorylation within the hippocampus (1000 mg/kg, p < 0.01). Together, our results suggest that HJG possesses neurotrophic effects similar to those of NGF, and can ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in a rat dementia model via CREB activation. Thus, HJG could potentially be a substitute for neurotrophic factors as a treatment for dementia."}

A single intratumoral injection of G47Δ in sciatic nerve tumors derived from human S462 MSLCs in athymic mice or mouse M2 (37-3-18-4) cells in immunocompetent mice significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival. Local IL-12 expression significantly improved the efficacy of G47Δ in syngeneic mice, while PF4 expression prolonged survival. Injection of G47Δ directly into the sciatic nerve of athymic mice resulted in only mild symptoms that did not differ from phosphate buffered saline control.

It has been thought that the primary mechanism by which labradimil does so is by acting selectively on tumor microvasculature to increase the local transvascular flow rate across the blood-brain tumor barrier. This mechanism of action does not explain why, in the clinical setting, carboplatin dosing based on patient renal function over-estimates the carboplatin dose required for target carboplatin exposure. In this study we investigated the systemic actions of labradimil, as well as other bradykinin B2 receptor agonists with a range of metabolic stabilities, in context of the local actions of the respective B2 receptor agonists on the blood-brain tumor barrier of rodent malignant gliomas.	Using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, the pharmacokinetics of gadolinium-diethyltriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA), a small MRI contrast agent, were imaged in rodents bearing orthotopic RG-2 malignant gliomas. Baseline blood and brain tumor tissue pharmacokinetics were imaged with the 1st bolus of Gd-DTPA over the first hour, and then re-imaged with a 2nd bolus of Gd-DTPA over the second hour, during which normal saline or a bradykinin B2 receptor agonist was infused intravenously for 15 minutes. Changes in mean arterial blood pressure were recorded. Imaging data was analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods.	The decrease in systemic blood pressure correlated with the known metabolic stability of the bradykinin B2 receptor agonist infused. Metabolically stable bradykinin B2 agonists, methionine-lysine-bradykinin and labradimil, had differential effects on the transvascular flow rate of Gd-DTPA across the blood-brain tumor barrier. Both methionine-lysine-bradykinin and labradimil increased the blood half-life of Gd-DTPA sufficiently enough to increase significantly the tumor tissue Gd-DTPA area under the time-concentration curve.	Metabolically stable bradykinin B2 receptor agonists, methionine-lysine-bradykinin and labradimil, enhance the transvascular delivery of small chemotherapy drugs across the BBTB of malignant gliomas by increasing the blood half-life of the co-infused drug. The selectivity of the increase in drug delivery into the malignant glioma tissue, but not into normal brain tissue or skeletal muscle tissue, is due to the inherent porous nature of the BBTB of malignant glioma microvasculature."}

NMDARs typically comprise two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. The four GluN2 subtypes (GluN2A-GluN2D) have distinct functional properties and gene expression patterns, which contribute to diverse functional roles for NMDARs in the brain. Here, we present a series of GluN2C/2D-selective negative allosteric modulators built around a N-aryl benzamide (NAB) core. The prototypical compound, NAB-14, is >800-fold selective for recombinant GluN2C/GluN2D over GluN2A/GluN2B in Xenopus oocytes and has an IC50 value of 580 nM at recombinant GluN2D-containing receptors expressed in mammalian cells. NAB-14 inhibits triheteromeric (GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2C) NMDARs with modestly reduced potency and efficacy compared to diheteromeric (GluN1/GluN2C/GluN2C) receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that structural determinants for NAB-14 inhibition reside in the GluN2D M1 transmembrane helix. NAB-14 inhibits GluN2D-mediated synaptic currents in rat subthalamic neurons and mouse hippocampal interneurons, but has no effect on synaptic transmission in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, which do not express GluN2C or GluN2D. This series possesses some druglike physical properties and modest brain permeability in rat and mouse. Altogether, this work identifies a new series of negative allosteric modulators that are valuable tools for studying GluN2C- and GluN2D-containing NMDAR function in brain circuits, and suggests that the series has the potential to be developed into therapies for selectively modulating brain circuits involving the GluN2C and GluN2D subunits."}

Following the introduction of live vaccinations in the western world by Edward Jenner in 1798 and the coining of the phrase 'vaccine', in 1881 Pasteur developed a rational design for vaccines. Pasteur proposed that in order to make a vaccine that one should 'isolate, inactivate and inject the microorganism' and these basic rules of vaccinology were largely followed for the next 100 years leading to the elimination of several highly infectious diseases. However, new technologies were needed to conquer many pathogens which could not be eliminated using these traditional technologies. Thus increasingly, computers were used to mine genome sequences to rationally design recombinant vaccines. Several vaccines for bacterial and viral diseases (i.e. meningococcus and HIV) have been developed, however the on-going challenge for parasite vaccines has been due to their comparatively larger genomes. Understanding the immune response is important in reverse vaccinology studies as this knowledge will influence how the genome mining is to be conducted. Vaccine candidates for anaplasmosis, cowdriosis, theileriosis, leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and the cattle tick have been identified using reverse vaccinology approaches. Some challenges for parasite vaccine development include the ability to address antigenic variability as well the understanding of the complex interplay between antibody, mucosal and/or T cell immune responses. To understand the complex parasite interactions with the livestock host, there is the limitation where algorithms for epitope mining using the human genome cannot directly be adapted for bovine, for example the prediction of peptide binding to major histocompatibility complex motifs. As the number of genomes for both hosts and parasites increase, the development of new algorithms for pan-genomic mining will continue to impact the future of parasite and ricketsial (and other tick borne pathogens) disease vaccine development."}

SITA severely impaired serum DPP-4 activity, but had no effect on glycaemia. Invasive haemodynamic recordings showed that SITA reduced LV passive stiffness and increased LV stroke volume; LV end-systolic elastance remained unchanged. In addition, SITA reduced resting tension of isolated single cardiomyocytes and intensified phosphorylation of the sarcomeric protein titin. SITA also increased LV concentrations of cGMP and increased activity of protein kinase G (PKG). In vitro activation of PKG decreased resting tension of cardiomyocytes from vehicle-treated mice, but had no effect on resting tension of cardiomyocytes from SITA-treated mice.	In obese Type 2 diabetic mice, in the absence of hypoglycaemic effects, inhibition of DPP-4 decreases LV passive stiffness and improves global LV performance.

To investigate the intracellular pathway of the LRP signaling involved in neurite outgrowth, we tested the effects of alpha2M* on the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). We found that 1) phospho-MAP kinase levels were altered within 30 min after treatment with alpha2M*, 2) the MAP kinase inhibitor, PD98059, specifically blocked the alpha2M*-induced neurite outgrowth, 3) manipulating intracellular calcium by BayK or BAPTA altered the neurite outgrowth and associated changes in the phospho-MAP kinase levels, which were blunted by alpha2M*, 4) alpha2M* promoted the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB through MAP kinase, and 5) LRP-specific antibodies increased levels of phosphorylated MAP kinase and phosphorylated CREB. The effects of alpha2M*, apoE3, and apoE peptides increased LRP levels in the cortical neurons, whereas LRP receptor-associated protein reduced dendritic LRP expression. These results demonstrate that p44/42 MAP kinase plays an important role in LRP-mediated neurite outgrowth with activation involving the effects on calcium homeostasis and downstream effects involving the activation of gene transcription through CREB."}

In the present study we examined the ability of various factors to influence the development of dopamine precursors. Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from the embryonic day 12 (E12) rat ventral mesencephalon, a time and place which coincides with the beginning of the birth of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. At low plating density in serum-free medium, the dopamine precursors divide for approximately 1 d in vitro. We report here that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) can expand the period of dopamine precursor division at least until day 8 in culture, which is well beyond the normal division of these cells. This increase in cell division was accompanied by a delay in differentiation as compared to untreated control cultures. Upon differentiation, the high-affinity dopamine uptake values in bFGF-treated cultures were 20 times maximal control values. Mature dopamine neurons appeared at the same time as astrocytes, which may be playing a role in inducing dopamine neuron differentiation. IGF-I, GDNF, and EGF were unable to mimic the effect of bFGF on division and differentiation of dopamine precursors. Expanding in vitro the number of dopamine precursors provides tissue that may be suitable for transplantation in patients with Parkinson's disease."}

On the next day following the operation 24 rats were injected intramuscularly with bacterial melanin solution. 12 of these rats were initially trained to ICR. Recovery periods of ICR and paralyzed hindlimb movements were registered for melanin injected rats (n=24) and for operated rats, not treated with melanin (n=24). In rats injected with bacterial melanin the posttraumatic recovery is shorter than in animals not treated with melanin. The fastest and complete recovery was registered in rats initially trained to ICR and injected after the operation with bacterial melanin. Electrophysiological experiments were performed in transected animals treated with melanin, transected animals without melanin treatment and intact animals. Spiking activity of motoneurons was registered in lumbar motoneurons of rats in response to high frequency stimulation above the corticospinal tract transection. Spiking activity was very similar in motoneurons of melanin injected and intact or non operated animals. In animals, not dosed with bacterial melanin after the operation, areactivity or no change in firing rate was registered in response to stimulus. Stimulation of the corticospinal tract of melanin injected rats produced potentiation of the motoneuronal firing rate and is an evidence of regeneration in corticospinal tract. Similarity in spiking activity of intact and melanin injected rats shows the recovery of conductance in pyramidal tract. Morphohistochemical examination was carried out to confirm the results of behavioral and electrophysiological experiments. Medulla slices were prepared to trace the regeneration of nerve fibers. Examination of transection area revealed that bacterial melanin increases vascularization, dilates the capillaries in nervous tissue and stimulates the process of sprouting."}

In most patients, symptoms of CIPN subside after treatment completion. However, in a substantial subgroup, CIPN persists long into survivorship. Impairment in pain resolution pathways may explain persistent CIPN. We investigated the contribution of T cells and endogenous interleukin (IL)-10 to resolution of CIPN. Paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia was prolonged in T-cell-deficient (Rag1[-/-]) mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. There were no differences between WT and Rag1[-/-] mice in severity of paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia. Adoptive transfer of either CD3[+] or CD8[+], but not CD4[+], T cells to Rag1[-/-] mice normalized resolution of CIPN. Paclitaxel treatment increased the number of T cells in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where CD8[+] T cells were the major subset. Inhibition of endogenous IL-10 signaling by intrathecal injection of anti-IL-10 to WT mice or Rag1[-/-] mice reconstituted with CD8[+] T cells delayed recovery from paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia. Recovery was also delayed in IL-10 knock-out mice. Conversely, administration of exogenous IL-10 attenuated paclitaxel-induced allodynia. In vitro, IL-10 suppressed abnormal paclitaxel-induced spontaneous discharges in DRG neurons. Paclitaxel increased DRG IL-10 receptor expression and this effect requires CD8[+] T cells. In conclusion, we identified a novel mechanism for resolution of CIPN that requires CD8[+] T cells and endogenous IL-10. We propose that CD8[+] T cells increase DRG IL-10 receptor expression and that IL-10 suppresses the abnormal paclitaxel-induced spontaneous discharges by DRG neurons to promote recovery from CIPN.	Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy persists after completion of cancer treatment in a significant subset of patients, whereas others recover. Persistent neuropathy after completion of cancer treatment severely affects quality of life. We propose that understanding how neuropathy resolves will identify novel avenues for treatment. We identified a novel and critical role for CD8[+] T cells and for endogenous IL-10 in recovery from paclitaxel-induced neuropathy in mice. Enhancing the capacity of CD8[+] T cells to promote resolution or increasing IL-10 signaling are promising targets for novel interventions. Clinically, peripheral blood CD8[+] T-cell function and/or the capacity of individuals to produce IL-10 may represent biomarkers of risk for developing persistent peripheral neuropathy after completion of cancer treatment."}

Sinapic acid (SA) is a bioactive phytoconstituent used as a dietary supplement for the treatment of epilepsy. This study determined the effects of SA on the pharmacokinetics of CBZ and proposed a possible interaction mechanism in twenty-four male wistar rats (180-210 g). A single CBZ dose (80 mg/kg) was administered orally to rats with or without SA pretreatment (20 mg/kg p.o. per day for 7 days, n = 6). The CBZ concentration in plasma samples was determined by using a sensitive reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography assay. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by using non-compartmental analysis. Significance was determined through Dunnett's multiple comparison test or one-way analysis of variance as appropriate; p < 0.05 were considered significant. The change in the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, T½, and kel) of CBZ was evaluated after the administration of CBZ alone or after CBZ co-administration with SA pretreatment. The plasma concentration of CBZ was higher after SA pretreatment than that without pretreatment. The pharmacokinetics of orally administered CBZ were found to be significantly altered (p < 0.05) in rats pretreated with SA compared to those in rats administered CBZ alone. The increases in the Cmax, AUC0-t, T1/2, and MRT of CBZ were 29.79%, 57.18%, 77.18%, and 58.31%, respectively, whereas the kel and apparent oral CL/F were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in rats pretreated with SA compared to those in rats not pretreated with SA (43.87% and 42.50%, respectively). However, no significant change was observed in the Tmax of CBZ in rats pretreated with SA compared to that in rats that did not receive pretreatment. The enhancement in Cmax, AUC0-t, T1/2, and MRT and the reduction in Kel and CL/F values resulted from the significant inhibition of CYP3 A2, the CYP2C11-mediated metabolism of CBZ in the liver, and the inhibition of intestinal P-glycoprotein/MDR1, which enhanced the rate of CBZ absorption.

Using serial femtosecond crystallography and multi-crystal data collection with a synchrotron light source, we determined structures of human orexin 2 receptor in complex with the subtype-selective antagonist EMPA (N-ethyl-2-[(6-methoxy-pyridin-3-yl)-(toluene-2-sulfonyl)-amino]-N-pyridin-3-ylmethyl-acetamide) at 2.30-Å and 1.96-Å resolution. In comparison with the non-subtype-selective antagonist suvorexant, EMPA contacted fewer residues through hydrogen bonds at the orthosteric site, explaining the faster dissociation rate. Comparisons among these OX2R structures in complex with selective antagonists and previously determined OX1R/OX2R structures bound to non-selective antagonists revealed that the residue at positions 2.61 and 3.33 were critical for the antagonist selectivity in OX2R.

The disease is characterized by general hallmarks seen also in human pancreatitis, such as accumulation of intraperitoneal ascites, acinar cell necrosis, and pancreatic as well as remote organ edema and inflammation. Thus, these animals make useful models for the human disease. Determination of these hallmarks can be used to assess the severity of the disease and to evaluate the efficacy of any therapy applied. The metabolic changes seen in genetically modified mice with either accelerated or inactivated polyamine catabolism have revealed that polyamine catabolism is involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. The simplest method to determine the metabolic phenotype of the animal is to assess the concentrations of blood metabolites. Fasting blood glucose level is an indicator of overall glucose homeostasis, whereas fasting insulin level is a useful marker of insulin sensitivity. A more detailed analysis of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity can be obtained by intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Blood lipid levels mainly reflect triglyceride, free fatty acid, and cholesterol metabolism. Altered blood glucose and/or lipid levels are associated with several diseases, e.g., diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, hyperthyroidism, atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, and dysfunction of the liver and kidneys."}

The aims of this study were to determine the effect of silibinin on pro-inflammatory mediators in (i) human fetal membranes and myometrium treated with bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, and (ii) in preterm fetal membranes with active infection. The effect of silibinin on infection induced inflammation and brain injury in pregnant mice was also assessed. Fetal membranes and myometrium (tissue explants and primary cells) were treated with 200 μM silibinin in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml LPS or 1 ng/ml IL-1β. C57BL/6 mice were injected with 70 mg/kg silibinin with or without 50 μg LPS on embryonic day 16. Fetal brains were collected after 6 h. In human fetal membranes, silibinin significantly decreased LPS-stimulated expression of IL-6 and IL-8, COX-2, and prostaglandins PGE2 and PGF2α. In primary amnion and myometrial cells, silibinin also decreased IL-1β-induced MMP-9 expression. Preterm fetal membranes with active infection treated with silibinin showed a decrease in IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-9 expression. Fetal brains from mice treated with silibinin showed a significant decrease in LPS-induced IL-8 and ninjurin, a marker of brain injury. Our study demonstrates that silibinin can reduce infection and inflammation-induced pro-labour mediators in human fetal membranes and myometrium. Excitingly, the in vivo results indicate a protective effect of silibinin on infection-induced brain injury in a mouse model of preterm birth."}

Male Thomae rats were divided randomly into a sham-operated group (n = 5), an ischemic control (untreated) group (n = 7) and an ischemic BDP-treated group (n = 6) and subjected to reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2h followed by 90min of reperfusion. Local cortical blood flow (LCBF) was monitored by Laser-Doppler flowmetry to assess the MCAO and to measure the blood flow in regions peripheral to the infarction. Infarcted areas of the hippocampus and subcortical structures were quantified in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stainings. Functional disturbances of the neurons were detected by immunohistochemical staining of the microtubule associated protein MAP2. Moreover, brain edema was estimated morphometrically. LCBF was estimated from the periphery of infarcted areas and was reduced to 55 to 65% of baseline values (p < 0.05). Reperfusion led to LCBF being increased again to baseline values. No differences in LCBF between the control and the BDP-treated animals were found. In the hippocampus, BDP-treated animals showed a significant reduction of loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity in the subiculum and CA1 region by 59% and 64%, respectively, in comparison to control animals (p < 0.05). The amount of irreversibly damaged neurons in these regions was decreased in tendency. However, the inner blade of the dentate gyrus in BDP-treated animals showed a significant reduction of neuronal injury by 98% (p < 0.05). Likewise, BDP treatment reduced the size of the areas showing a loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity in the thalamic and hypothalamic structures by 51% and in the mesencephalon by 81% (p < 0.05). The size of the infarcted areas in these regions (H&E) was reduced in tendency. In the caudate putamen, no protective effect of BDP-treatment could be proven. Cerebral infarction was accompanied by an increase in the volume of the ischemic hemisphere by 10 +/- 1% in the control and 8 +/- 1% in the BDP-treated animals.

Resveratrol may exert these effects by targeting several key metabolic sensor/effector proteins, such as AMPK, SIRT1, and PGC-1α. Resveratrol has also received considerable attention recently for its potential neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disorders where AMPK, SIRT1 or PGC-1α may represent promising therapeutic targets. A recent study published in Experimental Neurology (Ho et al., 2010) examined the therapeutic potential of a micronised proprietary resveratrol formulation, SRT501 in the N171-82Q transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD). HD is a progressive and devastating genetic neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with downregulation of PGC-1α activity. The Ho et al. study found that SRT501 treatment did not lead to significant improvement in weight loss, motor performance, survival and striatal atrophy. However, other studies have reported neuroprotective effects of resveratrol and a distantly related polyphenol, fisetin, in HD models. HD has been associated with diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, evidence from the Ho et al. study suggests a resveratrol formulation induced beneficial anti-diabetic effect in N171-82Q mice.

Therefore, blocking the neurotoxic effect of gp120 may lead to alternative strategies to reduce the neurotoxic effect of HIV. In vitro, the neurotoxic effect of M-tropic gp120BaL is reduced by the chemokine CCL5, the natural ligand of CCR5 receptors. To determine whether CCL5 reduces the toxic effect of gp120BaL in vivo, animals were intrastriatally injected with lentiviral vectors overexpressing CCL5 prior to an intrastriatal injection of gp120BaL (400 ng). Neuronal injury was determined by silver staining, cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL. Overexpression of CCL5 decreased gp120-mediated neuronal injury. CCL5 expression can be up-regulated by chronic morphine. Therefore, we examined whether morphine reduces the neurotoxic effect of gp120BaL. Rats stereotaxically injected with gp120BaL into the striatum received saline or chronic morphine for five days (10 mg/kg escalating to 30 mg/kg twice a day). Morphine-treated rats showed a decrease in all markers used to determine neuronal degeneration compared to saline-treated rats.

For in vitro ULDR treatments, U251 human malignant glioma cells were cultured in media containing tritiated water to yield a continuous dose rate of 0.03 Gy/hr. After exposures of 24, 48, or 72 hr, cells were acutely (1.1 Gy/min) irradiated, replated, and scored for colony formation. In vivo, U251 flank xenografts in nude mice had 125-iodine (125-I) seed brachytherapy at a dose rate of 0.05 Gy/hr. For whole-body continuous ULDR (0.03 Gy/hr), a 137-Cs source was mounted a fixed distance above the cages of animals bearing xenografts. After 3 days' continuous exposure, xenografts were acutely irradiated (2 Gy x 8 vs. 5 Gy x 2 daily fractions), and the regrowth delay in tumors was measured. In vitro, exposure to ULDR (0.03 Gy/hr) alone caused only modest killing and reduced the surviving fraction by approximately 0.2 logs after 72 hr exposure. The highest (10 Gy) dose of acute irradiation alone reduced survival by 1 log. However, U251 cell killing increased to 2.5 logs after combined HDR and ULDR treatments. Linear-quadratic modeling showed comparatively greater increase in the beta than the alpha coefficients of the linear-quadratic model for cell killing. In vivo, the 125-I seed brachytherapy treatments delayed tumor growth but resulted in no regression. The HDR treatments (5 Gy x 2 or 2 Gy x 8 daily fractions) caused growth delays (in days) of 17+/-2 or 16+/-2 (P=NS) days, respectively. The combined seed and 5 Gy x 2 or 2 Gy x 8 daily fractions regimen resulted in striking prolongation of regrowth delay (52.3+/-8.7 vs. 59.5+/-7.7 days) (P < 0.001 vs. HDR treatments alone). External ULDR alone caused no regression and minimal growth delay. Combined continuous external ULDR and the 5 Gy x 2 vs. 2 Gy x 8 daily fraction regimens resulted in prolongation of growth delay (33+/-0.9 (P=0.01 vs. 5 Gy x 2 daily fractions alone) vs. 35+/-0.7 (P=0.049 vs. 2 Gy x 8 daily fractions alone).

Despite its structural similarity to GABA, it does not bind GABAA or GABAB receptors and the mechanism, especially of its analgesic action, has remained elusive. Here, we have studied its effects on synaptic transmission mediated by the major spinal fast excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, L-glutamate and glycine, in the superficial layers of the spinal cord dorsal horn, a CNS area, which is critically involved in nociception. Gabapentin reversibly reduced evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA-EPSCs) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated by glycine (gly-IPSCs). Inhibition of AMPA-EPSCs and gly-IPSCs occurred with similar potencies (approximately 10-50 nM) and by about the same degree (approximately 40% at 1 microM).

Consequently, mutations of SCN4A encoding NaV1.4 produce pure skeletal muscle phenotypes that now include six allelic disorders: sodium channel myotonia, paramyotonia congenita, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, congenital myasthenia, and congenital myopathy with hypotonia. Mutation-specific alternations of NaV1.4 function explain the mechanistic basis for the diverse phenotypes and identify opportunities for strategic intervention to modify the burden of disease."}

Among nanomaterials, multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) are some of the best candidates for brain cancer therapy since they are well known to go across cellular barriers and display an intrinsic ability to block cancer cell proliferation triggering apoptosis. This study reveals that microglial cells, the brain macrophages and putative vehicles for MWCNTs into the brain, undergo a dose-dependent cell division arrest and apoptosis when treated with MWCNTs. Moreover, it is shown that MWCNTs severely interfere with both cell migration and phagocytosis in live microglia. These results lead to a re-evaluation of the safety of inhaled airborne CNTs and provide strategic clues of how to biocompatibilize MWCNTs to reduce brain macrophage damage and to develop new nanodrugs."}

This underlines the evidence that HAX-1 might be involved in several apoptotic pathways. In this context, it is known that cell death executed by cerebral ischemia involves both receptor- and mitochondrial apoptotic mechanisms. In this study, we performed focal cerebral ischemia in mice and investigated principally the dynamic changes of HAX-1 expression and other apoptotic agents such as HtrA2, AIF and caspase-3. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that HAX-1 was expressed at very low levels under normal conditions. Focal cerebral ischemia significantly decreased cytosolic accumulation of HAX-1, induced an upregulation of HtrA2, an upregulation of AIF and activation of caspase-3. Taken together, these results suggested that HAX-1 is probably involved in the pathophysiology of cell death induced by focal ischemia."}

While the number of individuals with AD is rising each year due to the longer life expectancy worldwide, current therapy can only somewhat relieve the symptoms of AD. There is no proven medication to cure or prevent the disease, possibly due to a lack of knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis. Most previous studies have accepted the 'amyloid hypothesis,' in which the neuropathogenesis of AD is believed to be triggered by the accumulation of the toxic amyloid beta (A β) protein in the central nervous system (CNS). Lately, knowledge that may be critical to unraveling the hidden pathogenic pathway of AD has been revealed. This review concentrates on the toxicity of A β and the mechanism of accumulation of this toxic protein in the brain of individuals with AD and also summarizes recent advances in the study of these accumulation mechanisms together with the role of herbal medicines that could facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic and preventive strategies."}

However, the relevance and significance of XMRV to human disease remain unclear, since the association has not been confirmed in other studies. XMRV is the first gammaretrovirus to be found in humans. XMRV and murine leukaemia viruses share similar structures and genomic organisation. Human restriction factors such as APOBEC3 or tetherin inhibit XMRV replication. Although XMRV induces low rates of transformation in cell culture, it might be able to induce cancer by low-frequency insertional activation of oncogenes or through the generation of highly active transforming viruses. A preference for regulatory regions of transcriptional active genes has been observed after a genomic-wide analysis of XMRV integration sites. Genes related to carcinogenesis and androgen signalling have been identified in the vicinity of integration sites. The XMRV genome contains a glucocorticoid responsive element, and androgens could modulate viral replication in the prostate. Evidence supporting the involvement of XMRV in chronic fatigue syndrome is still very weak, and needs further confirmation and validation. Currently approved anti-retroviral drugs such as zidovudine, tenofovir and raltegravir are efficient inhibitors of XMRV replication in vitro. These drugs might be useful to treat XMRV infection in humans. The identification of XMRV has potentially serious health implications for the implementation of novel techniques including gene therapy or xenotransplantation, while raising concerns on the need for screening donated blood to prevent transmission through transfusion."}

Two treatment groups with continuous i.v. infusion of 20 mg kg-1 h-1 YM872 during either the first 4 h or first 24 h after MCA occlusion, called 4 h YM872 treatment group (n=9) and 24 h YM872 treatment group (n=8) respectively, were compared to a control group (n=8). The main end-point was T2 weighted MR imaging and histopathology 24 h after MCA occlusion. Also the time evolution of the ischemic tissue damage was studied by diffusion weighted MR imaging 412 and 24 h after MCA occlusion. The volume of ischemic tissue damage as assessed by diffusion weighted MR imaging 412 h after MCA occlusion was significantly smaller in both YM872 treatment groups (99+/-52 mm3 and 102+/-44 mm3 compared to 186+/-72 mm3 in the control group, +/-S.D. and p=0.008). The infarct volume as assessed by T2 weighted MR imaging 24 h after MCA occlusion was significantly smaller only in the 24 h YM872 treatment group (262+/-57 mm3 compared to 366+/-49 mm3 in the control group, +/-S.D. and p=0.01) while the infarct volume in the 4 h YM872 treatment group (357+/-88 mm3) was similar to the control group. YM872 treatment significantly reduced the infarct volume 24 h after MCA occlusion when the drug was administered as continuous infusion during the 24-h observation period."}

Endothelial dysfunction is an early event in more common forms of atherosclerosis. Endothelial pathobiology may contribute to HGPS, but a comprehensive characterization of endothelial function in HGPS has not been performed. iPSCs derived from fibroblasts of HGPS patients or unaffected relatives were differentiated into endothelial cells (ECs). Immunofluorescent signal of the pluripotent stem cell markers SSEA4, Oct4, Sox2 and TRAI-60 was similar in HGPS or control iPSCs. Following the differentiation, FACS analysis and immunocytochemistry for CD31 and CD144 revealed a smaller percentage of ECs from HGPS iPSCs. Immunostaining for Lamin A revealed nuclear dysmorphology in HGPS iPSC-ECs. Furthermore, these cells were significantly larger and rounded, and they proliferated less, features which are typical of senescent endothelial cells. HGPS iPSC-ECs manifested less Dil-Ac-LDL uptake; less DAF-2DA staining for nitric oxide generation and formed fewer networks in matrigel in vitro. In immunodeficient mice injected with iPSC-ECs, HGPS iPSC-ECs generated a sparser vascular network compared to the control, with reduced capillary number. Telomere length (T/S ratio) of HGPS iPSC-EC was reduced as assessed by mmqPCR. iPSC-ECs derived from HGPS patients have dysmorphic appearance, abnormal nuclear morphology, shortened telomeres, reduced replicative capacity and impaired functions in vitro and in vivo. Targeting the endothelial abnormality in patients with HGPS may provide a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of this condition.

Supplement^\nMucosal tolerance to brain antigens preserves endogenous TGFβ-1 and improves neurological outcomes following experimental craniotomy.^\nIntracranial surgery causes brain damage from cortical incisions, intraoperative hemorrhage, retraction, and electrocautery; collectively these injuries have recently been coined surgical brain injury (SBI). Inflammation following SBI contributes to neuronal damage. This study develops T-cells that are immunologically tolerant to brain antigen via the exposure of myelin basic protein (MBP) to airway mucosa. We hypothesize that these T-cells will migrate to the site of corticotomy, secrete immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGFβ1, reduce inflammation, and improve neurological outcomes following SBI. A standard model for SBI was used for this experiment. C57 mice were divided into six groups: SHAM+Vehicle, SHAM+Ovalbumin, SHAM+MBP, SBI+Vehicle, SBI+OVA, and SBI+MBP. Induction of mucosal tolerance to vehicle, ovalbumin, or MBP was performed prior to SBI. Neurological scores and TBFβ1 cytokine levels were measured 48 h postoperatively. Mice receiving craniotomy demonstrated a reduction in neurological score. Animals tolerized to MBP (SBI+MBP) had better postoperative neurological scores than SBI+Vehicle and SBI+OVA. SBI inhibited the cerebral expression TGFβ1 in PBS and OVA treated groups, whereas MBP treated-animals preserved preoperative levels. Mucosal tolerance to MBP leads to significant improvement in neurological outcome that is associated with the preservation of endogenous levels of brain TGFβ1."}

Neuronal injury is associated with profound increases in cytoplasmic chloride ([Cl(-)]i) resulting in depolarizing GABA signaling, higher seizure propensity and limited efficacy of GABAergic anticonvulsants. The Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) (NKCC1) cotransporter blocker bumetanide reduces [Cl(-)]i and causes more negative GABA equilibrium potential in injured neurons. We therefore tested both the acute and chronic efficacy of bumetanide on early posttraumatic ictal-like epileptiform discharges and epileptogenesis.	Acute hippocampal slices were used as a model of severe traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic epileptogenesis. Hippocampal slices were then incubated for 3 weeks. After a 1-week latent period, slice cultures developed chronic spontaneous ictal-like discharges. The anticonvulsant and anti-epileptogenic efficacy of bumetanide, phenobarbital, and the combination of these drugs was studied.	Bumetanide reduced the frequency and power of early posttraumatic ictal-like discharges in vitro and enhanced the anticonvulsant efficacy of phenobarbital. Continuous 2-3 weeks administration of bumetanide as well as phenobarbital in combination with bumetanide failed to prevent posttraumatic ictal-like discharges and epileptogenesis.	Our data demonstrate a persistent contribution of NKCC1 cotransport in posttraumatic ictal-like activity, presumably as a consequence of chronic alterations in neuronal chloride homeostasis and GABA-mediated inhibition. New strategies for more effective reduction in posttraumatic and seizure-induced [Cl(-)]i accumulation could provide the basis for effective treatments for posttraumatic epileptogenesis and the resultant seizures."}

Using a recently described technique, a comprehensive range of physiological properties in two thenar MUs in ALS were intensively studied. In the first MU, despite a marked decline in the ability of the subject to voluntarily recruit the MU, the physiological properties of this MU remained remarkably stable over a 2-year period. In contrast, the physiological properties of the other MU declined rapidly over 5 months despite the fact that this MU could be recruited with ease throughout the study period. These differences between the progressively dysfunctional changes in these two MUs illustrates the value of such longitudinal studies of specific MUs in improving our understanding of the evolution of changes in single motoneurons in ALS. The broader application of longitudinally tracking the pathophysiological changes of the surviving MUs may prove to be a sensitive measure of disease progression and in evaluating the effectiveness of treatments."}

The secondary purpose was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of AC-90179. Like all atypical antipsychotics, AC-90179 shows high potency as an inverse agonist and competitive antagonist at 5HT2A receptors. In addition, AC-90179 exhibits antagonism at 5HT2C receptors. In contrast, AC-90179 does not have significant potency for D2 and H1 receptors that have been implicated in the dose-limiting side effects of other antipsychotic drugs. The ability of AC-90179 to block 5-HT2A receptor signaling in vivo was demonstrated by its blockade of the rate-decreasing effects of the 5-HT2A agonist, (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride, under a fixed ratio schedule of reinforcement. Similar to clozapine and haloperidol, AC-90179 attenuated phencyclidine-induced hyperactivity. Although haloperidol impaired acquisition of a simple autoshaped response and induced cataleptic-like effects at behaviorally efficacious doses, AC-90179 and clozapine did not. Furthermore, unlike haloperidol and clozapine, AC-90179 did not decrease spontaneous locomotor behavior at efficacious doses. Limited oral bioavailability of AC-90179 likely reflects rapid metabolism rather than poor absorption. Taken together, a compound with a similar pharmacological profile as AC-90179 and with increased oral bioavailability may have potential for the treatment of psychosis."}

The mechanism of the KD is not completely understood, but is thought to involve anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant processes. The nutritionally-regulated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, PPARγ, regulates genes involved in anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant pathways. Moreover, endogenous ligands of PPARγ include fatty acids suggesting a potential role in the effects of the KD. Here, we tested the hypothesis that PPARγ contributes to the anti-seizure efficacy of the KD. We found that the KD increased nuclear protein content of the PPARγ2 splice variant by 2-4 fold (P<0.05) in brain homogenates from wild-type (WT) and epileptic Kv1.1 knockout (KO) mice, while not affecting PPARγ1. The KD reduced the frequency of seizures in Kv1.1KO mice by ~70% (P<0.01). GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, prevented KD-mediated changes in PPARγ2 expression and prevented the anti-seizure efficacy of the KD in Kv1.1KO mice. Further supporting the association of PPARγ2 in mediating KD actions, the KD significantly prolonged the latency to flurothyl-induced seizure in WT mice by ~20-35% (P<0.01), but was ineffective in PPARγ2KO mice and neuron-specific PPARγKO mice. Finally, administering the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone increased PPARγ2 expression by 2-fold (P<0.01) and reduced seizures in Kv1.1KO mice by ~80% (P<0.01). Our findings implicate brain PPARγ2 among the mechanisms by which the KD reduces seizures and strongly support the development of PPARγ2 as a therapeutic target for severe, refractory epilepsy."}
