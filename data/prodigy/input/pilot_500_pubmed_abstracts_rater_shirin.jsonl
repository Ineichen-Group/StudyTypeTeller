Protocol for a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study.^\nPerioperative sleep disorders (PSD) are an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD), which is a common complication after surgery. Elderly patients who undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) often experience perioperative sleep disorders (PSD). Dexamethasone, a medication that works by inhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-suprarenal cortical axis, can reduce the negative effects of surgical stress. The objective of this study was to determine whether intravenous administration of dexamethasone at the time of anesthesia induction could improve postoperative sleep quality in elderly patients, thereby indirectly reducing the risk of postoperative cognitive impairment and accelerating postoperative rehabilitation.	This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted at a single center. A sample size of 116 patients was determined through calculation, and these patients were randomly assigned to either the dexamethasone group (group D, n = 58) or the blank control group (group C, n = 58). On the day of surgery, the anesthesia nurse prepared either diluted dexamethasone or saline in advance, according to the patient's assigned group. The blinded anesthesiologist administered the medication during induction, and a dedicated person followed up with the patient for three consecutive postoperative days. All other aspects of care were managed equally between the two groups. The primary outcome measure was sleep quality, while secondary outcome measures included postoperative sleep time, postoperative delirium (POD), pain scores, and other complications. Relevant test measures were recorded for analysis.	This study aims to investigate the impact of intravenous dexamethasone on sleep quality and duration of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). If the findings of this study protocol are affirmative, it could enhance the sleep quality of elderly patients after surgery, thereby minimizing the risk of postoperative delirium (POD), and providing substantial evidence for the perioperative enhanced recovery management of elderly patients.

In the U.S. Great Plains, encroachment by eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) (ERC) may be expanding conducive habitat for mosquitoes and their hosts, but few studies have evaluated associations between ERC encroachment and West Nile virus (WNV). To test the hypotheses that mosquito abundance and WNV-infected mosquitoes increase with increasing ERC cover, we collected mosquitoes in 32 sites in Oklahoma reflecting various ERC encroachment stages. We found support for our first hypothesis, as mean abundance of Aedes albopictus increased significantly with ERC cover. However, Psorophora columbiae and Anopheles quadrimaculatus abundance decreased with increasing ERC. There was no significant association with ERC for other mosquito species. We could not test our second hypothesis due to low WNV prevalence, but the only detected WNV-infected pool of mosquitoes (Cx. tarsalis) was collected in ERC. Our results suggest ERC encroachment increases abundance of at least one medically important mosquito species, but further research is needed to clarify how encroachment affects ecology of the entire WNV disease system through changes to vector and host communities, vector-host interactions, and thus disease transmission and prevalence. Understanding relationships between woody plant encroachment and the nidus of infection for mosquito-borne diseases will be crucial for targeting public health efforts, including land management activities that limit and/or eradicate woody plant encroachment, particularly in areas with high levels of disease risk."}

Using longitudinal data from an epidemiological twin sample (N = 7463), this study tested whether resilience would act as a buffer for stressful life events (SLEs) against risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Resilience, demographics, and psychopathology were measured at Time 1 and recent SLEs and current MDD and GAD were measured at Time 2.	Final models, controlling for demographic covariates and Time 1 diagnosis, examined the impact of Time 1 resilience, recent SLEs, their interaction, and a three-way interaction adding sex on MDD and GAD.	The pattern of findings was the same for MDD and GAD, wherein main effects and two-way interactions of resilience and SLEs were significant, such that greater resilience was protective even in the context of high numbers of past-year SLEs. The three-way interaction was not significant, suggesting that the relationship between SLEs and resilience on psychopathology was the same for both men and women. Findings support the conceptualization of resilience as a buffer against the impact of future life stressors on common internalizing psychopathology.

There is accumulating evidence indicating a central role for the previously unknown but ubiquitous endocannabinoid physiological control system (EPCS) in the regulation of the rewarding effects of abused substances. Thus an endocannabinoid hypothesis of drug reward is postulated. Endocannabinoids mediate retrograde signaling in neuronal tissues and are involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission to suppress neurotransmitter release by the presynaptic cannabinoid receptors (CB-Rs). This powerful modulatory action on synaptic transmission has significant functional implications and interactions with the effects of abused substances. Our data, along with those from other investigators, provide strong new evidence for a role for EPCS modulation in the effects of drugs of abuse, and specifically for involvement of cannabinoid receptors in the neural basis of addiction. Cannabinoids and endocannabinoids appear to be involved in adding to the rewarding effects of addictive substances, including, nicotine, opiates, alcohol, cocaine, and BDZs. The results suggest that the EPCS may be an important natural regulatory mechanism for drug reward and a target for the treatment of addictive disorders."}

Although most studies have focused on the pathology of the injured brain, we have noted that the liver plays an important role in TBI. Using two mouse models of TBI, we found that the enzymatic activity of hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) was rapidly decreased and then returned to normal levels following TBI, whereas such changes were not observed in the kidney, heart, spleen, or lung. Interestingly, genetic downregulation of hepatic Ephx2 (which encodes sEH) ameliorates TBI-induced neurological deficits and promotes neurological function recovery, whereas overexpression of hepatic sEH exacerbates TBI-associated neurological impairments. Furthermore, hepatic sEH ablation was found to promote the generation of A2 phenotype astrocytes and facilitate the production of various neuroprotective factors associated with astrocytes following TBI. We also observed an inverted V-shaped alteration in the plasma levels of four EET (epoxyeicosatrienoic acid) isoforms (5,6-, 8,9-,11,12-, and 14,15-EET) following TBI which were negatively correlated with hepatic sEH activity. However, hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally regulates the plasma levels of 14,15-EET, which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, we found that the application of 14,15-EET mimicked the neuroprotective effect of hepatic sEH ablation, while 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid blocked this effect, indicating that the increased plasma levels of 14,15-EET mediated the neuroprotective effect observed after hepatic sEH ablation. These results highlight the neuroprotective role of the liver in TBI and suggest that targeting hepatic EET signaling could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating TBI."}

Formalin-fixed intact hemispheres from 9 CAA cases and 2 elderly controls were scanned at 3-tesla MRI, including a diffusion-weighted sequence. DTI measures (i.e., fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) and histopathology measures were obtained from 2 tracts: the anterior thalamic radiation and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.	FA was reduced in both tracts and MD was increased in cases with CAA compared to controls. Regional FA was significantly correlated with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, axonal density, and white matter microinfarcts. MD correlated significantly with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, and white matter microinfarcts, but not axonal density. FA and MD did not correlate with oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or gliosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that tissue rarefaction (β = -0.32 ± 0.12, p = 0.009) and axonal density (β = 0.25 ± 0.12, p = 0.04) were both independently associated with FA, whereas myelin density was independently associated with MD (β = -0.32 ± 0.12, p = 0.013). Finally, we found an association between increased MD in the frontal white matter and CAA severity in the frontal cortex (p = 0.035).	These results suggest that overall tissue loss, and in particular axonal and myelin loss, are major components underlying CAA-related alterations in DTI properties observed in living patients. The findings allow for a more mechanistic interpretation of DTI parameters in small vessel disease and for mechanism-based selection of candidate treatments to prevent vascular cognitive impairment."}

An automatic oscillometric BP device was used. BP was measured in both arms in the (back) supine and both lateral decubitus positions.	In total, 54 consecutive acute stroke patients were included.

Measurements of BP in the lateral decubitus positions resulted in significantly lower BP readings in the uppermost arm (around 12 mm Hg in both arms) and significantly higher readings in the right lowermost arm (around 6 mm Hg) compared to the supine position. This effect seemed less pronounced when the left lowermost arm was measured. There was no relation between change of BP readings in various lateral positions and side of stroke.	Alternating lateral decubitus positions according to nursing standards in acute stroke patients lead to a mean 18 mm Hg BP fluctuation.

Ubiquitin and TDP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed on postmortem tissue from sporadic ALS (n = 59), ALS with SOD1 mutations (n = 15), SOD-1-negative FALS (n = 11), and ALS with dementia (n = 26).

These findings implicate pathological TDP-43 in the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS.

However, the relationship between the mechanical impact level and neurological severity following weight-drop-induced TBI remains uncertain. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the relationship between physical impact and graded severity at various weight-drop heights.	The acceleration, impact force, and displacement during the impact were accurately measured using an accelerometer, a pressure sensor, and a high-speed camera, respectively. In addition, the longitudinal changes in neurological deficits and balance function were investigated at 1, 4, and 7 days post TBI lesion. The inflammatory expression markers tested by Western blot analysis, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, beta-amyloid precursor protein, and bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X, in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were investigated at 1 and 7 days post-lesion.	Gradations in impact pressure produced progressive degrees of injury severity in the neurological score and balance function. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all inflammatory expression markers were increased at 1 and 7 days post-impact injury when compared to the sham control rats. The severity of neurologic dysfunction and induction in inflammatory markers strongly correlated with the graded mechanical impact levels.	We conclude that the weight-drop-induced TBI model can produce graded brain injury and induction of neurobehavioral deficits and may have translational relevance to developing therapeutic strategies for TBI."}

Methods: A total of 120 outpatients with ID or DD were recruited in the Department of Neurology, Affiliated Children's Hospital of Capital Institute of Pediatrics between September 2015 and April 2017. Target gene sequencing was used to screen the candidate gene. The sequencing data were analyzed by a variety of bioinformatics software. Combining with the phenotypes of the patients, the candidate genetic/genomic variants were identified from next-generation sequencing data. The final pathogenicity of the genetic/genomic variants were interpreted according to the guideline of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) for variants after segregation analysis in the parents and necessary family members by Sanger sequencing. The comprehensive physiological function and signaling pathways of 20 disease genes with de novo point mutation discovery was also studied. Results: Among the 120 patients, 23 patients were found to carry clear pathological changes, and the incidence of de novo point variation was 19.2%. The patients included 12 males and 11 females, with an age of 2 months to 6-year-6-month. Five patients were diagnosed with early onset of epileptic encephalopathy.

Weill-Marchesani syndrome type 2 was found in one case, Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome in one case, Coffin-Siris syndrome in two cases, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome in one case, GLUT1 deficiency syndrome in one case, Rett syndrome in one case, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome 3 in one case, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation in one case, corpus callosum local dysplasia in one case, and congenital fibrosis of the extra-ocular muscles in one case. A total of 20 novel mutations were reported in this study. No somatic mutation was found in the samples of 6 patients with mutation and their parents' peripheral blood DNA samples by amplicon-based deep sequencing. This study found that the main disease genes were involved in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, autophagy body assembly, MAPK signal pathway, DNA methylation, potassium, sodium ion transport, cell skeleton assembly and skeletal muscle development. These genes were significantly enriched in the following biological processes: Ras signaling pathways, transcription factor binding and cancer related signaling pathway. Conclusions: The etiology of children affected with intellectual disability or developmental delay is complex. Harmful de novo point mutation plays an important role in these diseases.

Subjects were 68 45- to 85-year-old, highly stressed care-givers to spouses with Alzheimer's disease. Results indicate that of the four operationalizations, Satisfaction with Support was the only significant predictor of depression and general psychopathology. The set of four support variables showed the strongest relationship to depression level, next strongest to general psychopathology, and least to physical health. The satisfaction with nine social support dimensions related differentially to the types of adjustment.

The current study is the first to examine changes in meal-related anxiety as a predictor of outcomes in the context of a family-based partial hospitalization program. A sample of 51 adolescents with anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia rated anxiety before and after all treatment meals using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS). Regression analyses suggested that participants experiencing a greater reduction in meal anxiety endorsed fewer eating disordered symptoms on the EDE at the end of treatment. Reductions in meal anxiety did not predict EBW at end of treatment, which could be because family-based treatment (FBT) supports adequate food intake regardless of meal anxiety (i.e., parents ensure food intake). Findings suggest that reductions in meal-related anxiety may be an important predictor of outcomes in family-based interventions, and future research is needed to examine if directly targeting meal anxiety may enhance outcomes."}

A random selection of primary schools provided a sample that included 49 schools with 6541 children in Grades 1 and 6. Examinations of the eyes of 96%, of these children were conducted doing visual acuity screening to 0.5. All 6292 children had an external eye examination. All children failing the visual acuity test had a complete eye examination.	Amblyopia was found in 0.92%, strabismic amblyopia in 0.48%, anisometropic amblyopia in 0.44% and strabismus with or without amblyopia was seen in 0.9%. There was statistically significantly (p<0.05) more amblyopia in 11-12 year olds (Grade 6) when compared with the 6-7 year olds (Grade 1). This difference was only found among the strabismic children.	When compared to Europe or North America the prevalence of strabismic amblyopia is lower, whereas anisometropic amblyopia occurs with approximately the same frequency. The increase of strabismic amblyopia in the older children indicates a development of amblyopia after the age of 6 to 7 years in an untreated population."}

A retrospective study was undertaken to define better the incidence and clinical features of this infection, and to establish current diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. Forty cases of spinal epidural abscess were encountered at our institution between July 1979 and March 1991. All medical records and radiological images were reviewed. We report a significant increase in the incidence of epidural abscess after June 1988 (p = 0.0195). Sixteen patients used drugs intravenously, and six had undergone spinal procedures. Twelve patients were misdiagnosed in various emergency rooms or clinics and discharged. Localized back pain, fever, and neurological deficit remained the typical clinical manifestations. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated uniformly when measured (21 cases). Magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic specifically in 23 of 24 instances. The majority of patients underwent surgical drainage, but five selected patients were managed nonoperatively. The highly variable presentation of spinal epidural abscess may confuse the diagnosis and delay indicated surgical intervention. Localized back pain in a febrile patient at significant risk for epidural abscess warrants erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement. The presence of erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevation or evidence of spinal cord compression on physical examination are indications for immediate magnetic resonance imaging examination with contrast enhancement. Surgical drainage with sustained intravenous antibiotic treatment remains the cornerstone of therapy. Nonoperative management may be considered in selected cases."}

It is the purpose of this paper to outline these possibilities and the characteristics unique to each. The differential diagnosis can be grouped into central (central nervous system) and peripheral (otologic) categories, with a few miscellaneous conditions. A basic evaluation should include a complete neurotologic examination, audiogram and electronystagmogram. An electroencephalogram is frequently a valuable diagnostic adjunct. Further testing should be decided on the basis of the patient's history, examination and prior results. The records of children admitted to Boston City Hospital over a one-year period were reviewed.

During the past 15 years, considerable research activity has focused on psychometrically identified individuals hypothesized to be en route to schizophrenia (i.e., putative schizotypes). The Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) has figured prominently in such prediction-oriented psychometric high-risk work. This report examines research using the PAS completed since 1987 that has established the instrument as a valid index for detecting liability for schizophrenia (or schizotypy) and as, arguably, the schizotypy index of choice for research. These results are presented and interpreted in light of Meehl's theoretical framework of schizotypy. Other measures of and assessment devices for schizotypy (schizophrenia-related liability) are identified. Of these other measures, the Chapmans' Magical Ideation Scale and the schizophrenia liability index of Moldin and colleagues are particularly well established. Methodologic suggestions for future psychometric high-risk and other work using objective measures of schizotypic psychopathology are offered. It is strongly recommended that future studies of schizotypy (or those in the planning stages, relying on psychometric detection methods use multiple psychometric indices to tap schizotypy or use a psychometric index in association with other promising biobehavioral markers of schizophrenia liability (e.g., sustained attentional deficits, eye movement dysfunction) for maximum efficiency in both location and definition of schizotypes."}

Children with ASD did not differ significantly from TD children in gray matter asymmetries, but were significantly less left-lateralized than TD children in the volume and radial diffusivity (RD) of the arcuate fasciculus (AF). They did not differ in the fractional anisotropy (FA) or the mean or axial diffusivity of the AF. Within the ASD group, exploratory analyses revealed that decreased leftward/increased rightward asymmetry of pars opercularis was associated with higher language ability and bilaterally increased FA and decreased RD of the AF. In conclusion, children with ASD exhibited atypical asymmetry in language-related white-matter structure as well as an atypical pattern of brain-language relationships that suggest that they may meet language milestones and acquire normal language via a different neurodevelopmental trajectory from TD children."}

Survey-weighted odds ratios adjusted for demographics, additional medical, and mental disorders were calculated for associations between ADHD and medical conditions. Models adjusted for demographics revealed significantly increased odds of allergy, asthma, enuresis, headache/migraine, and serious stomach or bowel problems. After adjusting for comorbidity, across the medical conditions, enuresis and serious stomach problems were the strongest correlates of ADHD. These findings confirm the pervasive medical comorbidity of ADHD reported in previous clinical and community-based studies.

In cases in whom the compensatory circulation during the carotid clamp time is not sufficient, the use of intraluminal shunts has been proposed. However, the use of intraluminal shunts present several problems, such as the technical difficulties in positioning the shunt, the variability of time requested for the placement, the inconstancy of the blood flow during surgery, and the need to clamp off the carotid to introduce and remove the shunt. For these reasons, most operators prefer not to employ intraluminal shunts, while others do use them only in selected cases. The purpose of this work is to present, for the first time, a new type of temporary extraluminal shunt, connecting the femoral to the internal carotid artery with the interposition of a roller pump to regulate the blood flow. This method allows one to perform carotid endarterectomy without interrupting the blood flow to the brain.	407 consecutive patients, who underwent carotid endarterectomy between August 1992 and April 2000, were considered. 35 patients presented an absolutely insufficient collateral circulation, demonstrated by important modifications of the electroencephalographic monitoring during the carotid clamp time. In these patients the endarterectomy was performed using a new femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt.	In all the cases in whom the femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt was positioned, the normalisation of electroencephalographic monitoring was achieved by regulating the blood flow with the interposed roller pump. The use and the placement of the shunt was simple and easy. None of the patients showed postoperative complications, except for one who had a stroke two days after surgery.

Cell 71:765). To directly investigate the role of acid SMase in IL-1 and TNF receptor-mediated signal transduction, we examined the ability of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) type A fibroblasts, which are deficient in acid SMase, to induce IL-8 gene expression through activating NFkB. Unexpectedly, IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha efficiently induced IL-8 production and IL-8 mRNA in NPD type A fibroblasts as in normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, activation of NFkB was also induced in NPD type A fibroblasts in response to IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha stimulation to a similar extent as in normal fibroblasts. These results provide evidence that acid SMase is not essential in IL-1 and TNF receptor signaling leading to NFkB activation as well as the cytokine gene activation which is regulated by NFkB."}

Furthermore, a specific category of women, deemed to be women-at-risk, face particular challenges in their journey and resettlement process. This longitudinal study investigated psychological distress in refugee women-at-risk one year after resettlement in Australia. Follow-up survey of 83 women-at-risk (mean age = 33.41 years; SD = 11.93) assessed: trauma events and symptoms; loss events and loss distress; level of post-migration problems; anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms; and absence of trust in community members. Participants demonstrated no symptom change since initial assessment (p > .05). Substantial proportions of women reported traumatization (39%), PTSD (20%), anxiety (32%), and depression (39%) above clinical cut-offs, and high levels of somatization and loss distress. Post-migration problems, trauma events, and region of birth were associated with all symptoms, with post-migration problems the strongest predictor. Absence of trust in community members was associated with trauma, depression, and somatic symptoms. Initial trauma and somatic symptoms were associated with follow-up traumatic and somatic symptoms. Loss and trauma events were associated with loss distress. Findings underline the role of post-migration problems on psychological distress and the need to consider women's psychological wellbeing in the context of their trauma and loss history, potential impacts of ethnicity, and complex socio-cultural dynamics underpinning issues of trust within communities. Effective service delivery requires that practitioners screen for and address psychological distress in women-at-risk at least up to 18 months after resettlement."}

Understanding the molecular interaction of these compounds with various anti-Parkinsonian drug targets is of interest. The present study is intended to explore binding modes of catechins with molecular targets having potential role in PD. Lamarckian genetic algorithm methodology was adopted for molecular docking simulations employing AutoDock 4.2 program. Toxicity potential and molecular properties responsible for good pharmacokinetic profile were calculated by Osiris property explorer and Molinspiration online toolkit, respectively. A strong correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.893) was obtained between experimentally reported and docking predicted activities of native co-crystallized ligands of the 18 target receptors used in current study. Analysis of docked conformations revealed monoamine oxidase-B as most promising, while N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor was recognized as the least favorable target for catechins. Benzopyran skeleton with a phenyl group substituted at the 2-position and a hydroxyl (or ester) function at the 3-position has been identified as common structural requirements at majority of the targets.

Many adolescents use the internet to seek health care information. However, young people face barriers before they can understand and apply the health information that they access on the web. It is essential that usability of adolescent health websites on the internet is improved to help adolescents overcome these barriers and allow them to engage successfully with web-based health care content.	The aim of this review was to synthesize the usability of specific health information websites. These findings were mapped onto the adolescent neurodevelopmental profile, and a design brief based on the findings was developed to tailor future websites for specific adolescent requirements.	A systematic search conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) identified 25 studies that assessed the usability of health information websites. Adolescent feedback was collected by a mixture of surveys, focus groups, interviews, and think-aloud procedures.	A majority of the information websites were developed for specific health issues that may be relevant to adolescents. The most preferred website features were interactive content such as games and quizzes, as well as videos, images, audio clips, and animations. Participants also preferred communicating with other adolescents with similar conditions or learning about their experience through real stories and testimonials. Adolescents found it difficult to use health information websites if they contained too much text, were too cluttered, or had features that made it difficult to access. The findings are considered in the context of adolescent social processes, low tolerance of delayed gratification, and attraction to novelty and mapped onto a neurodevelopmental model of adolescence.	Young people's feedback can determine usability and content that make a health information website easy or informative to use.

Three novel OACs--dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban--are approved for use in atrial fibrillation in Canada. They have each been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials where they have been shown to be noninferior, or in some cases superior, to warfarin (Coumadin). Prescription coverage for these drugs is increasingly available through third party and government drug plans. The major enhancements of the novel OACs relate to their rapid, consistent anticoagulant effect at fixed dosing and the lack of need for monitoring of anticoagulant effect. Nonetheless, their use is not foolproof and practitioners must be familiar with their limitations. On balance, we favour the use of novel OACs over warfarin in patients who are anticoagulant-naive, given their increased ease of use. However, we advocate switching from warfarin only if international normalized ratio control has been poor or if frequent monitoring is problematic."}

Besides motor impairment, PD patients exhibit non-motor symptoms that negatively impact their quality of life and often manifest prior to motor deficits. One such symptom is mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), which is comprised of deficits in executive function such as working memory, attention, cognitive flexibility, and spatial memory. The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced unilateral medial forebrain bundle (MFB) lesion animal model successfully recapitulates PD motor impairment but is also used to assess non-motor deficits. The present study utilizes a unilateral 6-OHDA induced MFB lesion rodent model to investigate prefrontal cortex (PFC)-mediated cognitive processes that are impaired in PD patients. In a test of attentional set shifting, PD rodents demonstrated deficits in simple discrimination, but not in rule reversal or extradimensional shifts. PD rodents also exhibited deficits in a temporal order memory task but had no deficits in novel/spatial object recognition or object-in-place tasks. These results reveal limitations of the 6-OHDA induced unilateral MFB lesion model to completely recapitulate PD-MCI symptoms suggesting a need for better lesion models to study PD-MCI."}

This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of fasting in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We found that fasting every other day rather than weekly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor in the nigrostriatal pathway. Therefore, we maintained the animals on alternate-day fasting for 2 weeks and injected MPTP (30 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) for five days. We observed that alternate-day fasting attenuated MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss and astroglial activation in the substantia nigra and the striatum. Moreover, neurochemical analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography showed that alternate-day fasting reduced MPTP-induced depletion of striatal dopamine. Consistent with these results, behavioral tests showed that fasting suppressed the motor impairment caused by MPTP. Furthermore, fasting increased the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B, which are downstream signaling molecules of neurotrophic factors. Fasting also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein, further supporting the involvement of neurotrophic factors in the observed neuroprotective effects. Hence, our results demonstrated the dopaminergic neuroprotection of intermittent fasting in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, supporting the idea that fasting could be an instrumental tool for preventing neurodegeneration in the brain."}

However, limited functional references for global pathway relationships exist. Pathways from databases such as KEGG and Reactome provide discrete annotations of biological processes. Their relationships are currently either inferred from gene set enrichment within specific experiments, or by simple overlap, linking pathway annotations that have genes in common. Here, we provide a unifying interpretation of functional interaction between pathways by systematically quantifying coexpression between 1,330 canonical pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to establish the Pathway Coexpression Network (PCxN). We estimated the correlation between canonical pathways valid in a broad context using a curated collection of 3,207 microarrays from 72 normal human tissues. PCxN accounts for shared genes between annotations to estimate significant correlations between pathways with related functions rather than with similar annotations. We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships.

PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS). A total of 84 different mutations were detected, and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals. Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations, 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity (severe PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). Then, 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications. The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity. These patients are considered functionally hemizygous.	The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level. Cognitive performance (IQ) was also significantly related to genotype. The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96, respectively, whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84, respectively. Of the patients with PKU, 92% had been treated during childhood. Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations. Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for >6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group.	The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances.

Results corresponded with previous published studies. No correlation was observed between Doppler indices and gestation as component velocities all increase with advancing gestation. Less variation and smaller standard deviation of CBFV's was associated with a smaller angle of insonation. Low RIs (<0.55), without a pathological cause, warrants further study."}

The study included 200 hypertensive older males without previous cardiovascular diseases. Clinic blood pressure (BP) was measured using a standard approach. Cerebrovascular health was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging in the following four aspects: Intracranial atherosclerosis as determined by vessel wall imaging; Vascular rarefaction (defined as less discernible vessels on angiography) was evaluated using a custom-developed technique. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) were assessed using arterial spin-labeling imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, respectively.	A total of 189 subjects had MRI scans. The mean age was 64.9 (± 7.2) years. For intracranial atherosclerosis, there was a significant association between uncontrolled hypertension and presence of intracranial plaque. When systolic and diastolic BP were analyzed separately, the association remained significant for both. For vascular rarefaction, uncontrolled hypertension was associated with less discernible vessel branches or shorter vessel length on angiography. Further analysis revealed that this is due to uncontrolled diastolic BP, but not uncontrolled systolic BP. There was an association between uncontrolled hypertension and reduced CBF, which was also mainly driven by uncontrolled diastolic BP. We also found that uncontrolled diastolic BP, but not uncontrolled systolic BP, was associated with increased WMH volume.	Uncontrolled hypertension was associated with subclinical cerebrovascular injury globally, with both small and medium-to-large arteries being affected.	• In this study, we leveraged the advantage of a series of cutting-edge MR imaging and analysis techniques and found uncontrolled hypertension is associated with subclinical globally compromised cerebrovascular health. • The detrimental consequences of uncontrolled BP affect not only the small vessels but also the medium-to-large arteries, and uncontrolled systolic and diastolic BP are both independently associated with certain types of cerebrovascular injury. • Our data suggest that cerebrovascular health is impaired globally in uncontrolled hypertension before the onset of stroke."}

We incorporated 1 year of EEG reports read by four adult EEG readers at our institution. We used SQL queries to determine EEG findings for subsequent analysis. We generated logistic regression models for particular EEG findings, dependent on patient age, location acuity, and EEG reader. We derived a novel measure, the κBEST statistic, from the logistic regression coefficients.	Increasing patient age and location acuity were associated with decreased sleep and increased diffuse abnormalities. For certain findings, EEG readers exhibited the dominant influence, manifesting directly as lower between-reader κBEST scores for certain EEG findings. Within-reader κBEST control scores were higher than between-reader scores, suggesting internal consistency.	The κBEST metric can measure significant interrater reliability differences between any number of EEG readers and reports, retrospectively, and is generalizable to other domains (e.g., pathology or radiology reporting). We suggest using this metric as a guide or starting point for focused quality control efforts."}

Repeated resting-state MEG recordings and clinical assessments were obtained in the context of a unique longitudinal cohort study over a seven-year period using a multiple longitudinal design. We used linear mixed-models to analyze the relationship between neurophysiological (spectral power and functional connectivity) and clinical data. At baseline, early-stage (drug-naïve) PD patients demonstrated spectral slowing compared to healthy controls in both subcortical and cortical brain regions, most outspoken in the latter. Over time, spectral slowing progressed in strong association with clinical measures of disease progression (cognitive and motor). Global functional connectivity was not different between groups at baseline and hardly changed over time. Therefore, investigation of associations with clinical measures of disease progression were not deemed useful. An analysis of individual connections demonstrated differences between groups at baseline (higher frontal theta, lower parieto-occipital alpha2 band functional connectivity) and over time in PD patients (increase in frontal delta and theta band functional connectivity).

From March 2006 to July 2008, MRI was performed on 135 pregnant women whose fetuses diagnosed as fetal ventriculomegaly at an average of 32 gestational weeks in Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University. Mild ventriculomegaly was defined when the width of unilateral or bilateral fetal cerebral ventricle triangle was 10-15 mm, moderate ventriculomegaly 16-20 mm and severe ventriculomegaly >20 mm. We introduced the Denver developmental screening test (DDST) to follow-up the mild ventriculomegaly and normal babies, confirmed by MRI, at 6-12 months after birth and a case-control study was conducted. The intelligence and growth of these infants were analyzed.	(1) Diagnostic rate of fetal ventriculomegaly through MRI: Among the 135 gravidas, 60 (44.4%) showed isolated ventriculomegaly, 5(3.7%) complicated with ventricular hemorrhage; 12 (8.9%) complicated with agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) and 2 (1.5%) complicated with cerebellar hypoplasia, while 56 (41.5%) were normal. Seventy-nine cases had fetal ventriculomegaly on MRI and 15.2% (n = 12) of them complicated with ACC. (2) Degree of fetal ventriculomegaly on MRI: Among the 60 isolated ventriculomegaly cases, 55 (91.7%) were mild and 5 (8.3%) moderate ones. Among the 5 cases complicated with ventricular hemorrhage, one was mild ventriculomegaly, and 4 moderate or severe cases. Among the 12 cases with ACC, 8 (66.7%) were moderate ventriculomegaly and 4 (33.3%) severe cases. The 2 cases with cerebellar hypoplasia were both moderate ventriculomegaly fetuses. (3) Follow-up at 6-12 months after birth: thirty out (case group) of the 55 isolated ventriculomegaly cases, 38 out of the 56 normal babies and 42 babies with normal MRI results were followed up, and the later 80 cases were taken as control. Four infants (13.3%) in the case group and 10 (12.5%) in the control group showed abnormal or suspected results in DDST (P > 0.05), the rest babies were all normal. (4) Clinical outcomes of the 79 ventriculomegaly fetuses diagnosed by MRI: thirty mild ventriculomegaly babies and 5 moderate ones were born at term and showed normal at follow ups. However, 7 gravidas were not compliant, 6 pregnancies were terminated, and 12 were lost. Three of the 12 cases with ACC continued the pregnancy, and postnatal MRI of the babies showed the same with the prenatal MRI, 8 pregnancies were induced and one was lost. All of the 5 fetuses with ventricular hemorrhage were induced and the prenatal diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy. One of the 2 fetuses with cerebellar hypoplasia was term delivered and diagnosed as cerebral palsy at the age of 6 months, and the other one was induced.	MRI is an indispensable complementary diagnostic method for fetal ventriculomegaly diagnosed through ultrasound. The development of intelligence and growth of babies born with mild isolated ventriculomegaly is the same as normal ones."}

However, direct evidence of FR production in neurons during seizures has never been presented. Using hippocampal cultured slices we demonstrate that FRs are produced in CA3 but not CA1 pyramidal neurons during the rhythmic synchronous activity induced by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. The production of FRs (measured as changes in the fluorescence emission of dihydrorhodamine 123) was correlated with an increase in the baseline levels of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) estimated by fluo-3 injected into individual neurons via a patch pipette. [Ca2+]i increased during spike bursting and returned to baseline levels after the burst termination in CA1, but not in CA3, pyramidal neurons where 'interburst' calcium concentrations progressively increased. Measurement of cell death, performed with propidium iodide 48 h after a 30-min exposure to bicuculline, revealed most prominent degeneration of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 pyramidal layer. The FR scavengers vitamin E and glutathione significantly reduced the seizure-induced neurodegeneration without supressing spontaneous epileptiform activity. These observations indicate that FR overproduction is related to seizure-induced neuronal death."}

In this study, we found that microRNA-103 (miR-103), microRNA-195 (miR-195), or microRNA-15b (miR-15b), which all have the same 5' 'seed' miRNA portion and share common binding sites in the SALL4 3'-untranslated region (UTR), were downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. These miRNAs suppressed glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, induced cell apoptosis, and decreased the level of the SALL4 protein, but not that of SALL4 mRNA, which was identified as a direct target of all three miRNAs. The caspase-3/7 activity expression in U251 cells overexpressing these miRNAs was rescued during SALL4 upregulation. An obvious inverse correlation was observed between SALL4 and miR-103 or miR-195 expression levels in clinical glioma samples. Moreover, enforced expression of SALL4 stimulated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, these data suggest that miR-103, miR-195, and miR-15b post-transcriptionally downregulated the expression of SALL4 and suppressed glioma cell growth, migration, and invasion, and increased cell apoptosis.

We performed multispectral optoacoustic tomography of the lumbar spinal cord before and after an oxygen enhancement challenge in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. In addition, mice were transcardially perfused with lectin to label the vasculature and their spinal columns were optically cleared, followed by light sheet fluorescence microscopy. To analyze the angioarchitecture of the intact spine, we used VesSAP, a novel deep learning-based framework. In EAE mice, the spinal cord had lower oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration compared to healthy mice, indicating compromised perfusion of the spinal cord. Oxygen administration reversed hypoxia in the spinal cord of EAE mice, although the ventral region remained hypoxic. Additionally, despite the increased vascular density, we report a reduction in length and complexity of the perfused vascular network in EAE. Taken together, these findings highlight a new aspect of neuroinflammatory pathology, revealing a significant degree of hypoxia in EAE in vivo that is accompanied by changes in spinal vascular perfusion.

Although several mitochondrial abnormalities have been identified, how mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations contribute to GBM biology and therapeutic response remains poorly described. We sought to determine the spectrum of functional complex III and IV mtDNA mutations in GBM.	The complete mitochondrial genomes of 10 GBM cell lines were obtained using next-generation sequencing and combined with another set obtained from 32 GBM tissues. Three-dimensional structural mapping and analysis of all the nonsynonymous mutations identified in complex III and IV proteins was then performed to investigate functional importance.	Over 200 mutations were identified in the mtDNAs, including a significant proportion with very low mutational loads. Twenty-five were nonsynonymous mutations in complex III and IV, 9 of which were predicted to be functional and affect mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. Most of the functional candidates were GBM specific and not found in the general population, and 2 were present in the germ-line. Patient-specific maps reveal that 43% of tumors carry at least one functional candidate.	We reveal that the spectrum of GBM-associated mtDNA mutations is wider than previously thought, as well as novel structural-functional links between specific mtDNA mutations, abnormal mitochondria, and the biology of GBM.

In contrast, CREB phosphorylation was increased in the prefrontal cortex following chronic nicotine exposure and in the ventral tegmental area during nicotine withdrawal. In addition, total and phosphorylated ERK decreased in the amygdala following chronic nicotine exposure, but ERK phosphorylation increased in the prefrontal cortex. TH levels increased in both the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, supporting the hypothesis that increased catecholaminergic tone contributes to nicotine reinforcement.

A single knockout mouse model, fmr1-tm1Cgr, exists. In this report we further characterize the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of the fmr1-tm1Cgr Fragile X mouse through the use of F1 hybrid mice derived from two inbred strains (FVB/NJ and C57BL/6J). Use of F1 hybrids allows focus on the effects of the fmr1-tm1Cgr allele with reduced influence from recessive alleles present in the parental inbred strains. We find that the cognitive phenotype of fmr1-tm1Cgr mice, including measures of working memory and learning set formation that are known to be seriously impacted in humans with Fragile X Syndrome, are essentially normal. Further testing of inbred strains supports this conclusion. Thus, any fmr1-tm1Cgr cognitive deficit is surprisingly mild or absent. There is, however, clear support presented for a robust audiogenic seizure phenotype in all strains tested, as well as increased entries into the center of an open field.

Here, we use human and mouse enteroids, and a mouse model of pathogenesis, to explore the capacity of WNV to directly infect gastrointestinal (GI) tract cells and contribute to disease severity. At baseline, WNV poorly infects human and mouse enteroid cultures and enterocytes in mice. However, when STAT1 or type I interferon (IFN) responses are absent, GI tract cells become infected, and this is associated with augmented GI tract and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, accumulation of gut-derived molecules in the brain, and more severe WNV disease. The increased gut permeability requires TNF-α signaling, and is absent in WNV-infected IFN-deficient germ-free mice. To link these findings to human disease, we measured auto-antibodies against type I IFNs in serum from WNV-infected human cohorts. A greater frequency of auto- and neutralizing antibodies against IFN-α2 or IFN-ω is present in patients with severe WNV infection, whereas virtually no asymptomatic WNV-infected subjects have such antibodies (odds ratio 24 [95% confidence interval: 3.0 - 192.5; P = 0.003]). Overall, our experiments establish that blockade of type I IFN signaling extends WNV tropism to enterocytes, which correlates with increased gut and BBB permeability, and more severe disease."}

Similar but attenuated alterations were found in bipolar disorder (BD). However, it remains unknown if segregated loops within thalamocortical systems show distinct rs-fcMRI alterations in schizophrenia. For instance, the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus, known to project to prefrontal networks, may be differently altered than the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), known to project to the occipital cortex. Also, it remains unknown if these circuits show different patterns of alterations in BD as a function of psychosis history, which may be associated with a more severe clinical course. We addressed these questions in 90 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 73 remitted BD patients (33 with psychosis history) matched to 146 healthy comparison subjects. We hypothesized that the MD vs LGN would show dissociations across diagnostic groups. We found that MD and LGN show more qualitative similarities than differences in their patterns of dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. In BD, patterns qualitatively diverged between thalamic nuclei although these effects were modest statistically. BD with psychosis history was associated with more severe dysconnectivity, particularly for the MD nucleus. Also, the MD nucleus showed connectivity reductions with the cerebellum in schizophrenia but not in BD. Results suggest dissociations for thalamic nuclei across diagnoses, albeit carefully controlling for medication is warranted in future studies. Collectively, these findings have implications for designing more precise neuroimaging-driven biomarkers that can identify common and divergent large-scale network perturbations across psychiatric diagnoses with shared symptoms."}

However, the association between levels of LE8 and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes is not known from a large prospective cohort. We aim to analyze the relationship between CVH, indicated by LE8, and risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD. Moreover, we sought to test whether the genetic susceptibility to CHD or stroke could be modified by LE8.	A total of 137 794 participants free of CVD from the UK Biobank were included. CVH was scored using LE8 and categorized as low, moderate, and high.	During a median of 10 years, 8595 CVD cases (6968 CHDs and 1948 strokes) were documented. A higher LE8 score was associated with remarkably lower risks of CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). Comparing the high CVH to the low CVH, the hazard ratios (95% CI) were 0.34 (0.30-0.38) for CHD, 0.45 (0.37-0.54) for stroke, and 0.36 (0.33-0.40) for CVD. Moreover, the model with LE8 achieved higher accuracy and outperformed the model with Life's Simple 7 for CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). The protective associations of the LE8 score with CVD outcomes were more pronounced among women (P interaction, <0.001 for CHD and 0.0013 for CVD, respectively) and among younger adults (P interaction, <0.001, 0.007, and <0.001 for CHD, stroke, and CVD, respectively).

All participants were followed for 52 weeks after treatment completion to assess durability of impact.	Although the study was stopped early due to lower than expected occurrence of the primary end points, sufficient data were available to assess the impact of the interventions on drug use and injection-related risk behavior. At week 26, 22% of ST-MAT participants had negative urinalyses for opioids compared with 57% in the LT-MAT (P < 0.001). Differences disappeared in the year after treatment: at week 78, 35% in ST-MAT and 32% in the LT-MAT had negative urinalyses. Injection-related risk behaviors were significantly reduced in both groups after randomization.	Participants receiving BUP/NX 3 times weekly were more likely to reduce opioid injection while on active treatment. Both treatment strategies were considered safe and associated with reductions in injection-related risk behavior.

Risk-related neural processing was assessed by blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses in the insula during a lottery choice task, cognitive control by behavioral performance during the Multi-Source Interference Task, and substance use by adolescents' self-reported cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use.	Latent change score modeling indicated that greater substance use predicted increased insula activation during risk processing, but the effects of insula activation on changes in substance use were not significant. The coupling effect from substance use to insula activation was particularly strong for adolescents with low cognitive control, which supports the theorized moderating role of cognitive control.	Our results elucidate how substance use may alter brain development to be biased toward maladaptive decision-making, particularly among adolescents with poor cognitive control. Furthermore, the current findings underscore that cognitive control may be an important target in the prevention and treatment of adolescent substance use given its moderating role in the neuroadaptive effects of substance use on brain development."}

Many limitations of conventional face-to-face psychological interventions could potentially be overcome through Internet-based and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This chapter introduces core features of IMIs, describes areas of application, presents evidence on the efficacy of IMIs as well as potential effect mechanisms, and delineates how Artificial Intelligence combined with IMIs may improve current practices in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in adults. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials clearly show that therapist-guided IMIs can be highly effective for a broad range of mental health problems. Whether the effects of unguided IMIs are also clinically relevant, particularly under routine care conditions, is less clear. First studies on IMIs for the prevention of mental disorders have shown promising results. Despite limitations and challenges, IMIs are increasingly implemented into routine care worldwide. IMIs are also well suited for applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which provides ample opportunities to improve the identification and treatment of mental disorders. Together with methodological innovations, these approaches may also deepen our understanding of how psychological interventions work, and why. Ethical and professional restraints as well as potential contraindications of IMIs, however, should also be considered. In sum, IMIs have a high potential for improving the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders across various indications, settings, and populations. Therefore, implementing IMIs into routine care as both adjunct and alternative to face-to-face treatment is highly desirable. Technological advancements may further enhance the variability and flexibility of IMIs, and thus even further increase their impact in people's lives in the future."}

Blood flow velocity was measured in the anterior cerebral arteries by a transcutaneous Doppler technique in nine infants who developed pneumothorax in the first 3 days of life. At the time of pneumothorax there was a marked increase in flow velocity, especially during diastole, and, with resolution of pneumothorax, flow velocity returned to normal levels over the ensuing hours. The changes in flow velocity correlated closely with systemic hemodynamic changes that occurred with pneumothorax, ie, and increase in mean systemic blood pressure, especially diastolic pressure. IVH, documented by serial ultrasound scans, was observed shortly after pneumothorax in the nine infants.

In this study, we report that ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a Ras superfamily small GTPase, is abundantly expressed in invasive human glioma cells. Cellular depletion of ARF6 by small interfering RNA decreased Rac1 activation, impaired HGF-stimulated and serum-stimulated glioma cell migration in vitro, and markedly decreased the invasive capacity of invasive glioma in the brain. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ARF6 in glioma cells promoted cell migration via the activation of Rac1. Upon stimulation of glioma cells with HGF, we show that IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) is recruited and overlaps with ARF6 at the leading edge of migrating cells. However, cellular depletion of ARF6 abrogated this recruitment of IQGAP1 and attenuated the formation of surface protrusions. ARF6 forms complexes with Rac1 and IQGAP1 in glioma cells upon HGF stimulation, and knockdown of IQGAP1 significantly inhibits ARF6-induced Rac1 activation and cell migration. Taken together, these data suggest that ARF6-mediated Rac1 activation is essential for glioma cell invasion via a signaling pathway that requires IQGAP1."}

In the central nervous system, leukotrienes are mainly synthesized in the gray matter and in vascular tissues. Their production is enhanced in ischemic conditions and in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Previous studies have indicated the ability of the leukotrienes C4 and D4 to constrict arterial vessels in vivo and in vitro and have suggested their involvement in the pathogenesis of cerebral arterial spasm. In the present study, the authors measured lumbar and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of leukotriene C4 in 48 patients who had suffered aneurysmal SAH. In 12 of the cases, symptomatic and radiological spasm was evident. The mean lumbar CSF level of immunoreactive-like activity of leukotriene C4 (i-LTC4) was significantly higher (p less than 0.005) than in control cases, while the cisternal CSF level was higher than the lumbar mean concentration (p less than 0.005). Patients presenting with vasospasm had significantly higher levels of i-LTC4 compared to patients without symptomatic vasospasm. This is the first report concerning monitoring of i-LTC4 levels in the CSF after SAH. The results of this study suggest that: 1) metabolism of arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway is enhanced after SAH; 2) the higher cisternal CSF levels of i-LTC4 may be part of the biological response in the perianeurysmal subarachnoid cisterns after the hemorrhage; and 3) the higher CSF levels of i-LTC4 in patients presenting with vasospasm suggest that a relationship exists between this compound and arterial spasm and/or reflect the development of cerebral ischemic damage."}

Aloofness showed similar negative associations with age, albeit much smaller. Rigidity was not significantly associated with age. The results are consistent with other research showing an abatement of symptoms among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) across early life and theories predicting changes in other psychological characteristics (e.g., personality). The results are discussed in the context of the malleability of ASD and BAP traits across life, the clinical implications of these changes, and the origins and consequences for lifespan differences in BAP. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about how subclinical autistic-like traits among middle-aged and older adults compare to younger adults. We found that these subclinical traits were highest in young adults and lowest in older adults. Knowing how these traits differ by age can provide researchers and clinicians with a sense of how much these traits might change across life, if the traits might be sensitive to interventions, and when in development it might be best to intervene."}

All of these issues have implications for patients' daily functioning and quality of life (QOL). This review synthesizes recent evidence about these prominent issues in geriatric care and related implications for care of older patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent evidence about pre-dialysis and dialysis treatment strategies that may help to optimize management of older patients is also considered. Although elderly patients often report better psychosocial adjustment to dialysis than do younger patients, physical functioning and cognitive functioning losses challenge the QOL of many elderly persons. Early management of CKD and attention to anemia, consideration of the benefits of peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis, and inclusion of some form of exercise or regular physical activity in routine care provide key opportunities to enhance the functioning and well-being of older patients."}

Twenty-four ambulatory patients (mean age, 10.0 years) with spastic cerebral palsy who were scheduled for single event multilevel surgery, including distal hamstring lengthening, were included. Preoperatively, peak isometric muscle strength was measured for the hip flexor, hip extensor, knee flexor, and knee extensor muscle groups using a handheld dynamometer, and three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis and gross motor function measure (GMFM) scoring were also performed. Correlations between peak isometric strength and GMFM, gait kinematics, and gait kinetics were analyzed.	Peak isometric muscle strength of all muscle groups was not related to the GMFM score and the gross motor function classification system level. Peak isometric strength of the hip extensor and knee extensor was significantly correlated with the mean pelvic tilt (r=-0.588, p=0.003 and r=-0.436, p=0.033) and maximum pelvic obliquity (r=-0.450, p=0.031 and r=-0.419, p=0.041).

Multiple lines of alsin knockout (ALS2(-/-)) mice have been generated to model this disease. However, it remains elusive whether the Rab5-dependent endocytosis is altered in ALS2(-/-) neurons. To directly examine the Rab5-mediated endosomal trafficking in ALS2(-/-) neurons, we introduced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Rab5 into cultured hippocampal neurons to monitor the morphology and motility of Rab5-associated early endosomes. Here we report that Rab5-mediated endocytosis was severely altered in ALS2(-/-) neurons. Excessive accumulation of Rab5-positive vesicles was observed in ALS2(-/-) neurons, which correlated with a significant reduction in endosomal motility and augmentation in endosomal conversion to lysosomes. Consequently, a significant increase in endosome/lysosome-dependent degradation of internalized glutamate receptors was observed in ALS2(-/-) neurons. These phenotypes closely resembled the endosomal trafficking abnormalities induced by a constitutively active form of Rab5 in wild-type neurons. Therefore, our findings reveal a negatively regulatory mechanism of alsin in Rab5-mediated endosomal trafficking, suggesting that enhanced endosomal degradation in ALS2(-/-) neurons may underlie the pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration in ALS2 and related motor neuron diseases."}

Controversy exists about whether open microsurgical methods serve to reduce shunt dependency compared with endovascular techniques.	To determine predictors of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and functional outcomes after aneurysmal SAH.	A total of 471 patients who were part of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial from 2003 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. All variables including demographic data, medical history, treatment, imaging, and functional outcomes were included as part of the trial. No additional variables were retrospectively collected.	Ultimately, 147 patients (31.2%) required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) in our series. Age, dissecting aneurysm type, ruptured vertebrobasilar aneurysm, Fisher grade, Hunt and Hess grade, admission intraventricular hemorrhage, admission intraparenchymal hemorrhage, blood in the fourth ventricle on admission, perioperative ventriculostomy, and hemicraniectomy were significant risk factors (P < .05) associated with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, intraventricular hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage were independent risk factors for shunt dependency (P < .05). Clipping vs coiling treatment was not statistically associated with VPS after SAH on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients who did not receive a VPS at discharge had higher Glasgow Outcome Scale and Barthel Index scores and were more likely to be functionally independent and to return to work 72 months after surgery (P < .05).

In this paper, we present the clinical course of five NMS patients in the presenium and senium. Case 1 was 72-year-old male who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with late onset). He showed nocturnal wandering, insomnia, and irritability. Tiapride 60 mg per day had been administered previously. Just after the addition of oxypertine 10 mg per day, NMS occurred, and he died of pneumonia a week later. Case 2 was 75-year-old male who was diagnosed as having vascular dementia. He showed insomnia, hyperactivity and wandering. He had been given levomepromazine (LPZ) 10 mg per day over a long period of time. At first, he had daily episodic fever, however, serum CPK levels did not increase at that time. A month later, all the symptoms of NMS appeared and then the patient's condition suddenly deteriorated and he died three days later. Case 3 was a 64-year-old male who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with early onset). He showed insomnia, irritability and violence. Tiapride 50-125 mg per day was administered along with oxypertine 50-115 mg per day. Almost two months later, NMS occurred. He had daily episodic fever at first, extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic instabilities gradually increased. Soon after symptoms of NMS were completed. In this case, NMS seemed to be induced by bacterial pneumonia after long term administration of LPZ 5 mg per day. Case 4 was a 75-year-old female who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with late onset). She showed hallucinatory delusional state. Although she had autonomic instabilities just after adminstration of haloperidol 1-2 mg per day, NMS itself occurred after discontinuing the neuroleptic. Case 5 was a 61-year-old female who was diagnosed as having schizophrenia at the age of forty. She was given various neuroleptics over a period of time. The neuroimaging in SPECT showed her cerebral cortex was generally hypoactive. She had a tendency to have autonomic instabilities after the administration of relatively high potential neuroleptics. Risperidone 3-6 mg per day was administered, and almost a month later, autonomic instabilities increased and she was diagnosed as having NMS. All the patients would be able to have brain dysfunction, which suggested that such patients may be liable to NMS. In our patients, NMS occurred after the additional administration of oxypertine 10 mg per day or after long time administration of LPZ 5 mg per day. It was suggested that NMS could occur after the administration of low dose and relatively low potential neuroleptics in elderly patients. Our 3 of 5 patients showed the delayed type of NMS, which might be relatively more frequent in senior and presenior patients than in younger patients. In case 3, NMS was induced by the somatic disease (bacterial pneumonia), however in other cases, NMS was not always induced by somatic disease. Our 4 of 5 patients experienced some of the symptoms of NMS--episodic fever, extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic instabilities--before the onset of NMS. Such symptoms may be 'pre-steps' to NMS. Once NMS occurred, the patient's systemic condition tended to deteriorate acutely. Due to the fact that our 2 of 5 patients died, it was suggested that the prognosis of the NMS patients in presenium and senium tends to be much worse. It is important to find the 'pre-steps' to NMS and treat them as soon as possible for better prognosis."}

Chronic, long-term alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are associated with neuronal loss with the prefrontal cortex being particularly susceptible to neurotoxic damage. This brain region is involved in the development and persistence of alcohol addiction and neurotoxic damage is likely to exacerbate the reinforcing effects of alcohol and may hinder treatment. Understanding the mechanism of alcohol's neurotoxic effects on the brain and the genetic risk factors associated with alcohol abuse are the focus of current research. Because of its well-established role in neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders, and its emerging role in the pathophysiology of addiction, here we review the genetic and epigenetic factors involved in regulating α-synuclein expression and its potential role in the pathophysiology of chronic alcohol abuse. Elucidation of the mechanisms of α-synuclein regulation may prove beneficial in understanding the role of this key synaptic protein in disease and its potential for therapeutic modulation in the treatment of substance use disorders as well as other neurodegenerative diseases."}

A further decrease in plasma thyroid hormone; during antidepressant treatment has been reported. However, the putative association between the plasma thyroid indices' concentration and response has not been addressed. In the present study 21 depressed inpatients underwent a four-week double blind antidepressant with amitriptyline and mianserin; their plasma thyroid hormone indices (total thyroxine [TT4], free thyroxine [FT4], total triiodothyronine [TT3], free triiodothyronine [FT3], thyrotropin [TSH], and thyroglobulin [TBG]) were quantified to elucidate their involvement in depression and during antidepressant drug treatment. Depressed patients' plasma TSH, when corrected for age, was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects. During antidepressant treatment the entire patient cohort showed a significant decrease in plasma TT4 and FT4 concentrations. Responders showed a significant drop in TT4 FT4, FT3, and T4/TBG, but nonresponders only a decrease in FT4. During mianserin treatment, a decrease was observed in TT4, FT4, FT3, and T4/TBG. FT4 and FT3 baseline levels correlated positively with the improvement in the Hamilton Depression Rating Score (HDRS). These findings show that depressed inpatients' serum TSH levels are within the reference range, but significantly lower than those of healthy subjects, and those patients who turn out to be nonresponders have potentially lower availability of thyroid hormones than responders. Therefore, we hypothesize that in order to assure clinical improvement in depression, an adequate capacity of the thyroid hormone pool is necessary to compensate for the additional antidepressant-provoked decrease in serum thyroid hormone availability."}

A multicenter, retrospective matched cohort in which PPCS symptoms were evaluated in children 8-15-year-old, 6-60 months after being admitted to the emergency department because of mTBI. The control group included children admitted to the emergency department because of uncomplicated distal radius fractures. The children's guardians were interviewed for the presence of PPCS symptoms using the 'Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire'. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of PPCS. Two-hundred and five children were included in the mTBI group and 205 in the control. The median time from the injury was 33.5 months in the mTBI group and 33.8 in the control. The prevalence of PPCS in the mTBI group was 25.3% and PPCS like symptoms in the control was 2.4%, p < 0.001. Within the 6-60 months period, the PPCS prevalence was not influenced by the time that elapsed from the injury. In the mTBI group, motor vehicle accidents and adolescence were found to be risk factors for PPCS.

Data evaluating this hypothesis are limited in ischemic stroke.	We conducted a prospective observational study in 507 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke to analyze the effect of ACE inhibitor treatment at the time of stroke onset on CRP levels within the first 24 hours and the relationship to outcome. Risk estimates were calculated according to Cox regression analysis controlled for blood pressure (BP) levels, clinical and neuroradiological confounding variables, and log-normalized CRP levels at entry.	ACE inhibitor treatment was associated with lower (2.6-fold; P<0.0001) median CRP levels and with a reduced 2-year cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.53; P<0.0001) compared with a different BP-lowering regimen. The relationship between ACE inhibitor status and log-normalized CRP levels remained significant (P<0.0001) after we controlled for important confounding variables and concomitant treatments. The reduced risk was also evident in multivariable analysis when ACE inhibitor treatment was controlled for BP, associated risk factors, neuroradiological findings, and concomitant treatments (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.62; P<0.0001).

In addition to the substantial decline in IPD, increased disease due to nonvaccine serotypes and a changing clinical presentation emerged. The objective of this study is to describe these trends in IPD in the late PCV7-era.	We report on continued, prospective, population-based surveillance of childhood IPD in Massachusetts children during the period 2007 to 2009 and make comparisons with the earlier 2001 to 2006 PCV7-era. Demographic and clinical data were collected for all cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from normally sterile sites were serotyped and further evaluated using antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus sequence typing and eBURST analysis. IPD incidence rates are calculated by age, year and serotype.	There were 326 cases of IPD between 2007 and 2009 in children < 18 years of age. Overall IPD incidence rate was 7.5 cases per 100,000 population and was not statistically different from the observed incidence in 2001 to 2006 (P > 0.05). As compared with the earlier period, the proportion of bacteremic pneumonia among all IPD cases was almost 3-fold greater in 2009 to 2010 (P < 0.01). PCV7 serotypes accounted for 7%, whereas the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes accounted for 77% of all cases between 2007 and 2009. IPD due to serotypes 19A and 7F increased, and 19A and 7F were isolated in 41% and 20% of all IPD cases in the same period, respectively. Serotype 19A also comprised a majority of the penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant isolates. Analysis of multilocus sequence typing data showed a significant increase in ST191, ST695 and ST320 and a significant decrease in ST199 and ST180.	The reduction in IPD after introduction of PCV7 persists in Massachusetts children; however, serotypes causing IPD have changed significantly in the last decade. Continued surveillance is necessary to determine the impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, as well as track potential changes in disease incidence and character due to non-13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes."}

The CENTURION study was the first phase 3 study of lasmiditan in Caucasian and Chinese patients with migraine. This post hoc analysis further demonstrates the safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population and was urgently needed.	Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to lasmiditan 200 mg lasmiditan 100 mg, or a control group. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), their severity, and incidence by treated attacks for frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 5%) were evaluated. The duration, onset, and relationship of efficacy with very common TEAEs (≥ 10%) was analyzed.	A total of 281 Chinese patients were included in this post hoc analysis. No deaths and no study drug-related treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were reported. The incidence of at least one TEAE was higher in patients receiving lasmiditan 200 mg (73.9%) and 100 mg (66.3%) versus placebo (26.6%). TEAEs were generally mild or moderate in severity, and the incidence of frequently reported TEAEs was generally highest during the first attack. Very common TEAEs with lasmiditan included dizziness, asthenia, somnolence, muscular weakness, fatigue, and nausea. The duration of dizziness was longest during the first attack. There were no cardio-cerebrovascular ischemic events and serotonin syndrome. The presence of very common TEAEs (except nausea), and severe dizziness, did not appear to have a negative influence on the efficacy.	In the Chinese population of the CENTURION study, most of the TEAEs were neurologic, of mild or moderate severity, and self-limiting.

Although there is significant unmet medical need among patients with migraine, there has been no novel compound for treatment of migraine over past two decades in China. These unmet medical needs persist because the current available medications for the acute treatment of migraine are reported to have safety and tolerability issues. Lasmiditan is a new class of acute migraine medication (5-HT receptor agonist with high selectivity for the 5-HT1F receptor) with a proven efficacy and safety in phase 2 and 3 studies. Owing to some differences in clinical practice between China and western countries, there is need to get additional evidence on safety of lasmiditan in the Chinese population to support its usage in clinical practice.This post hoc analysis was conducted to present the detailed safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population using data from the CENTURION study. Approximately half of the analyzed population was not covered in the published primary cohort.The results show that in the Chinese population of the study, most of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neurologic, of mild or moderate severity, and self-limiting. The distribution of frequently reported TEAEs at the first attack differed from the primary cohort with no new safety concerns observed in the Chinese population. The overall safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population was generally consistent with the primary cohort.

Sections from human spinal cords from 4 control patients and from 14 patients who died at different time points after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) were investigated immunohistochemically.	In control cases, TGF-beta1 was confined to occasional blood vessels, intravascular monocytes and some motoneurons, whereas TGF-beta2 was only found in intravascular monocytes. After traumatic SCI, TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity was dramatically upregulated by 2 days after injury (the earliest survival time investigated) and was detected within neurons, astrocytes and invading macrophages. The staining was most intense over the first weeks after injury but gradually declined by 1 year. TGF-beta2 immunoreactivity was first detected 24 days after injury. It was located in macrophages and astrocytes and remained elevated for up to 1 year. In white matter tracts undergoing Wallerian degeneration, there was no induction of either isoform.	The early induction of TGF-beta1 at the point of SCI suggests a role in the acute inflammatory response and formation of the glial scar, while the later induction of TGF-beta2 may indicate a role in the maintenance of the scar.

Using material properties from literature and iterative techniques, the model was validated under three distinct rotational loading conditions indicative of non-injury, concussion, and diffuse axonal trauma. Validation results produced a set of material properties to define the model and were deemed appropriate to examine the role of sustained strain as an indicator of the mechanics of mild diffuse brain injury at the local level. Using a separate set of histological data obtained from graded mild diffuse brain injury experimental studies in rats, different formulations of SMPS criterion were evaluated. For the hippocampus and parietal cortex regions, 4-4 SMPS criterion was found to most closely match with the pattern of histological results. This was further verified by correlating the fractional areas to the time of unconsciousness for each animal group. Although not fully conclusive, these results are valuable in the understanding of diffuse brain injury pathologies following rotational loading."}

Use of fissure dissection is also practical in the posterior fossa. In this study, the microsurgical anatomy of the 3 cerebellar-brainstem fissures (cerebellomesencephalic, cerebellopontine, and cerebellomedullary) and the various procedures exposing these fissures in brainstem surgery were examined. METHODS Seven cadaveric heads were examined with a microsurgical technique and 3 with fiber dissection to clarify the anatomy of the cerebellar-brainstem and adjacent cerebellar fissures, in which the major vessels and neural structures are located. Several approaches directed along the cerebellar surfaces and fissures, including the supracerebellar infratentorial, occipital transtentorial, retrosigmoid, and midline suboccipital approaches, were examined. The 3 heads examined using fiber dissection defined the anatomy of the cerebellar peduncles coursing in the depths of these fissures. RESULTS Dissections directed along the cerebellar-brainstem and cerebellar fissures provided access to the posterior and posterolateral midbrain and upper pons, lateral pons, floor and lateral wall of the fourth ventricle, and dorsal and lateral medulla. CONCLUSIONS Opening the cerebellar-brainstem and adjacent cerebellar fissures provided access to the brainstem surface hidden by the cerebellum, while minimizing division of neural tissue. Most of the major cerebellar arteries, veins, and vital neural structures are located in or near these fissures and can be accessed through them."}

We examined measures of self-report, as well as behavioral, physiological, and facial responses to errors during a Stop-Change Task. 25 participants with HD and 32 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Participants reported on number of errors committed and pre/post emotional response to errors. Skin conductance response (SCR) during correct and error commission trials was examined. Facial expression during task performance was coded for self-conscious and negative emotions. HD and HC participants had significantly different error rates but comparable error correction and post-error slowing. SCR was significantly lower for HD during error commission than for HC. During error trials, HD participants showed a significant deficit in displays of self-conscious emotions compared to HC. Self-reported emotions were increased in HD, with more negative and self-conscious emotion reported than was reported for HC participants. These findings suggest that hypoactive emotional responding at a physiological level may play a role in how errors are processed in individuals with HD."}

We performed a systematic analysis of 12 autosomal-dominant PD (AD-PD) genes (SNCA, LRRK2, GIGYF2, VPS35, EIF4G1, DNAJC13, CHCHD2, HTRA2, NR4A2, RIC3, TMEM230, and UCHL1) using panel sequencing and database filtration in a case-control study of a cohort of 391 Chinese sporadic PD patients and unrelated controls. We evaluated the association between candidate variants and sporadic PD using gene-based analysis.	Overall, 18 rare variants were discovered in 18.8% (36/191) of the index patients. In addition to previously reported pathogenic mutations (LRRK2 p.Arg1441His and p.Ala419Val), another four unknown variants were found in LRRK2, which also contribute to PD risk (p = 0.002; odds ratio (OR) = 7.83, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.76-34.93). The cumulative frequency of undetermined rare variants was significantly higher in PD patients (14.1%) than in controls (3.5%) (p = 0.0002; OR=4.54, 95% CI = 1.93-10.69).	Our results confirm the strong impact of LRRK2 on the risk of sporadic PD, and also provide considerable evidence of the existence of additional undetermined rare variants in AD-PD genes that contribute to the genetic etiology of sporadic PD in a Chinese cohort."}

Clinical^\nParietal operculum and motor cortex activities predict motor recovery in moderate to severe stroke.^\nWhile motor recovery following mild stroke has been extensively studied with neuroimaging, mechanisms of recovery after moderate to severe strokes of the types that are often the focus for novel restorative therapies remain obscure. We used fMRI to: 1) characterize reorganization occurring after moderate to severe subacute stroke, 2) identify brain regions associated with motor recovery and 3) to test whether brain activity associated with passive movement measured in the subacute period could predict motor outcome six months later. Because many patients with large strokes involving sensorimotor regions cannot engage in voluntary movement, we used passive flexion-extension of the paretic wrist to compare 21 patients with subacute ischemic stroke to 24 healthy controls one month after stroke. Clinical motor outcome was assessed with Fugl-Meyer motor scores (motor-FMS) six months later. Multiple regression, with predictors including baseline (one-month) motor-FMS and sensorimotor network regional activity (ROI) measures, was used to determine optimal variable selection for motor outcome prediction. Sensorimotor network ROIs were derived from a meta-analysis of arm voluntary movement tasks. Bootstrapping with 1000 replications was used for internal model validation. During passive movement, both control and patient groups exhibited activity increases in multiple bilateral sensorimotor network regions, including the primary motor (MI), premotor and supplementary motor areas (SMA), cerebellar cortex, putamen, thalamus, insula, Brodmann area (BA) 44 and parietal operculum (OP1-OP4). Compared to controls, patients showed: 1) lower task-related activity in ipsilesional MI, SMA and contralesional cerebellum (lobules V-VI) and 2) higher activity in contralesional MI, superior temporal gyrus and OP1-OP4. Using multiple regression, we found that the combination of baseline motor-FMS, activity in ipsilesional MI (BA4a), putamen and ipsilesional OP1 predicted motor outcome measured 6 months later (adjusted-R[2] = 0.85; bootstrap p < 0.001). Baseline motor-FMS alone predicted only 54% of the variance. When baseline motor-FMS was removed, the combination of increased activity in ipsilesional MI-BA4a, ipsilesional thalamus, contralesional mid-cingulum, contralesional OP4 and decreased activity in ipsilesional OP1, predicted better motor outcome (djusted-R[2] = 0.96; bootstrap p < 0.001). In subacute stroke, fMRI brain activity related to passive movement measured in a sensorimotor network defined by activity during voluntary movement predicted motor recovery better than baseline motor-FMS alone. Furthermore, fMRI sensorimotor network activity measures considered alone allowed excellent clinical recovery prediction and may provide reliable biomarkers for assessing new therapies in clinical trial contexts. Our findings suggest that neural reorganization related to motor recovery from moderate to severe stroke results from balanced changes in ipsilesional MI (BA4a) and a set of phylogenetically more archaic sensorimotor regions in the ventral sensorimotor trend, in which OP1 and OP4 processes may complement the ipsilesional dorsal motor cortex in achieving compensatory sensorimotor recovery."}

Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of cellular dysfunction associated with the expression of faulty PD genes.	We developed a yeast model for full-length LRRK2 studies. We expressed wild-type (wt) LRRK2 and mutations and evaluated their role during oxidative stress conditions. The involvement of mitochondria was assessed by using rho-zero mutants and by evaluating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry. The involvement of endocytosis was also studied by testing several endocytic mutants and by following the vacuolar delivery of the probe FM4-64.	Expression of LRRK2 in yeast was associated to increased hydrogen peroxide resistance. This phenotype, which was dependent on mitochondrial function, was not observed for PD-mutants G2019S and R1441C or in the absence of the kinase activity and the WD40 repeat domain. Expression of the pathogenic mutants stimulated ROS production and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. For the PD-mutants, but not for wild-type LRRK2, endocytic defects were also observed. Additionally, several endocytic proteins were required for LRRK2-mediated protection against hydrogen peroxide.	Our results indicate that LRRK2 confers cellular protection during oxidative stress depending on mitochondrial function and endocytosis.	Both the loss of capacity of LRRK2 pathogenic mutants to protect against oxidative stress and their enhancement of dysfunction may be important for the development of PD during the aging process."}

Here we describe a new hereditary cerebellar cortical degeneration in eight adult American Staffordshire and Pit Bull Terriers. The neuronal degeneration in these animals not only affects Purkinje cells of the cerebellum but also certain thalamic nuclei. In addition, nerve cell loss appears to be associated with a lysosomal storage disease, which is restricted to the affected cell populations. The stored material was histologically and ultrastructurally identified as fluorescent lipopigment. Since animals were euthanized at various stages of the disease, it could be shown that lysosomal storage preceded neuronal loss.

Categorical confirmatory factor analysis and the graded response model were used for evaluations of the latent factor structure, item properties, test information, and item invariance across gender, age groups (middle vs. late adolescence), and drug use profiles (readily available drugs vs. other illicit drugs), as well as computation of the item response theory scale scores for each of 617 alternative high school students (44% female).	A reduced set of 16 RAPI items provided plausible evidence of unidimensionality and good measurement precision at a relatively wide range of the latent trait continuum.

These populations also increased in number in the spleen. The T cell cytokine profiles in tumour-bearing mice were similar in the two sites, with predominant T helper type 1 (Th1)/Th17 polarization after polyclonal stimulation, although some interleukin (IL)-4 could also be found. We demonstrated that these T cells have anti-tumour activity in the CNS, although less than in the spleen: nude mice that received lymphoma cells intracerebrally died significantly earlier than immunocompetent animals.

Prevalence of any disorder, internalizing or externalizing disorders among Muslim adolescents were 19.2, 15.8 and 4.2%, respectively and among Druze adolescents 10.9, 5.9 and 5.5%, respectively. Muslim adolescents were 3.2 times more likely than Druze adolescents to have an internalizing disorder, while Druze were 2 times more likely than Muslim to have an externalizing disorder. Males were at higher risk than females for externalizing disorders in both populations, though among Druze the risk was more striking. Learning disabilities increased the likelihood of having an externalizing disorder in both populations. Risk factors for internalizing disorders among Muslim adolescents were female gender, a very low socio-economic level, few siblings, LD, high maternal GHQ-12 score and high FDI; and for externalizing disorders, male gender, a relatively low socio-economic level but not the lowest, learning disability and high maternal GHQ-12 score.	We found an association between religion/ethnicity and internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as a strong correlation between religion/ethnicity and socio-economic variables. Therefore, we tend to conclude that not religion per se but the multifaceted socio-cultural and economic factors that characterize religious groups are associated with mental disorders. Very low socio-economic level and feeling discriminated which were traits connected only to Muslim adolescents, were associated with internalizing disorders.

Accordingly, this study examined the explanatory role of cognitive distortions in the association between emotion regulation difficulties and problem gambling behaviours and also explored the interaction between emotion regulation and cognitive distortions in predicting gambling severity.

Analyses revealed that emotion regulation difficulties and erroneous gambling beliefs were positively related to problem gambling severity. Further, cognitive distortions partially accounted for the relationship between emotional regulation difficulties and problem gambling, although emotion regulation retained a direct relationship with problem gambling. There was no interaction between emotional regulation and cognitive distortions.

Other partner dances may be more suitable and preferable for those with Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of tango, waltz/foxtrot and no intervention on functional motor control in individuals with Parkinson's disease.	This study employed a randomized, between- notsubject, prospective, repeated measures design.	Fifty-eight people with mild-moderate Parkinson's disease participated.	Participants were randomly assigned to tango, waltz/foxtrot or no intervention (control) groups. Those in the dance groups attended 1-h classes twice a week, completing 20 lessons in 13 weeks. Balance, functional mobility, forward and backward walking were evaluated before and after the intervention.	Both dance groups improved more than the control group, which did not improve. The tango and waltz/foxtrot groups improved significantly on the Berg Balance Scale, 6-minute walk distance, and backward stride length. The tango group improved as much or more than those in the waltz/foxtrot group on several measures.	Tango may target deficits associated with Parkinson's disease more than waltz/foxtrot, but both dances may benefit balance and locomotion."}

It is insidious and multifactorial. Clinical management can be complex. This systematic review describes effects of interventions for the prevention and management of respiratory disease in young people with CP.	Nine databases (Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, EMCare, MEDLINE, PEDro, OpenGrey, ScienceDirect, and SpeechBITE) were searched. Eligibility criteria were as follows: the population included at least 50% individuals with CP aged under 26 years, the intervention was for chronic respiratory illness, the outcomes were any measurable indicators of respiratory health or morbidity; the study design could be any original study reporting effects of an intervention on measurable outcomes, and the study was published January 1998 or later. The American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine methodology guided study appraisal and synthesis. The review was registered with PROSPERO (reference number CRD42018086314).	The search yielded 3,347 papers; 37 papers (reporting 34 studies) of these met the eligibility criteria. They included 582 participants with CP (ranging from 1 to 77 across studies) with ages from 5 months to 25 years. Interventions were diverse and included: airway clearance techniques, exercise, positioning, mealtime management, salivary management, upper airway interventions, antibiotics, gastro-intestinal interventions, and spinal surgery. There were no interventions aimed at prevention of respiratory disease in this population. Research designs were classified as Levels 2 (n = 3), 3 (n = 2), 4 (n = 25), and 5 (n = 4).	Evidence for most respiratory interventions for young people with CP is absent or weak. No controlled trials demonstrated significant effects on respiratory morbidity, owing to their scarcity, weak designs, and inadequate power. There is an urgent need for well-designed prospective controlled studies investigating prevention and management of respiratory disease in young people with CP."}

This cross-sectional study involved 163 patients having been hospitalised for at least 24 hours. The patients were asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire previously approved by the Greek Ministry of Health. Four aspects of satisfaction were investigated (medical, hotel accommodation/ organisational facilities, nursing, global). Using Principal Component Analysis, summated scales were formed and tested for internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The non parametric Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was also used and the threshold p-value for statistical significance (2-sided) was set at 0.05.	The results revealed a high degree of global satisfaction (73.31%), yet satisfaction was higher for the medical (88.88%) and nursing (84.26%) services. Moreover, satisfaction derived from the accommodation facilities and the general organisation was found to be more limited (74.17%). Statistically significant differences (based on various demographic variables) in the participants' global satisfaction were not observed. On the contrary, self-assessment of health status at admission was negatively correlated with medical (r(s)=-0.157, p=0.045) and nursing (r(s)=-0.168, p=0.032) satisfaction.

It is known that many individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) have more difficulty self-initiating movement (i.e., endogenously evoked movement)than moving in response to environmental stimuli (i.e., exogenously evoked movement). However, it is not known if individuals with PD display this same endogenous-exogenous asymmetry when needing to terminate, disengage, and reprogram movements.	This study used a novel reaction time (RT) paradigm to test whether patients with mild PD have subclinical deficits of endogenous movement initiation and endogenous movement reprogramming.	Twelve non-demented individuals with PD on medication and 15 demographically similar healthy control (HC)participants completed an experimental paradigm that examined their RTs (key press) following self-selected valid action preparation (endogenous cues) versus valid exogenously presented cues. The paradigm also assessed participants' ability to rapidly stop their endogenous or exogenous preparation following an invalid cue and execute an alternative action (key press).	Participants with PD produced similar RTs as controls following endogenous and exogenous valid cues, and following invalid exogenous cues. However, following invalid endogenous cues, PD participants were slower than HC participants to stop an endogenous preparation and execute an alternative action.	Despite having mild disease and being on dopaminergic medication, these individuals with PD displayed deficits in motor disengagement and reprograming of self-selected actions. Future studies should examine how this phenomenon influences every day actions, as well as possible treatments for this deficit."}

A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over study followed by an open treatment over 3 weeks.^\nIn primary care, sedating antidepressants are often used for treating insomnia, although their underlying sleep-promoting mechanisms are only incompletely understood. Since enhanced evening and nocturnal plasma cortisol levels are supposed to maintain insomniac sleep complaints, a functional link between sleep and cortisol secretion in the mode of action of antidepressants in insomnia might be suspected.	We therefore investigated the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin on nocturnal sleep and plasma cortisol concentration in ten patients (age 41.3+/-9.5 years) with chronic primary insomnia between 1700 hours and 0800 hours.	Single infusions of placebo and 25 mg doxepin were applied following a double-blind, randomized cross-over design. Afterward, all patients received 25 mg doxepin p.o. for 3 weeks in an open-study design.	Both doxepin application forms improved sleep significantly and reduced mean cortisol levels from 9.0+/-1.7 microg/l (single placebo i.v.) to 7.5+/-1.6 microg/l (single doxepin i.v.) or 7.6+/-2.0 microg/l (subchronic doxepin p.o.). The duration of the quiescent period of the cortisol rhythm was significantly prolonged following both doxepin administrations compared with placebo.	The results implicate that the sleep-improving effects of doxepin are mediated at least in part by a normalization of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functions. Although in some patients rebound insomnia and specific side effects must be considered, our findings give a further rationale for the use of antidepressants in the treatment of primary insomnia."}

Pediatrics^\nToward a better understanding of the cellular basis for cerebrospinal fluid shunt obstruction: report on the construction of a bank of explanted hydrocephalus devices.^\nOBJECTIVE Shunt obstruction by cells and/or tissue is the most common cause of shunt failure. Ventricular catheter obstruction alone accounts for more than 50% of shunt failures in pediatric patients. The authors sought to systematically collect explanted ventricular catheters from the Seattle Children's Hospital with a focus on elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying obstruction. METHODS In the operating room, explanted hardware was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Weekly, samples were transferred to buffer solution and stored at 4°C. After consent was obtained for their use, catheters were labeled using cell-specific markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1), and choroid plexus (transthyretin) in conjunction with a nuclear stain (Hoechst). Catheters were mounted in custom polycarbonate imaging chambers. Three-dimensional, multispectral, spinning-disk confocal microscopy was used to image catheter cerebrospinal fluid-intake holes (10× objective, 499.2-μm-thick z-stack, 2.4-μm step size, Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with motorized stage and charge-coupled device camera). Values are reported as the mean ± standard error of the mean and were compared using a 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. Significance was defined at p < 0.05. RESULTS Thirty-six ventricular catheters have been imaged to date, resulting in the following observations: 1) Astrocytes and microglia are the dominant cell types bound directly to catheter surfaces; 2) cellular binding to catheters is ubiquitous even if no grossly visible tissue is apparent; and 3) immunohistochemical techniques are of limited utility when a catheter has been exposed to Bugbee wire electrocautery. Statistical analysis of 24 catheters was performed, after excluding 7 catheters exposed to Bugbee wire cautery, 3 that were poorly fixed, and 2 that demonstrated pronounced autofluorescence. This analysis revealed that catheters with a microglia-dominant cellular response tended to be implanted for shorter durations (24.7 ± 6.7 days) than those with an astrocyte-dominant response (1183 ± 642 days; p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Ventricular catheter occlusion remains a significant source of shunt morbidity in the pediatric population, and given their ability to intimately associate with catheter surfaces, astrocytes and microglia appear to be critical to this pathophysiology. Microglia tend to be the dominant cell type on catheters implanted for less than 2 months, while astrocytes tend to be the most prevalent cell type on catheters implanted for longer time courses and are noted to serve as an interface for the secondary attachment of ependymal cells and choroid plexus."}

We also reported that TGF-beta downregulates interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, by the CD4+ effector T cells (Te) that mediate EAE. We now report that TGF-beta also inhibits the production of tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin (TNF/LT) by EAE effector cells. When activated in vitro with myelin basic protein (MBP), Te produced TNF/LT, as measured using a WEHI 164 cytotoxicity assay. The specificity of cytokine action was demonstrated using neutralizing antibodies to TNF/LT. When added to the Te+MBP cultures, TGF-beta inhibited TNF/LT production in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibodies augmented TNF/LT production in the Te+MBP cultures. We also confirm that TGF-beta inhibits adoptive transfer of EAE. In contrast, murine IL-10 only partially inhibited TNF/LT and IFN-gamma production by Te. We conclude that TGF-beta production by Ts plays a major role in recovery from EAE in the Lewis rat by inhibiting TNF/LT and IFN-gamma production by the effector cells that mediate EAE."}

This study assessed the environmental burden of disease attributable to PM2.5 at the national level in Malaysia. We estimated the population-weighted exposure level (PWEL) of PM10 concentrations in Malaysia for 2000, 2008, and 2013 using aerosol optical density (AOD) data from publicly available remote sensing satellite data (MODIS Terra). The PWEL was then converted to PM2.5 using Malaysia's WHO ambient air conversion factor. We used AirQ+ 2.0 software to calculate all-cause (natural), ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer (LC), and acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) excess deaths from the National Burden of Disease data for 2000, 2008 and 2013. The average PWELs for annual PM2.5 for 2000, 2008, and 2013 were 22 μg m-3, 18 μg m-3 and 24 μg m-3, respectively. Using the WHO 2005 Air Quality Guideline cut-off point of PM2.5 of 10 μg m-3, the estimated excess deaths for 2000, 2008, and 2013 from all-cause (natural) mortality were between 5893 and 9781 (95 % CI: 3347-12,791), COPD was between 164 and 957 (95 % CI: 95-1411), lung cancer was between 109 and 307 (95 % CI: 63-437), IHD was between 3 and 163 deaths, according to age groups (95 % CI: 2-394) and stroke was between 6 and 155 deaths, according to age groups (95 % CI: 3-261).

Activation of melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in several neurological diseases. In the present study, we have explored the role of MC1R activation on neuroinflammation and the potential underlying mechanisms after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats.	A total of 169 post-natal day 10 unsexed rat pups were used. HI was induced by right common carotid artery ligation followed by 2.5 h of hypoxia. BMS-470539, a specific selective MC1R agonist, was administered intranasally at 1 h after HI induction. To elucidate the potential underlying mechanism, MC1R CRISPR KO plasmid or Nurr1 CRISPR KO plasmid was administered via intracerebroventricular injection at 48 h before HI induction. Percent brain infarct area, short- and long-term neurobehavioral tests, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot were conducted.	The expression levels of MC1R and Nurr1 increased over time post-HI. MC1R and Nurr1 were expressed on microglia at 48 h post-HI. Activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 significantly reduced the percent infarct area, brain atrophy, and inflammation, and improved short- and long-term neurological deficits at 48 h and 28 days post-HI. MC1R activation increased the expression of CD206 (a microglial M2 marker) and reduced the expression of MPO. Moreover, activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 significantly increased the expression levels of MC1R, cAMP, p-PKA, and Nurr1, while downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β) at 48 h post-HI. However, knockout of MC1R or Nurr1 by specific CRISPR reversed the neuroprotective effects of MC1R activation post-HI.	Our study demonstrated that activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 attenuated neuroinflammation, and improved neurological deficits after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats. Such anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects were mediated, at least in part, via the cAMP/PKA/Nurr1 signaling pathway. Therefore, MC1R activation might be a promising therapeutic target for infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)."}

The aim of this study was to investigate the current state and estimated need for ECT in forensic psychiatry in Germany.	A questionnaire was designed consisting of questions about the current practice and estimated need for ECT in this population. This questionnaire was sent electronically (and by post if needed) to the forensic psychiatric hospitals in Germany.	We received replies from 52 hospitals (66%) and 29 of these hospitals stated that they were capable of treating patients with ECT.

In 1 year (2018) 32 ECT treatment courses were carried out with on average good effectiveness and a mean clinical global impressions (CGI) scale of 2.32. The most frequent reason for not using ECT was lack of structural requirements. Approximately one third of the forensic psychiatric hospitals stated that there was a medium or even high need for ECT in forensic psychiatry.

Nevertheless, approximately two thirds of the forensic hospitals stated a medium or high need for ECT, which seems to suggest a shortage of ECT in the treatment of forensic psychiatry patients.	HINTERGRUND UND ZIEL DER ARBEIT: Für die Elektrokonvulsionstherapie (EKT) liegen Leitlinienempfehlungen zur Behandlung schwerer affektiver und psychotischer Erkrankungen vor, wie sie auch bei Patienten im Maßregelvollzug (MRV) vorkommen. Über die Anwendung der EKT in der forensischen Psychiatrie existieren jedoch keinerlei systematisch erhobene Daten. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist eine Erhebung des Ist-Zustands sowie des geschätzten Bedarfs an EKT im MRV.	Es wurde ein Fragebogen zur Erhebung der aktuellen Anwendung sowie der Einschätzung des Bedarfs an EKT in dieser Population entwickelt. Dieser wurde elektronisch und bei Bedarf postalisch an die forensischen Kliniken in Deutschland versendet.	Wir erhielten Antwort von 52 Kliniken (66 %). 29 der Kliniken gaben an, Patienten mit EKT behandeln zu können. Eine Behandlungsindikation wurde klinikübergreifend für 3,4 % der untergebrachten Patienten gesehen. In einem Jahr (2018) wurden insgesamt 32 EKT-Behandlungen an 12 Kliniken des Maßregelvollzugs mit durchschnittlich guter Wirksamkeit (Ø CGI‑I 2,32) durchgeführt. Häufigste Begründung für die fehlende Anwendung der EKT waren mangelnde strukturelle Voraussetzungen. Jeweils etwa ein Drittel der Kliniken sehen einen mittleren bzw. hohen Bedarf an EKT im MRV.	Die EKT kommt im MRV in Deutschland aktuell nur sehr begrenzt zum Einsatz. Auffällig ist, dass die Anzahl der durchgeführten Behandlungen etwa um den Faktor 8 hinter der Indikationshäufigkeit zurücksteht. Ungeachtet dessen sehen zwei Drittel der Kliniken einen mittleren bis hohen Bedarf, womit eine Unterversorgung mit EKT im MRV zu bestehen scheint."}

Telomeres are elongated by telomerase to compensate for incomplete replication and nuclease degradation and to extend the proliferation potential of germ and stem cells and most cancers. However, telomeres in somatic cells gradually shorten with age, ultimately leading to cellular senescence. Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HHS) is characterized by accelerated telomere shortening and diverse symptoms including bone marrow failure, immunodeficiency, and neurodevelopmental defects. HHS is caused by germline mutations in telomerase subunits, factors essential for its biogenesis and recruitment to telomeres, and in the helicase RTEL1. While diverse phenotypes were associated with RTEL1 deficiency, the telomeric role of RTEL1 affected in HHS is yet unknown. Inducible ectopic expression of wild-type RTEL1 in patient fibroblasts rescued the cells, enabled telomerase-dependent telomere elongation and suppressed the abnormal cellular phenotypes, while silencing its expression resulted in gradual telomere shortening. Our observations reveal an essential role of the RTEL1 C-terminus in facilitating telomerase action at the telomeric 3' overhang. Thus, the common etiology for HHS is the compromised telomerase action, resulting in telomere shortening and reduced lifespan of telomerase positive cells."}

Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) between 2007 and 2015 were: a reduction in the numbers of patients admitted with depression; a reduction in the numbers of patients diagnosed with adjustment disorder; an increase in the numbers of patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder; a reduction in pro re nata (prn) use, including a reduction in the need for chemical restraint with midazolam and a decrease in the length of admission in the PECC.	The significant reduction in aggression, the use of prn medication and the number of people with longer stays within the PECC support the usefulness of PECCs in relation to patient satisfaction and adherence to admission criteria policy.

During the period 1976 to 1986 we encountered 18 extracranial carotid aneurysms in 14 patients. The aneurysms were atherosclerotic (12 in 9 patients), congenital (3 in 2 patients), mycotic (1) and secondary (false aneurysms) after previous carotid surgery (2 in 2 patients). The patients presented with neurological symptoms (11) or a pulsating mass in the neck (2). In one patient the aneurysm was detected accidentally during angiography. From this study it became clear that 'carotid aneurysm' is not a well defined entity. The 'normal' configuration of the carotid bulb with its usually larger diameter, is in part a cause of the problem of definition. A recently described technique for predicting normal vessel diameters in stenosing lesions of the carotid arteries was retrospectively applied to all our patients with aneurysms. With these measurements, made on standard preoperative angiograms, it was possible to quantify the degree of dilatation, and confirm the diagnosis of aneurysm. Eleven of the 14 patients were operated on without mortality, no neurological deficits were seen as a result of the operation and minimal morbidity occurred in six patients. From this study we conclude that surgical correction of accessible carotid artery aneurysms is a relatively safe procedure and these lesions should be operated on irrespective of symptoms. This is the first report that gives clear guidelines for measuring dilatation of the extracranial carotid arteries and based on these guidelines we suggest criteria for the discrimination between physiological dilatation and pathological aneurysm formation, the latter condition being an indication for operation."}

Dangling and extensibility were used to examine passive muscle tone in the upper and lower limbs and the body axis. A comparison between muscles of the right and left sides enabled the determination of tonic laterality.	We found a disharmonious tonic typology, with a tonic component for the muscles of the trunk and the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and a laxity component for the ankles and the proximal and distal muscles of the upper limbs (wrists and shoulders). No establishment of tonic laterality was found in the upper limbs in 61% of ASD children (P<0.001).	The disturbed tonic organization influenced by subcortical structures, such as the cerebellum, may partially explain the motor disorders, and indefinite tonic laterality may also be linked to low hemispheric brain dominance described in autism.

Here, we assessed the low (MAOA-L) activity variant in relation to both brain function and a behavioral index of antisocial traits. From an initial sample of 290 healthy participants, 210 had low (MAOA-L) or high (MAOA-H) activity variants. Participants underwent a brief assessment of personality traits and event-related potential (ERP) recording during an emotion-processing task. Genotype differences in ERPs were localized using LORETA. The MAOA-L genotype was distinguished by elevated scores on the index of antisocial traits. These traits were related to altered ERPs elicited 120-280ms post-stimulus, particularly for negative emotion. Altered neural processing of anger in MAOA-L genotypes was localized to medial frontal, parietal, and superior temporo-occipital regions in males, but only to the superior occipital cortex in females. The MAOA low activity variant may increase susceptibility to antisocial traits through alterations to the neural systems for processing threat-related emotion, especially for males. Monoamines such as noradrenalin and serotonin may modulate these relationships, given that their metabolism varies according to MAOA variants, and that they modulate both emotional brain systems and antisocial aggression."}

However, little is known about the incidence and risk factors of IC at stroke onset in LHI. Besides, stroke-related complications and clinical outcomes in relation to the development of IC has not been systematically examined. Data of 256 consecutive patients with LHI were collected. IC at stroke onset was retrospectively collected from the initial emergency department and/or admission records. Of the 256 LHI patients enrolled, 93 (36.3%) had IC at stroke onset. LHI patients with IC at stroke onset were older (median age 66 vs. 61, p = 0.041), had shorter prehospital delay (24 vs. 26 h, p < 0.001and higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (19 vs. 12, p < 0.001). Independent risk factors of IC at stroke onset were high NIHSS score (odds ratio, OR 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.23) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.47). Dyslipidemia appeared to protect against IC at stroke onset (adjusted OR 0.416, 95% CI 0.175 to 0.988). IC at stroke onset was associated with higher frequency of stroke-related complications (90.32% vs. 67.48%, p < 0.001), especially brain edema (45.16% vs. 23.31%, p < 0.001) and pneumonia (63.44% vs. 47.82%, p = 0.019).

However, after adjusting for age, baseline NIHSS score and other confounders, IC at stroke onset was not an independent predictor of in-hospital death (adjusted OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.47), 3-month mortality (adjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.14) and 3-month unfavorable outcome (adjusted OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.33) in LHI patients (all p > 0.05). Our results suggested that IC occur in 1 out of every 3 LHI patients at stroke onset and was associated with initial stroke severity and atrial fibrillation.

While the majority of this enzyme is localized to the cytosol, about 1% of the cellular Sod1 is present in the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria. These amounts of mitochondrial Sod1 are increased for certain Sod1 mutants that are linked to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To date, only little is known about the physiological function of mitochondrial Sod1. Here, we use the model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae to generate cells in which Sod1 is exclusively localized to the IMS. We find that IMS-localized Sod1 can functionally substitute wild type Sod1 and that it even exceeds the protective capacity of wild type Sod1 under conditions of mitochondrial ROS stress. Moreover, we demonstrate that upon expression in yeast cells the common ALS-linked mutant Sod1(G93A) becomes enriched in the mitochondrial fraction and provides an increased protection of cells from mitochondrial oxidative stress. Such an effect cannot be observed for the catalytically inactive mutant Sod1(G85R). Our observations suggest that the targeting of Sod1 to the mitochondrial IMS provides an increased protection against respiration-derived ROS."}

The main symptoms of AS are severe impairment in social interaction and communication, and restricted interests, without significant delay in cognitive and language development. Its prevalence is not clearly established but might be around 0.26 per 1000. Symptoms of high-functioning autism (HFA), which is not an official diagnostic category, are quite similar. Children and adolescents with AS or HFA mostly have a social skills deficit, in connection with a lack of understanding concerning the rules governing social interactions. This deficit often leads to social isolation and peer rejection, which can alter their quality of life. Their lack of social skills can also have effects on success at school or work, integration among peers and mental health. According to recent guidelines of the French national authority for health (Haute autorité de santé, HAS) about the special needs of persons with PDD, professionals have to develop evidence-based interventions, emphasizing social interactions and participation, as described by the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF): social and professional participation as well as participation in leisure activities, clubs and societies, etc.	To explore the studies that give evidence of the value of these social skills training groups, to review the methods and programs worked out in these groups, and to highlight the best general operating principles to be adopted and combined.	Systematic searches of electronic databases, journals, and reference lists identified 12 studies published since 1984, involving social competence group interventions, led by psychotherapists who were trained in cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), for children and adolescents from 6 to 18years old with a diagnosis of AS or HFA.	According to these 12 studies, these interventions are useful and significantly effective. Adaptation of their contents and educational means to how children and adolescents with AS function is necessary to facilitate learning and decrease anxiety. Concerning the groups' setting, most of these studies insist on the value of working with a small number of participants and creating a friendly, predictable and structured environment (even the progress of the sessions itself has to be structured). The programs' contents should ally didactic teaching and training exercises, which should be diverse and adapted to the objectives. The techniques usually applied in CBT (role plays, modeling, problem-solving strategies, etc.), must be completed with strategies known to be appropriate for children and adolescents with ASD, such as social scenarios.	Although new studies are necessary to assess the generalization and long-term efficacy of such approaches, this review confirms the advantages of the main methods of social skills training groups for children and adolescents with AS. It opens up perspectives to developing new programs of social skills training groups, integrating various approaches, dimensions and objectives, working on a long-term basis."}

We further examined the effects of ALDH2*2, ethnicity, and their interaction in Asians to better understand their unique contributions to the moderation.	The association between ADI and AUD symptoms was moderated, with ADI negatively associated with AUD symptoms among Koreans without ALDH2*2 and Whites, but not among Koreans with ALDH2*2 or Chinese regardless of ALDH2*2. Both ALDH2*2 and ethnicity within Asians contributed unique variability in the effect.	Ethnicity and ALDH2*2 altered the relationship of ADI as a risk factor for AUD symptoms. Being Chinese and possessing an ALDH2*2 allele within Koreans both buffered against the risk for AUD symptoms associated with earlier ADI, indicating that this relationship can be attenuated by protective factors."}

Our aim was to contribute to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by mapping auditory evoked potentials (AEP). Evoked potentials represent the electric response of the CNS to an external stimulus and can be represented as a sequence of waves. Brain mapping allows a chromotopogram to be compiled showing chromatic maps.	A group of 12 patients were studied aged between 68 and 84 years old who were referred to our attention at the Department of Geriatrics and Gerontology at Catania University and the A.O. Cannizzaro, Geriatrics Unit. All patients completed an assessment form (MM-SE, ADAS) and underwent brain NMR and AEP.	These tests enabled us to identify two types of patients (Group A and Group B) based on the responses shown. The overall evaluation of results revealed that patients with Alzheimer-type dementia present an anomalous cortical neurogenic response to mapped AEP, and that patients in Group A showed anomalous wave morphology, latency and localisation and asymmetric impregnation. The data gathered in this study did not confirm any specific characteristics of AEP given that similar anomalies are found in metabolic dysfunction syndromes and demyelination pathologies.	However, while it does not constitute a specific technique for screening against Alzheimer's disease, the mapping of AEP may contribute to the diagnosis of this disease."}

Cytotoxicity, distribution and the ability to cross blood brain barrier are some of the most significant issues for the chemotherapy of brain tumors. Nanotechnology has been widely exploited in drug delivery with great potential in improving the drug efficiency and efficacy. The advent of nanotechnology would greatly facilitate the early detection and treatment of brain tumors. This review will be primarily focused on current nano drug delivery system for brain cancer therapy. Meanwhile, the existing impediments for therapeutic nanomedicines and critical analysis of the different delivery nanoparticles are also discussed.	We systematically evaluated the major factors that impact the current nanomedicines for brain tumor therapy. Meanwhile, various nanoparticle-based formulations for brain cancer detection and therapy are evaluated.	124 papers were included in this review. From the analysis of the nanomaterials, seven major nanomaterials have been discussed regarding the functionality and current therapeutic significance. The review also explains in detail about the different types of nanomaterials and their functionalities. This shows that each of these nanomaterials has specialized functions for the treatment of various kinds of brain cancer.	Nanomaterials provide a viable potential diagnosis mechanis. In the future, more research needs to be focused on developing a better diagnosis tool for detection of cancer on an urgent basis. Blood-brain barrier and cytotoxicity are some of the primary root causes for the impediment of treatment of cancer using nanoparticles. Therefore, different delivery systems should be exploited for the nanoparticles to surmount these issues."}

The study presented here was undertaken to investigate the interaction between these two mechanisms on bladder activity in conscious Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without cerebral infarction. Occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery or a sham operation (SO) was performed under halothane anesthesia. After recovery from the anesthesia, bladder activity was monitored continuously by means of infusion cystometrography in awake rats. The effects of cumulative intravenous doses of quinpirole (0.001-1 mg/kg), a D2 dopamine receptor agonist, were studied in awake SO and CI rats with or without dizocilpine (10 mg/kg) pretreatment. The effects of dizocilpine (1 or 10 mg/kg) were also examined in other SO or CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole. Bladder capacity in CI rats was significantly smaller (0.18 ml) than that in SO rats (0.48 ml). Quinpirole (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) further reduced bladder capacity in both types of rats, an effect blocked by sulpiride (20 mg/kg), a D2 dopamine receptor antagonist. The effect of quinpirole was also antagonized by dizocilpine (1 mg/kg) to a significantly (P < 0.01) greater degree in CI than in SO rats. In SO rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, dizocilpine significantly increased bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. After the maximum dose (10 mg/kg) of dizocilpine, sulpiride did not produce any changes in bladder activity. In CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, 1 mg/kg of dizocilpine increased bladder capacity. After administration of the maximum dose of dizocilpine (10 mg/kg), which did not produce an additional effect, sulpiride (20 mg/kg) increased bladder capacity by 58.3%. These results indicate that in awake rats D2 dopaminergic excitatory effects on the urinary bladder are mediated in part by NMDA glutamatergic mechanisms and in part by non-NMDA mechanisms. The latter type was more prominent in CI rats, indicating that the bladder hyperactivity induced by cerebral infarction may be mediated by an alteration in dopaminergic-glutamatergic interactions in the brain."}

Lewy pathology mainly consists of abnormal aggregates of α-synuclein, which play a pivotal role in PD pathophysiology. However, the complexity of PD leads to clinical challenges, and there are still no treatments to halt or slow the neurodegenerative process. Resveratrol (RV) is a natural polyphenol compound with multiple biological activities, which has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects on several neurological diseases. Here we first provided evidence that RV treatment alleviated motor and cognitive deficits in the A53T α-synuclein mouse model of PD in a dose-dependent manner. The beneficial effects of RV against PD resulted from inhibiting α-synuclein aggregation and cytotoxicity, lowering the levels of total α-synuclein and oligomers, reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that RV has promising therapeutic potential for PD and other synucleinopathies."}

In summary, endothelin receptor A antagonists restore microcirculation and diminish cellular damage after injury, while endothelin receptor B antagonists had no effect on either parameter. However, what is not known is the effect of either antagonist on behavioral outcome. Therefore, this work was designed to test the effects of endothelin receptor A and B antagonism on behavioral outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI).	A total of 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats (400-450 g) were used in this study. Four groups (n = 12 per group) were generated as follows: sham operation, trauma+vehicle (0·9% saline), trauma+40 nmol BQ-123 (a selective endothelin receptor A antagonist) and trauma +20 nmol BQ-788 (a selective endothelin receptor B antagonist). All treatments were delivered via intracerebroventricular injection. Trauma was induced using a weight acceleration impact device. Twenty-four hours post-injection animals were tested for 21 days on a radial arm maze task to determine cognitive outcome.	Our data indicated that endothelin receptor A antagonism significantly reduced the extent of behavioral deficits following TBI while endothelin receptor B and vehicle injection had no effect.	The results suggest that endothelin receptor A, but not endothelin receptor B, antagonism improves behavioral outcome following TBI. Furthermore, these data provide a functional correlate to previously published findings in our laboratory showing that endothelin receptor A antagonism improves both blood flow and cellular outcome following TBI. In a broader sense, this work demonstrates that hypoperfusion following TBI likely contributes to poor outcome following head injury."}

However, the underlying neurochemical mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on sleep and anxiety recovery after propofol anesthesia in rats with 24 h total sleep deprivation (TSD).	Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were in natural sleep or sleep deprived for 24 h in a sleep deprivation rat system. The rats received propofol anesthesia (75 mg/kg, i.p.) or natural sleep. Dopamine transporter knockdown was performed by microinjection of AAV-DAT-RNAi vector. EEG was measured in each group to evaluate the subsequent sleep. The elevated plus maze test (EPMT) and open field test (OFT) were used to evaluate locomotion and anxiety level in rats. Immunofluorescence was used to verify virus location and transfection efficiency.	Compared with NC group, the anxiety level of Propofol group showed no significant difference, but REM sleep decreased. Compared with the TSD group, the anxiety level of the TSD + Propofol group was reduced and the sleep recovery was closer to baseline. Compared with TSD + AAV-NC group, anxiety level and sleep time increased in TSD + AAVi group, REM increased within 24 h after sleep deprivation. The sleep time of TSD + AAVi + Propofol group was between those of TSD + AAV-NC group and TSD + AAVi group. TSD + AAV-NC + Propofol group had the least sleep time and the lowest anxiety level.	1. Propofol did not change anxiety level in normal rats, but reduced REM sleep, while it could accelerate sleep recovery and reduce anxiety level in sleep-deprived rats. 2. In sleep deprived rats with DAT knockdown, propofol improved sleep and anxiety levels more slowly, especially producing more REM rebound, suggesting that the improvement of sleep and anxiety levels in sleep-deprived rats with propofol may be related to DAT in VTA region."}

Because abnormal functional connectivity in these networks has been related to schizophrenia, we tested whether alterations are also evident in subjects at risk for psychosis. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was tested in 28 subjects with basic symptoms reporting subjective cognitive-perceptive symptoms; 19 with attenuated or brief, limited psychotic symptoms; and 29 matched healthy controls. We characterized spatial differences in connectivity patterns, as well as internetwork connectivity. Right anterior insula (rAI) was selected as seed region for identifying the SN; medioprefrontal cortex (MPFC) for the DMN and TPN. The 3 groups differed in connectivity patterns between the MPFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), and between the rAI and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In particular, the typically observed antagonistic relationship in MPFC-rDLPFC, rAI-PCC, and internetwork connectivity of DMN-TPN was absent in both at-risk groups. Notably, those connectivity patterns were associated with symptoms related to reality distortions, whereas enhanced connectivity strengths of MPFC-rDLPFC and TPN-DMN were related to poor performance in cognitive functions. We propose that the loss of a TPN-DMN anticorrelation, accompanied by an aberrant spatial extent in the DMN, TPN, and SN in the psychosis risk state, reflects the confusion of internally and externally focused states and disturbance of cognition, as seen in psychotic disorders."}

Redistribution of body heat and heat loss to the environment result in mild hypothermia before cardiopulmonary bypass. Maintenance of normothermia, rather than hypothermia, may facilitate early tracheal extubation. Hypothermia alters the distribution and decreases the metabolism of most drugs, including anesthetic drugs and muscle relaxants, thus prolonging recovery. Postoperative shivering increases metabolic rate and potentially leads to myocardial ischemia; prevention is therefore critical to the success of early tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery. Coagulopathies, increased incidence of surgical wound infection, and perioperative cardiac morbidity are other potential risk factors identified in noncardiac patients. Hypothermia, however, does have potential benefits to the patient, including protection from cerebral ischemia and hypoxemia. Mild core hypothermia (approximately 34 degrees C) may represent the optimal balance between risks and benefits for fast-track patients."}

For purposes of analysis, 'abuse' of analgesics is defined as regular, usually daily consumption. The prevalence of habitual consumption demonstrates marked geographic variation for poorly defined reasons. Prevalence tended to be highest in those populations in which phenacetin was available and popular. The prevalence of nephropathy among habitual consumers also shows marked interpopulation variability. A highly significant linear relationship exists between the prevalence of habitual analgesic consumption in a given population and the prevalence of nephropathy in the subset of that population that habitually consumes analgesics. This relationship may represent a dose-response curve relating amount of analgesic intake to prevalence of nephropathy. Four cross-sectional studies, 1 longitudinal, and 1 case-control study have shown significant differences in prevalence of nephropathy between habitual users of phenacetin-containing analgesics and control populations. Conversely, 2 cross-sectional studies and 1 case control study showed no difference between habitual users of analgesics and control populations. However, those studies showing no difference were performed in populations with low prevalence of habitual consumption of compound analgesics and a lower prevalence of nephropathy than was found in those populations where differences were observed. The relative risk for developing various manifestations of analgesic nephropathy has been estimated in 4 studies and varies depending on which abnormality is considered. Data are available only for subjects consuming phenacetin-containing compound analgesics. The relative risk for elevated serum creatinine is in the range of 8 to 11, about twice that for an abnormal renal concentrating test (approximately 4). The relative risk for clinical papillary necrosis is approximately 18, and for cause-specific death (and by inference for end-stage renal disease) about 4. The difference in risk between most clinical manifestations of analgesic nephropathy and death (or end-stage renal disease) may be due to the fact that most patients with nephropathy do not progress to terminal renal failure. Rheumatology clinic studies indicate that the prevalence of nephropathy in habitual consumers of phenacetin-containing compounds is higher than that for habitual consumers of aspirin alone. Removal of phenacetin from compound analgesics in Scandinavian countries appears to have reduced the prevalence of papillary necrosis and death from interstitial nephritis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"}

Users of Li+AC (N = 107, primarily lamotrigine and valproate, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.2, standard deviation = 1.3) and users of Li+AP+AC (N = 73, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.1, standard deviation = 1.3) showed worse response compared to lithium-only users (all p < 0.01). When comparing Li+AP to Li+AC, users of Li+AP improved slightly better on general (p = 0.05) and manic symptoms (p = 0.01), but showed a worse development of glucose, triglycerides, and metabolic syndrome.

A Bayesian account has recently suggested that central tendency reflects the integration of noisy sensory estimates with prior knowledge representations of a mean stimulus, serving to improve performance. The process is flexible, so prior knowledge is weighted more heavily when sensory estimates are imprecise, requiring more integration to reduce noise. In this study we measure central tendency in autism to evaluate a recent theoretical hypothesis suggesting that autistic perception relies less on prior knowledge representations than typical perception. If true, autistic children should show reduced central tendency than theoretically predicted from their temporal resolution. We tested autistic and age- and ability-matched typical children in two child-friendly tasks: (1) a time interval reproduction task, measuring central tendency in the temporal domain; and (2) a time discrimination task, assessing temporal resolution. Central tendency reduced with age in typical development, while temporal resolution improved. Autistic children performed far worse in temporal discrimination than the matched controls. Computational simulations suggested that central tendency was much less in autistic children than predicted by theoretical modelling, given their poor temporal resolution."}

For stress detection algorithms focused on short-duration time windows, there is potential benefit in including HRV features derived from the detection of smaller peaks within the ECG waveform: the P, Q, S, and T waves. However, the potential drawback of using these small peaks is their smaller magnitude and subsequent susceptibility to noise, making them more difficult to reliably detect. In this work, we demonstrate the potential benefits of including smaller waves within binary stress classification using a pre-existing data set of ECG recordings from 57 participants (aged 18-40) with a self-reported fear of spiders during exposure to videos of spiders. We also present an analysis of the performance of an automated peak detection algorithm and the reliability of detection for each of the smaller parts of the ECG waveform. We compared two models, one with only R peak features and one with small peak features. They were similar in precision, recall, F1, area under ROC curve (AUC), and accuracy, with the greatest differences less than the standard deviations of each metric. There was a significant difference in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which represented the information loss of the model. The inclusion of novel small peak features made the model 4.29×1028 times more probable to minimize the information loss, and the small peak features showed higher regression coefficients than the R peak features, indicating a stronger relationship with acute psychological stress. This difference and further analysis of the novel features suggest that small peak intervals could be indicative of independent processes within the heart, reflecting a psychophysiological response to stress that has not yet been leveraged in stress detection algorithms."}

These mDA NPs proliferate, migrate to their final destinations, and develop into mature mDA neurons in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Here, we show that such authentic mDA NPs can be efficiently isolated from differentiated ES cells (ESCs) using a FACS method combining two markers, Otx2 and Corin. Purified Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells coexpressed other mDA NP markers, including FoxA2, Lmx1b, and Glast. Using optimized culture conditions, these mDA NPs continuously proliferated up to 4 wk with almost 1,000-fold expansion without significant changes in their phenotype. Furthermore, upon differentiation, Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells efficiently generated mDA neurons, as evidenced by coexpression of mDA neuronal markers (e.g., TH, Pitx3, Nurr1, and Lmx1b) and physiological functions (e.g., efficient DA secretion and uptake). Notably, these mDA NPs differentiated into a relatively homogenous DA population with few serotonergic neurons. When transplanted into PD model animals, aphakia mice, and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, mDA NPs differentiated into mDA neurons in vivo and generated well-integrated DA grafts, resulting in significant improvement in motor dysfunctions without tumor formation. Furthermore, grafted Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells exhibited significant migratory function in the host striatum, reaching >3.3 mm length in the entire striatum. We propose that functional and expandable mDA NPs can be efficiently isolated by this unique strategy and will serve as useful tools in regenerative medicine, bioassay, and drug screening."}

Abnormalities in stress reactivity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) function may be involved in the mechanistic connection between stress and the initiation, development, and/or maintenance of alcohol dependence. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occurs with alcohol dependence and is characterized by HPA axis abnormalities. This study investigated the relationship between subjective and neuroendocrine stress reactivity to the cold pressor task (CPT) and prospective alcohol use among individuals with alcohol dependence, with and without comorbid PTSD.	Participants were 63 individuals with (a) alcohol dependence only (n=35) or (b) comorbid alcohol dependence and PTSD (n=28). Participants completed the CPT, a widely used physical laboratory stressor. Subjective stress, craving, adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), and cortisol were measured before, immediately after, and at 5, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the CPT. Alcohol use during 1 month following testing was also assessed.	For the alcohol-only group, change in craving immediately following the CPT and craving during the 120-minute recovery phase were predictive of follow-up alcohol use. For the alcohol/PTSD group, change in craving was not predictive of follow-up use. Baseline drinking was, however, predictive of followup alcohol use for the alcohol/PTSD group. For the alcohol-only group, a blunted ACTH response coupled with a higher change in craving following the CPT was associated with significantly greater frequency and intensity of drinking during the follow-up phase.	These preliminary findings demonstrate significant differences between the alcohol-only and the alcohol/PTSD group in predictors of relapse. For the alcohol-only group, reactivity to an acute laboratory stressor may be predictive of subsequent alcohol use. This was not true for the alcohol/PTSD group. Although preliminary, the findings may help shed light on the mechanistic relationship between stress reactivity and increased risk for alcohol relapse and dependence in individuals with and without other Axis I comorbidity."}

A 6-year-old boy with bilateral HL presented to the clinic with significant behavioral challenges. These challenges (e.g., fatigued quickly, poor attention, and hyperactivity) were affecting the reliability of audiological testing to determine cochlear implant candidacy.

PCIT is an evidence-based intervention that has been shown to significantly improve externalizing behavior problems. This study describes how the Child-Directed Interaction phase of PCIT was tailored for a child with bilateral HL. The goal of the intervention was to reduce externalizing behaviors in order to reliably complete a cochlear implant evaluation. Post-intervention, significant improvements were noted in behavior, including a decrease in disruptive behavior to normal levels. This led to completion of previously unsuccessful audiological testing and determination of cochlear implant candidacy.	This study illustrates how PCIT was successfully tailored to one child with an HL. This is critical as children with HL are at risk for behavior problems, and effective interventions for disruptive behaviors in children with HL may lead to significant improvements in medical and psychosocial outcomes for children with HL and their families."}

The NO-precursor L-arginine has been shown to counteract CBF decreases early after trauma, but microcirculatory and more long-term effects on CBF of L-arginine have not been investigated. In an attempt to analyze effects of L-arginine on the microcirculation in the traumatized brain, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of L-arginine compared to vehicle (0.9% saline) following a standardized controlled cortical-impact brain trauma in mice. Cerebral blood flow (autoradiography [(14)C]-iodoantipyrine), number of perfused capillaries (FITC-dextran fluorescence technique), brain water content (wet vs. dry weight) and the blood to brain transfer constant K(i) for [(51)Cr]-EDTA were analyzed in the injured and the contralateral cortex. Cortical blood flow in the injured cortex was 0.43+/-0.3 mL/g/min and 0.81+/-0.3 mL/g/min 3 h after trauma in the vehicle and L-arginine groups, respectively (p<0.05), and no treatment effect was seen 24 h after trauma. The number of perfused capillaries decreased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. K(i) increased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. Brain water content was lower in the L-arginine group than in the vehicle group 3 h after trauma and there was no difference between the groups 24 h after trauma. We conclude that L-arginine reduces brain edema formation and improves cortical blood flow in the early phase after a brain trauma, whereas no circulatory effects can be seen after prolonged treatment."}

The gene responsible for MEN 1 syndrome was recently identified and cloned. Low rates of MEN 1 gene mutations and deletions have been reported in sporadic pituitary adenomas. To elucidate the role of the MEN 1 gene in the pathogenesis of MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors, we examined pituitary adenomas from 11 MEN 1 patients for the presence of 11q13 allelic loss. Ten of the 11 pituitary tumors were informative by PCR-based loss of heterozygosity analysis. Using a combination of family pedigree analysis and restriction analysis directed at the mutated allele in 8 of the 10 informative cases, it was demonstrated in all 8 cases that it is the wild-type allele that undergoes deletion. All 11 tumors, 4 of which were growth hormone secreting, were additionally analyzed for mutation in the Gs alpha subunit (gsp) gene. None of the tumors (0 of 11 tumors) revealed a gsp gene mutation. Therefore, genetic alterations of the MEN 1 gene seem to play a dominant role in MEN 1-associated pituitary tumorigenesis, whereas gsp gene mutations do not seem to be a frequent event in either growth hormone-secreting or other types of MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors. These results suggest that MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors develop via genetic pathways that differ from those of most sporadic pituitary tumors."}

In the absence of decision aids, we explore insights from decision theory and propose an expected utility-inspired approach as a supplementary navigating tool in the decision-making process. Four patient case scenarios are discussed as a demonstration of using individualized rankings of outcome preferences, and deriving expected utilities for interventions such as decompressive craniectomy versus medical therapy.

In this review we first list common indications for thyroid hormone administration, distinguishing its use as replacement therapy in hypothyroidism from its use to suppress thyrotropin (TSH) secretion in cases of thyroid cancer, nodules, and goiter. The dangers associated with changing to a preparation with different bioavailability are summarized, noting the particular danger of giving a more active preparation to a patient receiving TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine. However, these dangers are part of a larger problem: there are data showing that large numbers of patients are already receiving an improper dosage of levothyroxine, as judged from measurements of serum TSH. The recent history of FDA actions concerning levothyroxine bioequivalence and the arguments of those in disagreement are summarized. The immediate response to these problems should be better education of both patients and physicians. It is also recommended that there be further discussion of the problems in determining bioequivalence, and that consideration be given to more accurate and clinically relevant methods.

Survivors (N=2,198) of seven different war and terror-related traumas were assessed using a DSM-IV-TR based PTSD inventory. Four confirmatory factor analytic models were compared.	The most acceptable model was a correlated model consisting of four factors of re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal. DSM-IV-TR avoidance empirically split into active avoidance and emotional numbing. These results corroborate knowledge and suggest that in Israel, where stressors are ongoing, the PTSD symptom clusters may be reformulated in DSM-5 to consist of re-experiencing, active avoidance, emotional numbing and hyperarousal."}

Glutamate production is greatly increased following HIV-1 infection of cultured MP, a process dependent upon the glutamate-generating enzyme glutaminase. Glutaminase inhibition was previously found to significantly decrease macrophage-mediated neurotoxicity. Potential mechanisms of glutaminase-mediated excitotoxicity including enzyme up-regulation, increased enzyme activity and glutaminase localization were investigated in this report. RNA and protein analysis of HIV-infected human primary macrophage revealed up-regulation of the glutaminase isoform GAC, yet identified no changes in the kidney-type glutaminase isoform over the course of infection. Glutaminase is a mitochondrial protein, but was found to be released into the cytosol and extracellular space following infection. This released enzyme is capable of rapidly converting the abundant extracellular amino acid glutamine into excitotoxic levels of glutamate in an energetically favorable process. These findings support glutaminase as a potential component of the HAD pathogenic process and identify a possible therapeutic avenue for the treatment of neuroinflammatory states such as HAD."}

This is a clinically important finding, as, with the demonstration that a significant proportion of ASDs are the result of rare, etiological genetic variants, it becomes possible to make use of genetic testing to supplement behavioral analyses for an earlier diagnosis. As it appears that earlier interventions in ASDs will produce better outcomes, the development of genetic testing to augment behaviorally based evaluations in ASDs holds promise for improved treatment. Furthermore, these rare variants involve synaptic and neuronal genes that implicate specific pathways, cells, and subcellular compartments in ASDs, which in turn will suggest novel therapeutic approaches in ASDs. Of particular recent interest are the synaptic cell adhesion and associated molecules, including neurexin 1, neuroligin 3 and 4, and SHANK3, which implicate glutamatergic synapse abnormalities in ASDs. In the current review we will overview the evidence for a genetic etiology for ASDs, and summarize recent genetic findings in these disorders.

The purpose of this study is to compare these three different treatment options in terms of local response, survival, and quality of life. From June 1995 to July 1998, 70 lung cancer patients with new diagnosed single brain metastasis were treated with either WBRT alone (n = 29), or SRS alone (n = 23), or the combination of both methods (n = 18). Multiple endpoints, including survival, freedom from local progression (FFLP), freedom from new brain metastasis (FFNBM), local control, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and causes of death, were measured from the date of treatment completion and compared using univariate and multivariate analyses. For patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, the median survivals were 5.7, 9.3, and 10.6 months, the median FFLP were 4.0, 6.9, and 8.6 months, the median FFNBM were 4.1, 6.7, and 8.6 months, and the local response rates were 55.6, 87.0, and 88.9%, respectively. Four of the 29 patients treated with WBRT-alone continued with progression of disease. The post treatment KPS showed improvement in 41.4, 82.6, and 88.9% of patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, respectively. The progression of new and/or recurred metastatic brain tumor as the cause of death accounted for 51.7%, 50. 0%, and 28.3% of the patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that the significant differences among the three treatment arms were observed based on all of the above mentioned endpoints. However, the comparison between SRS-alone and SRS+WBRT groups indicated that adding WBRT only improves FFNBM (P = 0.0392). Cox regression analyses revealed no significant difference in both of the KPS (P = 0.1082) and causes of death (P = 0.081) among the three arms. Both SRS alone and SRS+WBRT seem better in prolonging life and improving quality of life than WBRT alone for patients with single brain metastasis from lung cancer. But the combined therapy did not show significant advantage over SRS alone in improving survival, enhancing local control, and quality of life except for a more favorable FFNBM.

However, without direct questioning the absence cannot be assumed. We, therefore, asked 100 migraineurs about abdominal symptoms during migraine attacks: only one experienced unexplained abdominal pain. We conclude that abdominal pain is not a feature in adult migraineurs, leading us to support the notions that: (1) recurrent abdominal pain of childhood has a number of causes; (2) abdominal migraine may be an incorrect attribution and is liable to be over diagnosed; (3) abdominal migraine requires more precise definition; (4) the transition from childhood abdominal migraine to adult migraine needs precise prospective study."}

C3H/HeJ mice primed with V-LSGPC developed neither circulating antibodies nor CD8+ cytotoxic T cells specific for LCMV, yet they resisted a normally lethal LCMV challenge. Spleen cells from such mice gave a proliferative response to LCMV in vitro that was inhibitable by anti-CD4 antibody. Synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted T-cell sites common to the envelope glycoprotein precursor (GP-C) of LV and that of LCMV were used to map the specificity of the proliferative response to an epitope located between amino acids 403 and 417 of LV GP-C. Several CD4+ T-cell clones specific for the 403-417 peptide were isolated and found to produce gamma interferon in response to both the peptide and LCMV.

We review the extent and correlates of dropping out of mental health treatment for individuals with schizophrenia and suggest strategies for facilitating treatment engagement. Although rates vary across studies, reviews of the literature suggest that up to one-third of individuals with serious mental illnesses who have had some contact with the mental health service system disengage from care. Younger age, male gender, ethnic minority background, and low social functioning have been consistently associated with disengagement from mental health treatment. Individuals with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders, as well as those with early-onset psychosis, are at particularly high risk of treatment dropout. Engagement strategies should specifically target these high-risk groups, as well as high-risk periods, including following an emergency room or hospital admission and the initial period of treatment. Interventions to enhance engagement in mental health treatment range from low-intensity interventions, such as appointment reminders, to high-intensity interventions, such as assertive community treatment. Disengagement from treatment may reflect the consumer's perspective that treatment is not necessary, is not meeting their needs, or is not being provided in a collaborative manner. An emerging literature on patient-centered care and shared decision making in psychiatry provides suggestive evidence that efforts to enhance client-centered communication and promote individuals' active involvement in mental health treatment decisions can also improve engagement in treatment."}

This paper offers a model for understanding psychotic patients' experiences on an inpatient unit, and for effectively working with them in this setting. I have drawn on a parallel in film, that of 'The Madness of King George,' to help illustrate the concept of the hospitalized schizophrenic patient as imprisoned royalty. Through this metaphor, I explore the process of defensive breakdown and repair in psychosis, as it occurs in the hospital setting. I examine the relationships between patients, clinicians, and aspects of the hospital, and review some of the common dilemmas in this type of treatment."}

In 2010, an international panel of experts established consensus defining four main subgroups of medulloblastoma (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4) delineated by transcriptional profiling. This has led to the current generation of biomarker-driven clinical trials assigning WNT tumors to a favorable prognosis group in addition to clinicopathological criteria including MYC and MYCN gene amplifications. However, outcome prediction of non-WNT subgroups is a challenge due to inconsistent survival reports. In 2015, a consensus conference was convened in Heidelberg with the objective to further refine the risk stratification in the context of subgroups and agree on a definition of risk groups of non-infant, childhood medulloblastoma (ages 3-17). Published and unpublished data over the past 5 years were reviewed, and a consensus was reached regarding the level of evidence for currently available biomarkers. The following risk groups were defined based on current survival rates: low risk (>90 % survival), average (standard) risk (75-90 % survival), high risk (50-75 % survival) and very high risk (<50 % survival) disease. The WNT subgroup and non-metastatic Group 4 tumors with whole chromosome 11 loss or whole chromosome 17 gain were recognized as low-risk tumors that may qualify for reduced therapy. High-risk strata were defined as patients with metastatic SHH or Group 4 tumors, or MYCN-amplified SHH medulloblastomas. Very high-risk patients are Group 3 with metastases or SHH with TP53 mutation. In addition, a number of consensus points were reached that should be standardized across future clinical trials. Although we anticipate new data will emerge from currently ongoing and recently completed clinical trials, this consensus can serve as an outline for prioritization of certain molecular subsets of tumors to define and validate risk groups as a basis for future clinical trials."}

The DNA damage may lead to the cell apoptosis, which could contribute to the degeneration of neuronal tissues. Recent evidence suggests that PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) may be involved in the pathophysiology of the neurodegenerative disorders. Since PTEN expression appears to be one dominant determinant of the neuronal cell death, PTEN should be a potential molecular target of novel therapeutic strategies against Parkinson's disease. In addition, defects in DNA damage response and DNA repair are often associated with modulation of hormone signaling pathways. Especially, many observations imply a role for estrogen in a regulation of the DNA repair action. In the present review, we have attempted to summarize the function of DNA repair molecules at a viewpoint of the PTEN signaling pathway and the hormone related functional modulation of cells, providing a broad interpretation on the molecular mechanisms for treatment of Parkinson's disease. Particular attention will be paid to the mechanisms proposed to explain the health effects of food ingredients against Parkinson's disease related to reduce oxidative stress for an efficient therapeutic intervention."}

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses determined the associations of sociodemographic, pre-, and post-migration risk factors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and global functioning.	Regression data indicate that length of time between arrival in US and clinical services was significantly associated with PTSD and depression; participants receiving services after 1 year of resettlement were more likely to experience PTSD (adjusted OR = 3.29) and depression (adjusted OR = 4.50) than participants receiving services within 1 year. Anxiety was predicted by female gender (adjusted OR = 3.43), age over 40 years (adjusted OR = 3.12), Muslim religion (adjusted OR = 2.64), and receiving medical services (AOR 3.1). Severely impaired global functioning was associated with female gender (adjusted OR = 2.75) and unstable housing status (adjusted OR = 2.21).

As a result, it is becoming obvious that the clinical presentation of these smaller lesions can be somewhat variant to what is considered typical for an acoustic neuroma. Likewise, although the sensitivity of auditory brain stem response for larger tumors is believed to be quite good, the sensitivity for smaller tumors has recently been questioned, particularly when the patient is first seen early in the course of the disease with only mild otologic complications. To assess auditory brain stem response results as well as clinical and audiologic presentations, we conducted a retrospective study of patients treated for small acoustic tumors (less than 1 cm). Of the 70 patients included in the study, auditory brain stem response was abnormal in 65 (93%), on the basis of wave V latency prolongation and interaural latency differences. This would indicate that auditory brain stem response is a valid screening test for acoustic tumors, even in early stages of development. The clinical presentation of patients with small acoustic tumors was similar to that reported for acoustic tumors in general, but with vertigo occurring more frequently in patients with smaller tumors. Several atypical patterns of hearing loss were also noted."}

However, prior data on this issue are inconclusive. We re-examined this question, testing a group of 23 young autistic children, aged around 8years with a verbal mental age of around 4years and three groups of typical children (n=60) ranging in age from 4 to 8years on a level 2 visual perspective task and a closely matched mental rotation task. The results demonstrate that autistic children have difficulty with visual perspective taking compared to a task requiring mental rotation, relative to typical children. Furthermore, performance on the level 2 visual perspective taking task correlated with theory of mind performance. These findings resolve discrepancies in previous studies of visual perspective taking in autism, and demonstrate that level 2 visual perspective taking is a mentalising task."}

In these patients, awareness of intention to act has been shown to be delayed. However, delayed awareness of intention to act has also been shown in patients with hyperdopaminergic states and an excess of unwilled movements, as in Tourette's, and in patients with functional movement disorders. Hence, the role of dopamine in the awareness of intention and action remains unclear. 36 PD patients were tested ON and OFF dopaminergic medication and compared with 35 healthy age-matched controls. In addition, 17 PD patients with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) were tested ON medication and ON and OFF stimulation. Participants judged either the moment a self-generated action was performed, or the moment the urge to perform the action was felt, using the 'Libet method'. Temporal judgments of intention and action awareness were comparable between unmedicated PD patients and controls. Dopaminergic medication boosted anticipatory awareness of both intentions and actions in PD patients, relative to an unmedicated condition. The difference between ON/OFF DBS was not statistically reliable.

Data were pooled from 9 short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD randomly assigned to desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d, 100 mg/d, or placebo. A mixed-effects model for repeated-measures analysis of change from baseline score was used to determine the time point at which desvenlafaxine treatment groups separated from placebo on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and psychosocial outcomes. The association between early improvement and week 8 outcomes was examined using logistic regression analyses. Time to remission for patients with early improvement versus without early improvement was assessed using Kaplan-Meier techniques. Comparisons between groups were performed with log-rank tests.

In a 16-week follow-up, SR-VF daily dose could be modified on the basis of the therapeutic response and of the side effect profile. Symptomatological modifications were explored by means of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). SR-VF was well tolerated and only 2 patients interrupted the treatment before 24 weeks; the mean final dose +/- SD was 135.5 +/- 71.8 mg (range 75-225); in 26 (81.2%) patients, a statistically significant response was observed in depressive symptomatology within the first 8 weeks. The mean total score of HAM-D showed a significant reduction during the first 8 weeks of treatment, while the mean total score of HAM-A did not present a significant reduction until week 24. In patients with MD, a statistically significant response was observed after the first 8 weeks, while the reduction of the anxiety scores required more time and, in some cases, did not appear at all. Conversely, in patients with GAD and dysthymia, anxious and depressive symptomatology improved simultaneously. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that the improvement of depression is negatively related to a high score of CGI anxiety severity, and the improvement of anxiety is related to the presence of dysthymia and, to a lesser extent, to a short duration of the illness.

Morphological images showed, interestingly, that Abeta (1-42) aggregates had a tendency to form globules rather than fibrils as the valency of 6S-GlcNAc on the substrate was increased. The SPR measurements indicated that this morphological change of Abeta (1-42) was related to the change of binding mode, and the binding mode was dependent on the multivalency of the sugar. Globular Abeta (1-42) was more toxic than fibrillar Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells.

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare the effects of distinct working memory (2-back) and inhibition (Stroop) tasks on walking gait performance in chronic stroke survivors.	A pilot sample of chronic stroke survivors (n = 11, 8 males, mean age = 70.91, 6-12months post-stroke event) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 13, 4 male; mean age = 68.46) were tested. Gait performance (speed, stride time, stride time variability, stride length and stride length variability) was measured using 2 wireless inertial measurement sensors under 4 walking conditions: 1) preferred walking (single-task: ST), 2) walking with a 2-back DT, 3) walking with a Stroop DT, and 4) walking with a non-executive motor response DT. The secondary tasks were also carried out in both ST (seated) and DT conditions, to examine bidirectional effects.

Maximum parenchymal iodine concentration and maximum iodine concentration relative to the torcula were recorded. Follow-up imaging was reviewed for ICH. The primary outcome measure was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days.	Out of 651 records, 402 patients were included. CE was found in 318 patients (79%). Thirty-five patients developed ICH on follow-up imaging. Fourteen ICHs were symptomatic. Stroke progression occurred in 59 patients. Multivariable regression showed a significant association between decreasing CE-ASPECTS and the mRS at 90 days (adjusted (a)cOR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.18), NIHSS at 24-48 h (aβ: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.29-0.84), stroke progression (aOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.26) and ICH (aOR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06-1.39), but not symptomatic ICH (aOR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.95-1.38). Iodine concentration was significantly associated with the mRS (acOR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.06-1.32), NIHSS (aβ: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.30-1.06), ICH (aOR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.81) and symptomatic ICH (aOR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38), but not stroke progression (aOR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.86-1.15). Results of the analyses with relative iodine concentration were similar and did not improve prediction.	CE-ASPECTS and iodine concentration are both associated with short- and long-term stroke outcomes. CE-ASPECTS is likely a better predictor for stroke progression."}

The present study aimed to examine the effects of a self-applied computerized program based on SSL that maintains the same objectives and contents as the face-to-face program.	In this randomized controlled study, 75 children (49.3 % female) aged 8-12 years (Mage = 9.45, SD = 1.31), selected for exhibiting emotional symptoms, were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n = 35) or the waiting list control (WLC) group (n = 40). Pre- and post-intervention data were collected through self-reports and the report of parents who completed parallel versions of the same measures of emotional and behavioral problems.	Overall, compared to the WLC group, the intervention group showed positive effects on targeted emotional symptomatology in the short term. Based on parents' reports, a significant reduction was found in outcomes such as anxiety, depression, emotional symptoms, and internalizing problems, while self-reported results were similar except for anxiety. In addition, a positive impact was found on symptoms related to other types of difficulties (e.g., externalizing problems and general difficulties measured).	Small sample size, non-inclusion of follow-up assessment and other informants (e.g., teachers).	In conclusion, this research provides novel and promising data on the self-applied computerized adapted version of the SSL program, within a multi-informant approach, suggesting that it may be a useful tool for the indicated prevention of childhood emotional problems."}

Clinical and cultural implications.^\nAfter long-term treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), the TCA blood levels of 41 depressed Southeast Asian patients were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. No detectable medicine level was found in 25 (61%) of the patients and a therapeutic level by American standards was found in only six (15%), indicating a high incidence of noncompliance. A Cambodian subgroup, however, was significantly more compliant than either the Vietnamese or Mein patients. After patient education and a discussion of problems and benefits of medicine, compliance improved with Vietnamese and Cambodians but not with the Mien. Cultural and educational factors influence compliance with medicine and responsiveness to education. Because the Cambodians also suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder, it is probable that the presence of this illness increased compliance. Preliminary data among these patients indicate that Asians probably need the same dose of imipramine as Americans to achieve a 'therapeutic' level. Reports that Asians need lower doses of TCA medicine are limited by the high noncompliance rates with Asians. These high rates probably reflect cultural beliefs about illness and medication usage. It is valuable to perform TCA blood levels on Asian patients for whom antidepressants have been prescribed to monitor compliance and to lead into a discussion of benefits and side effects of the medicine. Evidence of noncompliance can lead to a productive doctor-patient discussion about beliefs and effects of the medication."}

SCLC was excluded by thoracic computed tomography (75%) or chest radiography (25%).	Of 120 eligible patients, 70% had limited disease (LD). Treatment modalities included chemotherapy (n = 82; 68%), radiotherapy (RT) (n = 80; 67%), and surgery (n = 41, 34%). The median survival for patients with LD and extensive disease was 1.4 years and 0.7 years, respectively. Gynecologic (n = 31) and gastrointestinal (n = 28) were the most common primary tumor sites. Gynecologic and head and neck primary tumor sites had better 1-year survival than other sites (P = .019 and 0.005, respectively). Brain metastasis was the site of first distant failure in 4.1% of patients versus 35% for soft tissue metastases. The lifetime risk of brain metastasis was 13%. Definitive RT (P = .004), LD (P = .028), and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) (P = .022) were found to be positive prognostic factors and weight loss (P < .001) was a negative prognostic factor on multivariate analysis.	Patients with EPSCC usually experienced short survival, often with early distant metastasis. Although PCI was associated with improved overall survival, brain metastasis was less frequent than in patients with SCLC, and therefore the potential benefit of PCI was less than in patients with SCLC.

We aimed to describe the differences in invasive disease potential of serotypes that are common colonizers in pre- and post-vaccine eras in order to provide further insight in our understanding of dynamic epidemiology of pneumococcal diseases.	Using data from surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage and enhanced surveillance for IPD, a serotype specific 'invasive capacity (IC)' was computed by dividing the incidence of IPD due to serotype x by the carriage prevalence of that same serotype in children <7years of age in Massachusetts. We have evaluated the serotype specific invasive capacity in two periods; pre-PCV13 (2001/02, 2003/04, 2006/07, 2008/09) and post-PCV13 (2010/11 and 2013/14), and by age groups; <24monthsvs. ≥24months.	An approximate 50-fold variation in the point estimate was observed between the serotypes having the highest (7F, 38, 19A, 3, 33F) and the lowest (6C, 35B, 21, 11A, 23B and 23A) computed serotype specific invasive disease potential. In the post-PCV13 era (6C, 35B, 11A, 23B and 23A), 5 of the 7 most common serotypes colonizing the nasopharynx were serotypes with the lowest invasive capacity. Serotype specific invasive capacity trended down in older children for majority of the serotypes, and serotypes 3, 10A and 19A had significantly lower invasive capacity in children older than 24months of age compared to younger children.	Invasive capacity differs among serotypes and likely by age. Point estimates of IC for most of the common serotypes colonizing children in Massachusetts in post-PCV13 era were low and likely explain the continued reduction in IPD from the pre-PCV era in the absence of specific protection against these serotypes."}

This study examined the extent to which fear activation and reduction within and across exposures predicted treatment outcomes for social anxiety disorder within a paradigm suitable for their measurement.	Sixty-eight adults with social anxiety disorder and fear of public speaking completed seven exposure sessions, each consisting of seven speeches conducted in virtual reality. Exposures were identical in duration, task requirements, and virtual public speaking situation. Fear was measured with skin conductance and subjective distress ratings. At baseline and post-treatment, participants completed a public speaking behavioral approach test with a panel of confederate judges; subjective fear was measured. A standardized questionnaire of anxiety symptoms was administered at baseline, post-treatment, and one-month follow-up.	No indices of within- or between-session fear reduction, measured by subjective distress and skin conductance response, predicted treatment outcome. One measure of fear activation was associated with outcomes such that less activation predicted greater symptom reduction; remaining indices did not predict outcomes.	Data were collected in the context of a randomized controlled trial of scopolamine; drug group was included in analytic models to account for drug influence. VR exposures elicited mild levels of distress that may underestimate levels of distress in clinical settings.

Annual Conference^\nTowards a method to study neurorobotic control in a rat model of spinal cord injury.^\nNeurorobotic control of prosthetic devices may bea viable therapeutic intervention that provides spinal cord injury patients with the ability to use the neuronal activity of populations of single neurons to control an external device (i.e.cursor on a computer screen or robotic arm). However, we are limited by our understanding of how spinal cord injury alters the ability of these neurons to convey information about the intention to move. Therefore, there is a need to develop animal models that 1) describe how population of single neurons encode information about different behavioral tasks (skilled vs.unskilled), 2) determine how this encoding is modulated by spinal cord injury and 3) perform neurorobotic control after spinal cord injury. To address the first question, we developed a rat model of spinal cord transection to evaluate the effects of the injury on the neuronal activity related to hindlimb activity. The model consists of training the rat to press a pedal with its hindlimbs. This paper describes the method that defines both the magnitude and latency of a neuron's activity in terms of its Peri-Event Histogram relative to the animal's movements during the task. The method provides a means by which changes in neural activation can be correlated with changes in behavior."}

In this study the authors tested whether similar protective effects are found in a rat model of permanent focal ischemia (permanent middle cerebral artery [MCA] occlusion).	Tamoxifen (20 mg/kg) was given either before or at 1, 3, or 6 hours after permanent MCA occlusion in rats, with sustaining doses given every 12 hours thereafter. The median infarct volume measured after 72 hours was 113 mm3 for the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) groups, compared with 31 mm3 for pretreatment, and 14, 27, and 98 mm3 for treatment beginning at 1, 3, and 6 hours, respectively, after permanent MCA occlusion. The infarct reductions in the pretreated and 1- and 3-hour post-MCA occlusion treatment groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). At 3 hours after permanent MCA occlusion, tamoxifen also significantly reduced the infarct size at a lower dose of 5 mg/kg but not at 1 mg/kg; the same sustaining doses of 5 and 1 mg/kg were given every 12 hours.	Tamoxifen is as effective in a permanent model of focal ischemia as it is in the reversible model, and the therapeutic window of 3 hours after initiation of ischemia is identical. This effectiveness is likely due to several properties of the drug, including its known ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Because tamoxifen has been administered safely in humans for treatment of gliomas at similarly high doses to those used in this study, it may be clinically useful as a treatment for ischemic stroke."}

Here the authors report a series of OPLL-affected patients treated by 'only-fixation' technique.	Between June 2012 and June 2019, 52 patients having OPLL were treated by a surgical strategy involving only spinal fixation without any form of bone or soft tissue decompression. Facetal fixation for both the atlantoaxial and subaxial spine formed the basis of the surgical treatment. Clinical parameters, analysis of video recordings before and after surgery, and patient self-assessment were included in the analysis of outcome.	During the mean follow-up period there was an immediate postoperative and progressive recovery in symptoms in 51 patients.

The Distributed Ambulatory Research in Therapeutics Network (DARTNet) was engaged to systematically collect data using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at the point of care. We used electronic health records (EHRs) and the PHQ-9 to capture, describe, and compare data on both baseline severity of illness and suicidality and response and suicidality after diagnosis for depressed patients in participating DARTNet practices.	EHR data were obtained for 81,028 episodes of depression (61,464 patients) from 14 clinical organizations. Over 9 months, data for 4900 PHQ-9s were collected from 2969 patients in DARTNet practices (this included 1892 PHQ-9s for 1019 adults and adolescents who had at least one depression diagnosis). Only 8.3% of episodes identified in our depression cohort had severity of illness information available in the EHR. For these episodes, considerable variation existed in both severity of illness (32.05% with no depression, 26.89% with minimal, 19.54% with mild, 12.04% with moderate, and 9.47% with severe depression) and suicidality (69.43% with a score of 0, 22.58% with a score of 1, 4.97% with a score of 2, and 3.02% with a score of 3 on item 9 of the PHQ-9). Patients with an EHR diagnosis of depression and a PHQ-9 (n = 1019) had similar severity but slightly higher suicidality levels compared with all patients for which PHQ-9 data were available. The PHQ-9 showed higher sensitivity for identifying depression response and emergent (after diagnosis) severity and suicidality; 25% to 30% of subjects had some degree of suicidal thought at some point in time according to the PHQ-9.

In a sample of 147 women outpatients with primary depression, subscale (HES) scores were bimodally distributed around the mean score of 7.38. High-HES patients had significantly elevated scores on measures of depressive symptomatology, generalized symptomatic distress, and social impairment relative to low-HES patients. Classifications based on HES scores significantly predicted RDC and DSM-III subtype diagnoses of endogenous and nonendogenous depression.

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 159 patients included in the cluster analysis who were ≥60 years and who underwent four-month follow-up. The first cluster contained 50 patients, the second cluster contained 74 patients, and the third cluster contained 35 patients. Clinical parameters were identified from electronic health records and patient questionnaires. Laboratory tests, anthropometric measurements, the number of chronic diseases, the number of prescribed medications were recorded. Frailty was determined using the five criteria of Fried's phenotype -model. Levels of anxiety and depression were recorded using the Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score assessed cognitive impairment. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of frailty and pre-frailty. RESULTS Three overlapping clusters of phenotypes predicted frailty, and included obesity (n=50), multimorbidity with mental impairment (n=74), and decline in renal function with cognitive impairment (n=35). The predictors of outcome included increasing age, number of chronic diseases, inflammation, anemia, anxiety, and cognitive impairment, and reduced muscle mass. CONCLUSIONS In patients ≥60 years in a primary healthcare setting, multimorbidity predictors of pre-frailty and frailty included a decline in cognitive function and renal function."}

Suggestions have been made to advance psychological understanding of negative symptoms by focusing on the social cognitive processes involved in symptom formation and maintenance.	Following the recommendations by the National Institute of Mental Health workshop on social cognition in schizophrenia, this study investigated associations between negative symptoms and various aspects of social cognition including Theory of Mind (ToM), attribution, empathy, self-esteem, and interpersonal self-concepts in 75 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 75 healthy controls.	Negative symptoms were significantly associated with difficulties in ToM, less readiness to be empathic, lower self-esteem, less self-serving bias, negative self-concepts related to interpersonal abilities, and dysfunctional acceptance beliefs. Different aspects of social cognition were mildly to moderately correlated and interacted in their impact on negative symptoms: Difficulties in ToM were associated with negative symptoms in persons with low but not in persons with medium or high levels of self-esteem. Taken together, the social cognition variables and their hypothesized interaction explained 39% of the variance in negative symptoms after controlling for neurocognition and depression.	The results highlight the relevance of self-concepts related to social abilities, dysfunctional beliefs, and global self-worth alone and in interaction with ToM deficits for negative symptoms and thereby provide a helpful basis for advancing psychosocial interventions."}

In the present study thirty participants with schizophrenia were compared with demographically matched controls on Virtual Week, a measure that closely represents the types of prospective memory tasks that actually occur in everyday life, and provides an opportunity to investigate the different sorts of prospective memory failures that occur. Participants with schizophrenia were significantly and comparably impaired on Virtual Week, irrespective of the specific prospective memory task demands. Importantly, after controlling for general cognitive functioning, executive functioning and retrospective memory, although the absolute magnitude of the deficit was reduced, significant impairment remained. These results suggest that individuals with schizophrenia experience generalized difficulties with prospective memory, and that whilst other cognitive deficits contribute to these difficulties, there is something unique to prospective remembering that is additionally disrupted in schizophrenia."}

These tumors, defined as G34R/V-mutant gliomas, are histologically heterogenous, with microscopic features of either HGG or embryonal tumors (primitve neuroectodermal tumor-like features). To assess the value of immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect G34R/V-mutated cases, we tested anti-histone G34V (clone 329E5) and anti-histone G34R (clone RM240) antibodies in a series of 28 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples. A total of 28 cases of hemispheric, IDH-wt HGG mainly affecting children and young adults were evaluated by IHC and by sequencing. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 17 years (0.1 to 26 y). By IHC, 10 of the 28 cases showed nuclear positivity for G34R and 3 of the 28 cases for G34V. Molecular analysis of G34R/V-mutation status was successful in 24 of the 28 cases. Mutation at glycine 34 of the H3F3A gene was identified in 9 of the 24 tumors (37%) by direct sequencing, revealing 7 of 9 positive case by sequencing and 2 of 9 false negative cases by IHC. Two of 15 negative case by sequencing demonstrated a false positivity by IHC. In total, in 4 (16.6%) of 24 cases, IHC and mutational results were discordant: 2 tumors were negative by IHC (false negative) but harbored G34R mutation by sequencing, and 2 cases were positive by IHC (false positive by IHC) but wild type by sequencing. Moreover, most mutated cases showed loss of ATRX expression and/or p53 expression. The positivity by IHC with specific antibody tested is not highly predictive for presence of G34R/V mutation, but confirmation by sequencing is mandatory; G34R/V mutations should be suspected in all hemispheric tumor IDH1/2 wild type, showing loss of OLIG2 and ATRX and/or p53 expression."}

With the structural and mechanistic elucidation of the BBB under both physiological and pathological conditions, it is now viable to target central nervous system (CNS) disorders utilizing the presence of transferrin (Tf) receptors (TfRs). However, overexpression of these TfRs on the GBM cell surface can also help to avoid restrictions of GBM cells to deliver chemotherapeutic agents within the tumor. Therefore, targeting of TfR-mediated delivery could counteract drug delivery issues in GBM and create a delivery system that could cross the BBB effectively to utilize ligand-conjugated drug complexes through receptor-mediated transcytosis.

Our understanding of molecular mechanisms ensuring iron homeostasis at both cellular and systemic levels has dramatically increased over the past 15 years. However, despite major advances in this field, homeostatic regulation of iron in the central nervous system (CNS) requires elucidation. It is unclear how iron moves in the CNS and how its transfer to the CNS across the blood-brain and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers, which separate the CNS from the systemic circulation, is regulated. Increasing evidence indicates the role of iron dysregulation in neuronal cell death observed in neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective cortical czynand spinal motor neuron dysfunction that results from a complex interplay among various pathogenic factors including oxidative stress. The latter is known to strongly affect cellular iron balance, creating a vicious circle to exacerbate oxidative injury. The role of iron in the pathogenesis of ALS is confirmed by therapeutic effects of iron chelation in ALS mouse models. These models are of great importance for deciphering molecular mechanisms of iron accumulation in neurons. Most of them consist of transgenic rodents overexpressing the mutated human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Mutations in the SOD1 gene constitute one of the most common genetic causes of the inherited form of ALS. However, it should be considered that overexpression of the SOD1 gene usually leads to increased SOD1 enzymatic activity, a condition which does not occur in human pathology and which may itself change the expression of iron metabolism genes."}

Cases were excluded if economic quality review found incomplete economic data.	The median and mean RVUs were within the range predicted by the model for all arms of one study and above the predicted range for the other study.	The model predicted resource use well for patients who completed treatment per protocol. Actual economic data can be collected for critical cost items. Some institutions experienced difficulty collecting retrospective data, and prospective collection of data is likely to allow wider participation in future Radiation Therapy Oncology Group economic studies."}

The delta increase was limited to frequencies 0.3-4 Hz; within this range, the effects on wave form periods and amplitudes differed by frequency band. These results illustrate the value of computer analysis applied to the physiological units of sleep (the successive non-REM and REM periods of each sleep cycle). The finding that all of the delta increase occurred in the first sleep cycle appears inconsistent with the exponential decline of delta across cycles predicted by 'recovery' models of sleep. The fact that wave periods and amplitudes are differentially affected by sleep loss indicates that it is premature to adopt any single wave form characteristic (e.g., power spectral density) to index delta sleep. Our data also confirm a recent report that eye movement density decreases after sleep loss; we hypothesize that this change results from greater depth of sleep; an inverse relation of depth of sleep to eye movement density provides a coherent explanation for a range of otherwise disparate observations. Lastly, we propose a new hypothesis to account for the presence of eye movement during REM sleep."}

Once bacteria have gained access to the central nervous system, their multiplication triggers a complex host response consisting of humoral and cellular immune mediators, reactive oxygen intermediates, matrix-metalloproteinases, and other host-derived factors. Alterations of the cerebral vasculature, with disruption of the blood brain barrier and global and focal ischemia, ultimately lead to functional and structural brain damage.

Outcomes showed that both EA preconditioning and regular intervention could relieve CI by reducing toxicity of excitatory amino acids (glutamate, aspartate) and TLR4/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascade reaction to relieve inflammatory injury. Moreover, EA preconditioning also could suppress the expression of pro-apoptosis genes and proteins to relieve apoptosis, regulate activation of microglia, and down-regulate the expression of blood brain barrier integrity-related matrix metalloprotein 9. Regular EA intervention also could promote angiogenesis to increase supply of blood and oxygen, facilitate regeneration, proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells via triggering activation of Notch and Shh signaling pathways, and promote the secretion of neurotrophin by up-regulating the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor /Trk A receptor, and promote expression of axon growth and synaptic remodeling-related factor (Ephrin B2/Eph B2) and sr-GTPase activating protein 1 and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42, axon growth and orientated down-stream molecules).

Carotid artery plaque (ultrasonography), insulin resistance and liver enzymes (prior to methotrexate (MTX) were determined in 77 consecutive patients with RA (43 with and 34 without MTX).	Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were associated with insulin resistance in univariate analysis (R = 0.54, p < 0.0001 and R = 0.36, p = 0.001, respectively) and after adjustment for age, gender and waist circumference (partial R = 0.43, p = 0.0001 and partial R = 0.37, p = 0.001, respectively).

In these low-resource settings, effective triage of patients with TBI-including the decision of whether or not to perform neurosurgery-is critical in optimizing patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. Machine learning may allow for effective predictions of patient outcomes both with and without surgery. Data from patients with TBI was collected prospectively at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, from 2016 to 2019. One linear and six non-linear machine learning models were designed to predict good versus poor outcome near hospital discharge and internally validated using nested five-fold cross-validation. The 13 predictors included clinical variables easily acquired on admission and whether or not the patient received surgery. Using an elastic-net regularized logistic regression model (GLMnet), with predictions calibrated using Platt scaling, the probability of poor outcome was calculated for each patient both with and without surgery (with the difference quantifying the 'individual treatment effect,' ITE). Relative ITE represents the percent reduction in chance of poor outcome, equaling this ITE divided by the probability of poor outcome with no surgery. Ultimately, 1766 patients were included. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) ranged from 83.1% (single C5.0 ruleset) to 88.5% (random forest), with the GLMnet at 87.5%. The two variables promoting good outcomes in the GLMnet model were high Glasgow Coma Scale score and receiving surgery. For the subgroup not receiving surgery, the median relative ITE was 42.9% (interquartile range [IQR], 32.7% to 53.5%); similarly, in those receiving surgery, it was 43.2% (IQR, 32.9% to 54.3%). We provide the first machine learning-based model to predict TBI outcomes with and without surgery in LMICs, thus enabling more effective surgical decision making in the resource-limited setting. Predicted ITE similarity between surgical and non-surgical groups suggests that, currently, patients are not being chosen optimally for neurosurgical intervention.

Early stress might be associated with these broad changes in functioning because it impairs general learning mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we examined whether individuals who experienced abusive caregiving in childhood had difficulties with instrumental learning and/or cognitive flexibility as adolescents. Fifty-three 14-17-year-old adolescents (31 exposed to high levels of childhood stress, 22 control) completed an fMRI task that required them to first learn associations in the environment and then update those pairings. Adolescents with histories of early life stress eventually learned to pair stimuli with both positive and negative outcomes, but did so more slowly than their peers. Furthermore, these stress-exposed adolescents showed markedly impaired cognitive flexibility; they were less able than their peers to update those pairings when the contingencies changed. These learning problems were reflected in abnormal activity in learning- and attention-related brain circuitry. Both altered patterns of learning and neural activation were associated with the severity of lifetime stress that the adolescents had experienced. Taken together, the results of this experiment suggest that basic learning processes are impaired in adolescents exposed to early life stress. These general learning mechanisms may help explain the emergence of social problems observed in these individuals."}

At early stages of AD-like pathology, in TgCRND8 mice, we found that combating Aβ pathology with scyllo-inositol ameliorated deficits in neurogenesis. Older TgCRND8 mice with established amyloid load had decreased progenitor cell proliferation and survival compared to non-transgenic mice, regardless of scyllo-inositol treatment. The prolonged exposure to Aβ-pathology leads to deficits in the neurogenic niche, thus targeting Aβ alone is insufficient to rescue neurogenesis. To support the neurogenic niche, we combined scyllo-inositol treatment with leteprinim potassium (neotrofin), the latter of which stimulates neurotrophin expression.

However, the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown since plasmatic cholesterol is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that cognitive impairments triggered by hypercholesterolemia during aging may be related to brain oxidative stress and altered brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. We also performed a neuropathological investigation in order to analyze whether the cognitive impairments may be associated with stroke-related features. To address these questions we used three- and fourteen-month-old low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (LDLr-/-). The current findings provide new evidence that aged LDLr-/- mice, exposed to over three-fold cholesterol levels from early life, show working, spatial reference, and procedural memory impairments, without alterations in motor function. Antioxidant imbalance and oxidative damage were evidenced by a marked increase in lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels) and glutathione metabolism (increase in glutathione levels, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase activities) together with a significant increase in the AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex of aged hypercholesterolemic LDLr-/- mice.

Clinicians may also question service users' ability to make considered decisions about their treatment when in crisis. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to investigate crisis treatment preferences of a sample of community-dwelling adults with borderline personality disorder.	Participants were 41 adults with borderline personality disorder who had created joint crisis plans during a randomized controlled trial. Data from all 41 joint crisis plans were analyzed iteratively via a thematic analysis framework.	Participants gave clear statements in their crisis plans relating to the desire to recover from the crisis and to improve their social functioning. Key themes included the desire to be treated with dignity and respect and to receive emotional and practical support from clinicians. Many participants spoke of the importance of connecting with others during periods of crisis, but several reported a clear desire to be left alone during a future crisis. Other themes concerned preferences for specific treatment refusals during crises, including particular types of psychotropic medication and involuntary treatment.	The variation of participants' preferences underscores the importance of developing individually tailored crisis plans for people with borderline personality disorder. The need to be treated with dignity and respect and to be given autonomy in decision making--also identified in global surveys of people with severe mental illness--is important to people with borderline personality disorder. Key messages for clinicians, service users, and policy makers, in addition to staff training issues, are discussed."}

Primary oligodendrocyte pro-genitor cells (OPCs) were separated from rats and differentiated to OLs. Immunofluorescent labeling showed positive expression of A2B5 in OPCs and Olig2 in OLs, suggesting the successful separation of OPCs and OLs. Three Fyn siRNAs (si-Fyn) and Fyn siRNA negative control (NC) were transfected into OLs. Western blot showed that among three si-Fyn groups, si-Fyn3 caused the lowest Fyn expression, so si-Fyn3 was chosen for following experiment. Cells were divided into four groups: Control, Model, NC and si-Fyn. In the Model group, cells were cultured in Mg-free extracellular fluid for 3 h. The morphology of control cells was normal. However, the migration of neurons, the aggregation of cell bodies and the 'grid-like' changes of neural networks were observed in the model cells. OLs apoptosis in various groups was assessed by flow cytometry. Expression of Fyn, ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in OLs of various groups was evaluated by western blot. Compared with the Control group, the apoptotic rates, the Fyn expression and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 ratio in the Model and NC groups increased significantly (p < .05). However, the apoptotic rate, the Fyn expression and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 ratio in the si-Fyn group were remarkably smaller than those in the Model group (p < .05). In conclusion, Fyn gene silencing reduced the apoptosis of OLs through inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in epileptic model."}

Additionally, IDE hydrolyzes Abeta, glucagon, IGF I and II, and beta-endorphin. We studied the expression of IDE protein in postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia and controls because: (1) the gene encoding IDE is located on chromosome 10q23-q25, a gene locus linked to schizophrenia; (2) insulin resistance with brain insulin receptor deficits/receptor dysfunction was reported in schizophrenia; (3) the enzyme cleaves IGF-I and IGF-II which are implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease; and (4) brain gamma-endorphin levels, liberated from beta-endorphin exclusively by IDE, have been reported to be altered in schizophrenia. We counted the number of IDE immunoreactive neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, and the basal nucleus of Meynert of 14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 matched control cases. Patients had long-term haloperidol treatment. In addition, relative concentrations of IDE protein in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were estimated by Western blot analysis. There was a significantly reduced number of IDE expressing neurons and IDE protein content in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia compared with controls, but not in other brain areas investigated. Results of our studies on the influence of haloperidol on IDE mRNA expression in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, as well as the effect of long-term treatment with haloperidol on the number of IDE immunoreactive neurons in rat brain, indicate that haloperidol per se, is not responsible for the decreased neuronal expression of the enzyme in schizophrenics. Haloperidol however, might exert some effect on IDE, through changes of the expression levels of its substrates IGF-I and II, insulin and beta-endorphin. Reduced cortical IDE expression might be part of the disturbed insulin signaling cascades found in schizophrenia. Furthermore, it might contribute to the altered metabolism of certain neuropeptides (IGF-I and IGF-II, beta-endorphin), in schizophrenia."}

In addition, depression has recently been added to the product labeling of Propecia (finasteride 1 mg). Finasteride reduces the levels of several neuroactive steroids linked to sexual function and depression. This study assesses depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts in former users of finasteride who developed persistent sexual side effects despite the discontinuation of finasteride.	In 2010-2011, former users of finasteride (n = 61) with persistent sexual side effects for ≥ 3 months were administered standardized interviews that gathered demographic information, medical and psychiatric histories, and information on medication use, sexual function, and alcohol consumption. All former users were otherwise healthy men with no baseline sexual dysfunction, chronic medical conditions, current or past psychiatric conditions, or use of oral prescription medications before or during finasteride use. A control group of men (n = 29), recruited from the community, had male pattern hair loss but had never used finasteride and denied any history of psychiatric conditions or use of psychiatric medications. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of depressive symptoms and the prevalence of suicidal thoughts as determined by the Beck depression inventory II (BDI-II); all subjects self-administered this questionnaire at the time of the interview or up to 10 months later.	Rates of depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥ 14) were significantly higher in the former finasteride users (75%; 46/61) as compared to the controls (10%; 3/29) (P < .0001). Moderate or severe depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥ 20) were present in 64% (39/61) of the finasteride group and 0% of the controls. Suicidal thoughts were present in 44% (27/61) of the former finasteride users and in 3% (1/29) of the controls (P < .0001).	Clinicians and potential users of finasteride should be aware of the potential risk of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts.

We examined the relationships between inflammation, oxidative stress and stroke severity in 75 acute stroke patients with and without IR. Serum levels of oxidative stress markers (nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH)) were measured as well as the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10).	The levels of IL-10 (13.7±19.11 vs 51.20±89.32 pg/ml, p<0.00) in IR group were significantly reduced.

Inflammation and oxidative stress are more evident in acute stoke patients with insulin resistance which may cause worse stroke severity. Our data also suggest that IL-10 as an antiinflammatory cytokine can be much lower in insulin resistance in acute phase of ischemic stroke.

The extent of the paradox has driven debate over the type of balance that should be struck between alcohol policies targeting a select group of high-risk drinkers versus more global approaches that target the population at-large. This paper examines the notion that most alcohol problems among 4 Hispanic national groups in the United States are attributable to moderate drinkers.	A general population survey employing a multistage cluster sample design, with face-to-face interviews in respondents' homes was conducted in 5 metropolitan areas of the United States. Study participants included a total of 2,773 current drinkers 18 years and older. Alcohol consumed in the past year (bottom 90% vs. top 10%), binge drinking (binge vs. no binge), and a 4-way grouping defined by volume and binge criteria were used. Alcohol-related harms included 14 social and dependence problems.	Drinkers at the bottom 90% of the distribution are responsible for 56 to 73% of all social problems, and for 55 to 73% of all dependence-related problems reported, depending on Hispanic national group. Binge drinkers are responsible for the majority of the social problems (53 to 75%) and dependence-related problems (59 to 73%), also depending on Hispanic national group. Binge drinkers at the bottom 90% of the distribution are responsible for a larger proportion of all social and dependence-related problems reported than those at the top 10% of the volume distribution. Cuban Americans are an exception.	The prevention paradox holds when using volume-based risk groupings and disappears when using a binge-drinking risk grouping. Binge drinkers who drink moderately on an average account for more harms than those who drink heavily across all groups, with exception of Cuban Americans."}

This requirement places a premium on spontaneous recovery and neuroplastic adaptation to rehabilitation by the lesioned hemisphere. Motor skill learning is frequently cited as a requirement for neuroplasticity. Studies examining the links between training, motor learning, neuroplasticity, and improvements in hand motor function are indicated.	This case study describes a patient with slow recovering hand and finger movement (Total Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer examination score = 25/66, Wrist and Hand items = 2/24 on poststroke day 37) following a stroke. The patient received an intensive eight-session intervention utilizing simulated activities that focused on the recovery of finger extension, finger individuation, and pinch-grasp force modulation.	Over the eight sessions, the patient demonstrated improvements on untrained transfer tasks, which suggest that motor learning had occurred, as well a dramatic increase in hand function and corresponding expansion of the cortical motor map area representing several key muscles of the paretic hand. Recovery of hand function and motor map expansion continued after discharge through the three-month retention testing.	This case study describes a neuroplasticity based intervention for UE hemiparesis and a model for examining the relationship between training, motor skill acquisition, neuroplasticity, and motor function changes. Implications for rehabilitation Intensive hand and finger rehabilitation activities can be added to an in-patient rehabilitation program for persons with subacute stroke. Targeted training of the thumb may have an impact on activity level function in persons with upper extremity hemiparesis. Untrained transfer tasks can be utilized to confirm that training tasks have elicited motor learning.

By use of an experimental protocol in which cycling of [3H]Ins is inhibited and resynthesis occurs with unlabelled Ins only, we were able to measure specifically the effects of TRH on the hydrolysis of the Ins lipids present before stimulation. A maximally effective dose of TRH (1 microM) caused a time-dependent decrease in 3H-labelled Ins lipids that attained a steady-state value of 42 +/- 1% of the initial level between 1.5 and 2 h. After 2 h, even though there was no further decrease in 3H-labelled Ins lipids, and no increase in [3H]Ins or [3H]Ins phosphates, turnover of Ins lipids, as assessed as incorporation of [32P]Pi into PtdIns, continued at a rate similar to that in cells incubated without LiCl or unlabelled Ins. These data indicate that Ins lipid turnover was not desensitized during prolonged TRH stimulation. Depletion of lipid 3H radioactivity by TRH occurred at higher TRH doses on addition of the competitive antagonist chlordiazepoxide. Addition of 1 microM-TRH after 3 h of stimulation by a sub-maximal (0.3 nM) TRH dose caused a further decrease in 3H radioactivity to the minimum level (40% of initial value).

Decline of this ability, as observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), results in an impaired sense of self and identity. In our model (AMAD: Autobiographical Memory in Alzheimer's Disease), we present a critical review of theories and findings regarding cognitive and neuroanatomical underpinnings of autobiographical memory and its decline in AD and highlight studies on its clinical rehabilitation. We propose that autobiographical recall in AD is mainly characterized by loss of associated episodic information, which leads to de-contextualization of autobiographical memories and a shift from reliving past events to a general sense of familiarity. This decline refers to retrograde, but also anterograde amnesia that affects newly acquired memories besides remote ones. One consequence of autobiographical memory decline in AD is decreased access to memories that shape self-consciousness, self-knowledge, and self-images, leading to a diminished sense of self and identity. The link between autobiographical decline and compromised sense of self in AD can also manifest itself as low correspondence and coherence between past memories and current goals and beliefs. By linking cognitive, neuroanatomical, and clinical aspects of autobiographical decline in AD, our review provides a theoretical foundation, which may lead to better rehabilitation strategies."}

Appropriate selection of donor and recipient nerves and surgical timing affect functional outcomes. Although the gold standard of nerve selection is intraoperative nerve stimulation, preoperative electrodiagnostic (EDX) evaluation may help guide surgical planning. Currently there is no standardized preoperative EDX protocol. This study reviews the EDX workup preceding PNT surgery in cervical SCI and proposes an informed EDX protocol to assist with surgical planning. The PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework was used to formulate relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and identify published cases of PNT in cervical SCI in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Emcare databases in the last 10 years. The EDX techniques evaluating putative donor nerves, recipient nerve branches, time sensitivity of nerve transfer and other electrophysiological parameters were summarized to guide creation of a preoperative EDX protocol. Needle electromyography (EMG) was the most commonly used EDX technique to identify healthy donor nerves. Although needle EMG has also been used on recipient nerves, compound muscle action potential amplitudes may provide a more accurate determination of recipient nerve health and time sensitivity for nerve transfer. Although there has been progress in presurgical EDX evaluation, EMG and nerve conduction study approaches are variable, and each has limitations in their utility for preoperative planning. There is need for standardization in the EDX evaluation preceding PNT surgery to assist with donor and recipient nerve selection, surgical timing and to optimize outcomes. Based on results of this review, herein we propose the PreSCIse (PRotocol for Electrodiagnosis in SCI Surgery of the upper Extremity) preoperative EDX panel to achieve said goals through an interdisciplinary and patient-centered approach."}

Relevant diagnostic considerations and consensus guidelines are discussed.	Articles examining the role of medications in the treatment of aggression in youth with pathological aggression were identified using PubMed and MEDLINE® databases over the past 15 years (2000-2015); selected articles published prior to 2000 and deemed to be of high relevance were searched and also included. Search terms included: Aggression, aggressive, disruptive behavior, conduct, youth, children, and adolescents. Cited references were also searched for relevant articles.	There are a number of evidence-based medication treatments for aggression, which are generally best considered in the context of differential diagnosis and ongoing evidence-based psychosocial interventions. Impulsive aggression is generally considered the type of aggression most amenable to medication, but other aggression subtypes may also possibly respond to treatment. Medication classes with positive evidence include the psychostimulants and α-2 agonists (in the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and/or disruptive behavior disorders), mood stabilizing agents, and atypical antipsychotics. Published guidelines recommend systematic and adequate trials of medications in sequential order, to optimize response and minimize polypharmacy. Guidelines for safety monitoring are available for many of the medications used for aggression in youth, and are also discussed.	Aggression in children carries a high risk of poor outcomes, and, therefore, a better understanding of treatment options is a high priority. The available literature points to the importance of identifying the underlying disorder, when possible, and using this information to guide treatment selection.

The upregulation of the SAP97 transcripts in the adult neocortex after the acute PCP injection was mimicked by another NMDA antagonist, dizocilpine, but not by the indirect dopamine agonists, methamphetamine and cocaine, a selective D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390, a D2 receptor-preferring antagonist haloperidol and a GABAergic anesthetic pentobarbital. Moreover, the pretreatment with a typical antipsychotic haloperidol failed to antagonize the increased neocortical SAP97 gene expression by PCP.

The present study investigated whether optimism can be increased by imagining a best possible self (BPS). Effects were compared to a control group in which participants imagined their daily activities (DA).	In order to minimize inter-individual differences in content of imagery, participants constructed their BPS according to 3 domains, namely a personal, relational, and professional domain. All participants were instructed to practice their imagery exercise for 5 min per day over a period of two weeks. Effects on optimism and mood were measured after one session, after one week and after two weeks.	Results indicated that BPS imagery led to significantly larger increases in optimism as compared to DA imagery, after one session and over a two week period. Effects on optimism remained after controlling for possible mediation by the change in positive mood.	In order to test the effectiveness of our BPS imagery intervention we relied exclusively on self-report measures.	The present study confirmed that imagining a BPS enhances levels of optimism, independent of the mood effect."}

Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of these epidemiological studies and possible neuroimmunological mechanisms.	Initial concerns of a 13-fold increased relative risk of narcolepsy were raised by the Scandinavian health protection agencies in 2010. Subsequent retrospective studies support these findings in Canada, France, Ireland, England and Denmark. The cases are predominantly young children who present with severe and rapid onset of cataplexy as well as narcolepsy often within a few weeks of vaccination. The proposed mechanism for postvaccination narcolepsy is one in which an environmental trigger causes or enhances an antibody-mediated autoimmune response in patients with a preexisting genetic susceptibility. However, there have not yet been any reports of specific autoimmunity, either antibody or T-cell-mediated.	There is a strong association between narcolepsy and H1N1 vaccination. However, whether this reflects a true increase in affected individuals or a hastening of disease onset in individuals who would otherwise have developed narcolepsy later will become clear in the coming years. The pathological explanation of this association and narcolepsy is likely to be autoimmune, although supportive evidence is lacking.Video abstract available: See the Video Supplementary Digital Content 1 (http://links.lww.com/COPM/A9)."}

In this study, we investigated the pathophysiology of this HDL deficiency by examining both HDL samples from NPD-B patients and nascent high density lipoprotein (LpA-I) generated by incubation of lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) with NPD-B fibroblasts. Interestingly, both LpA-I and HDL isolated from patient plasma had a significant increase in sphingomyelin (SM) mass (approximately 50-100%). Analysis of LCAT kinetics parameters (V(max) and K(m)) revealed that either LpA-I or plasma HDL from NPD-B, as well as reconstituted HDL enriched with SM, exhibited severely decreased LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification. Importantly, we documented that SM enrichment of NPD-B LpA-I was not attributable to increased cellular mass transfer of SM or unesterified cholesterol to lipid-free apoA-I. Finally, we obtained evidence that the conditioned medium from HUVEC, THP-1, and normal fibroblasts, but not NPD-B fibroblasts, contained active secretory sphingomyelinase (S-SMase) that mediated the hydrolysis of [(3)H]SM-labeled LpA-I and HDL(3). Furthermore, expression of mutant SMase (DeltaR608) in CHO cells revealed that DeltaR608 was synthesized normally but had defective secretion and activity. Our data suggest that defective S-SMase in NPD leads to SM enrichment of HDL that impairs LCAT-mediated nascent HDL maturation and contributes to HDL deficiency. Thus, S-SMase and LCAT may act in concert and play a crucial role in the biogenesis and maturation of nascent HDL particles."}

Consecutively referred children and adolescents to a pediatric psychopharmacology program were assessed with structured diagnostic interview and measures of psychosocial functioning. Comparisons were made between those youth satisfying diagnostic criteria for ASD and age and sex matched youth without ASD referred to the same clinical program. 9.3% (217/2323) of the referred youth (age range: 3-17 years) met DSM-III-R criteria for ASD. ASD youth suffered from significantly higher number of comorbid disorders than comparisons (6.4 ± 2.7 vs. 5.2 ± 2.9; p < 0.001). Ninety-five percent of the youth with ASD had three or more comorbid psychiatric disorders and 74% had five or more comorbid disorders. ASD youth were also more functionally impaired and required extra-assistance in school and therapeutic interventions at higher rates than age and sex matched non-ASD referred youth.

The anticonvulsant potencies of diazepam and clobazam are similar against both types of beta-carboline-induced seizures, whereas quazepam protects better against beta-CCM seizures (4 fold elevation in ED50 value at 1 mg/kg quazepam IP) than against DMCM seizures (1.7 fold elevation in ED50 value), supporting a preferential action of beta-CCM on BZ1 receptors.

We summarize emerging literature on functional neuroimaging biomarkers of resilience in MDD and discuss their clinical relevance and implications for future research.	Resilience in MDD is characterized by dissociable profiles of activation and functional connectivity within brain networks involved in cognitive control, emotion regulation, and reward processing. Increased activation of frontal cortical brain regions implicated in cognitive appraisal and emotion regulation is a common characteristic of resilient individuals at high risk for MDD and of individuals with MDD with a favorable illness course. Furthermore, significant associations between fronto-striato-limbic functional connectivity and both positively interpreted stressful life events in resilient high-risk individuals and a favorable response to first-line treatments in depressed individuals suggest that neuro-compensatory changes and experience-dependent plasticity underlie resilience in MDD.

However, she stopped her medical treatment one month ago and then polydipsia and general fatigue were manifested. She was admitted to a hospital five days ago at which time hyperglycemia (405 mg/dl) and anemia (Hb8.0g/dl) were detected. She was transferred to our hospital for control of blood glucose and further examination of bitemporal hemianopsia. She showed typical acromegalic features including enlargement of the nose, lips and tongue, increased heel pad and acral growth. Conscious disturbance was cured by the infusion of saline and the administration of insulin. Endoscopy revealed an active gastric ulcer (A1). Endocrine data disclosed increased GH levels in plasma and urine, whereas plasma IGF-1 levels were low. Plasma GH paradoxically increased following the administration of TRH. A water deprivation test showed an impaired increase in urinary osmolarity, indicating partial central diabetes insipidus (DI). MRI with Gd-contrast revealed a macroadenoma which progressed toward suprasella. She was diagnosed as having acromegaly, partial DI and probable hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic diabetic pre-coma. Polyuria (5-101/day) due to partial DI was controlled by the administration of DDAVP (10 micrograms/day). The constant subcutaneous administration of octreotide (240 micrograms/day) resulted in normal plasma GH levels and a marked shrinkage of the pituitary tumor. The pituitary tumor was finally removed by the transsphenoidal approach following treatment with octreotide for 4 months.

The assumption that such focal lesions invariably predict the site of seizure origin may not be correct, however. We report a series of 20 adults with medically intractable partial epilepsy, where high-resolution brain MRI disclosed a unilateral, focal, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion as the only abnormality in each case; nevertheless, based on electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, ictal onsets arose from a completely different location than that of the MRI lesion. All patients underwent epilepsy surgery, with the operations based on ictal EEG findings, and all were followed at least 2 years after the resection. After the most recent follow-up examination, 50% (10/20) of the patients were completely seizure-free, 35% (7/20) had at least a 75% reduction in the number of seizures, and 15% (3/20) had less than a 75% reduction in the number of seizures. We conclude that the identification of a focal, structural, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion on brain MRI is not always indicative of the site of seizure origin in partial epilepsy.

Treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial learning by limiting the increase in swim distance due to ischemia. In addition, LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial memory as demonstrated by minimizing the ischemia-induced reduction in time spent in the quadrant of the former platform position during the probe trial. Staurosporine had no influence on the ischemia-induced behavioural changes. Histological examination revealed neuronal damage in the hippocampus and in the striatum in all of the ischemic rats. However, treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the hippocampal damage. Correlation analysis demonstrated a correlation between hippocampal damage and total swim distance (r = 0.88, P < 0.001). No correlation was found between hippocampal damage and quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.24, p > 0.1). No correlation was observed between striatal damage and either total swim distance of the escape trials (r = 0.28. p > 0.1) or quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.08, p > 0.6). It is concluded that a correlation exists between hippocampal damage and the deficit in spatial learning following global cerebral ischemia."}

The primary outcome question concerned SE resolution after BRV initiation.	During that period, BRV was started with eleven adult patients with SE. Five of these were female, and the median age was 64 (interquartile range [IQR] 21years). The median SE duration before BRV initiation was 5days (IQR 9days); the median number of previous anticonvulsants used was 4 (IQR 5). Initial BRV doses ranged between 50mg and 400mg (median 100mg), titrated to a daily dose of 100 to 400mg (median 200mg). There was a cessation of SE in the first 24h of BRV in three patients (27%). While taking BRV, no serious side effects were seen.	Based on these cases and previous data from animal experiments, BRV may prove useful in SE treatment, and trials would be warranted to examine BRV's efficacy in treating SE and how this efficacy might be influenced by co-administration with levetiracetam."}

This may involve detecting structural and functional cerebral changes such as changes in the degree of asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres. Changes can be detected by computational algorithms and used for the early diagnosis of dementia and its stages (amnestic early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), Alzheimer's Disease (AD)), and can help to monitor the progress of the disease. In this vein, the paper proposes a data processing pipeline that can be implemented on commodity hardware. It uses features of brain asymmetries, extracted from MRI of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, for the analysis of structural changes, and machine learning classification of the pathology. The experiments provide promising results, distinguishing between subjects with normal cognition (NC) and patients with early or progressive dementia. Supervised machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks tested are reaching an accuracy of 92.5% and 75.0% for NC vs. EMCI, and 93.0% and 90.5% for NC vs. AD, respectively. The proposed pipeline offers a promising low-cost alternative for the classification of dementia and can be potentially useful to other brain degenerative disorders that are accompanied by changes in the brain asymmetries."}

Male cocaine abusers were employed more frequently than women and held higher status jobs despite equivalent levels of education. Female cocaine abusers were more likely to be diagnosed with concurrent psychiatric disorders and were more likely to report family histories of substance abuse.

SAH and cerebral lymphatic blockage (CLB) models in adult New Zealand rabbits were used. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from experimental animals 5 d after modeling and was added into cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The neurons were randomly divided into blank control, normal CSF, SAH, and SAH+CLB groups. At different points of time, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was detected by colorimetric method. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of neurons. Expressions of Bax and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) were determined by immunohistochemical staining. LDH leakage detection revealed that, compared with blank control group, CSF from normal rabbit did not damage the neurons, whereas the leakage of LDH increased in SAH group and SAH+CLB group. The increasing effect was more obvious in SAH+CLB group than that in SAH group. Normal CSF did not induce the apoptosis of neurons, whereas neuron apoptosis was found in SAH group and the apoptosis was even more severe in SAH+CLB group. Bax and Hsp70 protein expressions were found in both SAH and SAH+CLB groups. Expression of Bax protein in SAH+CLB group was stronger than that in SAH group in a time-dependent manner. At 0.5 h and 1 h, the expression of Hsp70 protein in SAH+CLB group was stronger than that in SAH group, whereas the expression became weaker at 2 h and 4 h. These results suggest that blockage of cerebral lymphatic drainage pathway deteriorates the damage of neurons treated with CSF from SAH, indicating this pathway may act as an endogenous protective role in SAH."}

While genetic factors are important in the etiology of most mental disorders, the relatively high rates of discordance among identical twins, particularly for depression and other stress-related syndromes, clearly indicate the importance of additional mechanisms. Environmental factors such as stress are known to play a role in the onset of these illnesses. Exposure to such environmental insults induces stable changes in gene expression, neural circuit function, and ultimately behavior, and these maladaptations appear distinct between developmental versus adult exposures. Increasing evidence indicates that these sustained abnormalities are maintained by epigenetic modifications in specific brain regions. Indeed, transcriptional dysregulation and the aberrant epigenetic regulation that underlies this dysregulation is a unifying theme in psychiatric disorders. Here, we provide a progress report of epigenetic studies of the three major psychiatric syndromes, depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We review the literature derived from animal models of these disorders as well as from studies of postmortem brain tissue from human patients. While epigenetic studies of mental illness remain at early stages, understanding how environmental factors recruit the epigenetic machinery within specific brain regions to cause lasting changes in disease susceptibility and pathophysiology is revealing new insight into the etiology and treatment of these conditions."}

Twenty-five individuals with idiopathic PD participated either in a land-based (LB) or in a LB plus water-based (LWB) exercise program for 16 weeks. The efficacy of both exercise programs was quantified by means of a biomechanical gait analysis from which spatiotemporal and sagittal plane kinetic (gait speed, stride length, cadence, stride time, simple support time, double support time) and kinematic (angles of the hip, knee, and ankle joints) variables were recorded. Once the intervention ended, significant changes were observed in stride length and single/double support time variables in all the patients. The intergroup analysis revealed the existence of significant differences only in the gait Speed and hip Angle parameters. Few significant improvements in the amplitude of lower limb joints were found. These results suggest that land-based and land-plus-water-based exercise programs can be considered as a useful physical rehabilitation alternative, both equally capable of improving gait impairment on Parkinson's disease."}

In this study, we examined the gene expression profile in neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) with or without HUCB treatment and identified signaling pathways (Akt/MAPK) important in eliciting HUCB-mediated neuroprotective responses. Gene chip microarray analysis was performed using RNA samples extracted from the neuronal cell cultures from four experimental groups: normoxia, normoxia+HUCB, OGD, and OGD+HUCB. Both quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were carried out to verify the microarray results. Using the Genomatix software program, promoter regions of selected genes were compared to reveal common transcription factor-binding sites and, subsequently, signal transduction pathways. Under OGD condition, HUCB cells significantly reduced neuronal loss from 68% to 44% [one-way ANOVA, F(3, 16)=11, p=0.0003]. Microarray analysis identified mRNA expression of Prdx5, Vcam1, CCL20, Alcam, and Pax6 as being significantly altered by HUCB cell treatment. Inhibition of the Akt pathway significantly abolished the neuroprotective effect of HUCB cells [one-way ANOVA, F(3, 11)=8.663, p=0.0031].

Options to avoid prolonged dying are limited since advanced dementia patients cannot qualify for Medical Aid in Dying. Physicians and judges can insist on clear and convincing evidence that the patient wants to die-which many advance directives cannot provide. Proxies/agents' substituted judgment may not be concordant with patients' requests. While advance directives can be patients' last resort to attain a peaceful and timely dying consistent with their lifelong values, success depends on their being effective and acceptable. A single flaw can provide opponents justification to refuse the directive's requests to cease assisted feeding.	This article considers 24 common advance directive flaws in four categories. Process flaws focus on how patients express their end-of-life wishes. Content flaws reflect drafters' selection of conditions and interventions, and how they are described. Inherent flaws can make advance directives unacceptable to authorities concerned about premature dying. Strategies are needed to compel physicians to write needed orders and to prevent third parties from sabotaging these orders after they are  implemented. The article includes excerpts from 'dementia-specific' directives or supplements that exemplify each flaw-mostly from the US and Europe. No directive critiqued here included an effective strategy to resolve this long-debated bioethical conflict: the past directive requests 'Cease assisted feeding' but the incapacitated patient apparently expresses the desire to 'Continue assisted feeding.' Some opponents to the controversial request, cease assisted feeding, use this conflict as a conceptual wedge to practice hard paternalism. This article proposes a protocol to prevent this conflict from emerging. These strategies may prevent authorities from requiring patients to fulfill authorities' additional clinical criteria as a prerequisite to honor the requests in patients directives.	This critique of flaws may serve as a guide to drafting and to selecting effective and acceptable advance directives for dementia. It also poses several bioethical and clinical questions to those in authority: Does your paternalistic refusal to honor patients' wishes respect their self-determination?

Growing evidence suggests a role for voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) regulation in mediating a range of chronic drug effects from drug withdrawal phenomena to dependence on a variety of drugs of abuse. High voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents were measured in whole-cell recordings from acutely isolated hippocampal CA1 neurons after a 1-week flurazepam (FZP) treatment that results in withdrawal-anxiety. An approximately 1.8-fold increase in Ca(2+) current density was detected immediately after and up to 2 days but not 3 or 4 days after drug withdrawal. Current density was unchanged after acute desalkyl-FZP treatment. A significant negative shift of the half-maximal potential of activation of HVA currents was also observed but steady-state inactivation remained unchanged. FZP and diazepam showed use- and concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca(2+) currents in hippocampal cultured cells following depolarizing trains (FZP, IC(50) = 1.8 microM; diazepam, IC(50) = 36 microM), pointing to an additional mechanism by which benzodiazepines modulate HVA Ca(2+) channels. Systemic preinjection of nimodipine (10 mg/kg), an L-type (L)-VGCC antagonist, prevented the benzodiazepine-induced increase in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxasole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current in CA1 neurons 2 days after FZP withdrawal, suggesting that AMPAR potentiation, previously linked to withdrawal-anxiety may require enhanced L-VGCC-mediated Ca(2+) influx. Taken together with prior work, these findings suggest that enhanced Ca(2+) entry through HVA Ca(2+) channels may contribute to hippocampal AMPAR plasticity and serve as a potential mechanism underlying benzodiazepine physical dependence."}

Supplementum^\nChildhood acute bacterial meningitis in the Sudan: an epidemiological, clinical and laboratory study.^\nThe aims of the present study were to document the epidemiology, clinical features and complications of childhood acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) in The Sudan during both an inter-epidemic (endemic) period (1985-1986), and the 1988 serogroup A epidemic; and to examine the phenotypic and genetic similarities and differences of Neisseria meningitidis strains isolated in The Sudan and Sweden. A new enzyme immunoassay test (Pharmacia Meningitis EIA-Test) was evaluated as a potential rapid diagnostic method for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae (HI) type b, Neisseria meningitidis (MC) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNC). The test was found to have good sensitivity (0.86) and specificity (0.95) in the inter-epidemic period; and to be adaptable to the field work in The Sudan during the 1988 MC epidemic. During inter-epidemic (endemic) situations in The Sudan, greater than 90% of childhood ABM was caused by one of the three organisms, HI type b, MC and PNC. HI accounted for 57% of the cases. The peak incidence (76%) of HI cases was in infants (less than 12 months) similar to the situation in other African countries. The overall case fatality ratio was 18.6%. Prospective follow-up of survivors for 3-4 years revealed that an additional 43% either died or had permanent neurological complications, the most prevalent and persistent of which was sensorineural hearing loss recorded in 22% of long term survivors. Post-meningitic children were found to have significantly lower intelligence quotients (92.3 +/- 13.9) than their sibling controls (100.7 +/- 10.2, P = 0.029). Features of the large serogroup A sulphonamide resistant MC epidemic (February-August 1988) in Khartoum are described. An estimated annual incidence of 1,679/100,000 was recorded at the peak of the epidemic. The highest attack rate was in young children less than 5 years, as in many other African countries; nevertheless, a high morbidity was observed in adults (31% of the cases greater than or equal to 20 years). The clinical features, mortality (6.3%) and short term sequelae in Sudanese children were generally within the framework described for MC disease elsewhere. Detailed analysis of MC isolates from Sudan and Sweden by characterizing their electrophoretic enzyme types, DNA restriction endonuclease pattern and outer membrane proteins, revealed that serogroup A MC clone III-1 was responsible of The Sudan epidemic in 1988 and has been the dominant serogroup A organism in Sweden since 1973. The Sudanese strains isolated prior to the epidemic (1985) were clone IV-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

In the past decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to biomarker discovery for early diagnosis and treatment of AD. Herein, this study aims to quantify clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in blood samples from AD patients and evaluate these two proteins as potential biomarkers in AD diagnosis. In-house synthesized 5-plex isotopic N,N-dimethyl leucine (iDiLeu) tags were used to label target peptide standards at different concentrations to construct standard curves. Our study revealed that the levels of CLU and APOE exhibited clear differences in male vs. female AD groups but not in male vs. female non-AD groups. In contrast, the levels of serum CLU and APOE did not show statistically significant differences in the AD groups and non-AD groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) with CLU and APOE showed some separation between the AD and non-AD participants. Significance: Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for sex-related pathways, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: As blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis are cost-effective and introduce less invasiveness, discovery and validation of biomarkers in the blood samples of AD patients have become a hot topic in Alzheimer's and dementia research. Thus far, amyloid β (Aβ), total-tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in blood show great accuracy and specificity in diagnosis of AD. However, the underlying mechanism of AD pathology remains to be elusive and complex. Besides these well studied proteins, many other proteins, such as clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) have also been found to be related to AD development. It has been implicated that these two proteins are involved in Aβ clearance and deposition. In this study, we measure the absolute concentrations of these two proteins in blood and shed some light on the potential roles of CLU and APOE in AD pathology. Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for specific pathways between different genders, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD."}

Using the database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service from 2002 to 2015, we examined 76,043 subjects (≥60 years old) free of PD, dementia, and stroke at baseline. The dose of statin use was classified into the following four 6-month categories (<180, 180-365, 365-540, and ≥540 days) for each 2-year interval. The incidence of PD was identified by the prescription records for any anti-PD medication with a diagnosis of PD.	During 10 years of follow-up, 1,427 PD cases occurred. Statin 'ever use' was significantly associated with a high risk of PD incidence (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.28; 95% confidence interval = 1.12-1.46) when compared with statin nonuse. In terms of a dose-response relationship, although a duration of statin use <365 days was associated with a higher risk of PD, the duration of statin use ≥365 days was not significantly associated with an increased risk of PD.	Statin use was associated with an elevated PD risk of PD, but long-term and adherent statin use was not significantly associated with elevated PD risk. However, there was no evidence of benefit with any statin treatment related to PD risk. Our study suggests that there is a complex relationship among cholesterol level, statin use, and PD risk that warrants further studies. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."}

Accuracy and rate of pecking for grain declined while food intake remained unchanged. Methylmercury produced permanent changes in posture and in motor coordination. The regional distribution of methylmercury within the nervous system was poorly correlated with the distribution of pathologic changes. Overt behavioral signs appeared after the brain accumulated more than about 12 to 16 ppm Hg. Data with pigeons support earlier evidence that the dose-response function for methylmercury is modulated by dose rate and duration of exposure, since the pattern of blood and tissue distribution of Hg is established in advance of the appearance of signs.

This article describes a research collaborative of health service researchers, systems engineers, and clinicians seeking to improve processes for safer chronic opioid therapy management in an academic primary care center. We present implementation results and lessons learned along with an intervention toolkit that others may consider using within their organization.	Using iterative improvement lifecycles and systems engineering principles, we developed a risk-based workflow model for patients on chronic opioids. Two key safe opioid use process metrics-percent of patients with recent opioid treatment agreements and urine drug tests-were identified, and processes to improve these measures were designed, tested, and implemented. Focus groups were conducted after the conclusion of implementation, with barriers and lessons learned identified via thematic analysis.	Initial surveys revealed a lack of knowledge regarding resources available to patients and prescribers in the primary care clinic. In addition, 18 clinicians (69%) reported largely 'inheriting' (rather than initiating) their chronic opioid therapy patients. We tracked 68 patients over a 4-year period. Although process measures improved, full adherence was not achieved for the entire population. Barriers included team structure, the evolving opioid environment, and surveillance challenges, along with disruptions resulting from the 2019 novel coronavirus.	Safe primary care opioid prescribing requires ongoing monitoring and management in a complex environment. The application of a risk-based approach is possible but requires adaptability and redundancies to be reliable."}

Patients' views have seldom been considered in the construction of measures addressing satisfaction with inpatient facilities in psychiatry. The Views on Inpatient Care - VOICE - is a first service-user generated outcome measure relying solely on their perceptions of acute care, representing a valuable indicator of service users' perceived quality of care. The present study aimed to contribute to the validation of the Portuguese version of VOICE.	The questionnaire was translated into Portuguese and applied to a sample of eighty-five female inpatients of a psychiatric institution. Data analysis focused on assessing reliability and exploring the impact of demographic and clinical variables on participants' satisfaction.	Internal consistency of the questionnaire was high (α = 0.87). Participants' age and marital status were associated with differences in scores, with older patients and patients who were married or involved in a close relationship presenting higher satisfaction levels.	The questionnaire demonstrated good internal consistency and acceptability, as well as construct validity. Further studies should expand the analysis of the psychometric properties of this measure e.g., test-retest reliability.	The Portuguese version of VOICE is a promising tool to assess service users' perceptions of inpatient psychiatric care in Portugal.

Fifty-five individuals with AS (aged < 5 years: n = 16, 5-12 years: n = 27, ≥ 18 years: n = 12; deletion genotype: n = 40, nondeletion genotype: n = 15) and 20 typically developing children (aged 1-12 years) were enrolled across six USA sites.

The participants achieved high completion rates for the clinical outcome assessments (adherence: 89-100% [Clinic Visit 1]; 76-91% [Clinic Visit 2]) and varied feasibility of and adherence to digital health technologies. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted participants' uptake of and/or adherence to some measures.

Participants achieved Bayley-III results comparable to the available natural history data, showing similar scores between individuals aged ≥ 18 and 5-12 years. Also, participants without a deletion generally scored higher on most clinical outcome assessments than participants with a deletion. Furthermore, the observed AS EEG phenotype of excess delta-band power was consistent with prior reports.	Although feasible clinical outcome assessments and digital health technologies are reported herein, further improved assessments of meaningful AS change are needed. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, remote assessments facilitated high adherence levels and the results suggested that at-home PSG/EEG might be a feasible alternative to the in-clinic EEG assessments.
