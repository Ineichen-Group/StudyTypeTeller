Although they can be grouped together for producing hormones and/or subunits that are glycoproteins, these tumors originate from distinctive cell types (gonadotrophes and thyrotrophes) that are only remotely related. Gonadotroph cell adenomas are among the commonest types of pituitary adenomas, corresponding to the majority of the so-called 'nonfunctioning' or clinically silent adenomas, while thyrotroph cell adenomas are extremely rare and usually present with hyperthyroidism due to inappropriate TSH secretion. In this article, we review the literature covering epidemiological, pathological, pathogenetic, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of gonadotroph and thyrotroph cell adenomas. Greater emphasis was given to the growing field of molecular pathogenesis of pituitary tumors in general, and a special effort was made to contrast molecular alterations found in these tumors with other tumor types. On the practical side, the authors extensive experience for more than two decades in the diagnosis and management of these tumors at the Neuroendocrine Unit (Endocrinology Division, Unifesp) was used to balance the extensive literature on this subject.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
2,23040741,Neurosurgery clinics of North America,Imaging the pituitary and parasellar region.,"Magnetic resonance imaging is the fundamental imaging tool for the evaluation of tumors and other lesions of the pituitary gland and infundibulum. Abnormalities may arise within the pituitary itself, from vestigial embryologic remnants, or from surrounding tissues. Correct diagnosis rests on accurate assessment of lesion location, imaging appearance, and clinical presentation. This article reviews the radiologic evaluation of lesions within the sella and suprasellar cistern, focusing on common masses and pseudomasses of the pituitary and sellar region that neurosurgeons are most likely to encounter in clinical practice.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
3,21714358,Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences,The efficacy of psychotherapy in reducing post-psychotic trauma.,"There is now growing evidence to suggest that the experience of psychosis may be so traumatic for some that it can lead to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)-type symptoms or post-psychotic trauma symptoms (PPTS). There is, however, less knowledge about what psychological interventions may be helpful in reducing these symptoms. Evidence from the literature, to date, suggests that of the seven studies that have addressed this issue only four were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, all these studies included less than 100 patients with the vast majority reporting positive results. Overall, it seems that although cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT)-based psychological interventions appear to be efficacious in the treatment of PPTS, the studies are too small to draw any firm conclusions and should be subjected to larger good-quality RCTs. Further research will also need to establish the role of mediating variables such as shame and depression in the treatment of PPTS.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
4,9193127,Behaviour research and therapy,Diagnosing DSM-IV--Part I: DSM-IV and the concept of disorder.,"In this first article in a two-article series, I diagnose' a problem with DSM-IV, specifically, the overinclusiveness of its diagnostic criteria. Using the harmful dysfunction analysis of the concept of disorder (Wakefield, 1992a, American Psychologist, 47, 373-388) as a framework, I argue that DSM-IV criteria for many diagnostic categories fail to satisfy the analysis' dysfunction' requirement, that is, the criteria do not distinguish harmful conditions due to internal dysfunctions from harmful conditions that are nondisordered 'problems in living'. The overinclusiveness problem, I suggest, can be partly dealt with by giving up purely symptomatic criteria and contextualizing diagnosis to take into account the relationship between triggering causes and resulting symptoms. In Part II (Wakefield, 1997, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 35, 651-665, I examine Eysenck's (1986, Contemporary directions in psychopathology: Toward the DSM-IV) proposal for a dimensional diagnostic system to supplant DSM-IV.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

How mothers express their experiences is poorly explored in the literature. This study aims to better understand mothers' description of their unique experiences in order to better inform interventions. Using a narrative inquiry approach, mothers convey unique stressors related to two central themes (role fulfillment and role support) during a journal writing intervention. Studying mothers' own words as they attempted to make sense of their experiences aligns with the foundational principles of narrative medicine: People make sense of their experiences through storytelling. Knowledge gained from this research underscores the importance of centering a mother's voice in order to create effective interventions.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
6,29802210,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",Neuroprotection via AT2 receptor agonists in ischemic stroke.,"Stroke is a devastating disease that afflicts millions of people each year worldwide. Ischemic stroke, which accounts for ~88% of cases, occurs when blood supply to the brain is decreased, often because of thromboembolism or atherosclerotic occlusion. This deprives the brain of oxygen and nutrients, causing immediate, irreversible necrosis within the core of the ischemic area, but more delayed and potentially reversible neuronal damage in the surrounding brain tissue, the penumbra. The only currently approved therapies for ischemic stroke, the thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and the endovascular clot retrieval/destruction processes, are aimed at restoring blood flow to the infarcted area, but are only available for a minority of patients and are not able in most cases to completely restore neurological deficits. Consequently, there remains a need for agents that will protect neurones against death following ischemic stroke. Here, we evaluate angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 (AT2) receptor agonists as a possible therapeutic target for this disease. We first provide an overview of stroke epidemiology, pathophysiology, and currently approved therapies. We next review the large amount of preclinical evidence, accumulated over the past decade and a half, which indicates that AT2 receptor agonists exert significant neuroprotective effects in various animal models, and discuss the potential mechanisms involved. Finally, after discussing the challenges of delivering blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeable AT2 receptor agonists to the infarcted areas of the brain, we summarize the evidence for and against the development of these agents as a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
7,27781424,Clinical neuropathology,Update on the integrated histopathological and genetic classification of medulloblastoma - a practical diagnostic guideline.,"The revised WHO classification of tumors of the CNS 2016 has introduced the concept of the integrated diagnosis. The definition of medulloblastoma entities now requires a combination of the traditional histological information with additional molecular/genetic features. For definition of the histopathological component of the medulloblastoma diagnosis, the tumors should be assigned to one of the four entities classic, desmoplastic/nodular (DNMB), extensive nodular (MBEN), or large cell/anaplastic (LC/A) medulloblastoma. The genetically defined component comprises the four entities WNT-activated, SHH-activated and TP53 wildtype, SHH-activated and TP53 mutant, or non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastoma. Robust and validated methods are available to allow a precise diagnosis of these medulloblastoma entities according to the updated WHO classification, and for differential diagnostic purposes. A combination of immunohistochemical markers including β-catenin, Yap1, p75-NGFR, Otx2, and p53, in combination with targeted sequencing and copy number assessment such as FISH analysis for MYC genes allows a precise assignment of patients for risk-adapted stratification. It also allows comparison to results of study cohorts in the past and provides a robust basis for further treatment refinement. .",Non-systematic-review,1,0
8,24737903,Postgraduate medical journal,Republished: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides: is it time to split up the group?,"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of diseases corresponding to necrotising inflammation of small vessels with a wide range of clinical presentations. At least two of the diseases are believed to exhibit a common ground of pathophysiological mechanisms. These are granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). ANCA directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) are preferentially associated with GPA, and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA are associated mainly with MPA and eosinophilic GPA (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). Anti-MPO and anti-PR3 antibodies can activate neutrophils in vitro. In vivo data are available for humans and mice on the pathogenicity of anti-MPO but it is more controversial for PR3-ANCA. A recent genome-wide association study of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitides confirmed the genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of these conditions, with significant association of PR3-ANCA and human leukocyte antigen-DP and the genes encoding α1-antitrypsin and PR3. MPO-ANCA were significantly associated with human leukocyte antigen-DQ. Thus, recent results from epidemiological studies, genome-wide association study and therapeutic trials have suggested that these entities are, in fact, distinct. We have summarised these results and discuss the idea that these two entities should be studied separately as the nature of the two auto-antigens suggests at a molecular level despite shared ANCA involvement.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Both administrative and clinical decisions often must take into account political realities not found in other treatment environments.

12,14604504,Current pain and headache reports,"Diagnosis, epidemiology, and impact of tension-type headache.","Although tension-type headache is the most prevalent headache and affects 78% of the general population, the substantial societal and individual burden associated with this primary headache has been overlooked. In contrast to migraine headache, there has been limited focus on tension-type headache. Most patients with the chronic form of tension-type headache, which affects 3% of the population, are left virtually without any specific treatment. Chronic tension-type headache differs from the episodic form in frequency, lack of effect to most treatment strategies, more medication overuse, and more loss of quality of life. Daily or near daily headaches also constitute a major diagnostic and therapeutic problem and distinguishing chronic tension-type headache from migraine headache and from medication-induced headache is a substantial diagnostic challenge because management strategies are completely different. Considerable benefits for the society can be gained by specific strategies leading to reductions in the amount of sickness absence and impaired working abilities. The burden on the affected patients' and their families' quality of life also may be improved by a general acceptance of the disorder and by the development of a specific treatment strategy.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The value of simultaneous participation in these two modalities has been recognized; 12-step work supports abstinence necessary for the focus on emotional growth in psychotherapy. However, mere simultaneous participation in the two modalities fails to incorporate the benefits of a collaborative relationship where both modalities are used to support both abstinence and emotional growth. The conjoint approach to group and individual treatment is used to (a) argue for the possibility of a collaborative relationship between psychotherapy and a patient's 12-step work, (b) understand the benefits and challenges to collaboration, and (c) provide guidelines for how to work collaboratively with a 12-step program.

Many studies have been published that have attempted to define diagnostic methodology, prognosis, and optimal treatment (pharmacological or percutaneous closure) of PFO patients with cryptogenic stroke. Unfortunately, even today, definitive evidence is still lacking, and clinical management is not consistent among cardiologists.	This review aims to evaluate the role of PFO in cryptogenic stroke, the diagnostic accuracy of transcranial Doppler, contrast transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of left-fright shunt and PFO; and discuss the indications to medical treatment and percutaneous closure of PFO.	All studies published in the literature on PFO and cryptogenic stroke are considered and discussed.	We define an appropriate diagnostic and clinical management of PFO patients with cryptogenic stroke.	After many years of interest on PFO and many concluded studies, there are still no definitive data. However, we are on good track for an appropriate management of PFO patients and cryptogenic stroke.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

16,6135252,Schizophrenia bulletin,Is there a tardive dysmentia?,"A change in the phenomenology of schizophrenia has been observed over the past several decades; affective disturbances and phasic courses have become more evident. Although there is no obvious single explanation for these changes, several ideas have been considered. The advent and use of antipsychotic drugs over the past 30 years stands out as the most significant change. Because it is well known that chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs can induce tardive dyskinesia and has been hypothesized to induce a supersensitivity psychosis, it is reasonable to believe that other behavioral changes may occur over time. We here describe a behavioral disorder that we have termed tardive dysmentia, involving changes in affect, activation level, and interpersonal interaction. A relationship between tardive dysmentia and tardive dyskinesia is suggested. It is our hypothesis that tardive dysmentia contributes to the changing course of schizophrenia and occurs after long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

18,8197410,Schizophrenia bulletin,"Psychometric high-risk paradigm, perceptual aberrations, and schizotypy: an update.","The psychometric high-risk strategy represents a useful methodologic adjunct to the traditional genetic high-risk research approach in the study of the etiology and development of schizophrenia. During the past 15 years, considerable research activity has focused on psychometrically identified individuals hypothesized to be en route to schizophrenia (i.e., putative schizotypes). The Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) has figured prominently in such prediction-oriented psychometric high-risk work. This report examines research using the PAS completed since 1987 that has established the instrument as a valid index for detecting liability for schizophrenia (or schizotypy) and as, arguably, the schizotypy index of choice for research. These results are presented and interpreted in light of Meehl's theoretical framework of schizotypy. Other measures of and assessment devices for schizotypy (schizophrenia-related liability) are identified. Of these other measures, the Chapmans' Magical Ideation Scale and the schizophrenia liability index of Moldin and colleagues are particularly well established. Methodologic suggestions for future psychometric high-risk and other work using objective measures of schizotypic psychopathology are offered. It is strongly recommended that future studies of schizotypy (or those in the planning stages, relying on psychometric detection methods use multiple psychometric indices to tap schizotypy or use a psychometric index in association with other promising biobehavioral markers of schizophrenia liability (e.g., sustained attentional deficits, eye movement dysfunction) for maximum efficiency in both location and definition of schizotypes.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
19,29063964,Psychopharmacology,Phytocannabinoids modulate emotional memory processing through interactions with the ventral hippocampus and mesolimbic dopamine system: implications for neuropsychiatric pathology.,"Growing clinical and preclinical evidence suggests a potential role for the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) as a pharmacotherapy for various neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, is associated with acute and neurodevelopmental propsychotic side effects through its interaction with central cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs). CB1R stimulation in the ventral hippocampus (VHipp) potentiates affective memory formation through inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, thereby altering emotional salience attribution. These changes in DA activity and salience attribution, evoked by dysfunctional VHipp regulatory actions and THC exposure, could predispose susceptible individuals to psychotic symptoms. Although THC can accelerate the onset of schizophrenia, CBD displays antipsychotic properties, can prevent the acquisition of emotionally irrelevant memories, and reverses amphetamine-induced neuronal sensitization through selective phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) molecular signaling pathway. This review summarizes clinical and preclinical evidence demonstrating that distinct phytocannabinoids act within the VHipp and associated corticolimbic structures to modulate emotional memory processing through changes in mesolimbic DA activity states, salience attribution, and signal transduction pathways associated with schizophrenia-related pathology.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway is a major innate immune pathway activated acutely and chronically after stroke. Hence, understanding the intricacies of the temporal profile, specific control points, and cellular specificity of TLR4 activation is crucial for the development of any novel therapeutics targeting the endogenous innate immune response after focal cerebral ischemia. The goal of this review is to summarize the current findings related to TLR4 signaling after stroke with a specific focus on the components of the neurovascular unit such as astrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, and pericytes. In addition, this review will examine the effects of focal cerebral ischemia on interaction of these neurovascular unit components.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

22,23791711,Neurochemistry international,The role of α-synuclein in the pathophysiology of alcoholism.,"Alcoholism has complex etiology and there is evidence for both genetic and environmental factors in its pathophysiology. Chronic, long-term alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are associated with neuronal loss with the prefrontal cortex being particularly susceptible to neurotoxic damage. This brain region is involved in the development and persistence of alcohol addiction and neurotoxic damage is likely to exacerbate the reinforcing effects of alcohol and may hinder treatment. Understanding the mechanism of alcohol's neurotoxic effects on the brain and the genetic risk factors associated with alcohol abuse are the focus of current research. Because of its well-established role in neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders, and its emerging role in the pathophysiology of addiction, here we review the genetic and epigenetic factors involved in regulating α-synuclein expression and its potential role in the pathophysiology of chronic alcohol abuse. Elucidation of the mechanisms of α-synuclein regulation may prove beneficial in understanding the role of this key synaptic protein in disease and its potential for therapeutic modulation in the treatment of substance use disorders as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

26,16044216,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al],Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.,"To evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) on target volume delineation for radiation treatment planning.	The data of the literature concerning the use of PET in target volume delineation are summarized. The following points are discussed for each tumor entity: biological background for the PET investigation, sensitivity and specificity of PET (with different tracers) in comparison to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and impact of PET on target volume definition. New PET tracers, which could visualize biological pathways, such as hypoxia, proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression patterns, will also be discussed.	The results of clinical studies on the integration of PET in target volume definition for lung, head-and-neck, genitourinary and brain tumors were analyzed. Fluorodeoxyglucose-(FDG-)PET has a significant impact on GTV (gross tumor volume) and PTV (planning target volume) delineation in lung cancer and can detect lymph node involvement and differentiate malignant tissue from atelectasis. In head-and-neck cancer, the value of FDG-PET for radiation treatment planning is still under investigation. For example, FDG-PET could be superior to CT and MRI in the detection of lymph node metastases and unknown primary cancer and in the differentiation of viable tumor tissue after treatment. Therefore, it might play an important role in GTV definition and sparing of normal tissue. Choline PET and acetate PET are promising tracers in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but their validity in local tumor demarcation, lymph node diagnosis and detection of recurrence has to be defined in future clinical trials. FDG-PET seems to be particularly valuable in lymph node status definition in cervical cancer. In high-grade gliomas and meningiomas, methionine PET helps to define the GTV and differentiate tumor from normal tissue. For other entities like gastrointestinal cancer, lymphomas, sarcomas, etc., the data of the literature are yet insufficient. The imaging of hypoxia, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression leads to the identification of different areas of a biologically heterogeneous tumor mass that can individually be targeted using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In addition, a biological dose distribution can be generated, the socalled dose painting. However, systematic experimental and clinical trials are necessary to validate this hypothesis.	Regarding treatment planning in radiotherapy, PET offers advantages in terms of tumor delineation and the description of biological processes. To define the real impact of this investigation in radiation treatment planning, subsequent experimental, clinical and cost-benefit analyses are required.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

This risk seems to be related to the COX-2 inhibitory potency and has been found with most NSAIDs except naproxen. Two main hypotheses have been advanced: an imbalance between COX-1-dependent platelet production of thromboxane and partly COX-2-dependent endothelial production of prostacyclin, and a COX-2-dependent increase in blood pressure.	Clinical trials and observational studies providing information about cardiovascular risk associated with long-term use of NSAIDs were retrieved; 14 clinical trials and 16 observational studies mentioned a follow-up of at least 6 months.	Results are ambiguous: long-term exposure seemed associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke with high-dose rofecoxib, and perhaps diclofenac, but less with other NSAIDs. In other studies, little or no increase in risk was associated with exposures shorter than 30 days. Since most NSAIDs are rarely used long term, there is little information on risks associated with long-term use. The relative risks or odds ratios associated with most drugs are mostly well below 2.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
29,25351111,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Prevention of Alzheimer's disease: a global challenge for next generation neuroscientists.,"The incidence of dementia is rapidly increasing in developed countries due to social and demographic changes. This trend is expected to worsen in the coming decades, with the number of cases possibly even tripling in the next 25 years. Therefore Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention is becoming a global health priority. Our knowledge of the pathophysiological process leading to the development of pathological brain lesions that characterize AD has increased exponentially in recent years. However, the phenotypic expression of AD not only depends on the development of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but other factors also play a role. Thus, over the last few decades, epidemiological studies have revealed several risk factors for developing AD, such as vascular or lifestyle related factors. Having the current knowledge on AD, two different strategies have been developed for the prevention of AD: one is based on primary prevention by acting on modifiable risk factors, the other is a pathophysiology-driven approach aimed to identify individuals in a preclinical stage of the disease and treating them with drugs purporting to act on molecular targets of the amyloid cascade. Several promising trials with these approaches are currently ongoing and results are expected in the next few years. The intrinsic limitations in the design of preventive trials should be overcome through a global effort involving healthy population, healthcare professionals, governments, industry, and scientific institutions. This exertion will be more than compensated if we can make AD a preventable disease.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
30,15199474,Seminars in vascular medicine,"P2Y12, a new platelet ADP receptor, target of clopidogrel.","Clopidogrel is a potent antithrombotic drug that inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. The antiaggregating effect of clopidogrel is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of ADP binding to a purinergic receptor present at the platelet surface. Clopidogrel is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. The chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. Several purinergic receptors have been described on platelets; P2X (1), a calcium channel, and P2Y1 a Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor, have been found not to be antagonized by clopidogrel. Another Gi (2)-coupled receptor (named P2Y12) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells. These cells displayed a strong affinity for (33)P-2MeS-ADP, a stable analogue of ADP, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. The binding of (33)P-2MeS-ADP to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets.

These results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called 'P2t' platelet receptor and show that the active metabolite of clopidogrel binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of ADP on platelets.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
31,18200440,Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,"Clinical and molecular genetics of acromegaly: MEN1, Carney complex, McCune-Albright syndrome, familial acromegaly and genetic defects in sporadic tumors.","Pituitary tumors are among the most common neoplasms in man; they account for approximately 15% of all primary intracranial lesions (Jagannathan et al., Neurosurg Focus, 19:E4, 2005). Although almost never malignant and rarely clinically expressed, pituitary tumors may cause significant morbidity in affected patients. First, given the critical location of the gland, large tumors may lead to mass effects, and, second, proliferation of hormone-secreting pituitary cells leads to endocrine syndromes. Acromegaly results from oversecretion of growth hormone (GH) by the proliferating somatotrophs. Despite the significant efforts made over the last decade, still little is known about the genetic causes of common pituitary tumors and even less is applied from this knowledge therapeutically. In this review, we present an update on the genetic syndromes associated with pituitary adenomas and discuss the related genetic defects. We next review findings on sporadic, non-genetic, pituitary tumors with an emphasis on pathways and animal models of pituitary disease. In conclusion, we attempt to present an overall, integrative approach to the human molecular genetics of both familiar and sporadic pituitary tumors.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

This article guides social work practice in the assessment of dementia patients and their families using an ecological-family-centered (EFC) model of practice. A case presentation illustrates how to apply the ECF model while incorporating ethnically sensitive practice principles. The model organizes complex assessment issues that often arise when working with families of dementia patients and illustrates the significance of cultural diversity in case practice. Literature on families of dementia patients is reviewed, an intervention plan for the family system is outlined, and implications for practice are noted.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Cytotoxicity, distribution and the ability to cross blood brain barrier are some of the most significant issues for the chemotherapy of brain tumors. Nanotechnology has been widely exploited in drug delivery with great potential in improving the drug efficiency and efficacy. The advent of nanotechnology would greatly facilitate the early detection and treatment of brain tumors. This review will be primarily focused on current nano drug delivery system for brain cancer therapy. Meanwhile, the existing impediments for therapeutic nanomedicines and critical analysis of the different delivery nanoparticles are also discussed.	We systematically evaluated the major factors that impact the current nanomedicines for brain tumor therapy. Meanwhile, various nanoparticle-based formulations for brain cancer detection and therapy are evaluated.	124 papers were included in this review. From the analysis of the nanomaterials, seven major nanomaterials have been discussed regarding the functionality and current therapeutic significance. The review also explains in detail about the different types of nanomaterials and their functionalities. This shows that each of these nanomaterials has specialized functions for the treatment of various kinds of brain cancer.	Nanomaterials provide a viable potential diagnosis mechanis. In the future, more research needs to be focused on developing a better diagnosis tool for detection of cancer on an urgent basis. Blood-brain barrier and cytotoxicity are some of the primary root causes for the impediment of treatment of cancer using nanoparticles. Therefore, different delivery systems should be exploited for the nanoparticles to surmount these issues.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

39,30291873,Pharmacological research,Neuronal and astrocytic primary cilia in the mature brain.,"Primary cilia are tiny microtubule-based signaling devices that regulate a variety of physiological functions, including metabolism and cell division. Defects in primary cilia lead to a myriad of diseases in humans such as obesity and cancers. In the mature brain, both neurons and astrocytes contain a single primary cilium. Although neuronal primary cilia are not directly involved in synaptic communication, their pathophysiological impacts on obesity and mental disorders are well recognized. In contrast, research on astrocytic primary cilia lags far behind. Currently, little is known about their functions and molecular pathways in the mature brain. Unlike neurons, postnatal astrocytes retain the capacity of cell division and can become reactive and proliferate in response to various brain insults such as epilepsy, ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative β-amyloid plaques. Since primary cilia derive from the mother centrioles, astrocyte proliferation must occur in coordination with the dismantling and ciliogenesis of astrocyte cilia. In this regard, the functions, signal pathways, and structural dynamics of neuronal and astrocytic primary cilia are fundamentally different. Here we discuss and compare the current understanding of neuronal and astrocytic primary cilia.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Through the analysis of the literature we want to assess whether the use of expressive writing on cancer patients in their care pathway compared to the use of writing neutral reduces emotional distress.	The bibliographic search was conducted using the databases CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane Library and PsycInfo.	The results of research conducted on 7 randomized controlled trials, including 3 pilot studies have shown after expressive writing sessions (experimental group) versus neutral writing (control group) a significant reduction in distress in the experimental group early stages of cancer (p = 0,0183); in patients with a diagnosis of metastatic assigned to the group expressive writing there was a statistically significant relevance in the reduction of mood disorders (p = 0,03).Were determined statistically significant group differences also with respect to some measure on the quality of sleep (p = 0,04). The expressive writing did not produce significant reductions in psychological distress and improvements in physical health (p > 0,20) in patients diagnosed with metastatic disease of long duration and, in the palliative care there have been results of feasibility for poor adherence at follow-up.

However, while the understanding of mechanisms underlying autophagy in SCI has progressed, there remain several controversial points: (1) temporal pattern results of autophagic activation after SCI are not consistent across studies; (2) effect of accumulation of autophagosomes due to the blockade or enhancement of autophagic flux is uncertain; (3) overall effect of enhanced autophagy remains undefined, with both beneficial and detrimental outcomes reported in SCI literature. In this review, the temporal pattern of autophagic activation, autophagic flux, autophagic cell death, relationship between autophagy and apoptosis, and pharmacological intervention of autophagy in TSCI (contusion injury, compression injury and hemisection injury) and IRSCI are discussed. Types of SCI and severity appear to contribute to differences in outcomes regarding temporal pattern, flux, and function of autophagy.

This paper reviews the neurobiology and pharmacotherapy of RLS, with a critical analysis of the heterogeneity and methodological limitations of the existing scientific literature.	Although several neurotransmitter systems dysfunction and neuroanatomical abnormalities have been implicated in RLS pathogenesis, dopamine dysfunction within basal ganglia pathways, iron deficiency and opioid system abnormalities have consistently been found to be involved. Their involvement is further strengthened by the therapeutic effectiveness of dopaminergic agents, iron supplementation and opioid medications.	Converging evidence from neuroimaging, autoptic and animal studies points towards dopamine dysregulation and iron metabolism alterations as the main contributors to RLS pathophysiology.

The concept of agitation is not well defined. In addition, there exists much confusion about the characteristics and boundaries of agitation, as well as the distinction between agitation and related concepts. Recently developed theoretical models for agitation in dementia require new interpretation and conceptualization of agitation.	Morse's method of critical appraisal of the literature was used. In addition, some parts of Rodgers' evolutionary method were employed. Data were selected using six electronic databases and the key words 'agitation', 'agitated', 'dementia', 'demented' and 'Alzheimer'. The analysis included 86 empirical or theoretical papers and one book.	A transition from the observer's perspective to the patient's perspective in the interpretation of agitation was found. Five critical attributes of agitation in dementia were identified: excessive, inappropriate, repetitive, non-specific and observable. Patient factors, interpersonal factors, environmental factors and restraint were identified as precipitating antecedents. Mediating antecedents included discomfort, unmet need and misinterpretation. Consequences of agitation were identified at the levels of patient, caregiver and others.	This transition in perspectives has important implications as it can change health providers' attitudes and responses to agitation and lead to patient-focused and individualized care.

This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.	The hallmark symptom of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is acute orthostatic headache; however, clinical presentations can be heterogeneous. New evidence shows that lumbar puncture is not always necessary or sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Some patients may have normal opening pressure, which suggests that insufficiency of CSF volume (hypovolemia) rather than CSF pressure might be the underlying mechanism. Several neuroimaging modalities can aid in diagnosis and localization of the CSF leakage, including brain MRI, spinal MRI, CT myelography, digital subtraction myelography, and radionuclide cisternography. Complications, such as subdural hematoma, can lead to a change in the headache pattern and potentially life-threatening consequences. Conservative treatments, such as fluid supplementation, can provide temporary relief; however, epidural blood patches, especially targeted ones, are more effective and definitive. For patients with refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension, surgical repair of spinal CSF leakages should be considered.

While the condition has been well described in patients with acute hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, post-transplantation and chemotherapy, RPLS has been increasingly identified in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Though experience in the diagnosis and management of RPLS in patients with SLE is likely accumulating, few have systematically worked out the strategy to distinguish RPLS from neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) and lupus-related complications of the central nervous system (CNS). Prompt recognition of, and differentiation between, these conditions is essential since their clinical presentations substantially overlap and yet their management strategy and subsequent outcomes can be entirely different. Indeed, inappropriate treatment such as augmentation of immunosuppression may be detrimental to patients with RPLS. A high index of suspicion of RPLS, prompt magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, including diffusion imaging, exclusion of CNS infection and metabolic derangement, a comprehensive medication review accompanied by timely and aggressive control of blood pressure and seizure are keys to successful management of RPLS.

58,30658131,Brain research bulletin,Cerebral malaria.,"Malaria remains of significant public health concern under the tropics, causing millions of deaths annually. The disease is caused by protozoans of the Plasmodium genus, of which harbors several distinct species. Human infection occurs during the blood meal of an infected female mosquito belonging to the Anopheles genus. It is estimated that around 1% of children infected with Plasmodium falciparum develops a more severe form of malaria, which may eventually lead to cerebral complications including cerebral malaria (CM). CM can be positively diagnosed in patients unable to localize a painful stimulus, with peripheral asexual P. falciparum parasitemia and no other identifiable causes of an encephalopathy. Unarousable comas along with the presence of asexual forms of the parasite on a peripheral blood smear are hallmarks of the disease. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CM have yet be fully elucidated, the pathology in itself indicates a clear disease of the vascular endothelium. It is characterized by parasite sequestration, inflammatory cytokine production and vascular leakage, eventually resulting in brain hypoxia. The condition requires systemic health management consisting of focused nursing practices, supportive care, and anti-malarial drugs. The continued understanding of pathogenic mechanisms leading to the onset of CM is fundamental and key for the expansion and development of appropriate neuroprotective interventions. Future research perspectives may also include the development of field-based and rapid diagnostic tests for CM, understanding of host-pathogen interactions to advance development of prevention tools and therapies, and antimalarial drug trials.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

60,20012471,Journal of gambling studies,The impacts of gaming expansion on economic growth: a theoretical reconsideration.,"This paper employs a general equilibrium framework to analyze the effects on economic growth of global expansions in casino gaming, which exports gambling services largely to non-residents. Both domestic and foreign investments in the gaming sector bring in not only substantial revenues but also positive spillover effects on related sectors and even on the entire local economy. However, an over-expansion of commercial gambling may lead to deterioration in the terms of trade with an adverse impact on real income. If this situation persists, it would not be impossible for immiserizing growth to occur. As a highly profitable sector, casino gaming may enable its operators to diversify out of this risk if they invest retained profits in non-gaming sectors to cash in on the spillover effects it has created. The gaming-dominant economy can then be directed on a more balanced and sustainable growth path, and will become less susceptible to business cycles. Indeed, economic experiences in the world's major casino resorts are consistent basically with this argument for diversification. We believe that after the current global crisis fades away, economic growth and resulting surges in global demand for gambling services can provide further opportunities for the expansion of existing casino resorts and the development of new gaming markets.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

None of these studies, however, used objective sleep measures or examined multiple dimensions of these women's lives.	This review conceptualized the women's symptom experience as the experience of specific symptoms (pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, depressed mood, and anxiety) that were influenced by biopsychosocial factors.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
62,27311246,Revue medicale de Liege,[Controversies around the diagnosis of ADHD].,"Complaints about restlessness, difficulties to focus and impulsivity are amongst the most frequent reasons for child psychiatric consultations. Those complaints refer to the core symptoms of the ADHD. However, the diagnosis of ADHD is delicate to establish and subject to several controversies regarding its etiopathological origins and, therefore, its treatment. In practice, those situations include very different cases and it seems obvious that this is a polyfactorial disorder, no single factor alone being sufficient to account for all the difficulties experienced by the children. It would therefore be simplistic to consider the ADHD as issued only from a neurobiological disorder and to consider a drug treatment, only. We are rather in favor of an integrative approach and a global treatment on a case by case basis.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
63,25062314,British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing),Attending to the spiritual in dementia care nursing.,"Spirituality is a complex and subjective concept. However, spiritual wellness is an important component in a person's overall well-being and the spiritual support of patients is central to nursing care. People with dementia may not be well-supported in this aspect of care; this may lead to spiritual distress. Spiritual needs may be identified by taking the person's spiritual history or, in the case of advanced dementia, by asking a person's significant others about the important spiritual aspects of the person's life. Spiritual care for people with dementia involves reflective practice and meaningful engagement with the person with dementia, so as to facilitate shared understanding. Furthermore, the support of the spiritual and religious beliefs of the person need to be facilitated within an individualised or person centred approach to care and delivered within a multi-disciplinary collaborative context.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
64,28091879,Pituitary,New medical therapies on the horizon: oral octreotide.,"Somatostatin analog treatment is first line medical treatment in patients with acromegaly. This drug is currently mainly administered by monthly depot preparations of octreotide and lanreotide. With the innovative transient permeability enhancer, a technology enabling the absorption of drug molecules via transient opening of the tight junctions of the gut epithelium, it is possible to achieve therapeutic octreotide levels after oral ingestion. The present review summarized the preclinical work and the recently reported phase I and III study on oral octreotide capsules in patients with acromegaly. Maintenance of control in 155 participating patients was achieved in 65% at the end of core period. Once controlled on oral octreotide, the response was maintained to the end of the extension phase in 85%. Side effects were comparable to currently available preparations. There was a profound suppression of growth hormone levels, and significant symptom reduction. Currently available parental somatostatin analogs are generally well tolerated and are able to achieve longstanding biochemical control in patients with somatostatin sensitive tumors. Potential advantages of an oral alternative is the lack injection-related side effects, but there will be an ongoing need for a very strict compliance with the 2 daily dose regimen and fasting around drug administrations. A second phase III study is currently being conducted. The potential place in the treatment of acromegaly is discussed.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Our study explores the efficacy of Pranic Healing (PH), as an adjuvant therapy in treating depression Methods: In this randomised double-blind controlled trial, 52 participants with a mean age of 34.4 years, with mild to moderate depression were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating (HAM-D) scale during the 5-week study. Both Medication + PH (MedPH) and Medication + Mock PH (MedMockPH) groups comprising 26 members received Pranic and mock healing lasting 20 minutes per session respectively once a week for 4 weeks, along with the antidepressant drug.	The average decrease in HAM-D score in MedPH was median 11 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 7-12) and was significantly higher compared with the MedMockPH group median 6.5 (IQR 3-9). At pre-assessment, both groups had 8 cases of mild and 18 cases of moderate depression. At post-assessment, HAM-D showed that the improvement in depression category was seen in 69.2% of participants in the MedMockPH group and 100% in MedPH group.

Assistive technology,Randomized controlled feasibility study of FindMyApps: first evaluation of a tablet-based intervention to promote self-management and meaningful activities in people with mild dementia.,"We tested the feasibility, implementation strategy and mechanism of impact of FindMyApps. FindMyApps is a tablet intervention consisting of a selection tool to help people with dementia find usable apps for self-management and meaningful activities, including training to support informal carers in employing errorless learning principles to help people with dementia learn tablet and tool usage.	We conducted an exploratory, pilot randomized controlled trial with a mixed-methods design. Twenty persons with mild dementia and carer dyads were randomly assigned to the FindMyApps group (n = 10), receiving either the FindMyApps training and selection tool, or a control condition (n = 10), receiving only a short tablet training. Pre- and post-test measurements at a three month follow-up, consisted of questionnaires and post-test semi-structured interviews.	The FindMyApps tool was mostly perceived as useful and easy to use. Persons with dementia were generally able to learn how to use the tool, though they regularly needed support from informal carers. Persons with dementia found apps through the tool, which they used regularly. Persons with dementia and informal carers were positive about the training and support they received. No significant differences were found on outcome measures of persons with dementia, but based on effect sizes FindMyApps is a promising intervention.	Qualitative results indicate that the FindMyApps intervention has the potential to positively influence the self-management abilities and engagement in meaningful activities of people with dementia. Remarks are made to improve the intervention and recommendations are given for future effectiveness studies.Implications for rehabilitationThe person-centred tablet intervention FindMyApps has the potential to positively influence the self-management and engagement in meaningful activities in people with dementia.Based on the input of persons with dementia and informal carers, the FindMyApps intervention and study procedure will be further improved and evaluated in terms of effectiveness in an RCT.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Randomized controlled study.	Research unit of a rehabilitation hospital.	Children with spastic CP (N=23; mean age, 10.6y; range, 6-14y; Gross Motor Function Classification System levels, I-IV).	Participants were randomly assigned to receive controlled assistance (n=11) or resistance (n=12) loads applied to the legs at the ankle. Participants underwent robotic treadmill training 3 times a week for 6 weeks (18 sessions). A controlled swing assistance/resistance load was applied to both legs starting from the toe-off to mid-swing phase of gait during training.	Outcome measures consisted of overground walking speed, 6-minute walk distance, and Gross Motor Function Measure scores and were assessed pre and post 6 weeks of training and 8 weeks after the end of training.	After 6 weeks of treadmill training in participants from the resistance training group, fast walking speed and 6-minute walk distance significantly improved (18% and 30% increases, respectively), and 6-minute walk distance was still significantly greater than that at baseline (35% increase) 8 weeks after the end of training. In contrast, overground gait speed and 6-minute walk distance had no significant changes after robotic assistance training.	The results of the present study indicated that robotic resistance treadmill training is more effective than assistance training in improving locomotor function in children with CP.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

The present study aimed to examine the effects of a self-applied computerized program based on SSL that maintains the same objectives and contents as the face-to-face program.	In this randomized controlled study, 75 children (49.3 % female) aged 8-12 years (Mage = 9.45, SD = 1.31), selected for exhibiting emotional symptoms, were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n = 35) or the waiting list control (WLC) group (n = 40). Pre- and post-intervention data were collected through self-reports and the report of parents who completed parallel versions of the same measures of emotional and behavioral problems.	Overall, compared to the WLC group, the intervention group showed positive effects on targeted emotional symptomatology in the short term. Based on parents' reports, a significant reduction was found in outcomes such as anxiety, depression, emotional symptoms, and internalizing problems, while self-reported results were similar except for anxiety. In addition, a positive impact was found on symptoms related to other types of difficulties (e.g., externalizing problems and general difficulties measured).	Small sample size, non-inclusion of follow-up assessment and other informants (e.g., teachers).	In conclusion, this research provides novel and promising data on the self-applied computerized adapted version of the SSL program, within a multi-informant approach, suggesting that it may be a useful tool for the indicated prevention of childhood emotional problems.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

In the present study, we investigate the effect of individually prescribed coloured overlays on the rate of reading. Subjects were 33 children and adults who: had consulted a specific learning difficulties clinic; had received treatment to normalise any conventional optometric and orthoptic anomalies; and subsequently reported symptomatic relief from coloured filters. These subjects carried out the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (which assesses visual rather than linguistic factors) under two conditions: with their chosen coloured overlay and with a control filter. Steps were taken to ensure that a strong placebo effect was associated with the control overlay and, when asked which they preferred, subjects were not significantly more likely to prefer their coloured overlay than the control filter (p=0.11). Nonetheless, the rate of reading was significantly faster with the coloured overlay than with the control (p=0.0019). Further analyses support the conclusion that individually prescribed coloured filters can improve reading performance for reasons that cannot be solely attributed to conventional optometric factors or to placebo effects.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
74,21185742,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,Variations of blood pressure in stroke unit patients may result from alternating body positions.,"Blood pressure (BP) is one of the major vital parameters monitored in the stroke unit. The accuracy of indirect BP measurement is strongly influenced by the position of both patient and arm during the measurement. Acute stroke patients are often nursed in lateral decubitus positions. The effect of these alternating body positions in relation to affected body side on the outcome and reliability of BP readings in acute stroke patients is unknown.	An automatic oscillometric BP device was used. BP was measured in both arms in the (back) supine and both lateral decubitus positions.	In total, 54 consecutive acute stroke patients were included. Thirty-five patients had right-sided deficits and 19 patients had left-sided deficits. Supine BP readings were similar in the right and left arms regardless of side of deficit. Measurements of BP in the lateral decubitus positions resulted in significantly lower BP readings in the uppermost arm (around 12 mm Hg in both arms) and significantly higher readings in the right lowermost arm (around 6 mm Hg) compared to the supine position. This effect seemed less pronounced when the left lowermost arm was measured. There was no relation between change of BP readings in various lateral positions and side of stroke.	Alternating lateral decubitus positions according to nursing standards in acute stroke patients lead to a mean 18 mm Hg BP fluctuation. This may largely be explained by hydrostatic pressure effects, partly by anatomic factors in the left lowermost arm, but not by the side of stroke.",Remaining,0,0

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of routine video-EEG and video-EEG after sleep deprivation, during the daytime, in the diagnosis of NFLE. We studied 23 patients complaining of repeated nocturnal motor attacks using a 3-level neurophysiological evaluation, including video-EEG when awake (level 1), video-EEG after sleep deprivation, during the daytime (level 2) and nocturnal video-polysomnography (level 3). All the patients had a normal video-EEG when awake. The video-EEG after sleep deprivation (level 2) allowed a diagnosis of NFLE in 52.2% of the patients, while the nocturnal video-polysomnography (level 3) allowed this diagnosis in 87.0% of the same sample. In the patients complaining of repeated nocturnal motor attacks, a video-EEG after sleep deprivation performed during the daytime, could be useful for diagnosis in about one half of cases. This methodology is routinely performed in many Departments of Neurology and Epileptology, and is much less binding and expensive than nocturnal video-polysomnography and so it could be important economically for the health service.",Remaining,0,0

In the present study thirty participants with schizophrenia were compared with demographically matched controls on Virtual Week, a measure that closely represents the types of prospective memory tasks that actually occur in everyday life, and provides an opportunity to investigate the different sorts of prospective memory failures that occur. Participants with schizophrenia were significantly and comparably impaired on Virtual Week, irrespective of the specific prospective memory task demands. Importantly, after controlling for general cognitive functioning, executive functioning and retrospective memory, although the absolute magnitude of the deficit was reduced, significant impairment remained. These results suggest that individuals with schizophrenia experience generalized difficulties with prospective memory, and that whilst other cognitive deficits contribute to these difficulties, there is something unique to prospective remembering that is additionally disrupted in schizophrenia.",Remaining,0,0

VFC starts in the precapillaries/capillaries in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) and expands to the granule cell and polymorphic cell layer of the DG, and to the stratum lacunosum/molecular in the CA1 sector. Vasculopathy spreads from the tail to the body and, in a few cases, to the head of the hippocampal formation. Light and electron microscopy reveal thickening of the vascular wall with fibrosis, calcification, and enforcement of the astrocyte interface with vessels with anchorage densities associated with hemidesmosome-like structures. In moderately and severely affected cases, fragmentation and removal of calcified and occluded vessels result in local reduction of vascular network. In two AD subjects, severe vascular calcification extending from the tail to the head of the hippocampal formation was associated with loss of almost all neurons in the CA1 sector and in the subiculum proper, corresponding to hippocampal sclerosis. The topography of affected vessels and the patterns of neuronal loss reflect the middle hippocampal artery distribution with its precapillary/capillary network. The similar prevalence of vasculopathy in the AD group and in the age-matched control group, and the presence of hippocampal VFC in only one subject in the DS cohort, 96% of which is affected by Alzheimer-type pathology, oppose the link between AD and this form of vasculopathy. However, severe VFC affects the pattern of AD pathology locally by deletion of neurofibrillary degeneration and beta-amyloidosis in the CA1 sector, subiculum proper, and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal VFC appears to be a form of vascular pathology with a unique predilection for the middle hippocampal artery and corresponding capillary network, which results in patchy neuronal loss in moderately affected subjects and in almost total neuronal loss in the area of impaired blood supply in severely affected subjects. These observations suggest an etiologic link between hippocampal VFC and hippocampal sclerosis.",Remaining,0,0

Results revealed that most diagnoses of SAD were not stable during this developmental period, as many children drifted toward subclinical or nonclinical status. In addition, children with clinical SAD, compared to those with subclinical SAD or no symptoms of SAD, had a disproportionately higher number of comorbid diagnoses and experienced significantly greater somatic concerns, anxiety, and general internalizing behavior. In addition, their parents experienced greater depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, phobic anxiety, and general distress. The results preliminarily support prior findings that most children experience a dissipation of SAD symptoms in young childhood but that some children continue to experience stable, significant distress. The results are consistent with prior research on older children that SAD remits for many but not all youth and suggest that parent and family variables may have much to do with cases of poor remission in this population.",Remaining,0,0

Since CARP is induced by pressure overload to the heart, it is proposed to be a genetic marker for cardiac hypertrophy. We recently identified a novel protein, ankyrin repeat protein with PEST and proline-rich region (ARPP), which is homologous to CARP and is preferentially expressed in type 1 skeletal muscle fibers (cf. slow fibers). We also found that both ARPP and CARP expression is induced in experimentally denervated skeletal muscles in mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that their expression may be induced in skeletal muscles in neurodegenerating disease. This work aimed to determine the expression pattern of ARPP and CARP in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).	In this study, we immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of ARPP and CARP in skeletal muscles of 9 ALS cases.	We found that CARP was aberrantly expressed in atrophic skeletal muscle fibers in ALS. Although ARPP-positive fibers were randomly scattered in a checkerboard-like pattern in normal skeletal muscle, this pattern was absent in ALS muscles. Furthermore, we also found that ARPP was expressed in fast myosin heavy chain-positive fibers (cf. type 2 fiber).

The gene responsible for MEN 1 syndrome was recently identified and cloned. Low rates of MEN 1 gene mutations and deletions have been reported in sporadic pituitary adenomas. To elucidate the role of the MEN 1 gene in the pathogenesis of MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors, we examined pituitary adenomas from 11 MEN 1 patients for the presence of 11q13 allelic loss. Ten of the 11 pituitary tumors were informative by PCR-based loss of heterozygosity analysis. Using a combination of family pedigree analysis and restriction analysis directed at the mutated allele in 8 of the 10 informative cases, it was demonstrated in all 8 cases that it is the wild-type allele that undergoes deletion. All 11 tumors, 4 of which were growth hormone secreting, were additionally analyzed for mutation in the Gs alpha subunit (gsp) gene. None of the tumors (0 of 11 tumors) revealed a gsp gene mutation. Therefore, genetic alterations of the MEN 1 gene seem to play a dominant role in MEN 1-associated pituitary tumorigenesis, whereas gsp gene mutations do not seem to be a frequent event in either growth hormone-secreting or other types of MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors. These results suggest that MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors develop via genetic pathways that differ from those of most sporadic pituitary tumors.",Remaining,0,0

In ten years, the number of psychiatric beds decreased 41% (5.4 to 3.2 per 10,000 inhabitants) while community services have increased nine-fold (0.004 to 0.037 per 10,000 inhabitants).

As a whole, the expenses in mental health decreased by 26.7% (2.66 to 1.95 US$ per capita).	There has been a clear switch from hospital to community psychiatric care in Brazil, where the system can now provide a diversity of treatments and free access to psychotropics. However, the coverage of community services is precarious, and the reform was not accompanied by an increased public investment in mental health.

The purpose of this study was to examine whether the pathway from ADI to AUD symptoms by early adulthood is moderated by ethnicity and possessing an alcohol-metabolizing gene ALDH2*2 variant allele.	We used multigroup structural equation modeling, including 5 groups split by ethnicity and ALDH2*2, to examine the consistency of the path from ADI to AUD symptoms in 604 Chinese-, Korean-, and White-American college students. We further examined the effects of ALDH2*2, ethnicity, and their interaction in Asians to better understand their unique contributions to the moderation.	The association between ADI and AUD symptoms was moderated, with ADI negatively associated with AUD symptoms among Koreans without ALDH2*2 and Whites, but not among Koreans with ALDH2*2 or Chinese regardless of ALDH2*2. Both ALDH2*2 and ethnicity within Asians contributed unique variability in the effect.	Ethnicity and ALDH2*2 altered the relationship of ADI as a risk factor for AUD symptoms. Being Chinese and possessing an ALDH2*2 allele within Koreans both buffered against the risk for AUD symptoms associated with earlier ADI, indicating that this relationship can be attenuated by protective factors.",Remaining,0,0
87,27534431,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,A novel amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutation in OPTN induces ER stress and Golgi fragmentation in vitro.,"Mutations in the optineurin gene (OPTN) have been identified in a small proportion (<1%) of sporadic and familial ALS cases, and the exact role of optineurin in the pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear. To further examine the role of OPTN in ALS, we sought to identify novel ALS variants in OPTN and examine their potential for pathogenicity in vitro. Whole exome sequence data from 74 familial ALS cases were analysed for the presence of novel OPTN mutations. Pathogenicity was assessed by analysing effects on Golgi fragmentation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-linked CHOP activation, and cellular localization of optineurin in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells expressing mutant optineurin. We identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation in OPTN (c.883G > T, p.Val295Phe) in a single familial ALS case. This mutation induced recognized cellular features of ALS pathogenesis including Golgi fragmentation and ER stress in NSC-34 cells. In conclusion, the identification of a novel OPTN mutation in an Australian ALS family, and its capacity to induce ALS-like pathological features in vitro, further strengthens evidence for the role of optineurin in the pathogenesis of ALS.",Remaining,0,0
88,31478214,Journal of clinical psychology,Somatic burden and perceived cognitive problems in trauma-exposed adults with posttraumatic stress symptoms or pain.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with somatic and cognitive changes, which may be magnified when accompanied by persistent pain. The mechanisms of somatic sensation processing may extend to cognitive symptoms, revealing a potential generalization of impairment across cognitive and somatic domains in PTSD. We hypothesized that somatic burden would mediate relationships between PTSD, pain, and perceived cognitive impairment.	Two samples-360 trauma-exposed college students and 268 mechanical Turk users-completed self-report measures.	Both samples revealed similar findings. There was a significant indirect effect of PTSD and pain on perceived cognitive problems through somatic burden. There remained a direct effect of PTSD symptoms. These findings indicate that in trauma-exposed samples with pain, somatic burden rather than pain severity accounts for perceived cognitive problems.	High somatic burden may reflect an underlying appraisal about somatic cues, which extend in part to interpretation of cognitive cues.",Remaining,0,0

In both devices, cerebral rSO2 correlated poorly with measured ScvO2 (FORE-SIGHT partial correlation 0.50 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.40-0.58]; FORE-SIGHT ELITE partial correlation 0.47 [0.39-0.55]) and mean bias was +8 (standard deviation [SD] 13.2) for FORE-SIGHT and +14 (SD 12.5) for FORE-SIGHT ELITE. When ScvO2 was <30%, rSO2 was <40 in 8% of FORE-SIGHT ELITE readings. Future NIRS should be validated in more hypoxic cohorts.",Remaining,0,0

91,27349722,Scientific reports,Central tendency effects in time interval reproduction in autism.,"Central tendency, the tendency of judgements of quantities (lengths, durations etc.) to gravitate towards their mean, is one of the most robust perceptual effects. A Bayesian account has recently suggested that central tendency reflects the integration of noisy sensory estimates with prior knowledge representations of a mean stimulus, serving to improve performance. The process is flexible, so prior knowledge is weighted more heavily when sensory estimates are imprecise, requiring more integration to reduce noise. In this study we measure central tendency in autism to evaluate a recent theoretical hypothesis suggesting that autistic perception relies less on prior knowledge representations than typical perception. If true, autistic children should show reduced central tendency than theoretically predicted from their temporal resolution. We tested autistic and age- and ability-matched typical children in two child-friendly tasks: (1) a time interval reproduction task, measuring central tendency in the temporal domain; and (2) a time discrimination task, assessing temporal resolution. Central tendency reduced with age in typical development, while temporal resolution improved. Autistic children performed far worse in temporal discrimination than the matched controls. Computational simulations suggested that central tendency was much less in autistic children than predicted by theoretical modelling, given their poor temporal resolution.",Remaining,0,0

95,11115331,Archives of general psychiatry,Increased neocortical neurofibrillary tangle density in subjects with Alzheimer disease and psychosis.,"Psychosis is common in patients with Alzheimer disease. While the relationship between psychosis and clinical variables has been examined frequently, few studies have examined the relationship between psychosis and the 2 major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease: neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. We characterized the occurrence of psychosis in relation to dementia severity and determined if subjects with Alzheimer disease and psychosis had a greater neurofibrillary tangle or senile plaque burden than subjects with Alzheimer disease and no psychosis.	One hundred nine subjects with Alzheimer disease were followed longitudinally with semistructured assessments in order to assign a Clinical Dementia Rating and determine whether psychosis was present. After the subjects died, their brains were obtained for histological examination. Analysis of variance was used to compare the densities of neurofibrillary tangles, total senile plaques, and cored senile plaques in subjects with psychosis vs subjects without psychosis, in several neocortical regions, the hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex.	Psychosis occurred commonly in Alzheimer disease, affecting 63% of subjects. The frequency of psychosis increased with increasing dementia severity. More importantly, we found that subjects with psychosis had a 2.3-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.9) greater density of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles than did subjects without psychosis. The increase was independent of dementia severity. No similar relationship with psychosis was seen for total senile plaques or cored senile plaques.	The increase in psychosis frequency that occurs with the progression of dementia severity and the independent association between psychosis and neurofibrillary tangle density suggest the possibility that some common underlying process or processes specific to Alzheimer disease may regulate both phenomena.

96,21112701,Drug and alcohol dependence,Psychopathic heroin addicts are not uniformly impaired across neurocognitive domains of impulsivity.,"Impulsivity is a hallmark characteristic of drug addiction and a prominent feature of externalizing disorders such as psychopathy that are commonly comorbid with drug addiction. In a previous study (Vassileva et al., 2007) we have shown that psychopathic heroin addicts evidence more impulsive decision-making on the Iowa Gambling Task relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether the observed impulse-control deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts would generalize to other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity, such as delay discounting and behavioral inhibition among a group of relatively 'pure' heroin addicts in Bulgaria who participated in our previous study.	We tested 92 currently abstinent male heroin addicts, classified as psychopathic or non-psychopathic based on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R). We administered two neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity: (1) Delayed Rewards Discounting Task, a measure of temporal discounting of rewards; and (2) Passive Avoidance Learning Task, a measure of behavioral inhibition.	Psychopathic heroin addicts were not impaired relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts on the Delayed Rewards Discounting Task and the Passive Avoidance Learning Task, on the latter of which they showed better attentional capacity.	These results indicate that psychopathic heroin users are not uniformly impaired across neurocognitive domains of impulsivity. Combined with our previous findings, results suggest that the presence of psychopathy may exacerbate decision-making deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts, but it may not have significant effect on other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity in this population.",Remaining,0,0
97,28728096,European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,Early life stress explains reduced positive memory biases in remitted depression.,"There is contradictory evidence regarding negative memory biases in major depressive disorder (MDD) and whether these persist into remission, which would suggest their role as vulnerability traits rather than correlates of mood state. Early life stress (ELS), common in patients with psychiatric disorders, has independently been associated with memory biases, and confounds MDD versus control group comparisons. Furthermore, in most studies negative biases could have resulted from executive impairments rather than memory difficulties per se.	To investigate whether memory biases are relevant to MDD vulnerability and how they are influenced by ELS, we developed an associative recognition memory task for temporo-spatial contexts of social actions with low executive demands, which were matched across conditions (self-blame, other-blame, self-praise, other-praise). We included fifty-three medication-free remitted MDD (25 with ELS, 28 without) and 24 healthy control (HC) participants without ELS.	Only MDD patients with ELS showed a reduced bias (accuracy/speed ratio) towards memory for positive vs. negative materials when compared with MDD without ELS and with HC participants; attenuated positive biases correlated with number of past major depressive episodes, but not current symptoms. There were no biases towards self-blaming or self-praising memories.	This demonstrates that reduced positive biases in associative memory were specific to MDD patients with ELS rather than a general feature of MDD, and were associated with lifetime recurrence risk which may reflect a scarring effect. If replicated, our results would call for stratifying MDD patients by history of ELS when assessing and treating emotional memories.",Remaining,0,0
98,12244316,Nature genetics,"Mutation of TDP1, encoding a topoisomerase I-dependent DNA damage repair enzyme, in spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy.","Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) repairs covalently bound topoisomerase I-DNA complexes and is essential for preventing the formation of double-strand breaks that result when stalled topoisomerase I complexes interfere with DNA replication in yeast. Here we show that a deficiency of this DNA repair pathway in humans does not predispose to neoplasia or dysfunctions in rapidly replicating tissues, but instead causes spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) by affecting large, terminally differentiated, non-dividing neuronal cells. Using genome-wide linkage mapping and a positional candidate approach in a Saudi Arabian family affected with autosomal recessive SCAN1, we identified a homozygous mutation in TDP1 (A1478G) that results in the substitution of histidine 493 with an arginine residue. The His493 residue is conserved in TDP1 across species and is located in the active site of the enzyme. Protein modeling predicts that mutation of this amino acid to arginine will disrupt the symmetric structure of the active site. We propose that loss-of-function mutations in TDP1 may cause SCAN1 either by interfering with DNA transcription or by inducing apoptosis in postmitotic neurons.",Remaining,0,0

Their common complaints are examined as core symbolic elements in culturally patterned complexes of meanings focused around personal trauma, stressful life events, personal and social reactions, expectations about treatment, and the course of illness. Many of these women report themselves to be 'nervous,' to be 'sick from nerves,' or to have had an 'ataque de nervios.' 'Nervousness' is the base symbolic domain in Puerto Rico of what psychiatry labels 'anxiety disorder,' although it is also a common complaint of many disorders.

The special difficulties of women in Puerto Rico are highlighted, and psychiatric and ethnopsychological (Spiritist) models of etiology and treatment are compared.",Remaining,0,0
100,8733222,Psychological medicine,Causal attributions about common somatic sensations among frequent general practice attenders.,"The causal attributions that people make about bodily symptoms or sensations are likely to influence their decisions whether or not to consult a doctor. Previous research has supported the model that people tend initially to look for external or environmental explanations for bodily sensations (normalizing attributions) and only if this process fails do they search for attributions internal to themselves (somatic or psychological attributions). This study tested two hypotheses about frequent general practice attenders: (1) compared with others, they are more likely to make somatic attributions and less likely to make normalizing ones; and (2) given a bodily symptom together with a somatic explanation, frequent attenders will have greater difficulty than others in finding reasons why the given (pathological) explanation is untrue. The frequent attenders' group had themselves initiated an average of 12 general practice visits in the 12 months before assessment, while a control group of infrequent attenders had not made appointments to see their general practitioner for an average of 24 months. The results provide partial support for the hypotheses. Frequent attenders generated significantly fewer normalizing explanations for a series of common bodily sensations than the comparison group, although the two groups did not differ in their somatic attributions. Given a common bodily sensation and an accompanying pathological explanation, the frequent attenders were less able than the control group to generate reasons why the given explanation might be untrue. Some associations were found between these measures and anxiety.",Remaining,0,0
101,29531139,Diabetes,Altered Brain Dynamics in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes During Working Memory Processing.,"It is now generally accepted that diabetes increases the risk for cognitive impairment, but the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. A critical problem in linking diabetes to cognitive impairment is that patients often have multiple comorbidities (e.g., obesity, hypertension) that have been independently linked to cognitive deficits. In the study reported here we focused on young adults with and without type 1 diabetes who were virtually free of such comorbidities. The two groups were matched on major health and demographic factors, and all participants completed a verbal working memory task during magnetoencephalographic brain imaging. We hypothesized that patients would have altered neural dynamics in verbal working memory processing and that these differences would directly relate to clinical disease measures. Accordingly, we found that patients had significantly stronger neural responses in the superior parietal cortices during memory encoding and significantly weaker activity in parietal-occipital regions during maintenance compared with control subjects. Moreover, disease duration and glycemic control were both significantly correlated with neural responses in various brain regions. In conclusion, young healthy adults with type 1 diabetes already have aberrant neural processing relative to their peers without diabetes, using compensatory responses to perform the task, and glucose management and duration may play a central role.",Remaining,0,0

The participants had hepatitis C infection and poor venous access due to current or former drug use. Interview audiotapes were analyzed, and the themes - conflict, emotional responses, the patient as expert, and offering solutions - were identified. In the context of this study, we discuss the difficulties associated with phlebotomy, which might explain why individuals with hepatitis C infection and venous damage disengage from health services and are less likely to undertake antiviral treatment. This research adds to the literature on phlebotomy for vulnerable groups, and recommends hepatitis C virus clinics within drug agencies, the need to review training and policy, and the development of 'phlebotomy passports' to enable continuity of care between services.",Remaining,0,0

We used data from a cross-sectional population-based survey of teenagers (Young-HUNT study). Among 8,986 teenage participants, 120 of their parents had invasive cancer before the Young-HUNT study according to the Norwegian Cancer Registry.

Fewer case daughters reported eating problems compared with control daughters, and more case sons reported eating problems compared with control sons. More case daughters than case sons reported somatic stress symptoms and low self-esteem and displayed more caseness of anxiety/depression. These three sex differences were also observed among controls, indicating that they were general sex differences.	In this population-based study, teenagers who had a parent with cancer did not have higher prevalence of psychosocial problems than controls.

We measured serum markers and quantified the numbers of 19 fecal bacterial groups/genera/species by quantitative RT-PCR of 16S or 23S rRNA. Although the six most predominant bacterial groups/genera/species covered on average 71.3% of total intestinal bacteria, our analysis was not comprehensive compared to metagenome analysis or 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.	In PD, the number of Lactobacillus was higher, while the sum of analyzed bacteria, Clostridium coccoides group, and Bacteroides fragilis group were lower than controls. Additionally, the sum of putative hydrogen-producing bacteria was lower in PD. A linear regression model to predict disease durations demonstrated that C. coccoides group and Lactobacillus gasseri subgroup had the largest negative and positive coefficients, respectively. As a linear regression model to predict stool frequencies showed that these bacteria were not associated with constipation, changes in these bacteria were unlikely to represent worsening of constipation in the course of progression of PD. In PD, the serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein levels were lower than controls, while the levels of serum diamine oxidase, a marker for intestinal mucosal integrity, remained unchanged in PD.	The permeability to LPS is likely to be increased without compromising the integrity of intestinal mucosa in PD. The increased intestinal permeability in PD may make the patients susceptible to intestinal dysbiosis. Conversely, intestinal dysbiosis may lead to the increased intestinal permeability. One or both of the two mechanisms may be operational in development and progression of PD.",Remaining,0,0

Yet, few studies have examined risk factors related to suicidal ideation (SI) among children aged 12 and younger. Aims: The current study addresses this gap. Method: A questionnaire was filled out by 1,350 Flemish primary caregivers (94.7% mothers) of 9-year-old children (50.4% boys, Mage = 9.45). Their responses were analyzed using logistic regression and independent samples t tests. Results: The presence of passive SI was reported in 10.5% of the children. A psychiatric, developmental, or behavioral condition (or multiple conditions), a learning disorder, impulsivity, aggression, and experiencing multiple stressful family life events were discovered as potential risk factors of passive SI in childhood. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of this study meant that causality could not be inferred. In addition, it was based on reports of primary caregivers, rather than on reports from the children themselves. Conclusion: These new empirical findings can be used for the development of prevention programs and be taken into account in risk assessments of SI in clinical practice.

Besides, stroke-related complications and clinical outcomes in relation to the development of IC has not been systematically examined. Data of 256 consecutive patients with LHI were collected. IC at stroke onset was retrospectively collected from the initial emergency department and/or admission records. Of the 256 LHI patients enrolled, 93 (36.3%) had IC at stroke onset. LHI patients with IC at stroke onset were older (median age 66 vs. 61, p = 0.041), had shorter prehospital delay (24 vs. 26 h, p < 0.001and higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (19 vs. 12, p < 0.001).

Our results suggested that IC occur in 1 out of every 3 LHI patients at stroke onset and was associated with initial stroke severity and atrial fibrillation. LHI patients with IC at stroke onset more frequently had stroke-related complications, 3-month mortality and unfavorable outcome, whereas IC was not an independent predictor of poor outcomes.",Remaining,0,0
112,15010995,Der Pathologe,[Morphological findings after stent implantation in the carotid artery].,"This report describes the pathological-anatomical and immunohistochemical findings of carotid arteries after incorporation of self-expanding metal stents. Ten stent specimens were examined. All specimens displayed variable expression patterns of chronic low-grade foreign body reactions in the vicinity of the incorporated stent struts as characterized by the appearance of CD68-positive macrophages and mainly CD3- and CD45-R0-positive T lymphocytes. Overwhelming proliferations in relation to intimal hyperplasia can be regarded as the main cause of stent-associated vascular restenosis. After a period of 6 months the expression of factor VIII-positive neoendothelial cells on the luminal surface can be detected in individual cases. Reactions of the vascular wall depend on the state of the underlying atherosclerotic lesions prior to stenting. In cases of predominantly atheromatous soft plaques, the typical reaction pattern triggered by the metallic foreign body pressed into vessel tissue can be absent. In summary, the morphological findings show a chronic tissue reaction in response to stent incorporation. In addition, individually differing reaction patterns ranging from discrete inflammatory changes to massive stenoses were identified and documented.",Remaining,0,0
113,3522814,Journal of clinical hypertension,Common carotid blood flow in patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery.,"Common carotid blood flow has been measured using pulsed Doppler techniques in hypertensive patients over 45 years of age, with and without stenosis of the internal carotid artery. In hypertensive patients without stenosis, arterial diameter remained within the normal range, whereas blood flow velocity and blood flow were significantly reduced. Vascular resistance was significantly increased but did not change markedly after administration of the vasodilating drug isosorbid dinitrate. Patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery were compared with two different populations used as controls: In comparison with hypertensive patients without stenosis of the internal carotid artery, both arterial diameter and blood flow velocity were reduced, leading to a more pronounced decrease in blood flow; and in comparison with normotensive patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery, common carotid blood flow was more reduced at any degree of stenosis. In a subset of patients, blood flow returned toward normal ranges after endarterectomy. The study suggested that in patients with hypertension without stenosis of the internal carotid artery, the decrease in blood flow is due to a decrease in blood flow velocity with normal arterial diameter despite the elevated blood pressure, and in patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery, blood flow was more reduced than in the normotensive patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery, suggesting that caution must be taken with indications of antihypertensive treatment.",Remaining,0,0

116,21602685,Current opinion in psychiatry,Psychiatric epidemiological surveys in China 1960-2010: how real is the increase of mental disorders?,"Community psychiatric epidemiological surveys over the last five decades have revealed a dramatic increase in the prevalence of mental disorders in China. This article summarizes the main surveys and attempts to interpret the increase of prevalence from a methodological perspective.	Regional and national surveys conducted in China during 1960-1990 focused on severe mental disorders and revealed very low and stable rates of disorders. By contrast, those performed in the last decade, whether psychiatrists or lay interviewers were used, have shown much higher and more 'reliable' rates comparable to those found in high-income countries. This is especially so for depression and anxiety disorders.	Given the sociopolitical turmoil that had previously plagued people in China, the dramatic rise in prevalence estimates of mental disorders in recent years cannot be simply interpreted as a substantive deterioration of mental health following rapid social change. Global and local factors that shape research methodology aimed at showing that mental disorders are common may play an important role in the dramatic increase. Future research in China should move beyond descriptive epidemiology. It should also address policy relevant issues in view of the limited resources available for mental health interventions.",Remaining,0,0

To address this issue, we performed a genome-wide association study among 6345 apparently healthy women in which we evaluated 336,108 SNPs as potential determinants of plasma CRP concentration. Overall, seven loci that associate with plasma CRP at levels achieving genome-wide statistical significance were found (range of p values for lead SNPs within the seven loci: 1.9 x 10(-)(8) to 6.2 x 10(-)(28)). Two of these loci (GCKR and HNF1A) are suspected or known to be associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, one is a gene-desert region on 12q23.2, and the remaining four loci are in or near the leptin receptor protein gene, the apolipoprotein E gene, the interleukin-6 receptor protein gene, or the CRP gene itself. The protein products of six of these seven loci are directly involved in metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, beta cell function, weight homeostasis, and/or premature atherothrombosis. Thus, common variation in several genes involved in metabolic and inflammatory regulation have significant effects on CRP levels, consistent with CRP's identification as a useful biomarker of risk for incident vascular disease and diabetes.",Remaining,0,0

119,25031221,Schizophrenia bulletin,Mediodorsal and visual thalamic connectivity differ in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with and without psychosis history.,"Empirical and theoretical studies implicate thalamocortical circuits in schizophrenia, supported by emerging resting-state functional connectivity studies (rs-fcMRI). Similar but attenuated alterations were found in bipolar disorder (BD). However, it remains unknown if segregated loops within thalamocortical systems show distinct rs-fcMRI alterations in schizophrenia. For instance, the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus, known to project to prefrontal networks, may be differently altered than the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), known to project to the occipital cortex. Also, it remains unknown if these circuits show different patterns of alterations in BD as a function of psychosis history, which may be associated with a more severe clinical course. We addressed these questions in 90 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 73 remitted BD patients (33 with psychosis history) matched to 146 healthy comparison subjects. We hypothesized that the MD vs LGN would show dissociations across diagnostic groups. We found that MD and LGN show more qualitative similarities than differences in their patterns of dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. In BD, patterns qualitatively diverged between thalamic nuclei although these effects were modest statistically. BD with psychosis history was associated with more severe dysconnectivity, particularly for the MD nucleus. Also, the MD nucleus showed connectivity reductions with the cerebellum in schizophrenia but not in BD. Results suggest dissociations for thalamic nuclei across diagnoses, albeit carefully controlling for medication is warranted in future studies. Collectively, these findings have implications for designing more precise neuroimaging-driven biomarkers that can identify common and divergent large-scale network perturbations across psychiatric diagnoses with shared symptoms.",Remaining,0,0

The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) was divided into proximal (brainstem, preganglionic, gasserian ganglion, and cavernous sinus) and distal (extracranial V1, V2, and V3) segments. Lesions were organized according to segments and correlated with the type and distribution of clinical symptoms or signs. The purpose of the study was to (1) determine the efficacy of clinical localization of cranial nerve V lesions, (2) compare CT and MR for cranial nerve V imaging, (3) develop an MR protocol for effective cranial nerve V imaging, and (4) construct a differential diagnosis by anatomic segment for lesions of cranial nerve V. Clinical localization was found to be extremely inaccurate. CT was not as sensitive as MR for lesions involving the basal cisterns and skull base and will not detect the most common brainstem lesions (small infarcts and multiple sclerosis plaques). The MR protocol developed does not rely heavily on clinical localization. On the basis of lesions found in this series, a differential diagnosis by segment was developed. Patients with cranial nerve V symptoms should undergo MR imaging according to the protocol provided in this article. CT is not as effective as MR in imaging some cranial nerve V segments.

A cross-sectional comparative study of 20 patients with PD and 20 age-matched healthy controls was conducted. Visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, pattern visual-evoked response (VER), and multifocal electroretinogram were recorded to determine functional change, whereas structural changes were evaluated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, macular thickness, macular volume, and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer complex (GCL-IPL) thickness using spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT).	PD patients ranged from Stage 1-3, with median Stage 2 (Hoehn and Yahr Classification) with mean Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III score of 19 ± 10.42, and average disease duration of 5.8 ± 2.78 years. Visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields were unaffected but contrast sensitivity was significantly worse than controls (P < 0.001). Multifocal electroretinogram values in the central 2° field revealed decreased foveal electrical activity, with increased pattern VER amplitude and latency. Significant RNFL thinning was observed in the average RNFL (P = 0.033), superior (P = 0.018), and temporal (P = 0.036) quadrants. Significant ganglion cell layer loss was captured on SD-OCT with average, minimum GCL-IPL, and all 6 sectors showing thinning (P ≤ 0.003). The functional changes correlated significantly with structural changes, disease duration, and severity. There was no correlation between structural changes in the retina and disease duration or severity.	Subclinical visual dysfunction was observed in patients with PD with good structural-functional correlation.

Also, there are controversial data about the comparison between euthymic bipolar patients and different subgroups of schizophrenia in neurocognition, functioning, and QoL level. The present study aimed to compare the neurocognitive performance, functional outcome, and QoL of remitted and non-remitted patients with SC with respect to a group of euthymic patients with BD, and a control group. It included 655 subjects: 98 patients with schizophrenia in remission (SC-R), 184 non-remitted patients with schizophrenia (SC-NR), 117 euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder (BD), and 256 healthy subjects. A comprehensive clinical, neurocognitive (six cognitive domains), functional, and QoL assessment was carried out. Remission criteria of Andreasen were used to classify schizophrenia patients as remitted or non-remitted. Compared with control subjects all groups of patients showed impaired neurocognitive performance, functioning and QoL. SC-R patients had an intermediate functioning between control subjects and SC-NR, all at a neurocognitive, functional, or QoL level. There were no significant differences between SC-R and BD. These results suggest that reaching clinical remission is essential to achieve a better level of psychosocial functioning, and QoL. Likewise, the results of this study suggest that euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and patients with schizophrenia in remission are comparable at the neurocognitive and functional levels, which might have implications in the pathophysiology of both disorders.",Remaining,0,0

We were able to resolve, with milliseconds temporal resolution, changes in activation patterns involving suspected epileptic foci and other brain regions in the epileptic network during spike and slow wave. Using summary maps (called SSWAS maps) which show the activation frequency of voxels, we found that suspected epileptic foci tend to be significantly active during this interval. SSWAS maps also enabled the detection of the epileptic foci in 4 of 5 patients where the conventional event-timing-based analysis failed to identify.	These findings demonstrated the efficacy of the method and the potential application of SSWAS maps to identify epileptic foci.	The method could help resolve activation changes during epileptic spike and could provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology of these changes.",Remaining,0,0

In patients with Parkinson's disease, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the D allele, but there was no difference in the frequency of the alleles in familial compared to sporadic Parkinson's disease. The D and I-16 promoters direct higher NQO2 gene expression that results in higher enzyme activity. Overexpression of NQO2 in the catecholaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species when exposed to exogenous dopamine. The results suggest that the association of the D promoter with Parkinson's disease may be due to an increase in expression of the NQO2 gene.",Remaining,0,0

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) and habituation of the startle reflex are operational measures of early information processing. Impaired PPI in schizophrenia has been replicated in many studies and is regarded as an endophenotype for schizophrenia. However, reports on the stability of PPI over a longer period of time are lacking, both for patients with schizophrenia and for healthy subjects. The current study examined 25 initially drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients and 23 healthy matched controls. Three PPI measures [stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) 30, 60, 120 ms] and habituation were assessed at baseline, and again after 6 yr. Sixteen patients and 17 healthy controls completed the study, and 13 patients and 17 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. The schizophrenia patients had PPI deficits compared to controls at baseline. After 6 yr, no significant group differences were found. PPI had increased significantly in the patients and had decreased significantly in controls. In addition, patients showed significantly less habituation than controls while habituation did not change in patients or controls. The present results show that PPI in drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients can improve significantly over time. As PPI increased in patients over the same period that it decreased in controls, it is likely that the increase was caused by disease-related factors such as disease process, clinical state, or medication.",Remaining,0,0

The main purpose of this study is to determine whether the obesity paradox measured by body mass index (BMI) or by waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is real.	We evaluated the association of general obesity measured by BMI, and abdominal obesity measured by WHtR with 1-year all-cause mortality, recurrence of stroke and combined vascular events of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients in a cohort -- the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III). Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were performed to investigate the association between obesity and clinical outcomes.	A total of 14,146 patients with ischemic stroke were included. When BMI was used as a measure of obesity, compared to the normal weight patients, mortality decreased in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.91], P = 0.0035) and obese patients (HR 0.54 [0.40-0.73], P < 0.0001); and increased in underweight patients (HR 2.55 [1.75-3.73], P < 0.0001). After adjustment for confounding factors, the protective effect of obesity and overweight disappeared. BMI had no association with recurrence of stroke or combined vascular events. When WHtR was used as a measure of obesity, obese patients had lower 1-year all-cause mortality (HR 0.64 [0.43-0.97], P = 0.0357). After adjustment for confounding factors, this difference disappeared; overweight patients still had lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42 [0.26-0.67], P = 0.0003), recurrence of stroke (aHR 0.77 [0.60-0.99], P = 0.0440) and combined vascular events (aHR 0.75 [0.58-0.95], P = 0.0198).

Concordance of diagnoses among family members was assessed and proportionate utilization ratios were used to compare the experiences of families of carpenters with and without ASRD.	Twenty-eight percent of the spouses with ASRD had a carpenter spouse with a similar diagnosis. Twenty-four percent of the families with a child with ASRD had a parent with one of these diagnoses compared to 9.4% of families without any children with ASRD (P < 0.0001). Families of carpenters with alcohol or ASRD also had different patterns of health care utilization.	Utilization patterns were influenced to a significant degree by concordant diagnoses among spouses and children. Excess mental health care was seen among families of carpenters with ASRD above their care for substance abuse treatment.",Remaining,0,0

The purpose of this study was to confirm that APOE allele polymorphism also represents a risk factor for unfavorable outcomes following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).	A total of 104 patients with aneurysmal SAH were studied. Computed tomography (CT) scan findings of SAH were assessed by Fisher's grade and clinical neurologic assessment was performed using the Hunt and Hess (H&H)grading system. Serum lipids were also analyzed. Outcomes at 3 months after SAH were determined using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.	The distributions of APOE genotypes and alleles of patients were matched with those of control subjects. That 5 of 18 patients with APOE-E4 allele (28%) had an unfavorable outcome was significantly different from those without APOE-E4 (8%, chi2, p = 0.032; OR = 4.34, 95% CI 1.20-15.75). However, the presence or absence of E2 or E3 alleles had no significant difference. The relative hazard of APOE-E4 for unfavorable outcome exited after adjustment for clinical assessment (OR = 6.95, 95% CI 1.21-39.75). Total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B were elevated in patients with unfavorable rather than favorable outcomes.	Our findings confirmed that the patients with APOE-E4 allele were predisposed to unfavorable outcomes after aneurysmal SAH even though an association between APOE and incidence of the SAH may not exist. The effect of APOE on neurobiology and lipoprotein metabolism seems to partially explain the difference in outcomes and deserves further study.",Remaining,0,0

PD patients underwent comprehensive neuropsychological and neurological evaluations and ACE-R assessment.	The ACE-R was superior to the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) in detecting PD-MCI, with a cutoff score of ≤93 offering a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 64%. The utility of the ACE-R in detecting PD-MCI is largely influenced by the fluency sub-domain score, and has optimal discriminability when utilized in patients with lower levels of education (≤12 years of formal schooling).	The ACE-R must be used cautiously as a screening tool for PD-MCI, with results being most influenced by its fluency sub-domain score and patient education levels.",Remaining,0,0

141,28317947,NeuroImage. Clinical,Parietal operculum and motor cortex activities predict motor recovery in moderate to severe stroke.,"While motor recovery following mild stroke has been extensively studied with neuroimaging, mechanisms of recovery after moderate to severe strokes of the types that are often the focus for novel restorative therapies remain obscure. We used fMRI to: 1) characterize reorganization occurring after moderate to severe subacute stroke, 2) identify brain regions associated with motor recovery and 3) to test whether brain activity associated with passive movement measured in the subacute period could predict motor outcome six months later. Because many patients with large strokes involving sensorimotor regions cannot engage in voluntary movement, we used passive flexion-extension of the paretic wrist to compare 21 patients with subacute ischemic stroke to 24 healthy controls one month after stroke. Clinical motor outcome was assessed with Fugl-Meyer motor scores (motor-FMS) six months later. Multiple regression, with predictors including baseline (one-month) motor-FMS and sensorimotor network regional activity (ROI) measures, was used to determine optimal variable selection for motor outcome prediction. Sensorimotor network ROIs were derived from a meta-analysis of arm voluntary movement tasks. Bootstrapping with 1000 replications was used for internal model validation. During passive movement, both control and patient groups exhibited activity increases in multiple bilateral sensorimotor network regions, including the primary motor (MI), premotor and supplementary motor areas (SMA), cerebellar cortex, putamen, thalamus, insula, Brodmann area (BA) 44 and parietal operculum (OP1-OP4). Compared to controls, patients showed: 1) lower task-related activity in ipsilesional MI, SMA and contralesional cerebellum (lobules V-VI) and 2) higher activity in contralesional MI, superior temporal gyrus and OP1-OP4. Using multiple regression, we found that the combination of baseline motor-FMS, activity in ipsilesional MI (BA4a), putamen and ipsilesional OP1 predicted motor outcome measured 6 months later (adjusted-R[2] = 0.85; bootstrap p < 0.001). Baseline motor-FMS alone predicted only 54% of the variance. When baseline motor-FMS was removed, the combination of increased activity in ipsilesional MI-BA4a, ipsilesional thalamus, contralesional mid-cingulum, contralesional OP4 and decreased activity in ipsilesional OP1, predicted better motor outcome (djusted-R[2] = 0.96; bootstrap p < 0.001). In subacute stroke, fMRI brain activity related to passive movement measured in a sensorimotor network defined by activity during voluntary movement predicted motor recovery better than baseline motor-FMS alone. Furthermore, fMRI sensorimotor network activity measures considered alone allowed excellent clinical recovery prediction and may provide reliable biomarkers for assessing new therapies in clinical trial contexts. Our findings suggest that neural reorganization related to motor recovery from moderate to severe stroke results from balanced changes in ipsilesional MI (BA4a) and a set of phylogenetically more archaic sensorimotor regions in the ventral sensorimotor trend, in which OP1 and OP4 processes may complement the ipsilesional dorsal motor cortex in achieving compensatory sensorimotor recovery.",Remaining,0,0
142,32421592,Journal of affective disorders,Anxiety predicts dyadic sleep characteristics in couples experiencing insomnia but not in couples without sleep disorders.,"Anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid with sleep problems. Despite growing acknowledgement that bedpartners are important determinants of sleep quality, few studies have explored mental health as a risk factor for disrupted sleep of the bedpartner. We examined whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted an individual's sleep or their bedpartner's sleep, in couples where one partner experienced insomnia and in couples without sleep disorders.	Fifty-two bed-sharing couples where one individual had insomnia ('Patient'), and 55 non-sleep-disordered couples completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Sleep was monitored for seven nights. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models assessed whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted individual or dyadic sleep (wake transmission).	Greater anxiety symptoms predicted increased vulnerability to being woken by their bedpartner, as well as increased frequency of waking their bedpartner up during the night in Patients with insomnia, but not in non-sleep-disordered couples. Neither anxiety nor depression symptoms predicted an individual's or their bedpartner's sleep efficiency in either subsample. However, ISI was positively predicted by own anxiety and depression symptoms for Patients with insomnia and in non-sleep-disordered couples.	The non-sleep-disordered subsample experienced only mild symptoms of anxiety and depression, potentially reducing predictive power.	Anxiety may help reveal social determinants of sleep in couples experiencing insomnia. These data underscore the importance of considering sleep, the bedpartner, and affective symptoms in mental health and sleep assessments.",Remaining,0,0

Yet there is an under-representation of the older population in the BP literature. We present extensive interview data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, dealing with a population-based sample of Danish twins aged 70-102, and describing the 1-month prevalence of BP and the development of BP over time. The associations between BP and education, self-rated health, other health problems, lifestyle factors, and physical and mental function were also investigated. Data were analysed in a cross-sectional analysis for all answers given at entry into the study and in a longitudinal analysis for participants in all four surveys. Associated factors were analysed for the cross-sectional sample using univariate and multivariate analysis accounting for the non-independence of twins in complete pairs. The overall 1-month prevalence of BP was 25% and differed significantly between men and women. The variations in prevalence between the age groups and over time were negligible. The majority of participants in all four surveys had either not experienced BP during the previous month or had done so on one occasion only. Education was not associated with BP. Self-rated health was associated with BP in a significant 'dose-response' like pattern. BP was associated with bone and joint disorders, migraine headaches, lung disease, cardiovascular disorders and gastric ulcer, but not neurologic or endocrinologic diseases. BP sufferers had significantly lower scores on physical but not on mental functioning. We conclude that BP is a common symptom in old age; however, the prevalence does not change with increasing age. BP may be part of a more general syndrome of poor health among the old.",Remaining,0,0

We studied cognitive functioning in four domains at baseline and change over time in fifty-seven cognitively intact individuals from the EMIF-AD 90+ study. Predictors were Aβ status determined by [[18] F]-flutemetamol PET (normal = Aβ - vs. abnormal = Aβ+), cortical thickness in 34 regions and hippocampal volume. Mediation analyses were performed to test whether effects of Aβ on cognitive decline were mediated by atrophy of specific anatomical brain areas.	Subjects had a mean age of 92.7 ± 2.9 years, of whom 19 (33%) were Aβ+. Compared to Aβ-, Aβ+ individuals showed steeper decline on memory (β ± SE = -0.26 ± 0.09), and processing speed (β ± SE = -0.18 ± 0.08) performance over 1.5 years (P < 0.05). Furthermore, medial and lateral temporal lobe atrophy was associated with steeper decline in memory and language across individuals. Mediation analyses revealed that part of the memory decline observed in Aβ+ individuals was mediated through parahippocampal atrophy.	These results show that Aβ abnormality even in the oldest old with initially normal cognition is not part of normal aging, but is associated with a decline in cognitive functioning. Other pathologies may also contribute to decline in the oldest old as cortical thickness predicted cognitive decline similarly in individuals with and without Aβ pathology.",Remaining,0,0
147,27981399,AIDS and behavior,The Usefulness of the CRAFFT in Screening for Problematic Drug and Alcohol Use Among Youth Living with HIV.,"Substance use is highly prevalent among youth living with HIV (YLWH) and negatively impacts HIV care. This study sought to determine whether the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, and Trouble), designed to screen for problematic substance use, is reliably associated with substance use behaviors among YLWH. A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth (ages 12-26) were recruited through the adolescent medicine trials network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. Participants completed a self-administered survey. Over half screened positive on the CRAFFT (i.e., ≥2). Among frequent substance users, those older in age, behaviorally infected, with history of incarceration or unstably housed were more likely to screen positive on the CRAFFT. Study findings suggest that the CRAFFT reliably identifies youth who use substances. Thus, screening measures such as the CRAFFT should be utilized routinely in HIV clinical settings for youth.	El uso de sustancias entre jóvenes que viven con el VIH es muy prevalente y afecta negativamente el cuidado del VIH.

Entre los usuarios frecuentes de sustancias, los mayores de edad, los infectados por conducta en comparación con aquellos infectados perinatalmente, y aquellos con antecedentes de encarcelamiento y viviendas inestables fueron más propensos a resultados positivos en el CRAFFT. Los hallazgos del estudio sugieren que el CRAFFT identifica de manera fiable a los jóvenes que usan sustancias.

Sensory loss in vision and hearing, 8-item CES-D, socio-economic variables, health indicators, and social support were assessed. We calculated the odds ratio for any association between sensory loss and depression.	Vision loss was a consistent predictor of both onset and persistence of depression even after a wide range of covariates had been adjusted, but the association between dual sensory loss and depression disappeared once health indicators were controlled for.

However, little is known about the long-term quality and consistency of the sqEEG signal, which is the objective of this study.	The largest multicenter cohort of sqEEG was analyzed, including 14 patients with epilepsy and 12 healthy subjects, implanted with a sqEEG device (24/7 EEG[™] SubQ), and recorded from 23 to 230 days (median 42 days), with a median data capture rate of 75% (17.9 hours/day). Median power spectral density plots of each subject were examined for physiological peaks, including at diurnal and nocturnal periods. Long-term temporal trends in signal impedance and power spectral features were investigated with subject-specific linear regression models and group-level linear mixed-effects models.	sqEEG spectrograms showed an approximate 1/f power distribution. Diurnal peaks in the alpha range (8-13Hz) and nocturnal peaks in the sigma range (12-16Hz) were seen in the majority of subjects. Signal impedances remained low, and frequency band powers were highly stable throughout the recording periods.	The spectral characteristics of minimally invasive, ultra long-term sqEEG are similar to scalp EEG, whereas the signal is highly stationary. Our findings reinforce the suitability of this system for chronic implantation on diverse clinical applications, from seizure detection and forecasting to brain-computer interfaces.",Remaining,0,0

Height, weight, head circumference and bone age were recorded at regular intervals for the first 6 years of life. The mean SD score (SDS) for height was not significantly different from zero at study entry, but decreased mainly during the second year of life to a nadir of -0.78 in boys and -0.54 in girls at 2.5 years. During the subsequent years, a significant trend towards a regain of height SDS was noted in both sexes. Weight-for-height SDS was close to zero in both sexes, with a significant continuous increasing trend throughout the observation period. Head circumference SDS decreased in boys during the first year of life from -0.28 to -0.68, whereas girls showed only a minor change. During the further follow-up period, head circumference SDS remained at approximately -0.3 in boys and 0.0 in girls. While the mean verbal and performance IQ of the total study population at 5 and 6 years of age did not differ from a group of 212 healthy non-PKU children, patients with a head circumference SDS less than the population median at 2 years of age exhibited poorer cognitive abilities at school age than those patients with a relative head size greater than the population median. The children with a head circumference less than the median at 2 years had smaller head sizes already at birth; in addition, the change in relative head size during the first 2 years was correlated significantly with cognitive abilities at school age in boys. Mean bone age was identical to chronological age at each time point of observation. The rate of maturation was one year of bone age per year of chronological age. No correlation between phenylalanine intake or phenylalanine concentrations and the rates of body or head growth or skeletal maturation could be established. We conclude that despite adequate weight gain, moderate growth retardation occurred during the first 2 years of life in this group of children treated for PKU. Growth was more compromised in boys than in girls and tended to be compensated during later follow-up. Early infantile head circumference and growth appear to be predictors of cognitive development.",Remaining,0,0

155,14689176,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,Community attitudes toward and knowledge of mental illness in South Africa.,"Although recent advances in psychiatry have increased our understanding of psychiatric disorders,many people with chronic or severe psychiatric disorders may be unaware that effective treatment is available. It is possible that ignorance and stigma prevent such persons from seeking appropriate help, and that community attitudes and beliefs play a role in determining the help-seeking behaviour and successful treatment of the mentally ill. Nevertheless, there is little research on the attitudes of lay persons toward mental illness within the South African community.	The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of the general South African public toward mental illness, specifically regarding the causes of illness and treatment options.	The study design employed a questionnaire survey. Structured interviews (n = 667) were conducted with members of the general public. One of eight vignettes, portraying depression, schizophrenia, panic disorder or substance abuse, with subtle or obvious symptoms, was presented to each respondent.	The main findings were that cases were most often conceptualised as stress-related or due to a lack of willpower rather than as medical disorders. Treatment advocated was more often to talk the problem over than to consult professional medical help. Psychotherapy was the preferred treatment option, particularly in vignettes where symptom presentation was subtle, and in cases of substance abuse.	These data suggest that stigma and misinformation regarding mental illness exist, influencing preferred treatment modality and help-seeking behaviour. More work needs to be done to educate the public about the psychobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and about the value of effective treatments. A better understanding of these disorders amongst the public would presumably lessen stigmatisation and encourage the use of currently available and effective interventions.",Remaining,0,0

Chronic treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) reduces ictal central apnoea, a risk factor for SUDEP. Reduced medullary serotonergic neurones, modulators of respiration in response to hypercapnia, were reported in a SUDEP post-mortem series. The amygdala and hippocampus have high serotonergic innervation and are functionally implicated in seizure-related respiratory dysregulation. We explored serotonergic networks in mesial temporal lobe structures in a surgical and post-mortem epilepsy series in relation to SUDEP risk. We stratified 75 temporal lobe epilepsy patients with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE/HS) into high (N = 16), medium (N = 11) and low risk (N = 48) groups for SUDEP based on generalised seizure frequency. We also included the amygdala in 35 post-mortem cases, including SUDEP (N = 17), epilepsy controls (N = 10) and non-epilepsy controls (N = 8). The immunohistochemistry labelling index (LI) and axonal length (AL) of serotonin transporter (SERT)-positive axons were quantified in 13 regions of interest with image analysis. SERT LI was highest in amygdala and subiculum regions. In the surgical series, higher SERT LI was observed in high risk than low risk cases in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and subiculum (p < 0.05). In the post-mortem cases higher SERT LI and AL was observed in the basal and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala and peri-amygdala cortex in SUDEP compared to epilepsy controls (p < 0.05). Patients on SRI showed higher SERT in the dentate gyrus (p < 0.005) and CA4 (p < 0.05) but there was no difference in patients with or without a psychiatric history. Higher SERT in hippocampal subfields in TLE/HS cases with SUDEP risk factors and higher amygdala SERT in post-mortem SUDEP cases than epilepsy controls supports a role for altered serotonergic networks involving limbic regions in SUDEP. This may be of functional relevance through reduced 5-HT availability.",Remaining,0,0

Demographic characteristics, behaviors, and prevalence of HCV antibody among 5088 injection drug users aged 18-40 years from Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and New York, New York, enrolled in 3 related studies--Collaborative Injection Drug User Study (CIDUS) I (1994-1996), CIDUS II (1997-1999), and CIDUS III/Drug User Intervention Trial (2002-2004)--were compared using the chi(2) and Mantel-Haenszel tests of significance. Trends over time were assessed by logistic regression.	Prevalence of HCV infection was 65%, 35%, and 35% in CIDUS I, CIDUS II, and CIDUS III, respectively. The adjusted prevalence odds ratio (OR) of being HCV antibody positive increased with the number of years of injection drug use (OR, 1.93 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.68-2.21] for each year of injecting within the first 2 years; OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.07-1.11] for each year of injecting beyond the first 2 years). Significant decreases were observed in the prevalence of HCV antibody between CIDUS I and CIDUS III in Baltimore (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.20-0.43) and Los Angeles (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09-0.31) and among people of races other than black in Chicago (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.08-0.17). No decrease in prevalence was seen in New York (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.69-1.58) or among blacks in Chicago (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.16-1.90).	Although regional differences exist, our data suggest that the incidence of HCV infection among injection drug users in the United States decreased from 1994 through 2004.",Remaining,0,0
164,30831339,Addictive behaviors,A cross sectional survey of smoking characteristics and quitting behaviour from a sample of homeless adults in Great Britain.,"Smoking is a key contributor to health and social inequalities and homeless smoking prevalence rates are 4 times higher than the general population. Research on homelessness and smoking to date has been concentrated predominantly in the US and Australia. This study aimed to describe smoking and quitting behaviour in homeless adult smokers in Great Britain. Data on perceptions of, and willingness to try, e-cigarettes were also gathered.	Cross sectional survey of 283 adult smokers accessing homeless support services in Kent, the Midlands, London and Edinburgh. Participants answered a four-part survey: i) demographics; ii) current smoking behaviour and dependence (including the Fagerström Test of Cigarette Dependence [FTCD]); iii) previous quit attempts; and iv) e-cigarettes perceptions.	High levels of cigarette dependence were observed (FTCD: M = 7.78, sd ± 0.98). Although desire to quit was high, most had made fewer than 5 quit attempts and 90% of these lasted less than 24 h. 91.5% reported that others around them also smoked. Previous quit methods used included cold turkey (29.7%), NRT (24.7%), varenicline (22.3%) and bupropion (14.5%). 34% were willing or able to spend £20 or more for an e-cigarette and 82% had tried one in the past although 54% reported that they preferred smoking.	We observed high nicotine dependence, few long-term quit attempts, strong desire to quit and amenability to both traditional cessation methods and e-cigarettes. Community embedded and non-routine approaches to cessation may be promising avenues promoting engagement with the homeless community. Likely barriers to uptake include low affordability, preference for cigarettes and high numbers of smoking acquaintances.",Remaining,0,0

An inventory of scales was developed to improve the assessment of different dimensions of somatic functioning. In order to enhance their specificity and incremental validity, the scales were constructed to be relatively independent of already known general personality variables such as Stress Reaction (neuroticism), Locus of Control, Hypochondriasis, and Absorption. Three scales, derived from orthogonal factor analyses, were developed and cross-validated: (1) Autonomic Response Frequency, assessing spontaneous fluctuations in autonomic responding; (2) Autonomic Response to Stress, assessing the amount of autonomic arousal perceived by a subject in stress situations; and (3) Somatic Response Control, a self-report measure of capacity to control both autonomic and fine muscle responses. The hypothesis that sympathetic and parasympathetic awareness might define two distinct dimensions was not supported by the data. The new scales will be useful in testing hypotheses of possible relationships among the factors measured and behavioral and psychophysiological indicators of the response to stress.",Remaining,0,0
166,32818528,Brain research,"Quality of life 6 and 18 months after mild traumatic brain injury in early childhood: An exploratory study of the role of genetic, environmental, injury, and child factors.","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in early childhood is prevalent, and some children may be at risk for short- and long-term difficulties that could affect quality of life (QoL). Despite growing efforts to understand associations between potential risk factors and outcomes after injury, prognosis is elusive and lacks the inclusion of genetic variables which may convey additional predictive power. This study assessed which factors contribute to pediatric QoL 6 and 18 months post-recruitment in 159 participants (mTBI = 52; orthopedic injury [OI] = 43; typically developing controls [TDC] = 64) aged 18 to 60 months at the time of injury (M = 37.50, SD = 11.69). Family environment, injury characteristics, and child cognitive-behavioral functioning were assessed at 6 months via parent questionnaires and socio-cognitive assessment. QoL was determined using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory at both time points. Genetic information (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] genotype) was collected using saliva samples. Hierarchical regression analyses testing biological, family-environmental, injury and cognitive-behavioral factors revealed that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was a significant independent predictor of better QoL 6 months post-injury in the mTBI group. Lower parental distress significantly and independently predicted higher QoL 18 months after mTBI, and 6 months post-recruitment in the TDC group. At 18 months, models were non-significant for both control groups. Genetic factors involved in neuroplasticity may play an important role in recovery 6 months after mTBI and contribute to outcome via their interplay with environmental factors. Over time, family factors appear to become the primary determinants of post-mTBI outcome.",Remaining,0,0
167,29052307,Developmental science,Instrumental learning and cognitive flexibility processes are impaired in children exposed to early life stress.,"Children who experience severe early life stress show persistent deficits in many aspects of cognitive and social adaptation. Early stress might be associated with these broad changes in functioning because it impairs general learning mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we examined whether individuals who experienced abusive caregiving in childhood had difficulties with instrumental learning and/or cognitive flexibility as adolescents. Fifty-three 14-17-year-old adolescents (31 exposed to high levels of childhood stress, 22 control) completed an fMRI task that required them to first learn associations in the environment and then update those pairings. Adolescents with histories of early life stress eventually learned to pair stimuli with both positive and negative outcomes, but did so more slowly than their peers. Furthermore, these stress-exposed adolescents showed markedly impaired cognitive flexibility; they were less able than their peers to update those pairings when the contingencies changed. These learning problems were reflected in abnormal activity in learning- and attention-related brain circuitry. Both altered patterns of learning and neural activation were associated with the severity of lifetime stress that the adolescents had experienced. Taken together, the results of this experiment suggest that basic learning processes are impaired in adolescents exposed to early life stress. These general learning mechanisms may help explain the emergence of social problems observed in these individuals.",Remaining,0,0
168,18367428,Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape,Long-term cognitive and behavioural follow-up in three patients with eye closure-triggered paroxysmal activity.,"To study clinical, EEG, neuropsychological and behavioural evolution of three patients presenting with epileptic activity triggered by eye closure (EC) over a mean 10-year follow-up period.	All patients were studied at the time of the first observation (T0) and after a long follow-up period (T1). At both T0 and T1, each patient underwent: 1) traditional and specific activation techniques during prolonged video-EEG monitoring to detect possible inducing factors; 2) neuropsychological evaluations during video-EEG monitoring either with eyes closed or eyes open to detect any transient cognitive impairment (TCI); 3) detailed neuropsychological assessment without simultaneous EEG recording, to detect any stable cognitive impairment (SCI).	EEG recordings showed transient, generalized paroxysms in one case and a continuous epileptic activity triggered by eye closure in the other two cases, at both T0 and T1. In all patients, no particular epileptiform discharge-induced factors were identified except for eye blinking (spontaneous, voluntary or induced by corneal reflex). The results of neuropsychological assessment while eyes were closed as compared to performances with eyes open, showed no significant differences at T0 or at T1 in two cases, thus possibly indicating the absence of TCI. Wechsler Intelligence Scales showed a decrease in performance at T1 in the two patients with eye closure-induced, continuous epileptiform activity. Detailed neuropsychological assessment without EEG recordings demonstrated an impairment of facial recognition ability in all three patients at T1.	The lack of any differences between the results of neuropsychological tests performed with eyes open and eyes closed in two patients might suggest that not all eye-closure-triggered paroxysms are associated with TCI. On the other hand, our data highlight that EC-triggered, EEG epileptic discharges can produce long-lasting neuropsychological and behavioural effects, and also indicate that EEG discharges recurring over time might exert a disruptive effect on cognitive functions. Our three patients showed extreme variability across the neuropsychological tasks except for a facial recognition deficit that was evident in all cases, thus suggesting a possible dysfunction of temporo-occipital brain structures and/or of the fusiform face area as recently demonstrated by combined fMRI/EEG studies in patients with fixation-off sensitivity.",Remaining,0,0
169,36078361,International journal of environmental research and public health,Workplace Bullying and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptomology: The Influence of Role Conflict and the Moderating Effects of Neuroticism and Managerial Competencies.,"Research has explored numerous consequences of workplace bullying, including a recent link to the exhibition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology. Role conflict as a workplace stressor may contribute to instances of bullying from a passive perspective, which may lead to PTSD symptomology in victims. What remains less explored is if role conflict has a direct relationship to PTSD symptomology and how personality traits such as neuroticism and workplace factors such as managerial competencies may moderate the stress brought on by role conflict. Hence the present study seeks to examine this gap in the literature. This study utilizes a between-subjects, cross-sectional design with 159 participants, 39.6% male and 60.4% female. Most participants (60%) were Italian workers of a large social cooperative organization. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the measurement model was valid and had an adequate model fit. Results from two separate moderated mediation analyses found a positive, full mediation between the independent variable of role conflict, the mediator of exposure to bullying, and the dependent variable of PTSD symptomology. Furthermore, in this study, neuroticism strengthened the indirect effect while managerial competencies weakened it. The results highlight the importance of training competent managers and providing resources for more vulnerable employees to moderate employee work stress and its negative outcomes.",Remaining,0,0

Recent studies revealed that Hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated glycolysis is one of the sources, as the association of chemoresistance and the expression of HK2 was confirmed in multiple cancers. However, there has been little knowledge of the functional contribution of HK2 to TMZ resistance in GBM. In our study, we found that HK2 expression is crucial for GBM proliferation and chemoresistance. In contrast to the healthy brain, HK2 expression is much higher in human GBM, especially in those patients with GBM recurrence. High HK2 expression is negatively related to the overall survival in GBM patients. HK2 depletion in GBM cells suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to TMZ-induced apoptosis. Both HK2-mediated glycolysis and mitochondria permeability transition pore opening (MPTP) were associated with its function in chemoresistance. Furthermore, we also revealed that the abnormal expression of HK2 was modulated by the expression of HOTAIR, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The absence of HOTAIR in GBM cells suppressed the HK2 expression in protein and mRNA level and, therefore, inhibited the cell proliferation and enhanced the cytotoxicity of TMZ both in vivo and in vitro. HOTAIR promoted the expression of HK2 by targeting mir-125, which suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased the TMZ-induced apoptosis. These findings shed light on a new therapeutic strategy in modulating HOTAIR/miR-125, which may interfere with the expression of HK2, and enhance the therapeutic sensitivity of GBM to TMZ.",Remaining,0,0

We investigated the association between hyperfibrinogenemia upon hospital admission and the short-term prognosis of AIS patients.	A total of 3,212 AIS patients enrolled from December 2013 to May 2014 across 22 hospitals in Suzhou city were included in the present study. Hyperfibrinogenemia was defined as having a serum fibrinogen＞4.0g/L. Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of hyperfibrinogenemia on all-cause in-hospital mortality and poor discharge outcome (modified Rankin Scale score≥3) in AIS patients.	During hospitalization, 106 patients (3.3%) died from all-cause and 1226 (38.2%) patients experienced poor functional outcome at discharge. Multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, white blood cell count and other covariates, showed that hyperfibrinogenemia was associated with a 1.76-fold increase in the risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.81; P-value=0.019). However, there was no significant association between hyperfibrinogenemia and poor outcome at discharge (adjusted odds ratios[OR]1.15; 95% CI 0.86-1.53; P-value=0.338). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses also confirmed a significant association between hyperfibrinogenemia and in-hospital mortality.

The sample comprised 2777 patients with Major Depressive Episode (MDE) enrolled in a multicentre, multinational study originally designed to assess different definitions of mixed depression. Socio-demographic, familial and clinical characteristics were compared in patients with (ADHD + ) and without (ADHD-) comorbid ADHD.	Sixty-one patients (2.2%) met criteria for ADHD. ADHD was associated with a higher number of (hypo)manic symptoms during depression. Mixed depression was more represented in ADHD + patients than in ADHD- using both DSM-5 and experimental criteria. Differences were maintained after removing overlapping symptoms between (hypo)mania and ADHD. ADHD in MDE was also associated with a variety of clinical and course features such as onset before the age of 20, first-degree family history of (hypo)mania, past history of antidepressant-induced (hypo)manic switches, higher number of depressive and affective episodes, atypical depressive features, higher rates of bipolarity specifier, psychiatric comorbidities with eating, anxiety and borderline personality disorders.	The study was primarily designed to address mixed features in ADHD, with slightly reduced sensitivity to the diagnosis of ADHD. Other possible diagnostic biases due to heterogeneity of participating clinicians.	In a sample of major depressive patients, the comorbid diagnosis of current ADHD is associated with bipolar diathesis, mixed features, multiple psychiatric comorbidity and a more unstable course.

176,9292187,Brain and cognition,The decoding of emotional concepts in patients with focal cerebral lesions.,"The effects of focal brain lesions on the decoding of emotional concepts in facial expressions were investigated. Facial emotions are hierarchically organized patterns comprising (1) structural surface features, (2) discrete (primary) emotional categories and (3) secondary dimensions, such as valence and arousal. Categorical decoding was measured using (1) selection of category labels and selection of the named emotion category; (2) matching one facial expression with two choice expressions. Dimensional decoding was assessed by matching one face with two different expressions with regard to valence or arousal. 70 patients with well documented cerebral lesions and 15 matched hospital controls participated in the study. 27 had left brain damage (LBD; 10 frontal, 10 temporal, 7 parietal); 37 had right brain damage (RBD; 15 frontal, 11 temporal, 11 parietal). Six additional patients had lesions involving both frontal lobes. Right temporal and parietal lesioned patients were markedly impaired in the decoding of primary emotions. The same patients also showed a reduced arousal decoding. In contrast to several patients with frontal and left hemisphere lesions, emotional conceptualization and face discrimination was not independent in these groups. No group differences were observed in valence decoding. However, right frontal lesions appeared to interfere with the discrimination of negative valence. Moreover, a distraction by structural features was noted in RBD when facial identities were varied across stimulus and response pictures in matching tasks with differing conceptual load. Our results suggest that focal brain lesions differentially affect the comprehension of emotional meaning in faces depending on the level of conceptual load and interference of structural surface features.",Remaining,0,0

Thus, visual testing could be used as an aid to the clinical diagnosis of dementia. In the present study, exploratory eye movement was measured to evaluate visual cognitive function in elderly subjects, including those with dementia.	We analyzed responsive search scores (RSS) from exploratory eye movements of 300 subjects who were examined with an eye mark recorder while viewing S shaped figures. Subjects were divided into three groups (dementia, intermediate, healthy) from the values of the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating. We further divided the intermediate groups into two subgroups, the high score and low score groups, based on RSS. In 202 subjects, Z-scores of voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	RSS of the dementia group were significantly lower than those in the intermediate and healthy groups, in order: dementia < intermediate < healthy groups. RSS of the low score intermediate group was significantly lower than that of the high score intermediate group. There was no significant difference between the low score intermediate and dementia groups, or between the high score intermediate and healthy groups. No significant differences of either HSD-R or MMSE were observed between the low score and the high score intermediate groups. The Z-score of VSRAD using MRI in the low score intermediate group was significantly higher than that in the high score intermediate group.	These findings suggest that RSS using an eye mark recorder is a useful psychophysiological marker to evaluate the early stage of dementia as well as at-risk elderly people.",Remaining,0,0
179,37369805,Acta neuropathologica,SMN regulates GEMIN5 expression and acts as a modifier of GEMIN5-mediated neurodegeneration.,"GEMIN5 is essential for core assembly of small nuclear Ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of spliceosome formation. Loss-of-function mutations in GEMIN5 lead to a neurodevelopmental syndrome among patients presenting with developmental delay, motor dysfunction, and cerebellar atrophy by perturbing SMN complex protein expression and assembly. Currently, molecular determinants of GEMIN5-mediated disease have yet to be explored. Here, we identified SMN as a genetic suppressor of GEMIN5-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo. We discovered that an increase in SMN expression by either SMN gene therapy replacement or the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), Nusinersen, significantly upregulated the endogenous levels of GEMIN5 in mammalian cells and mutant GEMIN5-derived iPSC neurons. Further, we identified a strong functional association between the expression patterns of SMN and GEMIN5 in patient Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)-derived motor neurons harboring loss-of-function mutations in the SMN gene. Interestingly, SMN binds to the C-terminus of GEMIN5 and requires the Tudor domain for GEMIN5 binding and expression regulation. Finally, we show that SMN upregulation ameliorates defective snRNP biogenesis and alternative splicing defects caused by loss of GEMIN5 in iPSC neurons and in vivo. Collectively, these studies indicate that SMN acts as a regulator of GEMIN5 expression and neuropathologies.",Remaining,0,0

We have found the phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS) to be a highly specific inhibitor of MAO-B, which has led us to postulate that the PS-MAO interaction might offer a basis for the lower MAO levels observed in platelets from certain schizophrenic populations. In this study we compared platelet MAO activity with phospholipid composition in a group of normals and chronic paranoid schizophrenics. The phospholipids in platelets and erythrocytes were extracted and separated by high-performance liquid chromatography into major classes phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and PS. The paranoid subjects showed statistically significantly lower MAO activity as well as higher mean levels of PS and lower levels of PC in both platelets and erythrocytes, consistent with our hypothesis.

Nevertheless, these modalities are often insufficient for achieving a definite diagnosis. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the combination of these tools.	The SPECT radiotracers [I]-N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) and meta-[I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) were used to research presynaptic dopaminergic projections (DAT SPECT) and myocardial adrenergic innervation (MIBG scintigraphy), respectively. PD patients (n=15; age: 61.5±13.6 years) and non-PD patients (n=19; age: 62.6±14.2 years) who underwent both tests were enrolled in this study. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were used to set the cutoff values of the specific binding ratio in DAT SPECT and the heart to mediastinum ratio in delayed scan in MIBG scintigraphy for differentiating PD from non-PD. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and test accuracy of the individual methods and also the combination of these two modalities.	When DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy were used individually, they showed mild accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD (DAT, 67.6%; MIBG, 67.6%). The combination of the two approaches using cutoff values of less than 3.24 for the specific binding ratio and less than 2.745 for the delayed heart to mediastinum ratio enabled more accurate differentiation between PD and non-PD. The accuracy of these indices in distinguishing PD from non-PD was 79.4%.	These results suggested that the combination of DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy may improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD.",Remaining,0,0

186,28457587,The British journal of oral & maxillofacial surgery,Integration of mental health screening in the management of patients with temporomandibular disorders.,"Mental health disorders such as depression or anxiety, or both, are more common in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) (16%-40%) than in the general population (16%), and failure to recognise them may be detrimental to the management of TMD. Paper-based screening tools previously reported in this group require assessment by clinicians and subsequent collation of data. We describe our experience of a new system - IMPARTS (Integrating mental and physical: research training and services), which uses validated tools to identify and to monitor the progress of patients who may benefit from psychological intervention. At outpatient clinics, patients used an electronic tablet to complete the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Inclusion of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Data were linked directly to their electronic record to allow the results, with suggestions for treatment, to be reviewed immediately during the consultation. A total of 162 patients were included. Screening showed that referral was required in 28 (17%) with a probable major depressive disorder and 32 (20%) with a general anxiety disorder. Two (1%), who were identified as being at high risk of suicide or self-harm, were referred for immediate psychological assessment. Use of the system can aid the holistic treatment of patients with TMD through appropriate referral. Early identification of mental health problems and concurrent management are most beneficial in those who have had symptoms of TMD for up to two years, and are therefore essential.",Remaining,0,0
187,18952610,The Journal of biological chemistry,A Drosophila protein family implicated in pheromone perception is related to Tay-Sachs GM2-activator protein.,"Low volatility, lipid-like cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones produced by Drosophila melanogaster females play an essential role in triggering and modulating mating behavior, but the chemosensory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Recently, we showed that the CheB42a protein, which is expressed in only 10 pheromone-sensing taste hairs on the front legs of males, modulates progression to late stages of male courtship behavior in response to female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons. Here we report that expression of all 12 genes in the CheB gene family is predominantly or exclusively gustatory-specific, and occurs in many different, often non-overlapping patterns. Only the Gr family of gustatory receptor genes displays a comparable variety of gustatory-specific expression patterns. Unlike Grs, however, expression of all but one CheB gene is sexually dimorphic. Like CheB42a, other CheBs may therefore function specifically in gustatory perception of pheromones. We also show that CheBs belong to the ML superfamily of lipid-binding proteins, and are most similar to human GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP). In particular, GM2-AP residues involved in ligand binding are conserved in CheBs but not in other ML proteins. Finally, CheB42a is specifically secreted into the inner lumen of pheromone-sensing taste hairs, where pheromones interact with membrane-bound receptors. We propose that CheB proteins interact directly with lipid-like Drosophila pheromones and modulate their detection by the gustatory signal transduction machinery. Furthermore, as loss of GM2-AP in Tay-Sachs disease prevents degradation of GM2 gangliosides and results in neurodegeneration, the function of CheBs in pheromone response may involve biochemical mechanisms critical for lipid metabolism in human neurons.",Remaining,0,0

Alcoholic men (n = 43) and women (n = 21) who responded to notices about a research study were screened, clinically assessed and administered Wechsler Memory and Intelligence tests after 3 months of sobriety, on average. Cognitive performance was compared with that of an age-matched sample of healthy controls (n = 51).	As a group, the alcoholics achieved significantly lower scores than controls on summary indices of the Wechsler Memory and Adult Intelligence Scales and showed greater decline from estimated premorbid intelligence levels than controls. Almost 60% of the alcoholics had at least one additional psychiatric (mood or anxiety) or past substance-dependence comorbidity. There were no marked sex differences in patterns of comorbidity. Comorbid alcoholics were younger, had consumed less alcohol over their lifetime and performed between noncomorbid alcoholics and controls on all tests.	Mood and anxiety comorbidity did not necessarily compound poor cognitive test performance associated with chronic alcohol misuse. While unexpected, this finding suggests that, in this sample, poorer cognitive performance was more a function of alcoholism per se than nonalcoholic comorbidity.",Remaining,0,0

Six years of annual data were analyzed for 506 boys using a mixed effects polynomial growth curve model. They tested whether distinct measures of psychopathology and behavioral problems (i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, depression, and violence) assessed in early adolescence could prospectively predict level and change in alcohol and marijuana use. Higher levels of all of the types of psychopathology predicted higher levels of alcohol use, and higher levels of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and violence predicted higher levels of marijuana use. Only conduct disorder predicted linear growth in alcohol use, and none of the measures predicted growth in marijuana use. The results suggest that drug use prevention programs should target youths with early symptoms of psychopathology.",Remaining,0,0

This study compares the attitudes towards via parenteral drug addicts held by nursing students and non specialized nurses. By means of a pilot study which used a selfadministered Litcker scale questionnaire developed by the study authors, two samples were selected: a student sample (n = 40) and a non specialized nurse sample (n = 40). These variables were evaluated in the two samples: age, professional experience, and the frequency in sporadic care for via parenteral drug addicts. The conclusion drawn from this study is that the attitude of nursing students is significantly more positive towards via parenteral drug addicts than the attitude held by non specialized nurses.

191,20309621,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,The heavy burden of psychiatric comorbidity in youth with autism spectrum disorders: a large comparative study of a psychiatrically referred population.,The objective of the study was to systematically examine patterns of psychiatric comorbidity in referred youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) including autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Consecutively referred children and adolescents to a pediatric psychopharmacology program were assessed with structured diagnostic interview and measures of psychosocial functioning. Comparisons were made between those youth satisfying diagnostic criteria for ASD and age and sex matched youth without ASD referred to the same clinical program. 9.3% (217/2323) of the referred youth (age range: 3-17 years) met DSM-III-R criteria for ASD. ASD youth suffered from significantly higher number of comorbid disorders than comparisons (6.4 ± 2.7 vs. 5.2 ± 2.9; p < 0.001). Ninety-five percent of the youth with ASD had three or more comorbid psychiatric disorders and 74% had five or more comorbid disorders. ASD youth were also more functionally impaired and required extra-assistance in school and therapeutic interventions at higher rates than age and sex matched non-ASD referred youth. Youth with ASD have high levels of psychiatric comorbidity and dysfunction comparable to the referred population of youth without ASD. These findings emphasize the heavy burden of psychiatric comorbidity afflicting youth with ASD and may be important targets for intervention.,Remaining,0,0
192,35332187,Scientific reports,"Effects of Apolipoprotein E polymorphism on carotid intima-media thickness, incident myocardial infarction and incident stroke.","The Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphism (rs429358 and rs7412) shows a well-established association with lipid profiles, but its effect on cardiovascular disease is still conflicting. Therefore, we examined the association of different APOE alleles with common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), carotid plaques, incident myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. We analyzed data from 3327 participants aged 20-79 years of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) from Northeast Germany with a median follow-up time of 14.5 years. Linear, logistic, and Cox-regression models were used to assess the associations of the APOE polymorphism with CCA-IMT, carotid plaques, incident MI and stroke, respectively. In our study, the APOE E2 allele was associated with lower CCA-IMT at baseline compared to E3 homozygotes (β: - 0.02 [95% CI - 0.04, - 0.004]). Over the follow-up, 244 MI events and 218 stroke events were observed. APOE E2 and E4 allele were not associated with incident MI (E2 HR: 1.06 [95% CI 0.68, 1.66]; E4 HR: 1.03 [95% CI 0.73, 1.45]) and incident stroke (E2 HR: 0.79 [95% CI 0.48, 1.30]; E4 HR: 0.96 [95% CI 0.66, 1.38]) in any of the models adjusting for potential confounders. However, the positive association between CCA-IMT and incident MI was more pronounced in E2 carriers than E3 homozygotes. Thus, our study suggests that while APOE E2 allele may predispose individuals to lower CCA-IMT, E2 carriers may be more prone to MI than E3 homozygotes as the CCA-IMT increases. APOE E4 allele had no effect on CCA-IMT, plaques, MI or stroke.",Remaining,0,0

Furthermore, a specific category of women, deemed to be women-at-risk, face particular challenges in their journey and resettlement process. This longitudinal study investigated psychological distress in refugee women-at-risk one year after resettlement in Australia. Follow-up survey of 83 women-at-risk (mean age = 33.41 years; SD = 11.93) assessed: trauma events and symptoms; loss events and loss distress; level of post-migration problems; anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms; and absence of trust in community members. Participants demonstrated no symptom change since initial assessment (p > .05). Substantial proportions of women reported traumatization (39%), PTSD (20%), anxiety (32%), and depression (39%) above clinical cut-offs, and high levels of somatization and loss distress. Post-migration problems, trauma events, and region of birth were associated with all symptoms, with post-migration problems the strongest predictor. Absence of trust in community members was associated with trauma, depression, and somatic symptoms. Initial trauma and somatic symptoms were associated with follow-up traumatic and somatic symptoms. Loss and trauma events were associated with loss distress. Findings underline the role of post-migration problems on psychological distress and the need to consider women's psychological wellbeing in the context of their trauma and loss history, potential impacts of ethnicity, and complex socio-cultural dynamics underpinning issues of trust within communities. Effective service delivery requires that practitioners screen for and address psychological distress in women-at-risk at least up to 18 months after resettlement.",Remaining,0,0
194,21669013,Journal of child language,Individual differences in pronoun reversal: evidence from two longitudinal case studies.,"Pronoun reversal, the use of you for self-reference and I for an addressee, has often been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and impaired language. However, recent case studies have shown the phenomenon also to occur in typically developing and even precocious talkers. This study examines longitudinal corpus data from two children, a typically developing girl, and a boy with Asperger's syndrome. Both were precocious talkers who reversed the majority of their personal pronouns for several months. A comparison of the children's behaviors revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in pronoun use: the girl showed 'semantic confusion', using second person pronouns for self-reference, whereas the boy showed a discourse-pragmatic deficit related to perspective-taking. The results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms underlying pronoun reversal and provide qualified support for both the Name/Person Hypothesis (Clark, 1978; Charney, 1980b) and the Plurifunctional Pronoun Hypothesis (Chiat, 1982).",Remaining,0,0
195,30700595,Neurology,Histopathology of diffusion imaging abnormalities in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"We sought to determine the underlying mechanism for altered white matter diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures at the histopathologic level in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).	Formalin-fixed intact hemispheres from 9 CAA cases and 2 elderly controls were scanned at 3-tesla MRI, including a diffusion-weighted sequence. DTI measures (i.e., fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) and histopathology measures were obtained from 2 tracts: the anterior thalamic radiation and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.	FA was reduced in both tracts and MD was increased in cases with CAA compared to controls. Regional FA was significantly correlated with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, axonal density, and white matter microinfarcts. MD correlated significantly with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, and white matter microinfarcts, but not axonal density. FA and MD did not correlate with oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or gliosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that tissue rarefaction (β = -0.32 ± 0.12, p = 0.009) and axonal density (β = 0.25 ± 0.12, p = 0.04) were both independently associated with FA, whereas myelin density was independently associated with MD (β = -0.32 ± 0.12, p = 0.013). Finally, we found an association between increased MD in the frontal white matter and CAA severity in the frontal cortex (p = 0.035).	These results suggest that overall tissue loss, and in particular axonal and myelin loss, are major components underlying CAA-related alterations in DTI properties observed in living patients. The findings allow for a more mechanistic interpretation of DTI parameters in small vessel disease and for mechanism-based selection of candidate treatments to prevent vascular cognitive impairment.",Remaining,0,0

Latent class analyses were used to characterize polysubstance abuse/dependence (AB/D) in 43 093 individuals who participated in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the association between the classes of life-time illicit drug AB/D and gender, age and race, as well as life-time Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV) alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia and antisocial personality disorder.	Five latent classes were identified: no AB/D (class 1: 92.5%), cannabis AB/D only (class 2: 5.8%), stimulants + hallucinogen AB/D (class 3: 0.6%), prescription drug AB/D (class 4: 0.6%) and polysubstance AB/D (class 5: 0.5%). Major depressive disorder and nicotine dependence were associated most strongly with class 5. Anxiety disorders were associated strongly with the prescription drug AB/D class while alcohol AB/D and ASPD were associated with classes 2, 3, 4 and 5 when compared to the reference class (class 1).	Significant heterogeneity exists in this US population for polysubstance AB/D patterns with evidence for a subgroup with high rates of sedative, tranquilizer and opiate AB/D and a history of anxiety disorders, a stimulant/hallucinogens group, a high-risk group with elevated rates of all psychiatric disorders and a milder cannabis AB/D only group. Replication of such classes across other samples has significant implications, such as characterizing risk groups that may be etiologically diverse.",Remaining,0,0

Participants in the Women's Health Initiative who had Type 2 diabetes and data on depressive symptoms (N=8895) were included in the analyses. In multivariable linear regression models controlling for sociodemographic, medical and psychosocial covariates, we examined the main effect of depressive symptoms, as well as the interactions between depressive symptoms and antidepressant use, and between depressive symptoms and optimism, on sleep disturbance, physical activity, physical health-related quality of life; and global quality of life.	In all, 16% of women with Type 2 diabetes reported elevated depressive symptoms. In multivariable analyses, women with depressive symptoms had greater sleep disturbance (P<0.0001) and lower global quality of life (P<.0001). We found evidence of significant statistical interaction in the models for quality-of-life outcomes: the increased risk of poor physical health-related quality of life associated with antidepressant use was stronger in women without vs with depressive symptoms, and the association between greater optimism and higher global quality of life was stronger in women with vs without depressive symptoms.	To improve health behaviours and quality of life in women with Type 2 diabetes, sociodemographic and medical characteristics may identify at-risk populations, while psychosocial factors including depression and optimism may be important targets for non-pharmacological intervention.",Remaining,0,0

NTD is associated with impaired folate metabolism. We investigated whether schizophrenia is also linked with a dysfunctional folate metabolism. In addition to the prevalence of the 677C-->T mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, we compared plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations of 35 schizophrenic patients with those of 104 unrelated controls. Schizophrenic patients had significantly lower plasma folate concentrations after adjustment for Hcy levels, and elevated RBC folate levels compared to controls. Vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and Hcy levels did not differ from control values. Plasma folate levels below the 10th percentile of controls were associated with an approximate 4-7-fold (before and after adjustment of folate levels for Hcy, respectively) risk of having schizophrenia. In addition, a significant dose-response relation between plasma folate concentrations and risk for schizophrenia suggested a protective effect by high plasma folate concentrations. Elevated Hcy levels and, in line with this finding, homozygosity for the 677C-->T mutation in the MTHFR gene were not associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia. Evidence is presented suggesting that folate metabolism is disturbed in schizophrenic patients, independently of Hcy.",Remaining,0,0

201,1359657,Surgical neurology,Spinal epidural abscess: a report of 40 cases and review.,"Despite modern medical advances, the morbidity and mortality rates associated with spinal epidural abscess remain significant, and the diagnosis often is elusive. A retrospective study was undertaken to define better the incidence and clinical features of this infection, and to establish current diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. Forty cases of spinal epidural abscess were encountered at our institution between July 1979 and March 1991. All medical records and radiological images were reviewed. We report a significant increase in the incidence of epidural abscess after June 1988 (p = 0.0195). Sixteen patients used drugs intravenously, and six had undergone spinal procedures. Twelve patients were misdiagnosed in various emergency rooms or clinics and discharged. Localized back pain, fever, and neurological deficit remained the typical clinical manifestations. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated uniformly when measured (21 cases). Magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic specifically in 23 of 24 instances. The majority of patients underwent surgical drainage, but five selected patients were managed nonoperatively. The highly variable presentation of spinal epidural abscess may confuse the diagnosis and delay indicated surgical intervention. Localized back pain in a febrile patient at significant risk for epidural abscess warrants erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement. The presence of erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevation or evidence of spinal cord compression on physical examination are indications for immediate magnetic resonance imaging examination with contrast enhancement. Surgical drainage with sustained intravenous antibiotic treatment remains the cornerstone of therapy. Nonoperative management may be considered in selected cases.",Remaining,0,0

Data were from approximately 1200 adults from 465 families assessed as part of a large family and genetic study of OCD. The association of three parenting factors, for fathers and mothers, with offspring OCD status were examined; analyses were stratified by parental OCD status and family loading for OCD (multiplex versus sporadic).	Three factors were derived by principal components factor analysis of the PBI (maternal and paternal care, overprotection and control). Maternal overprotection was associated with OCD in offspring with familial OCD (familial cases) but only if neither parent was affected with OCD, which suggests independent but additive environmental and genetic risk (OR = 5.9, 95% CI 1.2, 29.9, p = 0.031). Paternal care was a protective factor in those not at high genetic risk (sporadic cases) (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 0.8, p = 0.027). Maternal overprotection was also associated with offspring OCD in sporadic families (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3, 6.6, p = 0.012). The finding that parental overprotection and care were not associated with offspring OCD when at least one parent had OCD addressed directly the hypothesis of maternal or paternal OCD adversely impacting parenting.	This study provides evidence that aspects of parenting may contribute to the development of OCD among offspring. Prospective studies of children at risk for OCD are needed to explore the direction of causality.",Remaining,0,0
203,37905374,Cognitive science,Repeat After Me? Both Children With and Without Autism Commonly Align Their Language With That of Their Caregivers.,"Linguistic repetitions in children are conceptualized as negative in children with autism - echolalia, without communicative purpose - and positive in typically developing (TD) children - linguistic alignment involved in shared engagement, common ground and language acquisition. To investigate this apparent contradiction we analyzed spontaneous speech in 67 parent-child dyads from a longitudinal corpus (30 minutes of play activities at 6 visits over 2 years). We included 32 children with autism and 35 linguistically matched TD children (mean age at recruitment 32.76 and 20.27 months). We found a small number of exact repetitions in both groups (roughly 1% of utterances across visits), which increased over time in children with autism and decreased in the TD group. Partial repetitions were much more frequent: children reused caregivers' words at high rates regardless of diagnostic group (24% of utterances at first visit), and this increased in frequency (but not level) over time, faster for TD children (at final visit: 33% for autism, 40% for TD). The same happened for partial repetition of syntax and semantic alignment. However, chance alignment (as measured by surrogate pairs) also increased and findings for developmental changes were reliable only for syntactic and semantic alignment. Children with richer linguistic abilities also displayed a higher tendency to partially re-use their caregivers' language (alignment rates and semantic alignment). This highlights that all children commonly re-used the words, syntax, and topics of their caregivers, albeit with some quantitative differences, and that most repetition was at least potentially productive, with repeated language being re-contextualized and integrated with non-repeated language. The salience of echolalia in ASD might be partially explained by slight differences in frequency, amplified by lower semantic alignment, persistence over time, and expectations of echolalia. More in-depth qualitative and quantitative analyses of how repetitions are used and received in context are needed.",Remaining,0,0

Before treatment, the diameter of the ONS subarachnoid space ranged from 2.58 to 4.21 mm (mean 3.34 mm) and the thickness from 0 to 0.48 mm (mean 0.15 mm). Both measurements showed significant correlations with CSF opening pressure, and 8 patients had no CSF space before treatment. The size of CSF space increased in many patients after effective treatment.	Disappearance of the CSF space in the ONS was frequently observed in patients with SIH. This characteristic finding may be useful in the diagnosis of SIH as well as in the evaluation of treatment effectiveness.",Remaining,0,0

Medicaid claims data from two states were analyzed with a focus on adults treated for schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia. Patient groups were compared regarding demographic characteristics, pharmacologic treatment, and health service use during 180 days before and after a claim for either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.	A larger proportion of patients were treated for schizophrenia (N=38,760; 70.1%) than for schizoaffective disorder (N=16,570; 29.9%).

After the index claim, a similar proportion of both diagnostic groups were treated with antipsychotic medications (schizoaffective disorder, 87.3%; schizophrenia, 87.0%), although patients with schizoaffective disorder were significantly more likely than patients with schizophrenia to receive antidepressants (61.7% versus 44.0%, p<.001), mood stabilizers (55.2% versus 34.4%, p<.001), and anxiolytics (43.2% versus 35.1%, p<.001).

In contrast, mothers' data show an increased risk for all psychiatric syndromes covered in the study (including depression, anxiety, oppositionalism, inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and antisocial acts). Results from multivariate analysis support the hypothesis that the discrepancy between mothers and children is in part a function of the tendency of depressed mothers to view their children as more symptomatic.

208,3226364,Medical hypotheses,The TILT formula for brain lesions.,"A formula to evaluate and grade brain lesions is reported. The formula is based on 4 descriptive factors which characterize the lesion severity and potential outcome on the subject. The factors are, type of lesion, intensity of lesion, location and time of lesion duration before therapy is applied (TILT). A relative value is assigned to each TILT factor and the sum of these values determines the severity of the injury or traumindex. The relative benefit of specific therapy can then be assessed quickly and objectively by applying its effect on TILT. Three examples picked at random from the literature, illustrate application of TILT comparing 'claimed' and 'apparent' benefit of specific treatments. The formula is useful for both model-induced basic and sustained clinical injuries of the brain.",Remaining,0,0

When maximizing selection of true positive cases, scores on a subset of PQ items that assess positive symptoms predicted a concurrent prodromal or psychotic SIPS diagnosis with 90% sensitivity and 49% specificity. The PQ shows good preliminary validity in detecting individuals with an interview-diagnosed prodromal or psychotic syndrome, but it is less sensitive to the threshold between prodromal and full-blown psychosis.",Remaining,0,0
210,1358438,Cancer research,Evidence for the involvement of a potential second tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 17 distinct from p53 in malignant astrocytomas.,"Molecular analysis of malignant astrocytomas demonstrated three distinct groups of tumors with chromosome 17p abnormalities, which include (a) deletion of the p53 locus (17p13.1) and mutations in the remaining allele, (b) deletion of the p53 locus but no detectable mutations in the remaining allele, and (c) deletions not including the p53 locus but mutations in one of the alleles. Furthermore, deletion mapping analysis demonstrated allelic loss of genes distal to D17S28/D17S5 markers (17p13.3) in group C tumors. The loss of heterozygosity of genes on chromosome 17 without detectable mutation (group B) or deletion (group C) in the p53 gene implies the presence of a second tumor suppressor gene in the telomeric region of 17p, the homozygous functional inactivation of which may play a role, either alone or in conjunction with p53, in the initiation and/or progression of astrocytic neoplasms.",Remaining,0,0

Using a standard recognition memory task, we conducted a pilot study to examine how 24 hours of tobacco abstinence in moderate to heavy smokers would affect memory in males and females. Twenty-five moderate to heavy smokers were tested following a period of smoking normally and following 24 hours of tobacco abstinence. At each session, participants completed a recognition memory task in which items were studied under full- and divided-attention conditions (a standard manipulation of memory encoding) as well as tests of passive short-term and working memory (forward and backward digit span). Tobacco abstinence significantly reduced memory performance under full attention conditions for males but not for females. A significant main effect of smoking status in which abstinence significantly reduced performance, as well as a main effect of encoding condition (divided attention < full attention), were found. Our results demonstrate that there may be substantial sex differences in the cognitive effects of tobacco abstinence. While preliminary, the data suggest the need for further, more extensive study of how males and females differ during tobacco abstinence. Such information will inform the best strategies for tobacco cessation efforts.",Remaining,0,0
213,25364240,Clinical interventions in aging,The relationship between cholesterol and cognitive function is homocysteine-dependent.,"Previous studies have identified hyperlipidemia as a potential risk factor for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, studies on cholesterol measured in late-life and cognitive function have been inconsistent. Few studies have explored nonlinear relationships or considered interactions with other biomarker measures.	A cross-sectional sample of 1,889 participants from four rural counties in the People's Republic of China was included in this analysis. Serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and homocysteine levels were measured in fasting blood samples. A composite cognitive score was derived based on nine standardized cognitive test scores. Analysis of covariance models were used to investigate the association between biomarker measures and the composite cognitive scores.	There was a significant interaction between the homocysteine quartile group and the cholesterol quartile group on cognitive scores (P=0.0478). In participants with normal homocysteine levels, an inverse U-shaped relationship between total cholesterol level and cognitive score was found, indicating that both low and high cholesterol levels were associated with lower cognitive scores. In participants with high homocysteine levels, no significant association between cholesterol and cognition was found.	The relationship between cholesterol levels and cognitive function depends upon homocysteine levels, suggesting an interactive role between cholesterol and homocysteine on cognitive function in the elderly population. Additional research is required to confirm our findings in other populations, and to explore potential mechanisms underlying the lipid-homocysteine interaction.",Remaining,0,0

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of mutations occurring in exon 14 of ATP7B gene in Romanian patients referred to a tertiary gastroenterology center, with known or suspected WD and in asymptomatic first degree relatives of index cases.	93 patients were included in the study. Exon 14 of ATP7B gene has been amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and mutations identified by sequencing.	Only H1069Q missense mutation was detected in our study group. In patients with an established diagnosis of WD (38 cases), 34.2% were heterozygous for H1069Q and 21.1% were homozygous, with an allelic frequency of 38.1%. In paediatric WD patients (12 cases) 25% were heterozygous and 16.7% were homozygous (not significant versus adult population). Among asymptomatic first degree relatives of patients with WD (12 siblings, 25 parents) there were 40.5% cases heterozygous for H1069Q. In patients with suspected WD (17 cases), only 5.9% were heterozygous and no homozygous patient was identified. In our study group, H1069Q screening alone could not raise the Leipzig score to confirm diagnosis in patients with suspected WD or in asymptomatic first degree relatives.

We screened neurocognitive functioning in 103 adolescents with SCD (16-17 years, 50% female) and compared outcomes between patients with a history of exposure to hydroxycarbamide (n = 12 HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia; n = 52 HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia) and those never treated with hydroxycarbamide (n = 31 HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia; n = 8 HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia). Demographic distributions were similar between the groups. After adjusting for socioeconomic status, the hydroxycarbamide group had significantly higher scores on nonverbal IQ (HbSC/HbSβ thalassaemia: P = 0·036, effect size [d] = 0·65), reaction speed (HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia: P = 0·002, d = 1·70), sustained attention (HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia: P = 0·014, d = 1·30), working memory (HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia: P = 0·034, d = 0·71) and verbal memory (HbSC/HbSβ[+] thalassaemia: P = 0·038, d = 0·84) when compared to those who did not receive hydroxycarbamide. In patients with HbSS/HbSβ[0] thalassaemia, longer treatment duration with hydroxycarbamide was associated with better verbal memory (P = 0·009) and reading (P = 0·002). Markers of hydroxycarbamide effect, including higher fetal haemoglobin (HbF), higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and lower white blood cell count (WBC), were associated with better verbal fluency (HbF: P = 0·014, MCV: P = 0·006, WBC: P = 0·047) and reading (MCV: P = 0·021, WBC: P = 0·037).

For this retrospective analysis, 42 women and 42 men from the Innsbruck RLS database matched by age and therapy were included. Demographic data as well as different severity scales (IRLS, RLS-6 and CGI) were evaluated. Laboratory parameters included several indicators of serum iron status. In all patients, polysomnography was performed according to the AASM guidelines, and periodic leg movements during sleep were scored according to the AASM criteria. IRLS, RLS-6 and CGI revealed more severe symptoms in women (IRLS median [range]: 17.5 [0-35] versus 13.5 [0-32], p = 0.028; RLS-6 median [range]: 18 [0-39] versus 12 [1-42], p = 0.014). Women had lower serum ferritin levels than men (median [range] in μg L[-1] : 74 [9-346] versus 167 [15-389], p < 0.001). Twenty-two women and eight men (53.7% versus 22.2%, p = 0.003) had ferritin values below 75 μg L[-1] .

In the present study, we investigated the expression of the messenger ribonucleic acid PDGF A and B chains and the PDGF alpha and beta receptors in 17 cases of oligodendrogliomas.	Measurements of messenger ribonucleic acid levels were obtained using radioactive complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probes. Protein expression was analyzed with specific antibodies.	Sixteen of 17 tumors expressed the PDGF A subunit and all the PDGF alpha receptors. Furthermore, all the tumors expressed PDGF B and PDGF beta receptor subunits.

Assessment of patients was based on the clinical diagnosis of a major depressive disorder as established by the criteria of the DSM-IV-TR, the geriatric depression scale GDS-15 and the LEIPAD questionnaire specific to subjects aged 65 or over living at home. Spouses were assessed by GDS-15, the Zarit scale for assessing caregiver burden and the LEIPAD questionnaire. The HRQoL of controls, who were matched for age, sex and educational level, was assessed by LEIPAD.

Eighteen consecutive patients with symptoms of acute stroke underwent PCT at admission. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all patients after 3.6 +/- 1.7 days (range, 1.5-6 days). PCT maps were generated focusing on the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) ipsilateral and contralateral to the ischemic lesion as AIFs. Infarct, penumbra, and total ischemic lesion were delineated on cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps. CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) were calculated in the ischemic regions as provided by the 3 different AIFs, the normality test was applied for the obtained parameters, and the values were correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient). Volumes of the ischemic regions (as obtained by the different AIFs) also were correlated and compared (paired t test) to the follow-up infarct volume.	The CBF and CBV values obtained by the different AIFs in the infarct, penumbra, and total ischemic lesion were significantly correlated (r=0.94-0.96, P<or=0.01).

If the intervention protocol was not adhered to by the practitioner then patient receipt, understanding and enactment levels were reduced. Recruitment difficulties in terms of the gap between initially being recruited into the study and attending an intervention consultation also reduced the effectiveness of the intervention. Patient attributes such as motivation to learn and engage contributed to the success of the uptake of the intervention.

In 2005, 47 laboratory-confirmed and probable clinical cases of SLEV infection were reported in Córdoba, Argentina. Although the causes of 2005 outbreak remain unknown, they might be related not only to virological factors, but also to ecological and environmental conditions. We hypothesized that one of the factors for SLE reemergence in Córdoba, Argentina, was the introduction of a new SLEV genotype (SLEV genotype III), with no previous activity in the area. In order to evaluate this hypothesis we carried out a molecular characterization of SLEV detections from mosquitoes collected between 2001 and 2004 in Córdoba city. A total of 315 mosquito pools (11,002 individuals) including 12 mosquitoes species were analyzed. Overall, 20 pools (8 mosquitoes species) were positive for SLEV. During this study, genotypes II, V and VII were detected. No mosquito pool infected with genotype III was detected before the 2005 outbreak. Genotype V was found every year and in the 8 sampled sites. Genotypes II and VII showed limited temporal and spatial activities. We cannot dismiss the association of genotype II and V as etiological agents during the outbreak. However, the silent circulation of other SLEV strains in Córdoba city before the 2005 outbreak suggests that the introduction of genotype III was an important factor associated to this event. Not mutually exclusive, other factors such as changes in avian hosts and mosquitoes vectors communities, driven by climatic and environmental modifications, should also be taken into consideration in further studies.",Remaining,0,0

As a result, it is becoming obvious that the clinical presentation of these smaller lesions can be somewhat variant to what is considered typical for an acoustic neuroma. Likewise, although the sensitivity of auditory brain stem response for larger tumors is believed to be quite good, the sensitivity for smaller tumors has recently been questioned, particularly when the patient is first seen early in the course of the disease with only mild otologic complications. To assess auditory brain stem response results as well as clinical and audiologic presentations, we conducted a retrospective study of patients treated for small acoustic tumors (less than 1 cm). Of the 70 patients included in the study, auditory brain stem response was abnormal in 65 (93%), on the basis of wave V latency prolongation and interaural latency differences. This would indicate that auditory brain stem response is a valid screening test for acoustic tumors, even in early stages of development. The clinical presentation of patients with small acoustic tumors was similar to that reported for acoustic tumors in general, but with vertigo occurring more frequently in patients with smaller tumors. Several atypical patterns of hearing loss were also noted.",Remaining,0,0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PPCS in children after mTBI and to identify clinical variables in children who are at high risk for developing PPCS. A multicenter, retrospective matched cohort in which PPCS symptoms were evaluated in children 8-15-year-old, 6-60 months after being admitted to the emergency department because of mTBI. The control group included children admitted to the emergency department because of uncomplicated distal radius fractures. The children's guardians were interviewed for the presence of PPCS symptoms using the 'Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire'. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of PPCS. Two-hundred and five children were included in the mTBI group and 205 in the control. The median time from the injury was 33.5 months in the mTBI group and 33.8 in the control. The prevalence of PPCS in the mTBI group was 25.3% and PPCS like symptoms in the control was 2.4%, p < 0.001. Within the 6-60 months period, the PPCS prevalence was not influenced by the time that elapsed from the injury. In the mTBI group, motor vehicle accidents and adolescence were found to be risk factors for PPCS. PPCS is underdiagnosed in the pediatric population and 25% of children admitted to the ED due to mTBI may suffer from PPCS.

Because we found unusual phenotypes in our cohort, we performed a systematic review of genetically confirmed KCS cases using PubMed and Scopus. Evaluation by 3 researchers led to the inclusion of 26 papers for KCS1 and 16 for KCS2, totaling 205 patients. Data were extracted following the Cochrane guidelines and assessed by 2 independent researchers.	Several patients in our KCS2 cohort presented with intellectual disability (3/10) and chronic kidney disease (6/10), which are not considered common findings in KCS2. Systematic review of all reported KCS cases showed that the phenotypes of KCS1 and KCS2 overlap for postnatal growth retardation (KCS1: 52/52, KCS2: 23/23), low parathyroid hormone levels (121/121, 16/20), electrolyte disturbances (139/139, 24/27), dental abnormalities (47/50, 15/16), ocular abnormalities (57/60, 22/23), and seizures/spasms (103/115, 13/16). Symptoms more prevalent in KCS1 included intellectual disability (74/80, 5/24), whereas in KCS2 bone cortical thickening (1/18, 16/20) and medullary stenosis (7/46, 27/28) were more common.	Our case series established chronic kidney disease as a new feature of KCS2. In the literature, we found substantial overlap in the phenotypic spectra of KCS1 and KCS2, but identified intellectual disability and the abnormal bone phenotype as the most distinguishing features.",Remaining,0,0

We examined within-trial spatial memory by using a relocation search paradigm introduced by Kristjansson (2000) (modified from Horowitz & Wolfe, 1998), in which the display items traded places every 110ms so that the target was never to be found in the same location from one moment to the next (the relocation condition), as compared with a static condition where the display items remained in place for the whole trial duration. To equate appearance between the two conditions, all items changed orientation every 110ms in both conditions, and were masked after each of the briefly presented visual arrays. The results showed that search was disrupted by item relocation for both patients and controls, but importantly this disruption was only seen in the right visual field for the patients, not the left, indicating that their spatial working memory in left visual space is already severely disrupted, and to a greater degree than for their right visual space, in contrast to what has been previously argued.",Remaining,0,0

The plasma leptin levels significantly decreased during 36 h fasting by 48.8 +/- 4.5% (pre: 11.3 +/- 2.3, post: 6.2 +/- 1.5 ng/ml) and 38.6 +/- 7.9% (pre: 7.6 +/- 5.0, post: 4.2 +/- 1.0 ng/ml) in SCI and AB, respectively. Plasma leptin started to decrease at 24 h of fasting in the SCI group, whereas plasma leptin started to decrease at 12 h of fasting in the AB group. The current study demonstrated that plasma leptin decreased with fasting in both SCI and AB groups, with the leptin decrease being delayed in the SCI group. The delayed leptin response to fasting in the SCI group may be because of increased fat mass (%body fat, SCI: 33.8 +/- 3.0, AB: 24.1 +/- 2.9) and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.",Remaining,0,0
233,32563266,BMC public health,Correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.,"In Korea, higher education has rapidly grown influenced by sociocultural tradition. Parents invest a significant portion of their household income in their children's education. Private education has been considered to greatly affect students' psychology and behavior. However, past research has largely neglected to study parents who pay these costs. Since household income and education level are important determinants of socioeconomic status (SES), education expenditures are likely to cause depressive symptoms. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the correlation between private education costs and parental depression in South Korea.	Data were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS, 2015, 2018). The sample analyzed consisted of 397 and 337 fathers and 403 and 370 mothers in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The independent variable in this study was the proportion of private education cost. This proportion was calculated by dividing each household's private education costs by its equivalized household disposable income (EHDI) and multiplying this number by 100. The main dependent variable was parental responses to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-11 (CESD-11). Using a generalized linear model, we investigated the effects of the proportion of private education cost on parental depression.	The results showed that fathers with higher proportions of private education cost exhibited higher CESD-11 scores compared to fathers with lower proportions cost (moderate: β = 0.419, S. E = 0.164, p = 0.0105; high: β = 0.476, S. E = 0.178, p = 0.0076), indicating that a higher ratio of private education cost may negatively affect depression in fathers. However, there was no discernable correlation between mothers' CESD-11 scores and the proportion of private education cost (moderate: β = - 0.078, S. E = 0.250, p = 0.7555; high: β = 0.003, S. E = 0.215, p = 0.9882).	These results may be explained by the tendency for fathers to experience greater economic burdens than mothers in patriarchal Korean society.",Remaining,0,0
234,20845405,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,Low serum BDNF may indicate the development of PSD in patients with acute ischemic stroke.,"This study was to test whether serum BDNF or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is correlated with the development of depression at the acute stage of stroke.	Hundred ischemic stroke patients admitted to the hospital within the first 24 h of stroke onset were consecutively recruited and followed up for 14 days. The 17-item HDRS and MADRS were used to assess the severity of major depressive symptoms on day 3, day 7, and day 14 after admission. The diagnoses of depression were made in accordance with DSM-IV criteria for post-stroke depression (PSD). Serum BDNF and tPA of all the patients were determined by ELISA both on day 1 and day 7 after admission. Meanwhile, 50 healthy control subjects were also recruited and underwent measurement of serum BDNF and tPA once.	We found that 37 patients (37.0%) were diagnosed of major depression at the end of the follow-up. Serum BDNF on day 1 was significantly higher in non-PSD stroke patients than in normal controls, while PSD patients had significantly lower BDNF than non-PSD patients. There was a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF and tPA on day 1 only in PSD patients (r = -0.440, p = 0.006). Serum BDNF < 5.86 ng/ml on day 1 was independently associated with incident PSD at the acute stage of stroke (OR = 28.992; 95% CI, 8.014-104.891; p < 0.001 after adjustment).	There was a significant elevation of BDNF early after ischemic stroke. Serum BDNF on day 1 after admission may predict the risk of subsequent PSD. Moreover, tPA may be involved in the change of BDNF.",Remaining,0,0

We studied retrospectively 100 patients discharged over a 17-year period from Ca' Foncello Regional Hospital, Treviso, Italy with a diagnosis of brain abscess.	Post-surgical abscesses were more frequent than those related to contiguous infections and the spectrum of etiologic agents was very heterogeneous. A cerebral neoplasm was the initial neuroradiological diagnosis in 13 patients; 72 patients underwent a neurosurgical procedure.

236,9426989,Ethnicity & health,Symptoms in children of British and of Bangladeshi parents measured by the Rutter B2 Questionnaire.,"Bangladeshi children are less frequently referred to a child psychiatric clinic than their British peers. This study aimed to ascertain if teachers observed less psychological symptoms in Bangladeshi than British children.	Teachers completed a Rutter B2 Scale on samples of 113 'Bangladeshi' and 61 British children aged between 5 and 11 years.	Teachers recognised less symptomatology in the Asian children than their British peers. This trend was significant in children under the age of 8, but there was no significant difference in those aged 8-11 years. Only 13% of Bangladeshi children were fully fluent in English.	Two alternate hypotheses are put forward to explain these findings: (a) because more of the younger children could not speak English and communicate freely with their teachers, their symptoms were not noted by teachers; (b) the symptoms of the older children were a response to the pressures both the children and families faced as new immigrants. This study clearly needs to be replicated with a larger sample and also with interviews with both children and parents in order to validate the Rutter B2 questionnaires as an appropriate measure of disturbance in Bangladeshi children. It should be replicated with validated assessments of the children's fluency in English. It is also important to discuss with Bangladeshi parents what support they would like from both the school and from child psychiatric services, to promote their children's psychological health.",Remaining,0,0
237,19682673,Cognition,Visual perspective taking impairment in children with autistic spectrum disorder.,"Evidence from typical development and neuroimaging studies suggests that level 2 visual perspective taking - the knowledge that different people may see the same thing differently at the same time - is a mentalising task. Thus, we would expect children with autism, who fail typical mentalising tasks like false belief, to perform poorly on level 2 visual perspective taking as well. However, prior data on this issue are inconclusive. We re-examined this question, testing a group of 23 young autistic children, aged around 8years with a verbal mental age of around 4years and three groups of typical children (n=60) ranging in age from 4 to 8years on a level 2 visual perspective task and a closely matched mental rotation task. The results demonstrate that autistic children have difficulty with visual perspective taking compared to a task requiring mental rotation, relative to typical children. Furthermore, performance on the level 2 visual perspective taking task correlated with theory of mind performance. These findings resolve discrepancies in previous studies of visual perspective taking in autism, and demonstrate that level 2 visual perspective taking is a mentalising task.",Remaining,0,0

Complaints of snoring are examined, and its prevalence, risk factors and screening reliability are discussed. The subjects who participated in the study were 6445 new outpatients from a general hospital. They were asked to answer a sleep questionnaire that consisted of 34 items with seven demographic items; each item was composed of four grades of frequency. In order to offset possible seasonal variations in sleep habits, data were collected across four seasons. Sleep patterns, insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders were covered. Habitual snoring was seen in 16.0% of males and 6.5% of females. Male predominance was noted. From these data, the relationship between habitual snoring and sleep complaints was statistically analyzed. Habitual snorers (HS) were observed to wake up more frequently during sleep (17.8% of males, 21.5% of females) than were non-habitual snorers (NHS; 6.6% of males, 9.7% of females). Mid-sleep awakening of HS was also more frequent than it was for NHS; however, there were no differences in difficulty in falling asleep and early morning awakening.

Infarction suggesting a haemodynamic pathogenesis were demonstrated in seven of the cases by computed tomography. In seven of the eight subjects that were operated on, ICA reconstruction was successful. Since pseudoocclusion of the ICA is likely to progress rapidly to definite occlusion, the patient is severely jeopardized from periocclusive embolism into the major brain arteries.

Because abnormal functional connectivity in these networks has been related to schizophrenia, we tested whether alterations are also evident in subjects at risk for psychosis. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was tested in 28 subjects with basic symptoms reporting subjective cognitive-perceptive symptoms; 19 with attenuated or brief, limited psychotic symptoms; and 29 matched healthy controls. We characterized spatial differences in connectivity patterns, as well as internetwork connectivity. Right anterior insula (rAI) was selected as seed region for identifying the SN; medioprefrontal cortex (MPFC) for the DMN and TPN. The 3 groups differed in connectivity patterns between the MPFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), and between the rAI and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In particular, the typically observed antagonistic relationship in MPFC-rDLPFC, rAI-PCC, and internetwork connectivity of DMN-TPN was absent in both at-risk groups. Notably, those connectivity patterns were associated with symptoms related to reality distortions, whereas enhanced connectivity strengths of MPFC-rDLPFC and TPN-DMN were related to poor performance in cognitive functions. We propose that the loss of a TPN-DMN anticorrelation, accompanied by an aberrant spatial extent in the DMN, TPN, and SN in the psychosis risk state, reflects the confusion of internally and externally focused states and disturbance of cognition, as seen in psychotic disorders.",Remaining,0,0

Such estimates would enhance the targeting of HIV prevention resources and provide a sensitive outcome measure for prevention program evaluation. The goal of this investigation was to estimate the incidence of HIV infection among persons testing for HIV in New York City.	The study population consisted of persons testing for HIV in public settings in New York City during 2001 (n = 114,703). We applied a less sensitive enzyme immunoassay (LS-EIA) (Vironostika, BioMerieux, Durham, NC) to the diagnostic blood specimen of 1022 persons in whom HIV (non-AIDS) had been diagnosed for the first time in 2001. The distribution of transmission risk among HIV-negative persons--men who have sex with men (MSM), injection drug users (IDUs), heterosexuals-from a large telephone health survey was used to generate denominators for transmission risk groups.	The 1022 persons tested by the LS-EIA represented 27% of all persons in whom HIV (non-AIDS) had been diagnosed in New York City during 2001. The incidence of HIV was estimated to be 0.29% per year (95% CI: 0.20-0.38), and was significantly higher for men than women (rate ratio 3.6, 95% CI: 2.6-5.1), and HIV incidence increased with age. Male IDU and MSM testers had the highest HIV incidence rates: 2.7% per year (95% CI: 2.3-3.1) and 2.5% per year (95% CI: 2.1-2.8), respectively.

There was no material relationship between sex, cigarette smoking, oralcohol intake and the prevalence of stroke. When the lifetime prevalence of stroke was divided according to whether stroke had been diagnosed for the first time at the age of 90 years or less or over the age of 90, a significant positive association between hypertension and stroke was more pronounced in centenarians with a diagnosis of stroke at the age of 90 years or less than in those over the age of 90.

We prepared monovalent, divalent, and trivalent 6-sulfo-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (6S-GlcNAc) immobilized substrates. The morphology and secondary structure of Abeta (1-42) aggregates on the substrates were investigated by dynamic-mode AFM and FTIR-RAS. Abeta (1-42) interactions with multivalent sugars were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance, and the cytotoxicity of Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Morphological images showed, interestingly, that Abeta (1-42) aggregates had a tendency to form globules rather than fibrils as the valency of 6S-GlcNAc on the substrate was increased. The SPR measurements indicated that this morphological change of Abeta (1-42) was related to the change of binding mode, and the binding mode was dependent on the multivalency of the sugar. Globular Abeta (1-42) was more toxic than fibrillar Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells.

AD-type tau phosphoepitopes, detected by various monoclonal antibodies, are absent from normal adult neurons, but recent studies have shown that their expression may contribute to neuritogenesis and axon differentiation in the developing nervous system. Therefore, we have examined a brain nerve cell line that is spontaneously neuritogenic for possible expression of AD-type tau epitopes. The neuritogenic rat brain cell line B103 was found to constitutively produce two-AD related epitopes of tau, detected by cellular immunofluorescence studies with the PHF-1 and Alz-50 monoclonal antibodies. Biochemical studies showed that the antibodies bound to proteins within the molecular, weight range expected for phosphorylated tau isoforms. Further verification was established by use of tau antisense oligomers, which eliminated cellular immunofluorescence due to the AD-related monoclonals and polyclonal anti-tau but did not eliminate fluorescence due to anti-tubulin. Cells treated with tau antisense were not neurite-free. Neurites that remained, however, were abnormal, generally short and wavy in appearance. Cellular distribution of the tau epitopes was found to be particularly interesting. Alz-50 recognized only cytoplasmic tau whereas PHF-1 recognized nuclear tau as well as cytoplasmic. Thus, the two epitopes, are morphologically segregated within the cell. Because subcellular segregation of tau is compromised in Alzheimer's disease, mechanisms that segregate AD-type phosphotau epitopes in B103 cells may have relevance to this neurodegenerative disorder.",In-vitro-study,8,0

In the present study, the delivery efficiency of cationic bovine serum albumin-conjugated tanshinone IIA PEGylated nanoparticles (CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs) in rat brain was investigated. We further explored whether the protective mechanism of CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs in cerebral ischemia was associated with modulating neuronal signaling pathways. The experimental cerebral ischemia model was established to evaluate the treatment efficacy of CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs. The pharmacokinetics demonstrated that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs could obviously prolong circulation time and increase plasma concentration compared with intravenously administrated TIIA solution. The biodistribution and brain uptake study confirmed that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs possessed better brain delivery efficacy with a high drug accumulation and fluorescence quantitative level in brain. CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs effectively reduced infarction volume, neurological dysfunctions, neutrophils infiltration and neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-8; upregulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and increase TGF-β1 level in the ischemic brain. In addition, treatment with CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs markedly inhibited the mRNA expressions of GFAP, MMP-9, COX-2, p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK, downregulated the protein levels of GFAP, MMP-9 and COX-2, as well as decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK and JNK.

Here, we examined signaling events in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and searched for therapeutic agents that could overcome TRAIL resistance in glioma cells. TRAIL induced apoptosis through death receptor 5 (DR5) and was mediated by caspase-8-initiated extrinsic and intrinsic mitochondrial pathways in sensitive glioma cell lines. TRAIL also triggered apoptosis in resistant glioma cell lines through the same pathways, but only if the cells were pretreated with chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin, camptothecin and etoposide. Previous studies suggested that this was due to an increase in DR5 expression in wild-type TP53 cells, but this mechanism did not account for cells with mutant TP53. Here, we show that a more general effect of these agents is to downregulate caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP(S) (the short form of cellular Fas-associated death domain-fike interleukin-1-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein) and up-regulate Bak, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, independently of cell's TP53 status.

Moreover, α-synuclein content in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents a PD biomarker candidate. However, capture-based assays for α-synuclein quantification in CSF (such as by ELISA) have shown discrepancies and have limited suitability for high-throughput screening. Here, we describe two sensitive, in-solution, time-resolved Förster's resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based immunoassays for total and oligomeric α-synuclein quantification. CSF analysis showed strong concordance for total α-synuclein content between two TR-FRET assays and, in agreement with a previously characterized 36 h protocol-based ELISA, demonstrated lower α-synuclein levels in PD donors. Critically, the assay suitability for high-throughput screening of siRNA constructs and small molecules aimed at reducing endogenous α-synuclein levels was established and validated. In a small-scale proof of concept compound screen using 384 well plates, signals ranged from <30 to >120% of the mean of vehicle-treated cells for molecules known to lower and increase cellular α-synuclein, respectively. Furthermore, a reverse genetic screen of a kinase-directed siRNA library identified seven genes that modulated α-synuclein protein levels (five whose knockdown increased and two that decreased cellular α-synuclein protein). This provides critical new biological insight into cellular pathways regulating α-synuclein steady-state expression that may help guide further drug discovery efforts. Moreover, we describe an inherent limitation in current α-synuclein oligomer detection methodology, a finding that will direct improvement of future assay design. Our one-step TR-FRET-based platform for α-synuclein quantification provides a novel platform with superior performance parameters for the rapid screening of large biomarker cohorts and of compound and genetic libraries, both of which are essential to the development of PD therapies.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Glutamate production is greatly increased following HIV-1 infection of cultured MP, a process dependent upon the glutamate-generating enzyme glutaminase. Glutaminase inhibition was previously found to significantly decrease macrophage-mediated neurotoxicity. Potential mechanisms of glutaminase-mediated excitotoxicity including enzyme up-regulation, increased enzyme activity and glutaminase localization were investigated in this report. RNA and protein analysis of HIV-infected human primary macrophage revealed up-regulation of the glutaminase isoform GAC, yet identified no changes in the kidney-type glutaminase isoform over the course of infection. Glutaminase is a mitochondrial protein, but was found to be released into the cytosol and extracellular space following infection. This released enzyme is capable of rapidly converting the abundant extracellular amino acid glutamine into excitotoxic levels of glutamate in an energetically favorable process. These findings support glutaminase as a potential component of the HAD pathogenic process and identify a possible therapeutic avenue for the treatment of neuroinflammatory states such as HAD.",In-vitro-study,8,0

The results indicated that MnTDM significantly attenuated PQ-induced loss of cell viability, glutathione depletion, and reactive oxygen species production. MnTDM also ameliorated PQ-induced morphological nuclear changes of apoptosis and increased rates of apoptosis. In addition, our data provide direct evidence that MnTDM suppressed PQ-induced caspase-3 cleavage, possibly a key event of PQ neurotoxicity. These observations suggested that oxidative stress and apoptosis are implicated in PQ-induced neurotoxicity and this toxicity could be prevented by MnTDM. These findings also proposed a novel therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease and other disorders associated with oxidative stress.",In-vitro-study,8,0
254,23386689,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Hepatocyte growth factor sensitizes brain tumors to c-MET kinase inhibition.,"The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-MET and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are deregulated and promote malignancy in cancer and brain tumors. Consequently, clinically applicable c-MET inhibitors have been developed. The purpose of this study was to investigate the not-well-known molecular determinants that predict responsiveness to c-MET inhibitors and to explore new strategies for improving inhibitor efficacy in brain tumors.	We investigated the molecular factors and pathway activation signatures that determine sensitivity to c-MET inhibitors in a panel of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells, glioblastoma stem cells, and established cell line-derived xenografts using functional assays, reverse protein microarrays, and in vivo tumor volume measurements, but validation with animal survival analyses remains to be done. We also explored new approaches for improving the efficacy of the inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.	We found that HGF coexpression is a key predictor of response to c-MET inhibition among the examined factors and identified an ERK/JAK/p53 pathway activation signature that differentiates c-MET inhibition in responsive and nonresponsive cells. Surprisingly, we also found that short pretreatment of cells and tumors with exogenous HGF moderately but statistically significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of c-MET inhibition. We observed a similar ligand-induced sensitization effect to an EGF receptor small-molecule kinase inhibitor.	These findings allow the identification of a subset of patients that will be responsive to c-MET inhibition and propose ligand pretreatment as a potential new strategy for improving the anticancer efficacy of RTK inhibitors.",In-vitro-study,8,0

The experiments were carried out on hippocampal slices of guinea pigs. EFP were elicited by omission of Mg2+ from the perfusate and recorded from stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum in the CA1 subfield. Single electrical stimuli were applied to the Schaffer collateral pathway. Verapamil was added to the bath solution in concentrations of 40 and 60 mumol verapamil/l at normal (4 mmol/l) and elevated (8 mmol/l) K+ levels. After omission of Mg2+ from the perfusate, spontaneously occurring EFP appeared in all trials. These spontaneously occurring EFP were suppressed dose-dependently upon addition of verapamil to the perfusate. At elevated K+ levels, the latencies to suppression were significantly reduced and the dose dependency was abolished for the two doses of verapamil used. Triggered EFP reappeared upon stimulation after spontaneously occurring EFP had been suppressed, except for trials with 60 mumol verapamil/l bath solution with elevated K+ levels. The stimulus-evoked EFP were abolished with continuing perfusion of verapamil except for trials with 40 mumol/l at normal extracellular K+ concentrations. This effect was again dose dependent and enhanced by elevating the K+ level. In all experiments, stimulus-evoked EFP reappeared upon wash-out of verapamil. A primary action of verapamil on pacemaker functions in epileptogenic tissue is assumed.",In-vitro-study,8,0
256,18084303,Nature structural & molecular biology,Structural basis for synaptic adhesion mediated by neuroligin-neurexin interactions.,"The heterophilic synaptic adhesion molecules neuroligins and neurexins are essential for establishing and maintaining neuronal circuits by modulating the formation and maturation of synapses. The neuroligin-neurexin adhesion is Ca2+-dependent and regulated by alternative splicing. We report a structure of the complex at a resolution of 2.4 A between the mouse neuroligin-1 (NL1) cholinesterase-like domain and the mouse neurexin-1beta (NX1beta) LNS (laminin, neurexin and sex hormone-binding globulin-like) domain. The structure revealed a delicate neuroligin-neurexin assembly mediated by a hydrophilic, Ca2+-mediated and solvent-supplemented interface, rendering it capable of being modulated by alternative splicing and other regulatory factors. Thermodynamic data supported a mechanism wherein splicing site B of NL1 acts by modulating a salt bridge at the edge of the NL1-NX1beta interface. Mapping neuroligin mutations implicated in autism indicated that most such mutations are structurally destabilizing, supporting deficient neuroligin biosynthesis and processing as a common cause for this brain disorder.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Sixteen children with unilateral CP and 31 typically developing children (TDC) were assessed 2-4 weeks apart. Test-retest percent agreements within one point for children with unilateral CP (and TDC) were Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments: 75% (90%); single-point localization: 69% (97%); static two-point discrimination: 93% (97%); and moving two-point discrimination: 87% (97%). Test-retest reliability for registration and unilateral spatial tactile perception tests was high in children with CP (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.79-0.96). Two tests demonstrated a learning effect for children with CP, double simultaneous and tactile texture perception. Stereognosis had a ceiling effect for TDC (ICC = 0) and variability for children with CP (% exact agreement = 47%-50%). The Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, single-point localization, and both static and moving two-point discrimination are recommended for use in practice and research. Although recommended to provide a comprehensive assessment, the measures of double simultaneous, stereognosis, and tactile texture perception may not be responsive to change over time in children with unilateral CP.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
259,37271132,Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,The Utility of Visual and Spatial Perception Tests in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Visual and spatial perception (VSP) are cognitive domains frequently assessed in the screening and neuropsychological assessment of dementia. Evidence suggests that VSP impairment is common in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite this evidence, the ability of VSP tests to discriminate between healthy older adults and people with AD remains mixed. The purpose of this literature review was to employ a systematic search strategy to identify empirical evidence supporting the diagnostic utility of VSP tests which may be used in the screening and diagnosis of AD.	Specified criteria were used to perform a systematic literature search of the PsycINFO and PubMed databases with no date restrictions. Relevant data from the selected studies were extracted, and a published appraisal tool (the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) was used to evaluate methodological quality.	Of the 144 articles returned, six studies and 11 VSP tests met review inclusion criteria. Four tests demonstrated both sensitivity and specificity values above 80%. A computerised 3D Visual Task demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity values (90% and 95%, respectively). The quality of the identified studies was considered to be satisfactory. Identified limitations and the implications of issues relating to study methodology are discussed, and recommendations for future research are suggested.	The evidence from this review suggests that certain tests of VSP may be a useful addition to the routine screening of AD.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

Dementia is most prevalent of all. In general scenario, a dementia patient lacks proper guidance in searching out the way to return back at his/her home. Thus, increasing the risk of getting damaged at individual-health level. Therefore, it is important to track their movement in more sophisticated manner as possible. With emergence of wearables, GPS sensors and Internet of Things (IoT), such devices have become available in public domain. Smartphone apps support caregiver to locate the dementia patients in real-time. RF, GSM, 3G, Wi-Fi and 4G technology fill the communication gap between patient and caregiver to bring them closer. In this paper, we incorporated 7 most popular wearables for investigation to seek appropriateness for dementia tracking in recent times in systematic manners. We performed an in-depth review of these wearables as per the cost, technology wise and application wise characteristics. A case novel study i.e. IoT-based Force Sensor Resistance enabled System-FSRIoT, has been proposed and implemented to validate the effectiveness of IoT in the domain of smarter dementia patient tracking in wearable form factor. The results show promising aspect of a whole new notion to leverage efficient assistive physio-medical healthcare to the dementia patients and the affected family members to reduce life risks and achieve a better social life.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

The annual rate, number, and cost of PCF in the United States has increased. Far fewer studies have been published on PCF outcomes than on anterior cervical fusion (ACF) outcomes, most likely because far fewer PCFs than ACFs are performed.	To evaluate the patient-reported and clinical outcomes of adult patients who underwent subaxial posterior cervical fusion with decompression.	Systematic review and meta-analysis.	The total number of patients in the 31 articles reviewed and included in the meta-analysis was 1,238 (range 7-166).	Preoperative to postoperative change in patient-reported outcomes (visual analog scales for arm pain and neck pain, Neck Disability Index, Japanese Orthopaedic Association [JOA] score, modified JOA score, and Nurick pain scale) and rates of fusion, revision, and complications or adverse events.	This study was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and a preapproved protocol. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for articles published from January 2001 through July 2018. Statistical analyses for patient-reported outcomes were performed on the outcomes' raw mean differences, calculated as postoperative value minus preoperative value from each study. Pooled rates of successful fusion, revision surgery, and complications or adverse events, and their 95% confidence intervals, were also calculated. Two subgroup analyses were performed: one for studies in which only myelopathy or radiculopathy (or both) were stated as surgical indications and the other for studies in which only myelopathy or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (or both) were stated as surgical indications. This study was funded by Providence Medical Technology, Inc. ($32,000).	Thirty-three articles were included in the systematic review, and 31 articles were included in the meta-analysis. For all surgical indications and for the 2 subgroup analyses, every cumulative change in patient-reported outcome improved. Many of the reported changes in patient-reported outcome also exceeded the minimal clinically important differences. Pooled outcome rates with all surgical indications were 98.25% for successful fusion, 1.09% for revision, and 9.02% for complications or adverse events. Commonly reported complications or adverse events were axial pain, C5 palsy, transient neurological worsening, and wound infection.

The meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials of memantine for Lewy body disorders in all patients with Lewy body disorders. Motor function, activities of daily living, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Mini-Mental State Exam, discontinuation rate, and individual side effects were evaluated.	No significant effects of memantine on motor function scores, Mini-Mental State Exam scores, Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores, and activity of daily living scores were found.

These applications involve treatment protocols with automated content delivery and relatively low clinical contact. Whilst such CBT applications are promising, however, further investigation is needed to establish the efficacy of this treatment approach for individuals with OCD. The aim of the present study was to review the efficacy of technology-delivered CBT with minimal clinician support for OCD using a meta-analytic approach.	Randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified through PsycINFO, Medline and Scopus resulting in 18 eligible studies (n = 1707). Control conditions comprised both passive (namely no treatment, other treatments and waitlist controls) and active. Measurement of OCD symptoms improvement was the outcome in each study.	Participants in the technology-delivered CBT group scored lower on Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) (g = - 0.59, 95% CI = [- 0.99, - 0.18], p = 0.01), Y-BOCS and Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS) combined (g = - 0.55, 95% CI = [- 0.87, - 0.24], p = 0.003) and Obsessive-Compulsive-Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) (g = - 0.36, 95% CI = [- 0.62, - 0.09], p = 0.02) at post-treatment than passive control groups. There were no significant findings when compared to controls with other treatments.

The objective of this study is to assess the relationship of IL-10 -1082G/A polymorphism and AD risk by using meta-analysis.	All eligible case-control studies were searched in Pubmed and Embase. Odds ratios (OR) with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the association.	A total of 2158 cases and 2088 controls in 12 case-control studies were included. The results indicated that the A allele carriers (AA+AG) had a 27% increased risk of AD, when compared with the homozygote GG (OR=1.27, 95%CI=1.02-1.58 for AA+AG vs. GG). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant elevated risks were associated with A allele carriers in Europeans (OR=1.27 and 95%CI=1.01-1.59 for AA+AG vs. GG), but not in Asians (OR=1.37 and 95%CI=0.32-5.88 for AA+AG vs. GG).	This meta-analysis suggested that the -1082G/A polymorphism of IL-10 gene would be a risk factor for AD.

This article reviews the evidence supporting pharmacotherapy of aggression in youth, with a primary focus on impulsive aggression (the primary indication for this intervention). Relevant diagnostic considerations and consensus guidelines are discussed.	Articles examining the role of medications in the treatment of aggression in youth with pathological aggression were identified using PubMed and MEDLINE® databases over the past 15 years (2000-2015); selected articles published prior to 2000 and deemed to be of high relevance were searched and also included. Search terms included: Aggression, aggressive, disruptive behavior, conduct, youth, children, and adolescents. Cited references were also searched for relevant articles.	There are a number of evidence-based medication treatments for aggression, which are generally best considered in the context of differential diagnosis and ongoing evidence-based psychosocial interventions. Impulsive aggression is generally considered the type of aggression most amenable to medication, but other aggression subtypes may also possibly respond to treatment. Medication classes with positive evidence include the psychostimulants and α-2 agonists (in the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and/or disruptive behavior disorders), mood stabilizing agents, and atypical antipsychotics. Published guidelines recommend systematic and adequate trials of medications in sequential order, to optimize response and minimize polypharmacy. Guidelines for safety monitoring are available for many of the medications used for aggression in youth, and are also discussed.	Aggression in children carries a high risk of poor outcomes, and, therefore, a better understanding of treatment options is a high priority. The available literature points to the importance of identifying the underlying disorder, when possible, and using this information to guide treatment selection. Future studies are needed to better inform the treatment of aggression across disorders, and the treatment of different aggression subtypes.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

271,17244569,The International journal of psycho-analysis,"Thinking with, and about, patients too scared to think: can non-interpretive maneuvers stimulate reflective thought?","Patients incapable of higher-order (symbolic) thinking can often not tolerate evidence of the analyst's separate existence, particularly when that 'otherness' becomes evident in the process of the analyst's reflecting upon and interpreting how the patient experiences or represents the analyst. The patient's intolerance of the analyst's efforts to think (reflect upon and interpret) renders the usual psychoanalytic maneuvers employed to stimulate reflective thought ineffective with such patients. Such patients have to learn to tolerate multiple perspectives before they can allow the analyst, or themselves, to think in the other's presence. The author presents two clinical vignettes that illustrate how the analyst's efforts to think about the patient were experienced by the patient as both intolerably distancing and as rejecting of an aspect of the patient's subjective reality. Working psychoanalytically with such patients requires the analyst to forego the use of narrow interpretations that elucidate unconscious meanings and motives in favor of alternate technical maneuvers capable of facilitating the development of symbolic thinking and reflective thought (insightfulness). These maneuvers include a demonstration of the analyst's willingness and ability to withstand (rather than 'interpret away') how he is being psychically represented by the patient, without becoming destroyed by, or lost within, the patient's characterization of him. Beside modeling a tolerance of alternate perspectives of one's self, other non-interpretive maneuvers that help facilitate the development of self-reflective thought include: stimulating the patient's curiosity about the workings of his own mind by identifying incompletely understood behaviors or reactions worthy of greater psychological understanding, and insinuating doubt about the adequacy of the patient's explanations of such phenomena.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

We retrospectively sampled and analyzed 31 patients treated for ruptured Distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) aneurysms from a larger sample of 250 patients treated for ruptured aneurysms between July 2018 and July 2021. The outcomes of patients who underwent clipping and EVT were compared using chi-square tests. T-tests were used for univariate analysis and a logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors affecting outcomes.	Of the 31 patients, 20 were treated with clipping and 11 with EVT. Patients treated with EVT had a mean age of 35.45 ± 6.66. The mean age of the clipping group was 44.4 ± 6.94 years (p=0.002). Intraoperative rupture was significantly more common in the clipping group (p=0.025). There were no significant differences in the postoperative incidence of vasospasm or hydrocephalus (p=0.12). Modified Rankin Scale scores (p=0.017) and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores (p=0.02) both at discharge and 6-month follow-ups were significantly better in the EVT group than in the clipping group. Length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was 9.27 ± 2.6 days following EVT and 23.60 ± 6.29 following clipping (p=0.001). Age (p=0.0136), Hunt and Hess grade (p=0.02), and the occurrence of intraprocedural rupture (p=0.009) were found to significantly affect outcomes.	The outcomes of EVT were better than those for clipping and required a shorter stay in the ICU and the hospital. This may be partially attributable to the dual-trained neurovascular surgeon who performed the procedures. Older age, poorer Hunt and Hess grades, and intraoperative aneurysm rupture adversely affected outcomes.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

If this is the case, one would expect that there is a relationship between the pattern of neuropsychological and magnetic resonance imaging deficits and that both may indicate cerebellar abnormalities.	To investigate the profiles of neuropsychological functions and the morphologic features of the cerebellum, using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging planimetry in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with radiation and chemotherapy.	Thirteen survivors of childhood ALL with onset at age 2 to 5 years and a uniform protocol of treatment involving cranial radiation of 24 Gy and five doses of intrathecal methotrexate sodium participated in the study. Ten controls matched the patients in age and socioeconomic status. Each child was assessed with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests and with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.	The neuropsychological scores were transformed into z scores and clustered into right and left hemisphere measures. Planimetric measures of the cerebellar vermis and pons were collected in the midsagittal plane.	Consistently observed in survivors of ALL were the following: (1) significant cognitive deficits in visual-spatial-motor coordination and figural memory, functions commonly related to the right side of the brain; and (2) hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, lobuli I through V and particularly VI to VII. Lateralization of the neurobehavioral deficits was not reflected in structural brain abnormalities.	Coexistence of the cerebellar hypoplasia and visual-motor coordination and memory deficits supports the neurodevelopmental approach to brain sequelae in survivors of ALL; it also suggests significance of the cerebellum for both motor and complex nonmotor cognitive processing.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

This study examined the extent to which fear activation and reduction within and across exposures predicted treatment outcomes for social anxiety disorder within a paradigm suitable for their measurement.	Sixty-eight adults with social anxiety disorder and fear of public speaking completed seven exposure sessions, each consisting of seven speeches conducted in virtual reality. Exposures were identical in duration, task requirements, and virtual public speaking situation. Fear was measured with skin conductance and subjective distress ratings. At baseline and post-treatment, participants completed a public speaking behavioral approach test with a panel of confederate judges; subjective fear was measured. A standardized questionnaire of anxiety symptoms was administered at baseline, post-treatment, and one-month follow-up.	No indices of within- or between-session fear reduction, measured by subjective distress and skin conductance response, predicted treatment outcome. One measure of fear activation was associated with outcomes such that less activation predicted greater symptom reduction; remaining indices did not predict outcomes.	Data were collected in the context of a randomized controlled trial of scopolamine; drug group was included in analytic models to account for drug influence. VR exposures elicited mild levels of distress that may underestimate levels of distress in clinical settings.	Findings failed to support fear activation or reduction within or across exposure sessions as significant predictors of treatment outcome for social anxiety. Treatment implications are discussed.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
275,21302192,Minimally invasive neurosurgery : MIN,Endovascular treatment of vertebral artery dissection using stents and coils: its pitfall and technical considerations.,"There are various options for the treatment of vertebral artery dissection aneurysms (VADA). Treatment with stents may be an effective method to treat VADA involving the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and dissection of the dominant vertebral artery (VA). In this article, our personal experience of the treatment of VADAs by using stents and coils is reported.	Since 1998, 26 cases of VADA have been treated by endovascular surgery by the first author. Of these cases, 6 cases were treated using stents, 3 of which were treated using stent and coils, 2 patients were treated using double overlapping stents, and the remaining one patient was treated using a single stent.	In all patients, dissection aneurysms were successfully covered by stents. There was one complication: an intraprocedural rupture during additional coil insertion without neurological deterioration. Follow-up angiography was performed in all 5 surviving patients except for one patient who died due to the severity of his original subarachnoid hemorrhage (mean duration of follow-up angiography 22.8 months, range 15-57 months). Total or subtotal disappearance of the VADA was achieved in all 5 cases. At one year after the treatment, all 5 surviving patients remained clinically stable without any neurological deficit.	Treatment using stents is an effective alternative for the treatment of VA dissecting aneurysms, especially for lesions of the dominant VA or involving the PICA. However, additional coil insertion should be performed very carefully and may be avoided if stagnation of contrast material is achieved after overlapping stenting.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Pre-post nonrandomized controlled trial.	Rehabilitation center and gait laboratory of a university hospital.	Community-dwelling ambulatory volunteers (N=22) with chronic hemiparesis caused by a unilateral stroke.	Study subjects participated in a gait training program using either a below-knee prosthesis or a treadmill. Treadmill gait training was performed at a speed approximating the maximum gait velocity for each patient. The 3-week program consisted of a 5-minute gait training session 2 to 3 times a day.	The ground reaction forces, stance time, step length and cadence during walking at a comfortable speed, and maximum gait speed, as well as the Berg Balance Score, were estimated before and after each training program.	In comparison with changes after the treadmill gait training, analyses of covariance demonstrated a significant increase of the fore-aft ground reaction forces during the paretic propulsion phase and a significant increase in the relative durations of the paretic and nonparetic single stance involved in a gait cycle after the prosthetic gait training (P<.05).	Prosthetic gait training would have different effects on a hemiparetic gait than treadmill gait training. The gait-related task inducing the dominant use of the paretic leg to support the body may be useful as a rehabilitative treatment to improve the kinetic abilities in the paretic stance period.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

A concomitant effect of multilevel fusion is a restriction of cervical spine mobility. This retrospective study on DCM-patients with at least 4 laminectomy and fusion levels, compares data between objective and subjective restriction of the postoperative cervical spine mobility. The patient-reported restriction of cervical spine mobility was acquired by a five-step score. Measurements of cervical range of motion were performed using the CROM device and were correlated with the subjective scores. Fusion was performed over 6 levels in most of the 36 patients. For the subjective cervical spine mobility, 52.8% reported none to medium, 38.9% severe and 8.3% complete restriction. Mean objective cervical range of motion was 45.0° for flexion-extension, 26.3° for total lateral flexion and 51.4° for total rotation and therefore evidently reduced compared to non-operated patient cohorts in literature. There was a significant medium, negative correlation between the objective measurements and the patient-reported general restriction of cervical spine mobility, and with the physical component summary of SF-8. The significant objective reduction of cervical range of motion after laminectomy and multilevel fusion correlates with the patient-reported assessment for general restriction.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Although systemic and local factors in combination with genetic abnormality have been considered in its etiopathogenesis, OPLL remains a poorly understood pathology. Surgical management of OPLL and the choice of the most appropriate treatment are still controversial issues. Here the authors report a series of OPLL-affected patients treated by 'only-fixation' technique.	Between June 2012 and June 2019, 52 patients having OPLL were treated by a surgical strategy involving only spinal fixation without any form of bone or soft tissue decompression. Facetal fixation for both the atlantoaxial and subaxial spine formed the basis of the surgical treatment. Clinical parameters, analysis of video recordings before and after surgery, and patient self-assessment were included in the analysis of outcome.	During the mean follow-up period there was an immediate postoperative and progressive recovery in symptoms in 51 patients. Of 14 patients who were wheelchair bound before surgery, 12 walked independently on follow-up assessment of 6 months. All patients had successful arthrodesis in the surgically treated segments. There were no infective- or implant-related complications.	Decision making in the surgical management of cervical OPLL is still controversial. The concept of spinal instability has been shown to be a nodal point in the pathogenesis of OPLL, and 'only-spinal fixation' can be considered a rationale for an appropriate surgical treatment.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

283,33689536,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",Survival impact of incidental subventricular zone irradiation in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.,"The subventricular zone (SVZ) is an important niche for neural stem cells but probably also for brain tumor propagating cells, including the glioblastoma stem cell. The SVZ may become a target for radiation therapy in glioblastoma patients. However, reports studying the effect of irradiation of the SVZ on glioblastoma patient survival show conflicting results. We studied the correlation between incidental SVZ radiation dose and survival in a cohort of isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDHwt) glioblastoma patients with inclusion of important survival prognosticators.	In this retrospective analysis, only adult patients with supratentorial IDHwt glioblastoma were included who were treated with temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy after surgery. The SVZ was contoured on the radiotherapy planning imaging. Cox proportional regression overall survival (OS) analysis was used to study the correlation between SVZ dose and survival. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score, extent of resection and O[6]-methylguanine-methyl-DNA-transferase gene promoter (MGMTp) methylation were used as covariates in multivariate analysis.	In total, 137 patients were included. Median OS was 13.3 months. The MGMTp methylation was present in 40% of cases. Ipsilateral SVZ (iSVZ) mean dose was 44.4 Gy and 27.2 Gy for the contralateral SVZ (cSVZ). Univariate survival analysis showed an inverse relationship between cSVZ mean dose and OS (HR 1.029 (1.003-1.057); p= .032). However, there was no correlation between cSVZ mean dose and OS in multivariate analysis. iSVZ dose did not correlate with survival.	In this cohort of 137 IDHwt glioblastoma patients, iSVZ did not correlate with OS. Higher cSVZ dose was inversely correlated with OS in univariate survival analysis but lost its significance in multivariate analysis, including MGMTp-methylation. Hence, the correlation between SVZ radiation and glioblastoma patient survival remains unclear. Carefully designed prospective studies are needed to provide unequivocal results on this controversial topic.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The present series included 39 children (3-17 years of age) who underwent GKS for cerebral AVMs between January 2002 and February 2008. Twenty-five patients presented with hemorrhages. The median AVM volume was 1.5 cm³, and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy. All patients continued to have follow-up for more than 24 months with serial magnetic resonance images (MRIs)/angiograms. Current school performance has been evaluated using a telephone survey answered by the patients' parents.	Follow-up angiograms, available in 34 patients, confirmed complete obliteration in 16 patients. Serial MRIs indicated obliteration of the nidus in one of five patients without angiography. The diffuse nidus structure and low marginal dose were significantly associated with incomplete obliteration. Twelve patients underwent a second GKS, and subsequent angiographies, available in six patients, demonstrated complete obliteration in two of them. Complications included new-onset seizures (n = 1), apraxia (n = 1), and temporal horn entrapment requiring a shunt operation (n = 1). School performance declined in 14 out of 32 patients. Both the AVM volume and modified AVM score were found to be reliable predictors of school performance.	The results of the present study substantiate the diffuse and other atypical features of pediatric AVMs as major determinants of treatment failure following GKS. Considering the apparent declination of school performance, future prospective studies would be required to investigate the possible late-effects of GKS on neuropsychological function.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

We evaluated the outcome of 44 children with malignant brain tumors treated with HDCx and tandem AuHCT at Children's Hospital Los Angeles between June 1999 and July 2012. Forty-four children with malignant brain tumors were studied. Twenty-one had medulloblastoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor, eight atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), five high-grade glioma, four malignant germ cell tumor, three ependymoma and three choroid plexus carcinoma. Twenty-nine patients received three tandem transplants and 15 received two tandem transplants, respectively. The 5-year PFS and overall survivals (OS) for all patients were 46.3±8.2% and 51.7±8.5%, respectively. The PFS and OS for 27 newly diagnosed patients were 68.9±9.9% and 73.5±9.3%, respectively, compared with 17 transplanted at relapse 11.8±9.8% (P<0.001) and 15.1±12.3% (P=0.0231), respectively. The 5-year PFS and OS in 13 previously unirradiated patients were 74±13% and 74±13% versus 33.2±9.8% and 40.2±10.6% in 31 irradiated patients (P=0.11 and P=0.239), respectively.

The British Columbia Cancer Agency provincial database identified 2268 patients presenting with stage III NSCLC between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2000. Of these, 120 patients received radical CRT, forming the study cohort. Variables analyzed included gender, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, stage, histology, sites of metastasis, and survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.	The study cohort comprised 59 men and 61 women, median age 54.5 years. There were 74 stage IIIA and 46 stage IIIB cases. Histologic subtypes were squamous cell carcinoma (n = 29), adenocarcinoma (n = 53), and other non-squamous histologies (n = 38). Median follow-up time was 17.7 months. Median overall survival time was 19.2 months. Thirty-two patients (27%) developed brain metastasis. Non-brain metastases occurred in 51 patients (42%). No variables were statistically significantly associated with the risk of developing brain metastasis. Trends for higher risks of brain metastasis were observed with younger age (P = 0.09), and poor performance status (P = 0.07). Brain metastasis risk was highest during the first 10 months, progressively declining thereafter.	Stage III NSCLC patients treated with CRT have high risks of brain metastasis which persist during the first 10 months after diagnosis. Studies evaluating cranial prophylaxis will be relevant for these patients, particularly during this early period.

Most CPT research to date has focused on pre- to post-treatment change in total PTSD symptoms; however, PTSD symptom criteria may not change equivalently over the course of treatment. For example, changes in re-experiencing symptoms have been shown to precede changes in other PTSD criteria during other PTSD treatments (i.e. virtual reality exposure therapy, venlafaxine ER). An improved understanding of the mechanism of change in PTSD symptoms during CPT may assist in optimizing treatment.	The purpose of this study was to identify the pattern and temporal precedence of change in PTSD symptom criteria during and after CPT using cross-lagged panel analyses.	Data from veterans (n = 32) enrolled in a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of CPT for MST-related PTSD were utilized for this secondary analysis. Using hierarchical linear modelling, each symptom criterion was entered as a predictor of subsequent change in the other PTSD symptom criteria.	All symptom criteria followed a logarithmic pattern of change. Hyperarousal symptoms were found to both predict and temporally precede change in avoidance symptoms, but not re-experiencing symptoms. Re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms did not predict change in other PTSD symptom criteria.	These findings provide initial support that targeting and reducing hyperarousal symptoms may be a key component of PTSD intervention with CPT. Additional research is needed to identify factors that predict change in PTSD-related re-experiencing symptoms.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) describes the developmental origins and maintenance of a client's problems in both written (reformulation letter) and diagrammatic form (sequential diagrammatic reformulation). This study aimed to investigate the effects of these reformulation tools on insight and symptom change. A small-N repeated measures design was employed with quantitative and qualitative measures collected from six therapist/client dyads. Participating therapists kept a record of their delivery of CAT reformulation tools. Participating clients completed the insight subscale of the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale every fourth session and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-10 every session. Qualitative data from client change interviews regarding their experiences of CAT and attributions of change was explored using template analysis. Participants demonstrated improvements (symptom reduction and insight increases) over the course of the intervention. Administration of reformulation tools did not consistently result in significant changes on insight and symptom measures. However, the tools were identified by participants as leading to insight and emotional change within the context of a good therapeutic relationship. These findings suggest that a genuine therapeutic relationship is an important change mechanism operating through, and strengthened by, CAT-specific tools.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Neurological and cognitive functions were examined by several scales, including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Mini-Mental Status Examination. The depressive state was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Depression Scale. The state of clipping was assessed 1 yr and then every few years after the operation by 3-dimensional computed tomography angiography.	Complete neck clipping was confirmed in 62 aneurysms (98.4%). Perioperative complications occurred in 5 patients (5/63; mild frontalis muscle weakness in 3, anosmia in 1, and meningitis in 1). The mean clinical follow-up period was 5.2 ± 2.1 yr. No patient showed an mRS score more than 2 and all were completely independent in daily life. The depression scores were significantly improved after surgery. The overall mortality was 0% and overall morbidity (mRS score > 2 or Mini-Mental Status Examination score < 24) was 1.6%.

Personalized risk reports, booklets on alcohol-associated risks, and advice from physicians, followed by a health educator call.	Reductions in number of alcoholic drinks.	Thirty-nine percent of the sample had reduced drinking within 2 weeks of receiving the initial intervention. According to the final multiple logistic regression model, those who were concerned about alcohol-related risks (odds ratio (OR)=2.03, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-4.07), read through the educational booklet (OR=2.97, 95% CI=1.48-5.95), or perceived that their physicians discussed risks and advised changing drinking behaviors (OR=4.1, 95% CI=2.02-8.32) had greater odds of reducing drinking by the first health educator call.	Concern about risks, reading educational material, and perception of physicians providing advice to reduce drinking were associated with early reductions in alcohol use in older at-risk drinkers.

Retrospective assessment was performed in 3 neurosurgical centers (2008-2013). All patients with primary GB, unilocular growth, and adjuvant radiochemotherapy in whom subtotal resection was intended were included. Imaging data were pseudonymized and volumetrically assessed by a central reviewer. Clinical outcome was evaluated based on complications, new permanent neurologic deficits, and survival. Based on subtraction of potential EOR (as defined by reviewer) from effective EOR, EOR change (ΔEOR) was calculated for each case. We calculated multivariate linear regressions to assess influence on effective EOR and ΔEOR, binary regressions to assess influence on complications and new permanent neurologic deficits, and Cox regression models to assess survival.	Assessment included 70 patients. In iMRI group, a significantly lower ΔEOR (4% vs. 22%, P = 0.008) was found. In linear regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, only iMRI influenced ΔEOR significantly (P = 0.03, odds ratio 0.27). In binary regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, effective EOR, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, none of the variables showed a significant difference concerning complications and new permanent neurologic deficits. Overall survival was significantly influenced by age (P = 0.03, odds ratio 1.02) and iMRI (P = 0.026, odds ratio 0.51).

297,25226962,Bio-medical materials and engineering,Pilot study of vibration stimulation on neurological rehabilitation.,"Robot-assisted therapy has been proved effective for dyskinesia, and has many unique advantages compared with traditional treatment, such as repeatability, accuracy, objectivity. But some studies show that the effect of the robot-assisted rehabilitation for improving patients' activities of daily life (ADLs) is not obvious. This study introduces a novel auxiliary method-vibration stimulation combined with robots which may improve patients' ADLs. In controlled trials, two kinds of feedback-vibration and visual feedback are applied to prompt subjects for rehabilitation, and electromyographic signals (EMGs) and motion parameters are recorded in real time. Experimental results show that subjects' EMGs using vibration feedback are similar to healthy people, and characteristics of motion are closer to the theoretical value compared with control group. Vibration stimulation may serve as a kind of efficient auxiliary means to improve the efficiency of neurological rehabilitation.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
298,11919447,Pediatric neurosurgery,Impact of selective posterior rhizotomy on fine motor skills. Long-term results using a validated evaluative measure.,"Suprasegmental effects following selective posterior rhizotomy have been frequently reported. However, few studies have used validated functional outcome measures to report the surgical results beyond 3 years. The authors analyzed data obtained from the McGill Rhizotomy Database to determine the long-term impact of lumbosacral dorsal rhizotomy on fine motor skills. The study population comprised children with debilitating spasticity who underwent SPR and were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team preoperatively, at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Quantitative standardized assessments of upper extremity function were obtained using the fine motor skills section of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDMS) test. Of 70 patients who met the entry criteria for the study, 45 and 25 completed the 3- and 5-year assessments, respectively. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant improvements in grasping, hand use, eye-hand coordination, and manual dexterity at 1 year after SPR. More importantly, all improvements were maintained at 3 and 5 years following SPR. This study supports that significant improvements in upper extremity fine motor function using the PDMS evaluative measure are present after SPR and that these suprasegmental benefits are durable.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
299,12201612,Journal of rehabilitation medicine,External power output changes during prolonged cycling with electrical stimulation.,"This study analysed external power output and physiologic responses in 5 individuals with paraplegia during 40 minutes of electrical stimulation leg cycle exercise. Cycling was performed on a motor-driven isokinetic ergometer that enabled precise determinations of power output. Electrical stimulation was increased to 120-140 mA within the first 5 minutes and remained constant thereafter. Power output increased to 10.7 +/- 3.0 W after 2 minutes, dropped to 5.3 +/- 1.8 W after 6 minutes and subsequently recovered to 8.2 +/- 2.2 and 6.1 +/- 2.3 W after 19.5 and 40 minutes, respectively. Oxygen consumption increased to 0.47 +/- 0.09 l/min after 6 minutes and declined during the second half of the exercise bout. Gross mechanical efficiency after 19.5 minutes was elevated compared with the value after 6 minutes. Heart rate was significantly increased at the end of the trial. The time-dependent variability of power output and physiological responses question the concept of steady state for this form of exercise.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
300,18338212,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,Buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction after internal iliac artery embolization in patients prior to endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.,"Coil embolization of the internal iliac artery (IIA) is used to extend the application of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in cases of challenging iliac anatomy. Pelvic ischemia is a complication of the technique, but reports vary as to the rate and severity. This study reports our experience with IIA embolization and compares the results to those of other published series. The vascular unit database of the Leicester Royal Infirmary was used to identify patients who had undergone IIA coil embolization prior to EVAR. Data were collected from hospital case notes and by telephone interviews. Thirty-eight patients were identified; 29 of these were contactable by telephone. A literature search was performed for other studies of IIA embolization and the results were pooled. In this series buttock claudication occurred in 55% (16 of 29 patients) overall: in 52% of unilateral embolizations (11 of 21) and 63% of bilateral embolizations (5 of 8). New erectile dysfunction occurred in 46% (6 of 13 patients) overall: in 38% of unilateral embolizations (3 of 8) and 60% of bilateral embolizations (3 of 5). The literature review identified 18 relevant studies. The results were pooled with our results, to give 634 patients in total. Buttock claudication occurred in 28% overall (178 of 634 patients): in 31% of unilateral embolizations (99 of 322) and 35% of bilateral embolizations (34 of 98) (p = 0.46, Fisher's exact test). New erectile dysfunction occurred in 17% overall (27 of 159 patients): in 17% of unilateral embolizations (16 of 97) and 24% of bilateral embolizations (9 of 38) (p = 0.33). We conclude that buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction are frequent complications of IIA embolization and patients should be counseled accordingly.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Activated macrophages have been shown to induce vascular proliferation and play an important role in ischemic stroke. In this study, we examined the therapeutic effect of GM-CSF on the ischemic brain by activating microglia/macrophages. Rats were subjected to 1-h intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and received an intracarotid injection of GM-CSF (5 ng) or saline immediately after reperfusion. Infarct volume, neurological function and histological findings were assessed 48 h later. An intracarotid injection of GM-CSF reduced the infarct volume and improved neurological function at 48 h after reperfusion. Histological analysis revealed that the number of activated microglia/macrophages to be increased and the number of apoptotic cells to be decreased in the area of the penumbra. These results suggest that intracarotid injection of GM-CSF may have a therapeutic effect on brain ischemia via activation of microglia/macrophages.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
303,9130303,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",Correlation between hippocampal neuronal damage and spatial learning deficit due to global ischemia.,"Global cerebral ischemia leads to selective neuronal damage in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus and in the striatum. This ischemia leads to a deficit in spatial learning and memory in the water maze. The results of earlier studies that have examined the relationship between neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze were not clear-cut. It has been observed that neuroprotection reduces both the deficit in the water maze and the neuronal damage. The present study therefore approached the relationship between the neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze by pharmacological means. Global cerebral ischemia was induced in male Wistar rats by four-vessel occlusion for 20 min. Ischemic rats were then treated with the noncompetitive non-NMDA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 (30 mg/kg), the radical scavenger LY 231617 (20 mg/kg), the inhibitor of protein kinase C staurosporine (0.1 mg/kg), or solvent. Treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial learning by limiting the increase in swim distance due to ischemia. In addition, LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial memory as demonstrated by minimizing the ischemia-induced reduction in time spent in the quadrant of the former platform position during the probe trial. Staurosporine had no influence on the ischemia-induced behavioural changes. Histological examination revealed neuronal damage in the hippocampus and in the striatum in all of the ischemic rats. However, treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the hippocampal damage. Correlation analysis demonstrated a correlation between hippocampal damage and total swim distance (r = 0.88, P < 0.001). No correlation was found between hippocampal damage and quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.24, p > 0.1). No correlation was observed between striatal damage and either total swim distance of the escape trials (r = 0.28. p > 0.1) or quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.08, p > 0.6). It is concluded that a correlation exists between hippocampal damage and the deficit in spatial learning following global cerebral ischemia.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
304,29614295,Journal of neuroscience methods,Methodology and effects of repeated intranasal delivery of DNSP-11 in awake Rhesus macaques.,"To determine if the intranasal delivery of neuroactive compounds is a viable, long-term treatment strategy for progressive, chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), intranasal methodologies in preclinical models comparable to humans are needed.	We developed a methodology to evaluate the repeated intranasal delivery of neuroactive compounds on the non-human primate (NHP) brain, without the need for sedation. We evaluated the effects of the neuroactive peptide, DNSP-11 following repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation over the course of 10-weeks in Rhesus macaques. This approach allowed us to examine striatal target engagement, safety and tolerability, and brain distribution following a single [125]I-labeled DNSP-11 dose.	Our initial data support that repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation of DNSP-11 resulted in bilateral, striatal target engagement based on neurochemical changes in dopamine (DA) metabolites-without observable, adverse behavioral effects or weight loss in NHPs. Furthermore, a [125]I-labeled DNSP-11 study illustrates diffuse rostral to caudal distribution in the brain including the striatum-our target region of interest.	The results of this study are compared to our experiments in normal and 6-OHDA lesioned rats, where DNSP-11 was repeatedly delivered intranasally using a micropipette with animals under light sedation.	The results from this proof-of-concept study support the utility of our repeated intranasal dosing methodology in awake Rhesus macaques, to evaluate the effects of neuroactive compounds on the NHP brain. Additionally, results indicate that DNSP-11 can be safely and effectively delivered intranasally in MPTP-treated NHPs, while engaging the DA system.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
305,7512580,Journal of neuroimmunology,Transforming growth factor-beta 1 inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha/lymphotoxin production and adoptive transfer of disease by effector cells of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,"We previously reported that the CD4+ suppressor cells (Ts) that regulate recovery of Lewis rats from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) produce transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We also reported that TGF-beta downregulates interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, by the CD4+ effector T cells (Te) that mediate EAE. We now report that TGF-beta also inhibits the production of tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin (TNF/LT) by EAE effector cells. When activated in vitro with myelin basic protein (MBP), Te produced TNF/LT, as measured using a WEHI 164 cytotoxicity assay. The specificity of cytokine action was demonstrated using neutralizing antibodies to TNF/LT. When added to the Te+MBP cultures, TGF-beta inhibited TNF/LT production in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibodies augmented TNF/LT production in the Te+MBP cultures. We also confirm that TGF-beta inhibits adoptive transfer of EAE. In contrast, murine IL-10 only partially inhibited TNF/LT and IFN-gamma production by Te. We conclude that TGF-beta production by Ts plays a major role in recovery from EAE in the Lewis rat by inhibiting TNF/LT and IFN-gamma production by the effector cells that mediate EAE.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

307,35955753,International journal of molecular sciences,Synthetic Peucedanocoumarin IV Prevents α-Synuclein Neurotoxicity in an Animal Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Pathological protein inclusion formation and propagation are the main causes of neuronal dysfunction in diverse neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, current disease-modifying therapeutic strategies have targeted this disease protein aggregation process. Recently, we reported that peucedanocoumarin III (PCiii) is a promising therapeutic compound with the ability to disaggregate α-synuclein inclusion and protect dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we found that trans-4'-acetyl-3'-tigloylkhellactone (racemic peucedanocoumarin IV [PCiv]), a structural isomer of PCiii with a higher synthetic yield presented a strong anti-aggregate activity to a degree comparable to that of PCiii. PCiv retained effective inhibitory function against β-sheet aggregate-mimic β23 cytotoxicities and potently prevented α-synucleinopathy in α-synuclein preformed fibril (PFF)-treated mice cortical neurons. In detailed pharmacokinetic profiling of PCiv, oral administration of PCiv in rats exhibited an approximately 97-min half-life and 10% bioavailability. Moreover, tissue distribution analysis revealed favorable profiles of brain penetration with a 6.4 brain-to-plasma concentration ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of PCiv was further evaluated in a sporadic PD mouse model with a combinatorial co-injection of α-synuclein preformed fibril and recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing α-synuclein. Motor dysfunctions induced in this combinatorial α-synucleinopathy PD mouse model was almost completely rescued by PCiv diet administration, and this therapeutic effect is consistent with the marked prevention of dopaminergic neuron loss and suppression of α-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our translational study suggests that PCiv is advantageous as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, especially with its good synthetic yield, high brain distribution, and anti-aggregate activity. PCiv may be useful in the management of α-synuclein inclusion formation and propagation at different stages of PD.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
308,25804195,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,Combination of total Astragalus extract and total Panax notoginseng saponins strengthened the protective effects on brain damage through improving energy metabolism and inhibiting apoptosis after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in mice.,"To explore the effects and molecular mechanisms of the combination between total Astragalus extract (TAE) and total Panax notoginseng saponins (TPNS) against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.	C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into sham-operated group, model group, TAE (110 mg/kg) group, TPNS (115 mg/kg) group, TAE-TPNS combination group and Edaravone (4 mg/kg) group, treated for 4 days, then, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was established by bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) ligation for 20 min followed by reperfusion for 1 and 24 h.	TPNS could increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, TAE and TAE-TPNS combination increased ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) contents and Na[+]-K[+]-ATPase activity, and the effects of TAE-TPNS combination were stronger than those of TAE or TPNS alone after reperfusion for 1 h. After reperfusion for 24 h, TAE, TPNS and TAE-TPNS combination significantly increased neurocyte survival rate and decreased the apoptosis rate as well as down-regulated the expression of phosphorylated c-June N-terminal kinase1/2 (p-JNK1/2), cytochrome C (Cyt C), cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease (Caspase)-9 and Caspase-3. Furthermore, the effects in TAE-TPNS combination were better than those in TAE or TPNS alone.	The combination of TAE 110 mg/kg and TPNS 115 mg/kg could strengthen protective effects on cerebral ischemia injury, the mechanism underlying might be related to improving jointly the early energy metabolism, and relieving the delayed apoptosis via inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway of JNK signal transduction.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
309,17459424,Microvascular research,"Effects of L-arginine on cerebral blood flow, microvascular permeability, number of perfused capillaries, and brain water content in the traumatized mouse brain.","It is has been suggested that decreased production of the vasodilatory and anti-aggregative substance NO (nitric oxide) may result in lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) in injured areas of the traumatized brain. The NO-precursor L-arginine has been shown to counteract CBF decreases early after trauma, but microcirculatory and more long-term effects on CBF of L-arginine have not been investigated. In an attempt to analyze effects of L-arginine on the microcirculation in the traumatized brain, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of L-arginine compared to vehicle (0.9% saline) following a standardized controlled cortical-impact brain trauma in mice. Cerebral blood flow (autoradiography [(14)C]-iodoantipyrine), number of perfused capillaries (FITC-dextran fluorescence technique), brain water content (wet vs. dry weight) and the blood to brain transfer constant K(i) for [(51)Cr]-EDTA were analyzed in the injured and the contralateral cortex. Cortical blood flow in the injured cortex was 0.43+/-0.3 mL/g/min and 0.81+/-0.3 mL/g/min 3 h after trauma in the vehicle and L-arginine groups, respectively (p<0.05), and no treatment effect was seen 24 h after trauma. The number of perfused capillaries decreased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. K(i) increased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. Brain water content was lower in the L-arginine group than in the vehicle group 3 h after trauma and there was no difference between the groups 24 h after trauma. We conclude that L-arginine reduces brain edema formation and improves cortical blood flow in the early phase after a brain trauma, whereas no circulatory effects can be seen after prolonged treatment.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Activation of melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in several neurological diseases. In the present study, we have explored the role of MC1R activation on neuroinflammation and the potential underlying mechanisms after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats.	A total of 169 post-natal day 10 unsexed rat pups were used. HI was induced by right common carotid artery ligation followed by 2.5 h of hypoxia. BMS-470539, a specific selective MC1R agonist, was administered intranasally at 1 h after HI induction. To elucidate the potential underlying mechanism, MC1R CRISPR KO plasmid or Nurr1 CRISPR KO plasmid was administered via intracerebroventricular injection at 48 h before HI induction. Percent brain infarct area, short- and long-term neurobehavioral tests, Nissl staining, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot were conducted.	The expression levels of MC1R and Nurr1 increased over time post-HI. MC1R and Nurr1 were expressed on microglia at 48 h post-HI. Activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 significantly reduced the percent infarct area, brain atrophy, and inflammation, and improved short- and long-term neurological deficits at 48 h and 28 days post-HI. MC1R activation increased the expression of CD206 (a microglial M2 marker) and reduced the expression of MPO. Moreover, activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 significantly increased the expression levels of MC1R, cAMP, p-PKA, and Nurr1, while downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β) at 48 h post-HI. However, knockout of MC1R or Nurr1 by specific CRISPR reversed the neuroprotective effects of MC1R activation post-HI.	Our study demonstrated that activation of MC1R with BMS-470539 attenuated neuroinflammation, and improved neurological deficits after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats. Such anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects were mediated, at least in part, via the cAMP/PKA/Nurr1 signaling pathway. Therefore, MC1R activation might be a promising therapeutic target for infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of ACE in this model and to compare the treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat with that with the angiotensin II antagonist HR 720. The endothelial layer of the left carotid artery was removed using an inflated balloon catheter. Injured and control vessels were both submitted to histomorphological analysis and DNA content quantification at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 days after injury. Evaluation of neointima thickening demonstrated a slow but steady increase of neointima that was significant after day 6 and reached 30% of the lumen in 2 weeks. This was paralleled by an increase in DNA content, which was significant 4 days after injury. ACE mRNA levels were quantified by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. Measurement of ACE mRNA levels revealed a significant upregulation 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. ACE activity was also significantly enhanced at 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. In addition, the treatment with ramiprilat was more efficient in reducing neointima formation than that with HR 720. These data underlie the role of ACE in this model of restenosis. The early induction of ACE expression after endothelial injury but before significant changes in the vessel structure suggests that ACE activity might be one of the mechanisms that trigger neointima formation in the rat.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Ethanol dependence increases the maximum responses to NA and carbachol whereas responsiveness to barium remains unaltered. The concentration-effect curve to calcium was shifted to the left (3.0-fold at the EC50 level).

This study investigated whether LEV can modify induction of dyskinesia by l-dopa or the process of priming.	Drug-naive MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) -lesioned marmosets were treated for 21 days with l-dopa/LEV or l-dopa alone. Subsequently, the animals were left untreated for 1 week and then both groups were challenged with a single dose of l-dopa alone on day 29. Behavior was assessed by automated activity counts and by post hoc analysis of videotapes using validated rating scales.	LEV had no significant effect on the appearance of dyskinesia when administered de novo in combination with l-dopa. However, after a week of drug holiday, the 2 groups exhibited a different response to an acute l-dopa challenge. Thus, animals previously treated with l-dopa alone exhibited a similar level of dyskinesia to that seen on day 21 of the repeated treatment phase of the study. However, animals previously treated with l-dopa/LEV demonstrated significantly reduced dyskinesia compared with day 21 of the repeated treatment phase of the study.	LEV does not modify the onset of dyskinesia following de novo treatment with l-dopa. However, concomitant treatment with l-dopa/LEV reduces the level of dyskinesia induced by l-dopa following a drug holiday. Thus, prior treatment with LEV appears to modify the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of l-dopa-induced dyskinesia.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Cerebral ischemia was induced in swiss albino mice by performing BCCAO surgery. Morris water-maze test was utilized to assess the learning ability and memory of the animals. The whole brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, TBARS, GSH levels and MPO activity were evaluated as the biochemical parameters. For histopathological evaluation of the cerebral infarct size, TTC staining was employed.	Administration of L-carnosine (500   mg/kg, i.p.) successfully attenuated the manifestations of cerebral ischemia. Higher levels of AChE, TBARS, and MPO were observed in BCCAO treated animals, which were successfully attenuated by treatment with L-carnosine and ischemic postconditioning. Whereas administration of L-carnosine and ischemic postconditioning significantly increased the level of GSH in BCCAO treated animals. Moreover, treatment with ranitidine, an H2 blocker (30 NMol, i.c.v) antagonized the neuroprotective actions of L-carnosine evidenced by decrease in MWM performance, increase in the level of AChE and oxidative stress, while decrease in GSH level in brain. The cerebral infarct size was found to be more in BCCAO inflicted animals, which was improved by the administration of L-carnosine, while the cerebral infarct size worsened by treatment with ranitidine (3   nmol, i.c.v.).	It is concluded that L-carnosine exerts neuroprotective effect via involvement of histidine-histamine pathway since the beneficial effects of L-carnosine were abolished by the H2-blocker.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

DNA methylation may be a possible mechanism for persistence of such memory. Here we injected the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza) into hippocampus CA1 area and prelimbic cortex during the stages of acquisition and expression of cocaine-induced place preference in C57BL/6 mice. Results showed that in CA1 DNA methylation inhibitors could restrain acquisition but had no impact on expression of the cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). On the contrary, in prelimbic cortex, 5-aza had no effect on acquisition but blocked expression. Our results indicated that DNA methylation in hippocampus is required for learning; while DNA methylation in prelimbic cortex is necessary for memory retrieval. The present finding is consistent with the role of the hippocampus as a structure contributing to cocaine-induced memory acquisition, and prelimbic cortex, a part of prefrontal cortex as an area responsible for cocaine-induced memory retrieval. In conclusion, DNA methylation does play an important role in drug-induced learning and memory although the detailed effect still calls for further research.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
317,1506887,Journal of neurosurgery,Selective blood-tumor barrier disruption by leukotrienes.,"The authors have previously reported that intracarotid infusion of 5 micrograms leukotriene C4 (LTC4) selectively increases blood-tumor barrier permeability in rat RG-2 tumors. In this study, rats harboring RG-2 tumors were given 15-minute intracarotid infusions of LTC4 at concentrations ranging from 0.5 microgram to 50.0 micrograms (seven rats in each dose group). Blood-tumor and blood-brain barrier permeability were determined by quantitative autoradiography using 14C aminoisobutyric acid. The transfer constant for permeability (Ki) within the tumors was increased twofold by LTC4 doses of 2.5, 5.0, and 50.0 micrograms compared to vehicle alone (90.00 +/- 21.14, 92.68 +/- 15.04, and 80.17 +/- 16.15 vs. 39.37 +/- 6.45 microliters/gm/min, respectively; mean +/- standard deviation; p less than 0.01). No significant change in Ki within the tumors was observed at the 0.5-microgram LTC4 dose. Blood-brain barrier permeability was selectively increased within the tumors. At no dose in this study did leukotrienes increase permeability within normal brain. To determine the duration of increased opening of the blood-tumor barrier by LTC4 administration, Ki was measured at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after termination of a 15-minute LTC4 infusion (seven rats at each time point). The mean Ki value was still high at 15 minutes (92.68 +/- 15.04 microliters/gm/min), but declined at 30 minutes (56.58 +/- 12.50 microliters/gm/min) and 60 minutes (55.40 +/- 8.10 microliters/gm/min) after the end of LTC4 infusion. Sulfidopeptide leukotrienes LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 and LTF4 were infused to compare their potency in opening the blood-tumor barrier.

318,35446941,Brain : a journal of neurology,Clearance of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prions in vivo by the Hsp70 disaggregase system.,"The metazoan Hsp70 disaggregase protects neurons from proteotoxicity that arises from the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. Hsp70 and its co-chaperones disassemble and extract polypeptides from protein aggregates for refolding or degradation. The effectiveness of the chaperone system decreases with age and leads to accumulation rather than removal of neurotoxic protein aggregates. Therapeutic enhancement of the Hsp70 protein disassembly machinery is proposed to counter late-onset protein misfolding neurodegenerative disease that may arise. In the context of prion disease, it is not known whether stimulation of protein aggregate disassembly paradoxically leads to enhanced formation of seeding competent species of disease-specific proteins and acceleration of neurodegenerative disease. Here we have tested the hypothesis that modulation of Hsp70 disaggregase activity perturbs mammalian prion-induced neurotoxicity and prion seeding activity. To do so we used prion protein (PrP) transgenic Drosophila that authentically replicate mammalian prions. RNASeq identified that Hsp70, DnaJ-1 and Hsp110 gene expression was downregulated in prion-exposed PrP Drosophila. We demonstrated that RNAi knockdown of Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila enhanced neurotoxicity, whereas overexpression mitigated toxicity. Strikingly, prion seeding activity in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila was ablated or reduced by Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 overexpression, respectively. Similar effects were seen in scrapie prion-exposed ovine PrP Drosophila with modified Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression. These unique observations show that the metazoan Hsp70 disaggregase facilitates the clearance of mammalian prions and that its enhanced activity is a potential therapeutic strategy for human prion disease.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
319,34180761,Drug delivery,Nose-to-brain delivery of borneol modified tanshinone IIA nanoparticles in prevention of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Targeted treatment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) remains a problem due to the difficulty in drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we developed Bo-TSA-NP, a novel tanshinone IIA (TSA) loaded nanoparticles modified by borneol, which has long been proved with the ability to enhance other drugs' transport across the BBB. The Bo-TSA-NP, with a particle size of about 160 nm, drug loading of 3.6%, showed sustained release and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition property. It demonstrated a significantly higher uptake by 16HBE cells in vitro through the clathrin/caveolae-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis. Following intranasal (IN) administration, Bo-TSA-NP significantly improved the preventive effect on a rat model of CIRI with improved neurological scores, decreased cerebral infarction areas and a reduced content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rat brain. In conclusion, these results indicate that Bo-TSA-NP is a promising nose-to-brain delivery system that can enhance the prevention effect of TSA on CIRI.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
320,19397425,Journal of neurotrauma,Dose and chemical modification considerations for continuous cyclic AMP analog delivery to the injured CNS.,"In this investigation, two cell-permeable synthetic analogs of cAMP, dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) and 8-bromo-cAMP, which are widely used to elevate intracellular cAMP levels under experimental conditions, were investigated for their ability to dose-dependently improve histological and functional outcomes following continuous delivery in two models of incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). The cAMP analogs were delivered via osmotic minipumps at 1-250 mM through an indwelling cortical cannula or by intrathecal infusion for up to 4 weeks after either a T8 unilateral over-hemisection or a C2-3 dorsolateral quadrant lesion, respectively. In both SCI models, continuous db-cAMP delivery was associated with histopathological changes that included sporadic micro-hemorrhage formation and cavitation, enhanced macrophage infiltration and tissue damage at regions beyond the immediate application site; no deleterious or beneficial effect of agent delivery was observed at the spinal injury site. Furthermore, these changes were accompanied by pronounced behavioral deficits that included an absence of progressive locomotor recovery, increased extensor tone, paralysis, and sensory abnormalities. These deleterious effects were not observed in saline-treated animals, in animals in which the db-cAMP dose did not exceed 1 mM, or in those animals that received a high dose (250 mM) of the alternative cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP. These results demonstrate that, for continuous intraparenchymal or intrathecal administration of cAMP analogs for the study of biological or therapeutic effects within the central nervous system (CNS), consideration of the effective concentration applied as well as the potential toxicity of chemical moieties on the parent molecule and/or their activity needs to be taken into account.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

DDAVP was started with the diagnosis of lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis (LINH). Three months later, she complained of right visual acuity loss. MRI revealed right optic nerve swelling, compatible with the diagnosis of the retrobulbar optic neuritis. She had two other such episodes in the next 3 months. She developed a transient oculomotor and abducens nerve palsies as well. Each time the symptoms disappeared with corticosteroid therapy. The pituitary stalk became normal in size 6 months later.

Most of these tumors are mitotically low in activity in accord with their benign clinical course. However, increased mitotic activity has been noted in several cases, one of which had an ultimately fatal outcome. Here, the authors present a tumor showing angiocentric glioma and glioblastoma-like features, with recurrence of the lower-grade component after radiotherapy. A 15-year-old boy presented with a 3-month history of progressive left-sided weakness and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large heterogeneous mass in the right frontal lobe, with mild post-Gd enhancement. A gross-total resection was obtained. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue revealed a tumor with 2 distinct appearances: 1) a mildly to moderately cellular infiltrating tumor with angiocentric glioma characteristics, and 2) a markedly cellular glioblastoma-like tissue with necrosis and microvascular proliferation. The patient received a course of postoperative radiotherapy to 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions administered over the course of 6.5 weeks, but his tumor recurred 4 months after resection. A second resection was then performed. The recurrent tumor exhibited radiation-induced changes and persistent characteristics of angiocentric glioma, but it had fewer malignant features; the mitotic activity was lower, and there was no necrosis or microvascular proliferation. The findings in this case, along with those in several previously reported cases, suggest that angiocentric gliomas may have a malignant variant or malignant transformation. Angiocentric gliomas with malignant features tend to recur, for which surgical intervention followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be offered as a therapeutic option.",Human-case-report,4,0

Administration of bromocriptine, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were initiated. Emergent craniotomy was required for rapid regrowth of the tumor. Histological examination found predominant sarcomatous components. Tumor growth was difficult to control. The patient died of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a pseudoaneurysm involving the C1 portion of the right internal carotid artery. Pituitary adenoma rarely shows malignant transformation. In this case, prolactinoma underwent malignant change to sarcoma.

334,25651393,The journal of ECT,Efficacy of Cathodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Over the Left Orbitofrontal Cortex in a Patient With Treatment-Resistant Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling and frequent neuropsychiatric disorder. Forty percent to 60% of patients with OCD fail to respond to available treatments. Neuroimaging studies have highlighted an association between the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms and an increased activity of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in patients with OCD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a powerful and easy-to-use tool to modulate brain activity. Cathodal tDCS (c-tDCS) is assumed to decrease cortical excitability in the targeted brain region. We hypothesized that c-tDCS applied over the left OFC alleviates symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. We report here the case of a patient who received 10 sessions (2 mA, 20 minutes) of c-tDCS. The tDCS sessions were delivered twice a day with a 2-hour interval, with the cathode (35 cm[2]) placed over the left OFC and the anode (100 cm[2]) placed over the contralateral occipital region. No adverse event was reported. One month after the completion of the tDCS sessions, we observed a 26% reduction in severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores. These findings are consistent with a previous study reporting a similar reduction in obsessive and compulsive symptoms after a low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was given to the left OFC. Our results indicate that c-tDCS applied over the left OFC may be a suitable and safe treatment in patients with treatment-resistant OCD.",Human-case-report,4,0

We report a case of a 5-year-old girl with a 2-month history of right hemiparesis. The initial magnetic resonance imaging scan mimicked the appearance of malignant glioma or cerebral infarction. By use of neuroimaging alone, it was extremely difficult to reach an appropriate diagnosis.	Pathological examination of a surgical specimen of the lesion revealed histological characteristics typical of HLH. Because of the absence of both physical and blood chemical findings of systemic HLH, the patient was diagnosed as having HLH isolated in the CNS without systemic HLH. Radiotherapy with corticosteroid administration led to complete resolution of the CNS lesions, but the duration of remission was only 3 months. The patient died secondary to refractory progression of the CNS lesion.	Radiotherapy with corticosteroid administration led to a complete resolution of the lesions, although for only a transitory remission.

A search was undertaken for the diagnosis of paracetamol overdoses in the diagnoses registry of the National University Hospital of Iceland from 2004 to 2009 serving a population of 219,249 inhabitants. Relevant information was collected from medical records.	A total of 1913 drug-related poisoning episodes were identified and reviewed, 352 (18%) involved paracetamol overdoses. The annual incidence of paracetamol overdoses declined from 30.0 (2004) to 16.0/100,000 per year (2009) (p < 0.05). The female/male ratio was 3.0 and the largest age group was 16-25 years.

We observed two PD patients with unusual buccolingual masticatory movements which did not seem to fluctuate, either throughout the day during dopaminergic treatment or during a standardised levodopa challenge. After their dopaminergic treatment had been changed to a less pulsatile form of administration (ie, the use of dopamine agonist alone in the first patient and an increase in the dosage of dopamine agonist with a low dose of levodopa in the second), these abnormal movements totally disappeared in the first patient and were greatly improved in the second.

346,28645717,Vaccine,Surveillance of pneumococcal colonization and invasive pneumococcal disease reveals shift in prevalent carriage serotypes in Massachusetts' children to relatively low invasiveness.,"Following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), overall nasopharyngeal colonization rates have not changed significantly, however a dramatic and sustained decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children was observed in every setting where the PCVs were implemented. We aimed to describe the differences in invasive disease potential of serotypes that are common colonizers in pre- and post-vaccine eras in order to provide further insight in our understanding of dynamic epidemiology of pneumococcal diseases.	Using data from surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage and enhanced surveillance for IPD, a serotype specific 'invasive capacity (IC)' was computed by dividing the incidence of IPD due to serotype x by the carriage prevalence of that same serotype in children <7years of age in Massachusetts. We have evaluated the serotype specific invasive capacity in two periods; pre-PCV13 (2001/02, 2003/04, 2006/07, 2008/09) and post-PCV13 (2010/11 and 2013/14), and by age groups; <24monthsvs. ≥24months.	An approximate 50-fold variation in the point estimate was observed between the serotypes having the highest (7F, 38, 19A, 3, 33F) and the lowest (6C, 35B, 21, 11A, 23B and 23A) computed serotype specific invasive disease potential. In the post-PCV13 era (6C, 35B, 11A, 23B and 23A), 5 of the 7 most common serotypes colonizing the nasopharynx were serotypes with the lowest invasive capacity. Serotype specific invasive capacity trended down in older children for majority of the serotypes, and serotypes 3, 10A and 19A had significantly lower invasive capacity in children older than 24months of age compared to younger children.	Invasive capacity differs among serotypes and likely by age. Point estimates of IC for most of the common serotypes colonizing children in Massachusetts in post-PCV13 era were low and likely explain the continued reduction in IPD from the pre-PCV era in the absence of specific protection against these serotypes.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Patients underwent nocturnal penile tumescence testing and, if results were abnormal, penile duplex ultrasonography with intracavernous injection and arteriography were performed to diagnose the etiology of ED. Patients were questioned about erectile function every 3 months after surgery and if they complained of ED they were offered 100 mg sildenafil. Patients were followed for at least 18 months after surgery.	A total of 29 consecutive patients were evaluated and 22 (76%) of them had ED before surgery. Sufficient followup was available for 15 of the patients. Overall 47% of these patients responded favorably to sildenafil. Of the patients 60% with neurogenic ED and 20% of those with arterial ED responded to this treatment. In 33% of the patients ED resolved within the followup period. All patients with spontaneous resolution of ED previously responded to sildenafil (71% of sildenafil responders).	In patients with ED due to PFUD, those with neurogenic ED are more likely to respond to sildenafil than those with arterial damage. Favorable response to sildenafil may predict spontaneous resumption of normal erectile function over time.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
349,32767873,The primary care companion for CNS disorders,Second-Generation Antipsychotics and Pneumonia-Related Hospitalizations.,"To compare the rate of hospitalizations for pneumonia in patients with a psychotic or bipolar disorder who were prescribed 1 of 4 second-generation antipsychotics prior to admission.	This retrospective cohort study included patients who were medically admitted for pneumonia to a 2,059-bed academic medical center or its associated health system hospital. Medical records of 872 admissions from November 1, 2016 to December 15, 2018, were included for all adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder prescribed clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone prior to admission.	There was no significantly increased risk of pneumonia for patients taking olanzapine (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% CI, 0.48-2.41) or quetiapine (OR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.42-2.25) prior to admission compared to risperidone. When controlling for various factors, treatment with a combination of antipsychotics including clozapine (OR = 2.28, 95% CI, 1.13-4.62, P = .022) and clozapine alone (OR = 2.37, 95% CI, 1.30-4.32, P = .005) was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia-related hospitalization compared to treatment with risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine alone.	The findings of this study in combination with other published literature support an association of an increased risk of pneumonia with the use of clozapine, although this cannot be interpreted as causal. These data show that use of clozapine alone or in combination with other antipsychotics significantly increases risk of pneumonia, although this finding cannot be deemed causal due to study design.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
350,14673555,European journal of clinical pharmacology,Pharmacokinetic modelling of valproic acid from routine clinical data in Egyptian epileptic patients.,"This paper describes a developed pharmacokinetic model for the estimation of valproic acid (VPA) clearance (CL) calculated from routine clinical data taken from Egyptian epileptic patients.	Retrospective clinical data from 81 adult and paediatric epileptic patients with one trough VPA serum concentration per patient were analysed using NONMEM to estimate drug CL and determine the influence of different covariates. A qualification group of 20 epileptic children (3-13 years old) was used to evaluate the final model.	The population CL as estimated by base model (no covariates) was 0.581 l h(-1) with inter-individual variability (C.V. %) of 17.4% and SD of residual error was 6.82 mg l(-1). Univariate selection and backward deletion of different covariates led to the development of the final regression model of CL as follows: CL(Lh-1) = 0.101 + 0.151 * CBZ + 0.000248 * VPADD + 0.0968 * age/20 + 0.0803 * INDI, in which CBZ indicates co-administration of carbamazepine, VPADD the daily dose of VPA and INDI uncontrolled epilepsy. The between-subject variability in CL was 23.6% while the standard deviation of the residual error was 5.24 mg l(-1). The model predictions in the qualification group were found to have no bias and satisfactory precision.	The population pharmacokinetic model for VPA could be used for a priori recommendation and dose optimisation of that drug in the Egyptian population of epileptic patients.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
351,16038683,Biological psychiatry,Emotional dysregulation in adult ADHD and response to atomoxetine.,"Before 1980, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was called minimal brain dysfunction and included emotional symptoms now listed as 'associated features' in DSM-IV. Data from two multicenter, placebo-controlled studies with 536 patients were reexamined to assess: 1) the pervasiveness of these symptoms in samples of adults with ADHD; 2) the response of these symptoms to atomoxetine; and 3) their association with depressive/anxiety symptoms.	The Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (WRAADDS) was used to assess temper, affective lability, and emotional overreactivity, thus identifying patients exhibiting 'emotional dysregulation.' Other DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses were exclusionary. Outcome measures were the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) and the WRAADDS.	Thirty-two percent of the sample met post hoc criteria for emotional dysregulation and had higher baseline scores on ADHD measures, a lower response to placebo, and greater response to atomoxetine (p = .048). Symptoms of emotional dysregulation had a treatment effect (p < .001) at least as large as the CAARS (p = .002) and the total WRAADDS (p = .001). Emotional dysregulation was present in the absence of anxiety or depressive diagnosis.

352,15820354,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Do antiepileptic drugs accelerate forgetting?,"The majority of patients with epilepsy become seizure-free with antiepileptic drug therapy. However, seizures in approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy are difficult to treat with antiepileptic drugs and require high doses or polytherapy. High dosages increase the risk of cognitive side effects. We retrospectively investigated 162 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy to determine whether the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin affect the acquisition and retention of verbal and visual information. We found that patients with high serum levels of these antiepileptic drugs were selectively impaired in the retention but not acquisition of new information. Intelligence, age, duration of epilepsy, and seizure frequency were controlled for and were not factors in the observed results. There were no differences in favor of a certain drug with respect to memory functioning. Our results suggest that patients with refractory epilepsy with high serum levels of the antiepileptic drugs studied are at higher risk of accelerated forgetting.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Open study.	36 children ranging in age from 3 to 17 years who fit the diagnostic criteria for ADHD.	AD-FX capsules were taken twice a day on an empty stomach for 4 weeks. Patients were instructed not to change any other medications during the study.	At the beginning of the study, after 2 weeks, and then at the end of the 4-week trial, parents completed the Conners' Parent Rating Scale--revised, long version, a questionnaire that assesses a broad range of problem behaviours (and was used as an indication of ADHD symptom severity).	After 2 weeks of treatment, the proportion of the subjects exhibiting improvement (i.e., decrease in T-score of at least 5 points) ranged from 31% for the anxious-shy attribute to 67% for the psychosomatic attribute. After 4 weeks of treatment, the proportion of subjects exhibiting improvement ranged from 44% for the social problems attribute to 74% for the Conners' ADHD index and the DSM-IV hyperactive-impulsive attribute. Five (14%) of 36 subjects reported adverse events, only 2 of which were considered related to the study medication.	These preliminary results suggest AD-FX treatment may improve symptoms of ADHD and should encourage further research on the use of ginseng and Ginkgo biloba extracts to treat ADHD symptoms.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

We investigated whether response to the EBP was related to the distance of the injection site from the leakage site in patients with SIH.	We reviewed patients with SIH who underwent EBP at a single hospital. Patients were assigned to group R (response after EBP) or group N (no response after EBP). We then analyzed the demographics, clinical characteristics, leakage site, leakage length, EBP injection level and distance from leakage site, and injected EBP volume.	Sixty-two patients were included in the analysis. The overall response rate to EBP was 59.7% (37 patients). The leakage length and injection distance from the leakage site did not differ between the two groups. Age, gender, body mass index, leakage site, and EBP volume did not differ significantly between the two groups.	The clinical effect of EBP in SIH was not affected by leakage length or injection distance to leakage site. Further large studies must be conducted to investigate the efficacy of targeted EBP for SIH.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
355,15642876,Archives of internal medicine,Statin use and survival outcomes in elderly patients with heart failure.,"Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of heart failure. Statins are efficacious drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, but their value in persons with heart failure remains unknown.	We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study involving the entire province of Ontario, Canada, restricting participants to those aged 66 to 85 years who were free of cancer and who survived at least 90 days following hospitalization for newly diagnosed heart failure. The primary study outcome was the risk of death from all causes, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke among persons newly dispensed statins (n = 1,146) relative to those who were not (n = 27,682).	The mean age of all participants was 76.5 years, and half were women. During the 7-year study period, death, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 217 statin recipients (13.6 per 100 person-years) vs 12,299 nonrecipients (21.8 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.83). Most of the benefit from statins was related to a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78). No significant reduction was seen for subsequent myocardial infarction (adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63-1.03) or stroke (adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.53-1.25).	Statin use is associated with a lower risk of death among seniors newly diagnosed as having congestive heart failure. While statin use has been previously shown to be efficacious in patients with coronary heart disease and stroke, we could not control for all prognostic risk factors in the present study, including left ventricular ejection fraction and serum lipid levels. Better evidence can direct clinicians about which patients with heart failure might benefit from these drugs.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The study is a retrospective observational cohort study.	The study retrieved data from electronic health record from Hospital Authority (HA), HK.	The study included patients aged 18 years old or above, who were admitted to seven institutions under HA with diagnosis of ACS during 2008-2017.	The primary outcome was the frequency of antiplatelet therapy prescription at the point of index hospitalisation discharge each year during 2008-2017. Association between demographics, baseline comorbidities, procedures and antiplatelet prescription were examined as secondary outcome using multivariate logistic regression model, with commonly used antiplatelet groups selected for comparison.	Among the included 14 716 patients, 5888 (40.0%) discharged with aspirin alone, 6888 (46.8%) discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel, and 973 (6.6%) discharged with DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor. Prescribing rate of aspirin alone decreased substantially from 56.8% in 2008 to 27.5% in 2017. Utilisation of DAPT with clopidogrel increased from 33.7% in 2008 to 52.7% in 2017. Use of DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor increased from 0.3% in 2010 to 15.3% in 2017. Compared with those prescribed with DAPT with clopidogrel, male patients (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.65), patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (aOR 2.50, 1.98 to 3.16) or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (aOR 3.26, 2.59 to 4.09), use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (aOR 3.03, 2.48 to 3.68) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (aOR 3.85, 3.24 to 4.58) or coronary artery bypass graft (aOR 6.52, 4.63 to 9.18) during index hospitalisation, concurrent use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (aOR 1.35, 1.10 to 1.65) or proton pump inhibitors (aOR 3.57, 2.93 to 4.36) during index hospitalisation discharge were more likely to be prescribed with DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor. Patients with older age (aOR 0.97, 0.96 to 0.97), diabetes (aOR 0.68, 0.52 to 0.88), chronic kidney disease (aOR 0.43, 0.22 to 0.85) or concurrent use of oral anticoagulant (aOR 0.16, 0.07 to 0.42) were more likely to received DAPT with clopidogrel.	Use of DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor was suboptimal yet improving during 2008-2017 in HK patients with ACS. Considering DAPT, predictors for clopidogrel prescription, compared with prasugrel/ticagrelor, were consistent with identified risk factors of bleeding.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
357,8895943,Pharmacopsychiatry,Low plasma thyroid indices of depressed patients are attenuated by antidepressant drugs and influence treatment outcome.,"Decreased turnover of thyroid indices and blunting of TSH release after TRH administration has been associated with depressive disorder. A further decrease in plasma thyroid hormone; during antidepressant treatment has been reported. However, the putative association between the plasma thyroid indices' concentration and response has not been addressed. In the present study 21 depressed inpatients underwent a four-week double blind antidepressant with amitriptyline and mianserin; their plasma thyroid hormone indices (total thyroxine [TT4], free thyroxine [FT4], total triiodothyronine [TT3], free triiodothyronine [FT3], thyrotropin [TSH], and thyroglobulin [TBG]) were quantified to elucidate their involvement in depression and during antidepressant drug treatment. Depressed patients' plasma TSH, when corrected for age, was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects. During antidepressant treatment the entire patient cohort showed a significant decrease in plasma TT4 and FT4 concentrations. Responders showed a significant drop in TT4 FT4, FT3, and T4/TBG, but nonresponders only a decrease in FT4. During mianserin treatment, a decrease was observed in TT4, FT4, FT3, and T4/TBG. FT4 and FT3 baseline levels correlated positively with the improvement in the Hamilton Depression Rating Score (HDRS). These findings show that depressed inpatients' serum TSH levels are within the reference range, but significantly lower than those of healthy subjects, and those patients who turn out to be nonresponders have potentially lower availability of thyroid hormones than responders. Therefore, we hypothesize that in order to assure clinical improvement in depression, an adequate capacity of the thyroid hormone pool is necessary to compensate for the additional antidepressant-provoked decrease in serum thyroid hormone availability.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Using an anonymized longitudinal patient-level dataset that captures information on medical and pharmacy claims in the United States (October 1, 2014 through March 31, 2020), buprenorphine prescriptions, days' supply, and daily dose were described overall and stratified by induction (month 1) vs. maintenance (month 2-6) treatment, along with duration of concomitant benzodiazepines or opioid analgesics.	Overall, there were 1.5 million buprenorphine treatment episodes initiated between January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2019 (2015: 258,899; 2019: 351,378). Treatment episodes included an average of 6.8 buprenorphine prescriptions (standard deviation [SD] = 6.7), 16.8 days' supply per prescription (SD = 10.5), 94.2 total days' supply per treatment episode (SD = 71.4), and a mean daily dose of 13.6 mg (SD = 6.3), with the number of prescriptions and total days' supply per treatment episode declining over the study period. There was a lower mean number of days' supply per prescription in the first month of treatment compared to months 2-6 (month 1: 15.8 [SD = 11.0]; month 2-6: 19.0 [SD = 10.1]) and daily dose per prescription (month 1: 13.3 mg [SD = 6.4]; months 2-6: 14.3 mg [SD = 6.2]), and a higher mean number of prescriptions per month (month 1: 2.5 per month [SD = 1.7]; months 2-6: 1.8 per month [SD = 1.2]). From 2015 to 2019, there appeared to be a shift in payer mix, with increases in Medicaid/Medicare and declines in cash and commercial insurance. Concomitant benzodiazepine and opioid analgesic use declined over time; in 2019, 16.6 % and 14.3 % of treatment episodes had any concomitant benzodiazepine or opioid analgesic, respectively, and <5 % had chronic (>90 overlapping days) concomitant use (3.0 % and 0.4 %, respectively).	The number of oral buprenorphine treatment episodes increased over the study period, and prescribing was generally consistent with the REMS and other treatment guidelines. There was a decline in concomitant buprenorphine and benzodiazepine or opioid analgesics, and chronic concomitant use was rare.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
359,7599368,The Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,Medroxyprogesterone treatment for paraphiliacs.,"This study addresses the following questions: (1) what are the essential components of a medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) pretreatment evaluation?; (2) do paraphilic men treated with MPA (Depo-Provera) report a lowering of both deviant and nondeviant sexual drive and activities?; (3) is behavioral improvement associated with testosterone level reductions?; and (4) what significant side effects are associated with MPA treatment? A total of 29 paraphilic men who underwent a comprehensive psychiatric, medical, and legal evaluation and were eligible for treatment with MPA were followed naturalistically while receiving concurrent MPA and group therapy. The principal outcome measures were data obtained from a weekly self-reported psychosexual inventory that quantified five dimensions of deviant and nondeviant sexual activities and testosterone levels that were drawn pretreatment and after three and six months of MPA. Self-reported data were analyzed by nonparametric methods. Because MPA's effectiveness is evident early in treatment, we report on data from the first six months. Subjects reported a differential rate of suppression of sexual activities, a median of up to two weeks for deviant and 2 to 10 weeks for nondeviant behaviors (p < or = .01 for each of the five dimensions). Testosterone levels suppressed to less than 0.5 ng per milliliter for all but two subjects at three months and for all at six months. Recidivism was reported for one subject. Except for one subject who developed pulmonary emboli, no major medical problems were encountered. MPA safely and effectively reduced sex drive, controlled deviant sexual impulses and behavior, and lowered the testosterone levels of these paraphilic men during the first six months of treatment. However, the relative rapidity and completeness of the response raises questions regarding possible distortions in self-reported sexual activities. This should alert the practicing clinician to consider the use of collateral sources of information in interpreting treatment outcome for patients with paraphilic behaviors. Also, longer follow-up periods are required for monitoring treatment efficacy.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

There was minimal or no toxicity. Twenty of 30 patients (66%) receiving at least twice weekly poly-ICLC showed regression or stabilization of gadolinium-enhancing tumor, as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (median = 65% volume decrease). All but one patient with anaplastic astrocytomas who received continuous poly-ICLC remain alive, with a median progression-free survival of 54 months from diagnosis. Median Kaplan-Meier survival is 19 months for patients with glioblastomas who receive at least twice weekly poly-ICLC treatments. Tumor response was associated with 2',5' -oligoadenylate synthetase activation (P = 0.03) but not with serum interferon. We hypothesize clinical activation by poly-ICLC of a basic host tumor suppressor system. Prolonged, quality survival with tumor stabilization or regression confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging for most patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas suggests that more extensive laboratory and controlled clinical studies are warranted. The concept of long-term, broad spectrum stimulation of host defenses with nontoxic, inexpensive double-stranded ribonucleic acids, such as low-dose poly-ICLC, may be applicable to the treatment of other malignancies.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Participants with major depressive disorder (N = 2875) at primary and specialty care sites who received the first step treatment with citalopram in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression study were included. Patients were enrolled between July 2001 and April 2004. Melancholic features were ascribed by previously developed algorithms of telephone interview ratings prior to treatment. Demographics, clinical features, and treatment response were compared between those with and without melancholic features.	The 23.5% of participants with melancholic features were characterized by higher severity scores, greater rates of previous suicide attempts and ratings of current suicidal risk, and more concurrent psychiatric comorbidity. Unadjusted remission rates for those with melancholic features were statistically significantly reduced in absolute terms by up to 8.4% compared to those without melancholic features, which is a 24.1% decrease in relative chance of remission (p < .0001). Following adjustments for between-group baseline differences, remission rates were no longer different.	Melancholic features are associated with a significantly reduced remission rate with an SSRI. This effect appears to be accounted for by demographic and clinical features associated with melancholic features.	clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT0021528.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

To assess the associations of tramadol, compared with codeine, with mortality and other adverse clinical outcomes as used in outpatient settings.	Retrospective, population-based, propensity score-matched cohort study using a primary care database with routinely collected medical records and pharmacy dispensations covering more than 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain (≈6 million people).

New prescription dispensation of tramadol or codeine (no dispensation in the previous year).	Outcomes studied were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, constipation, delirium, falls, opioid abuse/dependence, and sleep disorders within 1 year after the first dispensation. Absolute rate differences (ARDs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using cause-specific Cox models.	Of the 1 093 064 patients with a tramadol or codeine dispensation during the study period (326 921 for tramadol, 762 492 for codeine, 3651 for both drugs concomitantly), a total of 368 960 patients (184 480 propensity score-matched pairs) were included after study exclusions and propensity score matching (mean age, 53.1 [SD, 16.1] years; 57.3% women).

The primary objective was to determine the effectiveness of antidepressant medications on lowering depressive symptom scores in patients with manifest HD. The secondary objective was to determine the effect of antidepressant use on measures of disease progression.	After retrospectively identifying motor-manifest HD participants with at least borderline depressive symptoms from the Enroll-HD database, 86 new users of antidepressant medication were exact matched with non-users on depression score, and matched on propensity scores developed using age, sex, CAG repeat length, anxiety scores, and disease progression measures. Linear mixed effect models were used to assess the change in depression scores, anxiety scores, and disease progression measures based on antidepressant use between two visits approximately one-year apart.	There was no significant difference in the change in depression score between antidepressant users and non-users (p = 0.46). There were also no significant differences in the change in total motor score (p = 0.88), total functional capacity score (p = 0.16), number correct on the symbol digit modality test (p = 0.49), or anxiety score (p = 0.68).	Initiation of antidepressant medication was not associated with a greater reduction in depressive symptoms or changes in other symptoms when compared to non-use. The findings of this study support further research on the effectiveness of antidepressants in Huntington's disease patients.

TAU responders (patients who had a 50% or greater reduction in MADRS scores from baseline at any time) demonstrated a significant difference from nonresponders in pH changes from baseline (effect size = 150). These results suggest that TAU treatment may decrease symptoms of depression and improve mitochondrial functioning.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
366,2517493,Hormone research,Estrogen feedback in normal and sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemic postmenopausal women.,"Feedback effect of estrogen on gonadotropin secretion was studied in normal and sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemic postmenopausal women. Twelve normoprolactinemic postmenopausal women were administered 40 micrograms/day of ethinyl estradiol (EE2) orally throughout the study. On the 4th week of the study, daily doses of 200 micrograms EE2 were also given to each subject for 4 days. Twelve postmenopausal women were given sulpiride orally in a daily dose of 150 mg throughout the study. Serum levels of prolactin were raised in all 12 subjects given sulpiride. In the 12 sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemic postmenopausal women, EE2 was given in the same manner as in normal postmenopausal women. The negative feedback effect of estrogen with low doses of EE2 (40 micrograms/day for 4 weeks) and the positive feedback effect of estrogen after the subsequent administration of EE2 (200 micrograms/day for 4 days) were demonstrated in both normoprolactinemic and hyperprolactinemic groups. The result of the present study suggests that sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemia does not affect the negative and positive feedback effect of estrogen in postmenopausal women.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, and triiodothyronine were evaluated in 61 children with epilepsy who received VPA monotherapy for more than 6 months and in 144 controls. We analyzed the effect of age, seizure type, duration of VPA treatment, dose of VPA, and serum level of VPA on thyroid function. The incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly higher in patients with VPA therapy than in controls (52.4 vs. 16.7%; p < 0.001). In addition, of the 61 patients, 5 (8.1%) exhibited TSH levels that were >10 μIU/mL. However, none of the patients and controls showed overt hypothyroidism. Serum VPA level and daily dose of VPA were correlated with TSH level. Subclinical hypothyroidism developed frequently in children and adolescents during VPA therapy.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

We aimed to assess the uptake of slow-release oral morphine (SROM) as second-line OAT among medically ill, hospitalised patients with opioid use disorder who declined buprenorphine and methadone.	This study included consecutive hospitalised patients with untreated moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder referred to an inpatient addiction medicine consultation service, between June 2018 and September 2019, in Nova Scotia, Canada. We assessed the proportion of patients initiating first-line OAT (buprenorphine or methadone) in-hospital, and the proportion initiating SROM after declining first-line OAT. We compared rates of outpatient OAT continuation (i.e., filling outpatient OAT prescription or attending first outpatient OAT clinic visit) by medication type, and compared OAT selection between patients with and without chronic pain, using χ[2] tests.	Thirty-four patients were offered OAT initiation in-hospital; six patients (18%) also had chronic pain. Twenty-one patients (62%) initiated first-line OAT with buprenorphine or methadone. Of the 13 patients who declined first-line OAT, seven (54%) initiated second-line OAT with SROM in-hospital. Rates of outpatient OAT continuation after hospital discharge were high (>80%) and did not differ between medications (P = 0.4). Patients with co-existing chronic pain were more likely to choose SROM over buprenorphine or methadone (P = 0.005).	The ability to offer SROM (in addition to buprenorphine or methadone) increased rates of OAT initiation among hospitalised patients. Increasing access to SROM would help narrow the opioid use disorder treatment gap of unmet need.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

An interviewer-based questionnaire was used to obtain relevant clinical information from 50 WWE on CBZ and LEV monotherapy, respectively, and 50 age-matched controls. The diagnosis of epilepsy was clinical with electroencephalographic features taken into consideration and the seizures classified using the 2017 International League Against Epilepsy classification. The diagnosis of PCOS was based on the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine.	The frequency of PCOS and its subcomponent were higher among WWE compare to controls. PCOS was present in 22 (44%) of LEV group compare to 8 (16%) CBZ group. The frequency of its subcomponent was higher among those on LEV except for comparable effect with regard to oligomenorrhea. The levels of the sex steroid hormone were comparable in both groups of WWE except luteal phase luteinizing hormone, which was lower among the LEV group (P .001). The follicular phase estradiol level was lower (P .021), and follicle-stimulating hormone level was about 2-fold higher (P .03) among WWE compare to controls. The mean value testosterone was significantly lower among controls compared to WWE.	The increased frequency of PCOS and its subcomponent and the unsatisfactory effect of LEV compared to CBZ on reproductive endocrine function underscore the need for routine reproductive endocrine evaluation to improve overall quality of life.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
370,8102036,The American journal of physiology,Autonomic control of pancreatic polypeptide and glucagon secretion during neuroglucopenia and hypoglycemia in mice.,"Neural control of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release has not been previously investigated in the mouse. In addition, it is not known to what extent increased glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia in mice is neurally mediated vs. an effect of hypoglycemia to directly stimulate glucagon secretion at the level of the islet. Feeding or the cholinergic agonist carbachol increased plasma PP levels in conscious mice (+74 +/- 18 pg/ml vs. fasted mice and +141 +/- 17 pg/ml vs. control, respectively). Neuroglucopenia induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose or insulin-induced hypoglycemia also increased plasma PP (+79 +/- 18 and +89 +/- 11 pg/ml vs. control, respectively). These increases were abolished by hexamethonium and reduced by atropine methylnitrate (atropine). Hypoglycemia-induced hyperglucagonemia (+1,243 +/- 275 pg/ml) was reduced to 31 +/- 7% of control by atropine (+382 +/- 85 pg/ml), to 48 +/- 9% of control by combined adrenergic blockade (+601 +/- 112 pg/ml), and nearly abolished by atropine plus combined blockade (+143 +/- 41 pg/ml; 11 +/- 3% of control) or hexamethonium (+151 +/- 38 pg/ml; 12 +/- 3% of control). We conclude the following in the mouse. 1) Feeding or cholinergic agonists increase plasma PP. 2) During neuroglucopenia or hypoglycemia, plasma PP is increased via nicotinic and muscarinic mechanisms. 3) The glucagon response to hypoglycemia is predominantly the result of autonomic activation and is mediated by both muscarinic and adrenergic mechanisms.",Animal-other,5,1
371,31272300,Veterinary pathology,Spontaneous Incidental Brain Lesions in C57BL/6J Mice.,"Genetically engineered mouse lines on a C57BL/6J background are widely employed as preclinical models to study neurodegenerative human disorders and brain tumors. However, because of the lack of comprehensive data on the spontaneous background neuropathology of the C57BL/6J strain, discriminating between naturally occurring changes and lesions caused by experimental mutations can be challenging. In this context, this study aims at defining the spectrum and frequency of spontaneous brain changes in a large cohort of C57BL/6J mice and their association with specific biological variables, including age and sex. Brains from 203 experimentally naive and clinically unremarkable C57BL/6J mice were collected and analyzed by means of histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Mice ranged in age from 3 to 110 weeks with 89 females, 111 males, and 3 unknowns. Sixteen different spontaneous lesion categories were described in this cohort. Age-related neurodegenerative and/or neuroinflammatory findings represented the most common pathologic changes and included (1) Hirano-like inclusions in the thalamic neurons, (2) neuroaxonal dystrophy in the medulla oblongata, (3) periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular deposits in the neuropil of the hippocampus, and (4) progressive neuroinflammation characterized by microgliosis and astrogliosis. Neoplastic conditions, developmental abnormalities, and circulatory disorders were rarely observed incidental findings. In conclusion, this study describes spontaneous age-related brain lesions of the C57BL/6J mouse and provides a reference for evaluating and interpreting the neuropathological phenotype in genetically engineered mouse models developed and maintained on this congenic background.",Animal-other,5,1
372,25288671,Diabetes,Diabetic microangiopathy: impact of impaired cerebral vasoreactivity and delayed angiogenesis after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion on stroke damage and cerebral repair in mice.,"Diabetes increases the risk of stroke by three, increases related mortality, and delays recovery. We aimed to characterize functional and structural alterations in cerebral microvasculature before and after experimental cerebral ischemia in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. We hypothesized that preexisting brain microvascular disease in patients with diabetes might partly explain increased stroke severity and impact on outcome. Diabetes was induced in 4-week-old C57Bl/6J mice by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). After 8 weeks of diabetes, the vasoreactivity of the neurovascular network to CO2 was abolished and was not reversed by nitric oxide (NO) donor administration; endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) mRNA, phospho-eNOS protein, nNOS, and phospho-nNOS protein were significantly decreased; angiogenic and vessel maturation factors (vascular endothelial growth factor a [VEGFa], angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), Ang2, transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β], and platelet-derived growth factor-β [PDGF-β]) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) occludin and zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) expression were significantly decreased; and microvessel density was increased without changes in ultrastructural imaging. After permanent focal cerebral ischemia induction, infarct volume and neurological deficit were significantly increased at D1 and D7, and neuronal death (TUNEL+ / NeuN+ cells) and BBB permeability (extravasation of Evans blue) at D1. At D7, CD31+ / Ki67+ double-immunolabeled cells and VEGFa and Ang2 expression were significantly increased, indicating delayed angiogenesis. We show that cerebral microangiopathy thus partly explains stroke severity in diabetes.",Animal-other,5,1

In this study the changes in rat PRL cells by estrogen treatment were studied histologically and immunocytochemically. Furthermore, intracellular structures in PRL cells were observed by high resolution scanning electron microscopy using the aldehyde prefix osmium-DMSO-osmium method. These rat pituitary tumors were established in Fischer-344 female rats by weekly injections of 2.5 mg estradiol valerate. The estrogen-induced, autonomous and transplantable rat pituitary tumors (MtT/F84) were also studied in the same manner and the findings were compared with estrogen-induced tumors. The increase of weight of pituitary gland and of serum PRL level correlated significantly with the number of estrogen administration. On the basis of histological findings, estrogen-induced pituitary tumors can be classified into two different stages, that is, hypertrophic hyperplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The former corresponds to the period until 6 weeks after the beginning of estrogen treatment and the latter to the period thereafter. In the former, PRL cells were significantly increased in number and volume, and were diffusely immunoreactive for PRL in the cytoplasm. Cell atypism was rarely found. The extent of acidophil staining was well preserved in hematoxylin-eosin staining. Ultrastructurally, organelles were well developed, especially rough endoplasmic reticulum showed whorl formation. Immature, irregularly shaped secretory granules were frequently observed within the Golgi area. Mature granules were richly stored at the periphery of the cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Animal-other,5,1
374,35041849,Brain research bulletin,"Motor, memory, and anxiety-like behavioral impairments associated with brain-derived neurotrophic factor and dopaminergic imbalance after inhalational exposure to deltamethrin.","Believed to cause damage to the nervous system and possibly being associated with neurodegenerative diseases, deltamethrin (DM) is a type II pyrethroid used in pest control, public health, home environment, and vector control. The objective of this study was to evaluate the motor, cognitive and emotional changes associated with dopaminergic and BDNF imbalance after DM exposure in rats. Sixty Wistar rats (9-10 months-old) were used, under Ethics Committee on Animal Research license (ID 19/2017). The animals were randomly divided into four groups: control (CTL, 0.9% saline), DM2 (2 mg DM in 1.6 mL 0.9% saline), DM4 (4 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline), and DM8 (8 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline). DM groups were submitted to 9 or 15 inhalations, one every 48 h. Half of the animals from each group were randomly selected and perfused 24 h after the 9th or 15th inhalation. Throughout the experiment, the animal's behavior were evaluated using catalepsy test, open field, hole-board test, Modified Elevated Plus Maze, and social interaction. At the end of the experiments, the rats were perfused transcardially and their brains were processed for Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) and Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunohistochemistries. The animals submitted to 9 inhalations of DM showed a reduction in immunoreactivity for TH in the Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and dorsal striatum (DS) areas, and an increase in BDNF in the DS and CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal areas. Conversely, the animals submitted to 15 inhalations of DM showed immunoreactivity reduced for TH in the SNpc and VTA, and an increase in BDNF in the hippocampal areas (CA3 and DG). Our results indicate that the DM inhalation at different periods induce motor and cognitive impairments in rats. Such alterations were accompanied by dopaminergic system damage and a possible dysfunction on synaptic plasticity.",Animal-other,5,1

The clinical manifestations of cerebral ischemia were more significantly pronounced in the second group. This group was also characterized by a more marked hyperemia of the gastrointestinal tract as shown both macro- and microscopically. It is suggested that a more severe course of ischemia in this group of animals is induced by the redistribution of the blood into the bed of the gastrointestinal arteries, which leads to a decrease in the cerebral blood content and aggravated conditions of the collateral blood supply in cases of brain ischemization.",Animal-other,5,1

377,3095713,Neuroscience letters,Two types of electrocortical paroxysms in an inbred strain of rats.,"In 10 subjects of a particular inbred strain of rats (WAG/Rij), two types of spike-wave complexes were detected in the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) during the two recording hours. The first type, already well-known, occurred in 8 of the 10 rats. This type was seen both during sleep and wakefulness and was accompanied by behavioural concomitants, reminiscent of human petit-mal epilepsy. A mean of 18 discharges/h was found. The second type, a novel one with a differential shape, occurred in 7 rats with a mean number of 14 discharges/h. In contrast to the first one, this spike-wave complex was not accompanied by behavioural correlates and was almost exclusively present during wakefulness. Four reasons make this strain of rats attractive as an additional animal model for epileptogenic activity: the occurrence of two types of spike-wave complexes, the high percentage of animals showing these phenomena, the genetic constitution of these rats and the fact that they are commercially available.",Animal-other,5,1
378,2921862,The Journal of surgical research,Continuous intravenous ammonia infusion as a model for the study of hepatic encephalopathy in rabbits.,"To obtain a more precise pathophysiological evaluation of the role of ammonia in acute hepatic encephalopathy, we compared the plasma ammonia concentrations and electroencephalographic recordings (EEGs) of rabbits with surgically induced acute hepatic failure (AHF, n = 10) and normal rabbits administered an infusion of ammonium acetate (NH4-Ac, n = 7) over a 10-hr period. AHF was surgically induced by portocaval shunting followed by hepatic artery ligation 48 hr later. In the infusion group the dose of NH4-Ac, initially 0.78 mmol/kg/hr, was increased every 2 hr by 0.13 mmole/kg/hr during a 10-hour period to simulate the arterial NH3 concentrations observed in AHF. Ammonia levels in rabbits administered the NH4-Ac infusion were identical to those observed in AHF, with the exception of the higher initial value in the AHF group. Moreover, the mean rates of increase in grade of encephalopathy in the two groups were similar, although the EEG grades in the infusion group were significantly less at all time points. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a more pathophysiological approach to identification of the putative toxins in hepatic encephalopathy is feasible. Some of the EEG abnormalities of acute hepatic encephalopathy in rabbits are presumably due to hyperammonemia; the encephalopathy observed in AHF at zero time is probably caused by the previously constructed portocaval shunt via an undefined, but possibly also ammonia-related, mechanism.",Animal-other,5,1
379,11018077,The Journal of clinical investigation,Chronic alcohol ingestion induces osteoclastogenesis and bone loss through IL-6 in mice.,"To investigate the role of IL-6 in alcohol-mediated osteoporosis, we measured a variety of bone remodeling parameters in wild-type (il6(+/+)) or IL-6 gene knockout (il6(-/-)) mice that were fed either control or ethanol liquid diets for 4 months. In the il6(+/+) mice, ethanol ingestion decreased bone mineral density, as determined by dual-energy densitometry; decreased cancellous bone volume and trabecular width and increased trabecular spacing and osteoclast surface, as determined by histomorphometry of the femur; increased urinary deoxypyridinolines, as determined by ELISA; and increased CFU-GM formation and osteoclastogenesis as determined ex vivo in bone marrow cell cultures. In contrast, ethanol ingestion did not alter any of these parameters in the il6(-/-) mice. Ethanol increased receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) mRNA expression in the bone marrow of il6(+/+) but not il6(-/-) mice. Additionally, ethanol decreased several osteoblastic parameters including osteoblast perimeter and osteoblast culture calcium retention in both il6(+/+) and il6(-/-) mice. These findings demonstrate that ethanol induces bone loss through IL-6. Furthermore, they suggest that IL-6 achieves this effect by inducing RANKL and promoting CFU-GM formation and osteoclastogenesis.",Animal-other,5,1

Changes in free fatty acid liberation.,"Does the impaired lipid metabolism during non-lethal transient ischemia truly recover within a few hours after recirculation? In an attempt to answer this question, we first investigated the time course of the changes in the amount and composition of free fatty acids (FFAs) accumulated during 5-min ischemia and after various postischemic recirculation durations (3 min, 1 h, 24 h, 3 days, and 6 days) in the gerbil cerebral cortex. Then those of FFAs liberated in response to the second 5-min ischemia at various recirculation intervals (3 min, 1 h, 3 days, and 6 days) following the initial one were also measured to evaluate the changes in the cellular response. The former study disclosed that the FFA levels transiently returned to the control levels at 1-h recirculation, increased again a few days after the onset of recirculation, followed by the final return to the control levels after 6-day recirculation. The latter study disclosed that the cellular response to the second ischemia was quite different from that to the initial one even after 6-day recirculation, suggesting that membrane lipid metabolism had not yet been recovered even at such a late period. We discuss the significance of the alterations in lipid metabolism.",Animal-other,5,1
382,4075172,Brain research,Thiamine deficiency depletes cortical norepinephrine and impairs learning processes in the rat.,"Several lines of evidence indicate that thiamine deficiency causes the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a human memory disorder. The present study examined behavioral deficits in rats after recovery from a bout of thiamine deficiency. Following behavioral testing, the brains were dissected into regions and assayed biochemically for levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and the primary metabolites of these monoamines. Based on previous findings in this laboratory, we predicted that thiamine deficiency not only produces behavioral deficits but loss in catecholamines as well. Impairments were observed for a spatial delayed alternation task that had been learned prior to experimental treatment. In addition, experimental animals were impaired in their ability to acquire two novel tasks, active and passive shock avoidance, after recovery from the acute effects of thiamine deficiency. Comparable deficits were not observed for a number of reflex responses that were measured to assess the general neurological state of the animals. Biochemical analyses revealed that the concentration of norepinephrine was reduced significantly in cortex-hippocampus and olfactory bulb but not in other regions, while dopamine and serotonin levels were not altered in any brain region examined. These data demonstrate that a bout of thiamine deficiency can produce persistent deficits in brain norepinephrine and concomitant decrements in behavioral measures of learning and memory. These results are consistent with our hypothesis and evidence that noradrenergic deficits contribute to the amnesic symptoms of Korsakoff's psychosis.",Animal-other,5,1
383,35410629,Acta neuropathologica communications,Mapping of neuroinflammation-induced hypoxia in the spinal cord using optoacoustic imaging.,"Recent studies suggest that metabolic changes and oxygen deficiency in the central nervous system play an important role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). In our present study, we investigated the changes in oxygenation and analyzed the vascular perfusion of the spinal cord in a rodent model of MS. We performed multispectral optoacoustic tomography of the lumbar spinal cord before and after an oxygen enhancement challenge in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. In addition, mice were transcardially perfused with lectin to label the vasculature and their spinal columns were optically cleared, followed by light sheet fluorescence microscopy. To analyze the angioarchitecture of the intact spine, we used VesSAP, a novel deep learning-based framework. In EAE mice, the spinal cord had lower oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration compared to healthy mice, indicating compromised perfusion of the spinal cord. Oxygen administration reversed hypoxia in the spinal cord of EAE mice, although the ventral region remained hypoxic. Additionally, despite the increased vascular density, we report a reduction in length and complexity of the perfused vascular network in EAE. Taken together, these findings highlight a new aspect of neuroinflammatory pathology, revealing a significant degree of hypoxia in EAE in vivo that is accompanied by changes in spinal vascular perfusion. The study also introduces optoacoustic imaging as a tractable technique with the potential to further decipher the role of hypoxia in EAE and to monitor it in MS patients.",Animal-other,5,1
384,15544577,"Genes, brain, and behavior",A phenotypic and molecular characterization of the fmr1-tm1Cgr fragile X mouse.,"Fragile X Syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation. It is also known for having a substantial behavioral morbidity, including autistic features. In humans, Fragile X Syndrome is almost always caused by inactivation of the X-linked FMR1 gene. A single knockout mouse model, fmr1-tm1Cgr, exists. In this report we further characterize the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of the fmr1-tm1Cgr Fragile X mouse through the use of F1 hybrid mice derived from two inbred strains (FVB/NJ and C57BL/6J). Use of F1 hybrids allows focus on the effects of the fmr1-tm1Cgr allele with reduced influence from recessive alleles present in the parental inbred strains. We find that the cognitive phenotype of fmr1-tm1Cgr mice, including measures of working memory and learning set formation that are known to be seriously impacted in humans with Fragile X Syndrome, are essentially normal. Further testing of inbred strains supports this conclusion. Thus, any fmr1-tm1Cgr cognitive deficit is surprisingly mild or absent. There is, however, clear support presented for a robust audiogenic seizure phenotype in all strains tested, as well as increased entries into the center of an open field. Finally, a molecular examination of the fmr1-tm1Cgr mouse shows that, contrary to common belief, it is not a molecular null. Implications of this finding for interpretation of the phenotype are discussed.",Animal-other,5,1
385,32514154,Scientific reports,A heritable profile of six miRNAs in autistic patients and mouse models.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of developmental pathologies that impair social communication and cause repetitive behaviors. The suggested roles of noncoding RNAs in pathology led us to perform a comparative analysis of the microRNAs expressed in the serum of human ASD patients. The analysis of a cohort of 45 children with ASD revealed that six microRNAs (miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-3613-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-499a-5p) were expressed at low to very low levels compared to those in healthy controls. A similar but less pronounced decrease was registered in the clinically unaffected parents of the sick children and in their siblings but never in any genetically unrelated control. Results consistent with these observations were obtained in the blood, hypothalamus and sperm of two of the established mouse models of ASD: valproic acid-treated animals and Cc2d1a[+/-] heterozygotes. In both instances, the same characteristic miRNA profile was evidenced in the affected individuals and inherited together with disease symptoms in the progeny of crosses with healthy animals. The consistent association of these genetic regulatory changes with the disease provides a starting point for evaluating the changes in the activity of the target genes and, thus, the underlying mechanism(s). From the applied societal and medical perspectives, once properly confirmed in large cohorts, these observations provide tools for the very early identification of affected children and progenitors.",Animal-other,5,1

However, how the activity and neuroplasticity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) change after contextual morphine withdrawal conditioning and what factors determine this change remain to be determined. In this paper, using immunohistochemical and single-cell microinjection techniques, combining behavioral assay, we found that (1) contextual withdrawal conditioning increases the expression of c-Fos, but not Arc, in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (2) at the first day after conditioning, conditioned context has no influence on the expression of c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (3) at the 14th day after conditioning, conditioned context increases the expression of both c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (4) the inhibition of dendritic spines of the ACC or projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC attenuates the conditioned context-induced increase of Arc expression in the ACC and abolishes the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning. These results suggest that the ACC may exhibit a change in neuroplasticity at the 14th day after conditioning, and the dendritic spines of the ACC and the projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC are key determinants for conditioned context induced-increase in Arc expression in the ACC and the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning.",Animal-other,5,1

In this report, the differentiation capacity in vivo of these cells was analysed following a standardized trauma. Before the trauma, the subependymal cells expressed nestin but not the astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament respectively. In response to injury, the majority of the subependymal cells coexpressed nestin and GFAP, but never nestin and neurofilament. Furthermore, cells coexpressing nestin and GFAP were found progressively further away from the subependyma and closer to the lesion at later time points after the injury, indicating that these cells migrate towards the lesion. Nestin was in addition re-expressed in reactive astrocytes near the lesion and in non-reactive astrocytes very far from the lesion throughout the ipsilateral cortex. In conclusion, our data indicate that the nestin-positive subependymal cells are an in vivo source for the generation of new astrocytes but not neurons after injury, and that nestin re-expression in astrocytes following traumatic stimuli can be used as a sensitive marker for astroglial activation.",Animal-other,5,1

To address this issue, we generated compound mice expressing a human amyloid precursor protein gene with familial AD mutations in combination with deficiency of amylin receptors produced by hemizygosity for the critical calcitonin receptor subunit of this heterodimeric GPCR. These compound transgenic AD mice demonstrated attenuated responses to human amylin- and Aβ-induced depression of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in keeping with the genetic depletion of amylin receptors. Both the LTP responses and spatial memory (as measured with Morris water maze) in these mice were improved compared to AD mouse controls and, importantly, a reduction in both the amyloid plaque burden and markers of neuroinflammation was observed. Our data support the notion of further development of antagonists of the amylin receptor as AD-modifying therapies.",Animal-other,5,1
389,28552947,PloS one,Relationship of mechanical impact magnitude to neurologic dysfunction severity in a rat traumatic brain injury model.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major brain injury type commonly caused by traffic accidents, falls, violence, or sports injuries. To obtain mechanistic insights about TBI, experimental animal models such as weight-drop-induced TBI in rats have been developed to mimic closed-head injury in humans. However, the relationship between the mechanical impact level and neurological severity following weight-drop-induced TBI remains uncertain. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the relationship between physical impact and graded severity at various weight-drop heights.	The acceleration, impact force, and displacement during the impact were accurately measured using an accelerometer, a pressure sensor, and a high-speed camera, respectively. In addition, the longitudinal changes in neurological deficits and balance function were investigated at 1, 4, and 7 days post TBI lesion. The inflammatory expression markers tested by Western blot analysis, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, beta-amyloid precursor protein, and bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X, in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were investigated at 1 and 7 days post-lesion.	Gradations in impact pressure produced progressive degrees of injury severity in the neurological score and balance function. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all inflammatory expression markers were increased at 1 and 7 days post-impact injury when compared to the sham control rats. The severity of neurologic dysfunction and induction in inflammatory markers strongly correlated with the graded mechanical impact levels.	We conclude that the weight-drop-induced TBI model can produce graded brain injury and induction of neurobehavioral deficits and may have translational relevance to developing therapeutic strategies for TBI.",Animal-other,5,1
390,25540200,The Journal of biological chemistry,Tau monoclonal antibody generation based on humanized yeast models: impact on Tau oligomerization and diagnostics.,"A link between Tau phosphorylation and aggregation has been shown in different models for Alzheimer disease, including yeast. We used human Tau purified from yeast models to generate new monoclonal antibodies, of which three were further characterized. The first antibody, ADx201, binds the Tau proline-rich region independently of the phosphorylation status, whereas the second, ADx215, detects an epitope formed by the Tau N terminus when Tau is not phosphorylated at Tyr(18). For the third antibody, ADx210, the binding site could not be determined because its epitope is probably conformational. All three antibodies stained tangle-like structures in different brain sections of THY-Tau22 transgenic mice and Alzheimer patients, and ADx201 and ADx210 also detected neuritic plaques in the cortex of the patient brains. In hippocampal homogenates from THY-Tau22 mice and cortex homogenates obtained from Alzheimer patients, ADx215 consistently stained specific low order Tau oligomers in diseased brain, which in size correspond to Tau dimers. ADx201 and ADx210 additionally reacted to higher order Tau oligomers and presumed prefibrillar structures in the patient samples. Our data further suggest that formation of the low order Tau oligomers marks an early disease stage that is initiated by Tau phosphorylation at N-terminal sites. Formation of higher order oligomers appears to require additional phosphorylation in the C terminus of Tau. When used to assess Tau levels in human cerebrospinal fluid, the antibodies permitted us to discriminate patients with Alzheimer disease or other dementia like vascular dementia, indicative that these antibodies hold promising diagnostic potential.",Animal-other,5,1
391,25402009,Developmental neuroscience,Spontaneous pre-existing hypoxia does not affect brain damage after global cerebral ischaemia in late-gestation fetal sheep.,"There is considerable evidence that a mild, non-injurious insult can protect (precondition) against a subsequent injurious insult. Typically, protection is seen when the gap between insults is several days to a week. However, the effect of mild but persistent hypoxia is unknown. In this study we examined the hypothesis that mild pre-existing hypoxia (PaO2<17 mm Hg) would reduce neural injury in chronically instrumented late-gestation (0.85 gestation) fetal sheep exposed to 30 min of global cerebral ischaemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion (normoxia: n=9 vs. pre-existing hypoxia: n=9) or normoxia plus sham ischaemia (sham controls: n=9). Histopathology was assessed after 7 days of recovery. Fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia had lower PaO2 values (16.1±0.6 vs. 26.0±1.1 mm Hg) and were lighter at post-mortem (4,033±412 vs. 5,261±238 g) compared to normoxic fetuses. Cerebral ischaemia was associated with secondary cortical oedema and seizures, reduced final EEG power, loss of sleep state cycling, and significant loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, with no significant effect of pre-existing hypoxia. Pre-existing hypoxia was associated with a significantly attenuated rise in mean arterial pressure between 18 and 36 h and slower resolution of cortical oedema between 96 and 150 h after ischaemia. These data suggest that chronic hypoxia is not associated with a significant preconditioning effect.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
392,36370926,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,Intermittent fasting protects the nigral dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-mediated dopaminergic neuronal injury in mice.,"Dietary restriction through low-calorie intake or intermittent fasting benefits many organs, including the brain. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of fasting in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We found that fasting every other day rather than weekly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor in the nigrostriatal pathway. Therefore, we maintained the animals on alternate-day fasting for 2 weeks and injected MPTP (30 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) for five days. We observed that alternate-day fasting attenuated MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss and astroglial activation in the substantia nigra and the striatum. Moreover, neurochemical analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography showed that alternate-day fasting reduced MPTP-induced depletion of striatal dopamine. Consistent with these results, behavioral tests showed that fasting suppressed the motor impairment caused by MPTP. Furthermore, fasting increased the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B, which are downstream signaling molecules of neurotrophic factors. Fasting also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein, further supporting the involvement of neurotrophic factors in the observed neuroprotective effects. Hence, our results demonstrated the dopaminergic neuroprotection of intermittent fasting in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, supporting the idea that fasting could be an instrumental tool for preventing neurodegeneration in the brain.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

The diverse molecular heterogeneity in these rare tumors and inadequate tumor models have limited the development of effective therapies. In this issue of the JCI, Haase et al. produced a genetically engineered mouse model of H3.3-G34R-mutant pHGG to help identify vulnerabilities in DNA repair pathways. The authors designed a therapy that combined radiation with DNA damage response inhibitors to induce an adaptive immune response and extend survival. These findings suggest that combinations of small-molecule therapies with immunotherapies could drive a more durable response and improve mortality for patients with pHGG.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
394,21114367,Physiological research,Rehabilitation intervention in animal model can improve neuromotor and cognitive functions after traumatic brain injury: pilot study.,"The aim of the present study was to quantify the effect of multisensory rehabilitation on rats' cognition after an experimental brain trauma and to assess its possible clinical implications. The complex intermittent multisensory rehabilitation consisted of currently used major therapeutic procedures targeted at the improvement of cognitive functions; including multisensory and motor stimulation and enriched environment. We have confirmed this positive effect of early multisensory rehabilitation on the recovery of motor functions after traumatic brain injury. However, we have been able to prove a positive effect on the recovery of cognitive functions only with respect to the frequency of efficient search strategies in a Barnes maze test, while results for search time and travelled distance were not significantly different between study groups. We have concluded that the positive effects of an early treatment of functional deficits are comparable with the clinical results in early neurorehabilitation in human patients after brain trauma. It might therefore be reasonable to apply these experimental results to human medical neurorehabilitation care.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
395,21606375,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,ES cell-derived renewable and functional midbrain dopaminergic progenitors.,"During early development, midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuronal progenitors (NPs) arise from the ventral mesencephalic area by the combined actions of secreted factors and their downstream transcription factors. These mDA NPs proliferate, migrate to their final destinations, and develop into mature mDA neurons in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Here, we show that such authentic mDA NPs can be efficiently isolated from differentiated ES cells (ESCs) using a FACS method combining two markers, Otx2 and Corin. Purified Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells coexpressed other mDA NP markers, including FoxA2, Lmx1b, and Glast. Using optimized culture conditions, these mDA NPs continuously proliferated up to 4 wk with almost 1,000-fold expansion without significant changes in their phenotype. Furthermore, upon differentiation, Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells efficiently generated mDA neurons, as evidenced by coexpression of mDA neuronal markers (e.g., TH, Pitx3, Nurr1, and Lmx1b) and physiological functions (e.g., efficient DA secretion and uptake). Notably, these mDA NPs differentiated into a relatively homogenous DA population with few serotonergic neurons. When transplanted into PD model animals, aphakia mice, and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, mDA NPs differentiated into mDA neurons in vivo and generated well-integrated DA grafts, resulting in significant improvement in motor dysfunctions without tumor formation. Furthermore, grafted Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells exhibited significant migratory function in the host striatum, reaching >3.3 mm length in the entire striatum. We propose that functional and expandable mDA NPs can be efficiently isolated by this unique strategy and will serve as useful tools in regenerative medicine, bioassay, and drug screening.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
396,7200181,Life sciences,Differential effect of environmental temperature on morphine physical dependence and abstinence.,"1) Ambient temperature (Ta) significantly influenced the display of 4 of the 14 naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs (nesting, flat posture, vocalization, dyspnea) in morphine-dependent, non-hibernating ground squirrels (Citellus lateralis). 2) Analysis of variance performed on the six quantified signs revealed that Ta during withdrawal, but not during the development of physical dependence, was a significant factor in determining the expression of two signs (nesting and vocalization). 3) The interaction between the influence of Ta during the periods of morphine administration and abstinence was a significant factor in determining the expression of nesting behavior, a finding that is consistent with the natural role of nesting as a behavioral thermoregulatory response. 4) We conclude that environmental temperature modulates the expression of selected components of the naloxone-precipitated abstinence syndrome in C. lateralis without exerting a measurable influence on the development of morphine physical dependence itself.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
397,16476809,Archives of neurology,A randomized controlled trial of etilevodopa in patients with Parkinson disease who have motor fluctuations.,"Motor fluctuations are a common complication in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) receiving long-term levodopa therapy. Slowed gastric emptying and poor solubility of levodopa in the gastrointestinal tract may delay the onset of drug benefit after dosing. Etilevodopa is an ethyl-ester prodrug of levodopa that has greater gastric solubility, passes quickly into the small intestine, is rapidly hydrolyzed to levodopa, and has a shortened time to maximum levodopa concentration.	To determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of etilevodopa in patients with PD who have motor fluctuations.	A double-blind, randomized, comparative clinical trial.	Forty-four sites in the United States and Canada.	Three hundred twenty-seven patients with PD who had a latency of at least 90 minutes total daily time to 'on' (TTON) after levodopa dosing.	Treatment with either etilevodopa-carbidopa or levodopa-carbidopa for 18 weeks.	Change from baseline in total daily TTON as measured using home diaries.	The reduction in mean total daily TTON from baseline to treatment was 0.58 hour in the etilevodopa-carbidopa group and 0.79 hour in the levodopa-carbidopa group (P = .24). There was no significant difference between the etilevodopa-carbidopa and levodopa-carbidopa groups in the reduction of response failures (-6.82% vs -4.69%; P = .20). Total daily 'off' time improved in the etilevodopa-carbidopa (-0.85 hour) and levodopa-carbidopa (-0.87 hour) groups without an increase in on time with troublesome dyskinesias.	Despite the theoretical pharmacokinetic advantage of etilevodopa, there was no improvement in TTON, response failures, or off time compared with levodopa.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

This was a randomized, parallel arms, placebo-contolled trial. Children with hypertonic CP aged 2 to 15 years awaiting bony hip surgery at a tertiary hospital were randomized to receive either BoNT-A or placebo injections into the muscles of the hip on a single occasion immediately before surgery. The primary outcome was the paediatric pain profile (PPP), which was assessed at baseline and weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment allocation was by minimization. Participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were masked to group assignment.	Twenty-seven participants (17 males, 10 females; mean 8y 8mo [SD 3y 9mo], range 3y 4mo-15y 10mo) were allocated to BoNT-A and 27 participants (14 males, 13 females; mean 8y 11mo [SD 3y 5mo], range 4y 1mo-15y 2mo) to placebo. Mean (SD) PPP at 6 weeks for the BoNT-A group (n=24 followed up) was 10.96 (7.22) and for the placebo group (n=26) was 10.04 (8.54) (p=0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.82, 3.18). There were 16 serious adverse events in total during 6 months of follow-up (n=6 in BoNT-A group).	Use of BoNT-A immediately before bony hip surgery for reducing postoperative pain for children with CP was not supported.	Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) does not reduce postoperative pain following bony hip surgery. BoNT-A also does not affect postoperative quality of life.

A 1-month, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, followed by a 6-month open-label follow-up.	Ambulatory subjects treating themselves outside of a medical setting.	One hundred thirty-one adult subjects with migraine, diagnosed according to International Headache Society criteria, were enrolled in the study: 113 treated at least one headache in the controlled trial, and 74 treated at least one headache in the open-label phase. All subjects were members of the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Medical Care Program and were recruited at two urban medical centers.	Intranasal lidocaine 4% or saline placebo 0.5 mL was dropped into the nostril on the side of the headache, or bilaterally for bilateral headache, according to study protocol.	Trial: percent of headaches relieved to mild or none at 15 minutes and relapse of headache within 24 hours. Open-label: percent of headaches relieved to mild or none at 15 and 30 minutes and relapse within 24 hours.	In the controlled trial, headache was relieved within 15 minutes in 34 (35.8%) of 95 subjects treated with 4% intranasal lidocaine compared with 8 (7.4%) of 108 subjects receiving placebo (P < .001). Headaches relapsed in 7 (20.6%) of 34 subjects treated with 4% intranasal lidocaine compared to 0 of 8 placebo subjects (P = .312). In the open-label follow-up, headaches were relieved in 129 (41.2%) of 313 episodes within 15 minutes and in 141 (57.6%) of 245 episodes after 30 minutes. Headaches relapsed in 28 (19.9%) of 140.

400,29777529,Clinical pharmacokinetics,Pharmacokinetics of ADS-5102 (Amantadine) Extended Release Capsules Administered Once Daily at Bedtime for the Treatment of Dyskinesia.,"Preclinical and clinical studies suggest amantadine immediate-release (IR) may reduce dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD), although higher doses are associated with increased CNS adverse events (AEs). ADS-5102 is an extended release amantadine capsule formulation, designed for once-daily dosing at bedtime (qhs) to provide high concentrations upon waking and throughout the day, with lower concentrations in the evening. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADS-5102 were assessed in two phase I studies in healthy subjects, and a blinded, randomized phase II/III dose-finding study in PD patients.	The first phase I study assessed single ADS-5102 doses (68.5, 137, and 274 mg) in a crossover design, whereas the second phase I study evaluated ADS-5102 137 mg for 7 days followed by amantadine IR 81 mg twice daily (or reverse order). In the phase II/III double-blind study, PD patients with dyskinesia were randomized to ADS-5102 (210, 274, or 338 mg) or placebo for 8 weeks.	Single ADS-5102 doses resulted in a slow initial rise in amantadine plasma concentration, with delayed time to maximum concentration (12-16 h). Amantadine plasma concentrations were higher in PD patients versus healthy volunteers. The steady-state profile of once-daily ADS-5102 was significantly different from that of twice-daily amantadine IR, such that the two formulations are not bioequivalent. PK modeling suggested the recommended daily ADS-5102 dosage (274 mg qhs) resulted in 1.4- to 2.0-fold higher amantadine plasma concentrations during the day versus amantadine IR.	ADS-5102 can be administered once-daily qhs to achieve high amantadine plasma concentrations in the morning and throughout the day, when symptoms of dyskinesia occur.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
401,28817491,Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,Speed of Improvement in Symptoms of Depression With Desvenlafaxine 50 mg and 100 mg Compared With Placebo in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder.,"This post hoc analysis examined the time point at which clinically significant improvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms occurs with desvenlafaxine versus placebo.	Data were pooled from 9 short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD randomly assigned to desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d, 100 mg/d, or placebo. A mixed-effects model for repeated-measures analysis of change from baseline score was used to determine the time point at which desvenlafaxine treatment groups separated from placebo on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and psychosocial outcomes. The association between early improvement and week 8 outcomes was examined using logistic regression analyses. Time to remission for patients with early improvement versus without early improvement was assessed using Kaplan-Meier techniques. Comparisons between groups were performed with log-rank tests.	In the intent-to-treat population (N = 4279 patients: desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d, n = 1714; desvenlafaxine 100 mg/d, n = 870; placebo, n = 1695), a statistically significant improvement on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was observed with desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d at week 1 (P = 0.0129) and with desvenlafaxine 100 mg/d at week 2 (P = 0.0002) versus placebo. Early improvement was a significant predictor of later remission. Treatment assignment, baseline depression scale scores, and race were significantly associated with probability of early improvement. On several measures of depressive symptoms and function, desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d and 100 mg/d separated from placebo as early as week 1 and no later than week 4 in patients with MDD.	These findings suggest that clinicians may be able to use depression rating scale scores early in treatment as a guide to inform treatment optimization.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
