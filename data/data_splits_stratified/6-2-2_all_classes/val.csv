The Canadian journal of neurological sciences. Le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques,Helping Families Cope with the Severe Stress of Dravet Syndrome.,"A child with Dravet syndrome shakes family life to the core. Dravet syndrome usually has three phases: (1) up to 1-1½ years: with episodes of febrile status epilepticus but normal development; (2) age 1½ to ~6-10 years: with frequent seizures of varying types, developmental stagnation, behavioural and sleep problems; (3) after ~10 years: improvement in seizures, deteriorating gait, intellectual disability but some developmental gains. Complete seizure control is rare-simply prescribing medication is inadequate to help families. Based on structured interviews with 24 families and confirmed by more informal discussions with other families, we suggest strategies for coping with this catastrophe. A child with Dravet syndrome usually means that one parent cannot work-financial pressures should be anticipated. In Stage 1, the approach to status should include a written protocol. An indwelling catheter for rapid venous access may be helpful. In Stage 2, assistance finding qualified babysitters is required, and the extended family needs encouragement to help. Appropriate equipment, rescue medication and protocols should travel with the child. Siblings may benefit from a system of one parent 'on call.' An internet support group provides an invaluable lifeline. In Stage 3, family isolation may be extreme-respite care and personal time for parents are important. Death from status, accidents and SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) occurs in 15%. Fear of SUDEP needs to be addressed. Moving from paediatric to adult care is frightening; an epilepsy transition clinic is useful. Attention to these realities may improve the quality of life for both child and family.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
The International journal of social psychiatry,A normality for us without confinement for them: notes on the associations of families of the mentally ill.,"Associations of families of the mentally ill arose in Italy in the early 1980s mainly in the country's northern and central regions. They denounced the inadequacies of an extramural service conceived of as an out-patient clinic filling the void left by the shutting down of asylums. The positions elaborated by these associations focus on four main themes: the distribution of the 'burden of care' for the ill between services and families; the ill-conceived interpretation of the families' needs owing to the professional's alleged tendency to 'point the finger of guilt' at the families themselves; the demand for greater power in regard to decisions made by the services; the interaction with the rights and liberties of the mentally ill. Two different ranges of problems are discussed. First, there is the conflict within the family between the interests and rights of its income-producing and its 'dependent' members. This conflict points not to a loss but to an overload of functions shifted to the family at a time of rising expectations for the satisfaction of needs. It therefore calls for services of a new kind, i.e. services capable of making these conflicting interests and rights compatible. Second, extramural services either reject or misinterpret the asylum's labour-saving function. These services thus ascribe care for the material life of the mentally ill to the family's own resources alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Technology in cancer research & treatment,Stereotactic radiosurgery for benign neoplasms.,"Over the last decade, the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of intracranial lesions has grown significantly. In addition to malignant brain tumors and vascular malformations, benign tumors have also been treated with SRS. Although surgical resection has long been considered the gold standard in the management of such benign lesions, the outcomes of SRS in various benign neoplasms appears to be comparable. In this review, we will examine the literature as it pertains to the treatment of benign brain tumors with SRS. Of particular note, we will examine the results of SRS in acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, and other benign tumors.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Current opinion in neurology,Cerebellar mutism syndrome: cause and rehabilitation.,"Mutism of cerebellar origin may occur in the context of various causes but is most frequent in children after resection of a large midline cerebellar tumour. In this review, the endeavour to reach a consensus on name and definition of postoperative mutism of cerebellar origin and associated symptoms is highlighted. In addition, progress in understanding of cause and risk factors for the syndrome is discussed as well as the rehabilitation issues.	Consensus on the term cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) has been reached. The exact pathogenesis of CMS remains unclear. Recently, attention was drawn to the hypothesis that thermal injury might be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of CMS. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography was found to visualize the damage to relevant pathways that are associated with persistent impairments after recovery of CMS. There is still no established treatment for CMS to date.	By reaching a consensus on terminology and description of CMS, a firm basis has been created for future research. The pathogenesis of CMS seems multifactorial and important risk factors have been found. However, CMS cannot be effectively prevented yet and no established or specific treatment is available, apart from very general rehabilitation and cognitive interventions.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti,[Brain injuries].,"The author presents an account of contemporary knowledge on the classification of brain injuries and different types of these injuries which comprise a wide range from minor injuries of the head with impairment of memory to severe lethal injuries. The author emphasizes the differentiation of two basic types of injuries--primary and secondary, because this differentiation is important for the prognosis of the casualty as well as for the therapeutic strategy. He emphasize also the fact that the target group in brain injuries are patients with secondary damage which is caused as a rule by a sequelae of intracranial hypertension.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Psychologie & neuropsychiatrie du vieillissement,[Psychanalitic psychotherapy: practice and indications in the aged].,"Use of psychoanalytic psychotherapy for the elderly remains an issue. Even though regular psychoanalysis cure is contraindicated for elderly patients in most cases, yet, face-to-face psychotherapies can prove useful. The methods used for psychoanalytic psychotherapy for elderly patients are different from those applicable to middle age patients. These methods take into account the mourning process experienced by the elderly patient in three spheres: loss of object, loss of function and loss of oneself. Indications concerning psychoanalytic psychotherapy for the elderly have to be carefully assessed and will be detailed throughout the paper.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Pakistan journal of biological sciences : PJBS,A review on the metabolic disorders of iodine deficiency.,Iodine is in the crucial parts of two hormones of T4 and T3 produced by the thyroid glands which are essential for all the aspects of human metabolisms. It is demonstrated that iodine deficiency can be considered as sole cause of many thyroid abnormalities including mental disorders. Iodine deficiency of sufficient degree to cause hypothyroidism during fetus life and early infancy will be accompanied with brain abnormality possibly to the stage of mental retardation. The iodine deficiency among subjects in their early stage of childhood is not as severe as those in their fetus or infancy. In adult subjects the sever iodine deficiency can be also associated with mental disorders due to the direct side effects of hypothyroidism occurred by lack of iodine. The clinical manifestation of iodine deficiency show itself with psychological disorders in adult subjects. The status of iodine within blood can be evaluated through measurement of urinary iodine level and the low urinary concentration is an indicative of hypothyroidism. Mental retardation and brain damage due to iodine deficiency can be prevented if iodine supplementation prescribed duly on time.,Non-systematic-review,1,0
Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,Methods of monitoring brain oxygenation.,"Posttraumatic brain ischemia or hypoxia is a major potential cause of secondary injury that may lead to poor outcome. Avoidance, or amelioration, of this secondary injury depends on early diagnosis and intervention before permanent injury occurs. However, tools to monitor brain oxygenation continuously in the neuro-intensive care unit have been lacking.	In recent times, methods of monitoring aspects of brain oxygenation continuously by the bedside have been evaluated in several experimental and clinical series and are potentially changing the way we manage head-injured patients. These monitors have the potential to alert the clinician to possible secondary injury and enable intervention, help interpret pathophysiological changes (e.g., hyperemia causing raised intracranial pressure), monitor interventions (e.g., hyperventilation for increased intracranial pressure), and prognosticate. This review focuses on jugular venous saturation, brain tissue oxygen tension, and near-infrared spectroscopy as practical methods that may have an important role in managing patients with brain injury, with a particular focus on the available evidence in children. However, to use these monitors effectively and to understand the studies in which these monitors are employed, it is important for the clinician to appreciate the technical characteristics of each monitor, as well as respective strengths and limitations of each. It is equally important that the clinician understands relevant aspects of brain oxygen physiology and head trauma pathophysiology to enable correct interpretation of the monitored data and therefore to direct an appropriate therapeutic response that is likely to benefit, not harm, the patient.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Seminars in pediatric neurology,Treatment of Folate Metabolism Abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that currently has no approved medical therapy to address core symptoms or underling pathophysiological processes. Several compounds are under development that address both underlying pathophysiological abnormalities and core ASD symptoms. This article reviews one of these treatments, d,l-leucovorin calcium (also known as folinic acid) for treatment of folate pathway abnormalities in children with ASD. Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that is essential for normal neurodevelopment and abnormalities in the folate and related pathways have been identified in children with ASD. One of these abnormalities involves a partial blockage in the ability of folate to be transported into the brain utilizing the primary transport mechanism, the folate receptor alpha. Autoantibodies which interfere with the function of the folate receptor alpha called folate receptor alpha autoantibodies have been identified in 58%-76% of children with ASD and independent studies have demonstrated that blood titers of these autoantibodies correlate with folate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Most significantly, case-series, open-label, and single and double-blind placebo-controlled studies suggest that d,l-leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the blockage at the folate receptor alpha by using the reduced folate carrier, an alternate pathway, can substantially improve particular symptoms in children with ASD, especially those positive for folate receptor alpha autoantibodies. This article reviews the current evidence for treating core and associated symptoms and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in children with ASD with d,l-leucovorin.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Current medicinal chemistry,Targeting the Nogo receptor complex in diseases of the central nervous system.,"After injury to the central nervous system intrinsic factors such as myelin associated inhibitory factors inhibit cellular and axonal regeneration resulting in permanent disability. Three of these factors (Nogo-A, oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, myelin-associated glycoprotein) bind to a common receptor: the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1). NgR1 is expressed mainly on neurons and is usually associated in a trimolecular complex. The second member of the complex, LINGO-1, is often connected to NgR1 function and is further found to function independently as a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation. The third member of the NgR complex is either the p75 neurotrophin receptor, TROY, or an as yet unidentified co-receptor. Targeting of factors contained in this complex has been described to lead to the promotion of neurite outgrowth, oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation and inhibition of cell death. In the current review, we aim to describe the mechanisms of action of the chemical and biological compounds used in targeting NgR1 and LINGO-1. This will be achieved using three examples: blocking of ligand binding to NgR1 in treatment of spinal cord injury, antibody-mediated inhibition of LINGO-1 to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation in multiple sclerosis, and the use of soluble NgR1 to sequester Abeta peptide in the periphery in Alzheimer's disease.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,Herpes simplex virus type 1 and Alzheimer's disease: possible mechanisms and signposts.,"Support for the concept that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), when present in the brains of apolipoprotein E-ε4 carriers, is a major risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing steadily, with over 120 publications providing direct or indirect evidence relevant to the hypothesis. No articles have contested the concept, apart from 3 published 13-18 yr ago. This review describes very recent studies on the role of HSV1 but refers also to older studies that provide background for some lesser-known related topics not covered in other recent reviews; these include the relevance of herpes simplex encephalitis and of epilepsy to AD, the action of IFN, and the possible relevance of the different types of DNA damage to AD-in particular, those caused by HSV1-and mechanisms of repair of damage. New epidemiologic data supporting previous studies on mild cognitive impairment and progression to AD are reviewed, as are those examining the relationship between total infectious burden (additive seropositivity to various microbes) and cognition/AD. The latter indicates the involvement of HSV1 and cytomegalovirus (and the necessity of taking into account any marked differences in sensitivity of antibody detection). Recent studies that provide further support for the occurrence of repeated reactivation of latent HSV1 in the brain in AD pathogenesis are also discussed.-Itzhaki, R. F.

International urology and nephrology,Promoting functioning and well-being in older CKD patients: review of recent evidence.,"Osteoporosis, falls, sleep difficulty, cognitive impairment, and depressed mood are major clinical concerns in the geriatric population that are physiologically and psychologically based and are often interrelated. All of these issues have implications for patients' daily functioning and quality of life (QOL). This review synthesizes recent evidence about these prominent issues in geriatric care and related implications for care of older patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent evidence about pre-dialysis and dialysis treatment strategies that may help to optimize management of older patients is also considered. Although elderly patients often report better psychosocial adjustment to dialysis than do younger patients, physical functioning and cognitive functioning losses challenge the QOL of many elderly persons. Early management of CKD and attention to anemia, consideration of the benefits of peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis, and inclusion of some form of exercise or regular physical activity in routine care provide key opportunities to enhance the functioning and well-being of older patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Journal of neural transmission. Supplementum,Deprenyl in the treatment of Parkinson's disease: clinical effects and speculations on mechanism of action.,"Selegiline is a relatively selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B that has been used in Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa and as putative neuroprotective therapy. Clinical trials demonstrate that selegiline slows the rate of disease progression and delays the appearance of disability necessitating levodopa. However, confounding symptomatic effects have made it difficult to ascertain the presence of any direct neuroprotective effect. Laboratory studies demonstrate that selegiline protects dopaminergic neurons through a mechanism that does not involve MAO-B inhibition. Recent studies suggest that neuroprotection in laboratory models may be related to the capacity of selegiline to up-regulate a series of anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic molecules which promote cell survival. Further delineation of the precise mechanism whereby selegiline induces this effect may permit for the development of enhanced neuroprotective benefits in PD patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,"Adipocytokines, gut hormones and growth factors in anorexia nervosa.","Anorexia nervosa is a complex eating disorder of unknown etiology which affects adolescent girls and young women and leads to chronic malnutrition. Clinical manifestations of prolonged semistarvation include a variety of physical features and psychiatric disorders. The study of different biological factors involved in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa is an area of active interest. In this review we have described the role of adipocytokines, neurotrophins, peptides of the gastrointestinal system and growth factors in appetite regulation, energy balance and insulin sensitivity in anorexia nervosa patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,Pathological lying revisited.,"Although pathological lying was first described in the medical literature over 100 years ago, it remains a poorly understood concept. Psychiatrists continue to grapple with the full ramifications of the condition, even though interest specifically in pathological lying seems to have waned in recent times. The impact of pathological lying deserves critical attention from forensic psychiatrists because of the implications that untruths have in a legal context. In this article, the authors review the considerable vagueness and confusion that has surrounded this concept and examine the extent to which a person can control lying behavior and the related question of whether pathological liars have responsibility for their actions. While providing a structured framework for considering pathological lying in the forensic context, the authors conclude that further systematic research is needed to resolve the questions raised in this article.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Current opinion in neurology,Vertigo and dizziness in children.,"Vertigo and dizziness occur with considerable frequency in childhood and adolescence. Most causes are benign and treatable. This review aims to make physicians more alert to the frequent causes of dizziness in the young.	Epidemiological data confirm that migraine-related syndromes are the most common cause of vertigo in children. Vestibular migraine and benign paroxysmal vertigo have now been defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders. About half of the adolescents with vertigo and dizziness show psychiatric comorbidity and somatization. Vestibular paroxysmia has been described as a new entity in children that can be treated with low doses of carbamazepine. To assess vestibular deficits, video head impulses (for the semicircular canals) and vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (for the otoliths) are increasingly being used.	Pediatricians and neuro-otologists should be aware of the full spectrum of causes of vertigo and dizziness in children and adolescents. Vestibular function can reliably be tested nowadays. Although treatment for the common migraine-related syndromes can be done in analogy to the treatment of migraine in general, specific approaches are required for somatoform vertigo, the most frequent diagnosis in adolescent girls.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Schizophrenia bulletin,Disengagement from mental health treatment among individuals with schizophrenia and strategies for facilitating connections to care: a review of the literature.,"Disengagement from mental health services can lead to devastating consequences for individuals with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses who require ongoing treatment. We review the extent and correlates of dropping out of mental health treatment for individuals with schizophrenia and suggest strategies for facilitating treatment engagement. Although rates vary across studies, reviews of the literature suggest that up to one-third of individuals with serious mental illnesses who have had some contact with the mental health service system disengage from care. Younger age, male gender, ethnic minority background, and low social functioning have been consistently associated with disengagement from mental health treatment. Individuals with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders, as well as those with early-onset psychosis, are at particularly high risk of treatment dropout. Engagement strategies should specifically target these high-risk groups, as well as high-risk periods, including following an emergency room or hospital admission and the initial period of treatment. Interventions to enhance engagement in mental health treatment range from low-intensity interventions, such as appointment reminders, to high-intensity interventions, such as assertive community treatment. Disengagement from treatment may reflect the consumer's perspective that treatment is not necessary, is not meeting their needs, or is not being provided in a collaborative manner. An emerging literature on patient-centered care and shared decision making in psychiatry provides suggestive evidence that efforts to enhance client-centered communication and promote individuals' active involvement in mental health treatment decisions can also improve engagement in treatment.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

African journal of medicine and medical sciences,Alzheimer's disease in Nigeria.,"The age-related dementias of the elderly (those aged 65 years or more) are of major public health importance in developed countries. Developing countries, most of which are undergoing epidemiological transition and greying of population, currently contain more than half of the world's population of elderly, a proportion that would reach 75% by 2020. Apart from reports from China, there is little or no information on the dementias of the elderly in developing countries. Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for two-thirds of dementia of the elderly in Caucasian population, is under-documented and believed to be rare in black Africans. But black Americans who are of black African lineage commonly suffer from Alzheimer's disease. A recent autopsy survey of the brains of elderly Nigerians showed absence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the pathognomonic histologic lesions of Alzheimer's disease and ageing found in 25% to 80% of normal undemented elderly Caucasians and Japanese. In a community-based door-to-door survey of a population of 9000, including 932 elderly Nigerians, no subject with dementia as defined by DSM-IIIR was found, although there was significant decline of cognition with age, female sex and less than 6 years of formal education. The distribution of cognitive scores is a highly skewed unimodal curve. We emphasize the potential value of cross-cultural epidemiological studies of ethnic groups in different environments and with different prevalence ratios of Alzheimer's disease, in identifying putative environmental factors for this disease.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Postgraduate medical journal,The measurement of anxiety.,"Selected contemporary highlights and issues in the field of anxiety measurement are discussed. The concepts of state and trait anxiety, and the most widely used measures of these, are reviewed. A measure of state anxiety is essential in some clinical and experimental research and it is often very useful in clinical practice. Whilst existing measures are satisfactory for some purposes, none adequately assesses the psychological, somatic and behavioural components of anxiety. The measurement of trait anxiety is also important in some clinical research and as part of the assessment of selected patients. In some circumstances, self report measures of trait anxiety should be used in conjunction with a measure of social desirability. Patients who score low both on trait anxiety and social desirability may respond differently to experimental stressors from those who score low on trait anxiety and high on social desirability. This may have a number of implications, for example in the area of psychoimmunology. Four scales are reviewed in more detail: the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Clinical Anxiety Scale and the Fear Questionnaire. Finally, some future directions for research are outlined.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,The central role of peripheral inflammation in ischemic stroke.,"Stroke pathology and its treatments conventionally focus on the brain. Probing inflammation, a critical secondary cell death mechanism in stroke, has been largely relegated to the brain. To this end, peripheral inflammation has emerged as an equally potent contributor to the onset and progression of stroke secondary cell death. Here, we review novel concepts on peripheral organs displaying robust inflammatory response to stroke. These inflammation-plagued organs include the spleen, cervical lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, gastrointestinal system, and adrenal glands, likely converging their inflammatory effects through B and T-cells. Recognizing the significant impact of this systemic inflammation, we also discuss innovative stroke therapeutics directed at sequestration of peripheral inflammation. This review paper challenges the paradigm of a brain-centered disease pathology and treatment and offers a peripheral approach to our stroke understanding.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,Substance-induced dissociative disorders and psychiatric nosology.,"Transient amnesias, fugues, twilight states, automatisms, depersonalization, and furors or explosive disorders can occur in association with, or be caused by, various medications or substance-induced organic brain states. Agents capable of precipitating dissociative-like states include alcohol, barbiturates and similarly acting hypnotics, benzodiazepines, scopolamine, clioquinol, beta-adrenergic blockers, marijuana and certain psychedelic drugs, general anesthetics, and others. The presentations of substance-induced dissociative states may resemble those of functional dissociative disorders, or organic and psychogenic dissociative factors may coexist and be intertwined or indistinguishable. Organic dissociative states are distinct from intoxication, amnestic disorder, frank delirium, or other organic mental disorders as specified in DSM-III and DSM-III-R, yet these diagnostic manuals have no inclusive category or coherent nosological approach to dissociative states not strictly psychogenic in etiology. Substance-induced and other organic dissociative disorders can have clinical, medicolegal, and neuropsychological significance. They provide a unique opportunity for the study of mind-brain relationships and should be included in psychiatric nosology.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Journal of drug targeting,A critical review on the role of nanotheranostics mediated approaches for targeting β amyloid in Alzheimer's.,"Alzheimer's is one of the most common neurodegenerative illnesses that affect brain cellular function. In this disease, the neurons in the brain are considered to be decaying steadily but consistently by the accumulation of amyloid mass, particularly the β-amyloids, amyloid proteins, and Tau proteins. The most responsible amyloid-proteins are amyloid-40 and amyloid-42, which have a high probability of accumulating in excess over the brain cell, interfering with normal brain cell function and triggering brain cell death. The advancement of pharmaceutical sciences leads to the development of Nanotheranostics technology, which may be used to diagnose and treat Alzheimer's. They are the colloidal nanoparticles functionalised with the therapeutic moiety as well as a diagnostic moiety. This article discusses the prognosis of Alzheimer's, various nanotheranostics approaches (nanoparticles, quantum dots, aptamers, dendrimers, etc), and their recent advancement in managing Alzheimer's. Also, various in-vitro and in-vivo diagnostic methodologies were discussed with respect to nanotheranostics.

Annual review of entomology,Ekbom syndrome: the challenge of 'invisible bug' infestations.,"Ekbom Syndrome is synonymous with delusory parasitosis, a belief that one's body is infested by invisible bugs. Persons suffering from this syndrome often claim to feel dermal sensations and to visualize the bugs, although no one else can see them. Ekbom Syndrome is a delusional condition; it is intractable and cannot be corrected by argument or evidence. Ekbom Syndrome sufferers exhibit a range of predictable behaviors in their attempts to eliminate their infestations, including seeking identifications and treatment from physicians and entomologists. Frequently they also experience comorbid psychological conditions. Because this is a delusional affliction, successful treatment typically requires neuroleptic medications, necessitating intervention by medical professionals.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Journal of inherited metabolic disease,"AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8 distribution in the central nervous system, in relation to creatine deficiency syndromes: a review.","Creatine deficiency syndromes, either due to AGAT, GAMT or SLC6A8 deficiencies, lead to a complete absence, or a very strong decrease, of creatine within the brain, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. While the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) expresses AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8, the lack of SLC6A8 in astrocytes around the blood-brain barrier limits the brain capacity to import creatine from the periphery, and suggests that the CNS has to rely mainly on endogenous creatine synthesis through AGAT and GAMT expression. This seems contradictory with SLC6A8 deficiency, which, despite AGAT and GAMT expression, also leads to creatine deficiency in the CNS. We present novel data showing that in cortical grey matter, AGAT and GAMT are expressed in a dissociated way: e.g. only a few cells co-express both genes. This suggests that to allow synthesis of creatine within the CNS, at least for a significant part of it, guanidinoacetate must be transported from AGAT- to GAMT-expressing cells, possibly through SLC6A8. This would explain the creatine deficiency observed in SLC6A8-deficient patients. By bringing together creatine deficiency syndromes, AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8 distribution in CNS, as well as a synthetic view on creatine and guanidinoacetate levels in the brain, this review presents a comprehensive framework, including new hypotheses, on brain creatine metabolism and transport, both in normal conditions and in case of creatine deficiency.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Progress in neurobiology,N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and glutamate carboxypeptidase II: An abundant peptide neurotransmitter-enzyme system with multiple clinical applications.,"N-Acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is the third most prevalent neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, yet its therapeutic potential is only now being fully recognized. Drugs that inhibit the inactivation of NAAG by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) increase its extracellular concentration and its activation of its receptor, mGluR3. These drugs warrant attention, as they are effective in animal models of several clinical disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia. In inflammatory and neuropathic pain studies, GCPII inhibitors moderated both the primary and secondary pain responses when given systemically, locally or in brain regions associated with the pain perception pathway. The finding that GCPII inhibition also moderated the motor and cognitive effects of ethanol intoxication led to the discovery of their procognitive efficacy in long-term memory tests in control mice and in short-term memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. NAAG and GCPII inhibitors respectively reduce cocaine self-administration and the rewarding effects of a synthetic stimulant. Most recently, GCPII inhibition also has been reported to be efficacious in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. GCPII was first discovered as a protein expressed by and released from metastatic prostate cells where it is known as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). GCPII inhibitors with high affinity for this protein have been developed as prostate imaging and radiochemical therapies for prostate cancer. Taken together, these data militate in favor of the development and application of GCPII inhibitors in more advanced preclinical research as a prelude to clinical trials.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,An endocannabinoid hypothesis of drug reward and drug addiction.,"Pharmacologic treatment of drug and alcohol dependency has largely been disappointing, and new therapeutic targets and hypotheses are needed. There is accumulating evidence indicating a central role for the previously unknown but ubiquitous endocannabinoid physiological control system (EPCS) in the regulation of the rewarding effects of abused substances. Thus an endocannabinoid hypothesis of drug reward is postulated. Endocannabinoids mediate retrograde signaling in neuronal tissues and are involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission to suppress neurotransmitter release by the presynaptic cannabinoid receptors (CB-Rs). This powerful modulatory action on synaptic transmission has significant functional implications and interactions with the effects of abused substances. Our data, along with those from other investigators, provide strong new evidence for a role for EPCS modulation in the effects of drugs of abuse, and specifically for involvement of cannabinoid receptors in the neural basis of addiction. Cannabinoids and endocannabinoids appear to be involved in adding to the rewarding effects of addictive substances, including, nicotine, opiates, alcohol, cocaine, and BDZs. The results suggest that the EPCS may be an important natural regulatory mechanism for drug reward and a target for the treatment of addictive disorders.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,The social course of drug injection and sexual activity among YMSM and other high-risk youth: an agenda for future research.,"The cumulative epidemiologic literature indicates that many injecting drug users (IDUs) initiate injection as a mode of drug administration during late adolescence or early adulthood. Recent studies have shown that IDUs are often exposed to viral infections relatively early in the course of injection, highlighting the importance of understanding this initiation process for both epidemiology and prevention. Epidemiologic evidence similarly suggests that at least some youth populations, most notably young men who have sex with men (YMSM), are at substantial risk for exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) from early sexual activity. Despite the importance of this issue for both epidemiology and prevention, however, surprisingly little information is available on the social course of injection initiation, including the individual, social, or ecological factors that might mitigate or exacerbate transmission risks within the critical phase of early injection drug use. Similarly, we know little about the ways that YMSM and other high-risk youth understand risk, the kinds of exchanges and relationships in which they participate in the context of initiating sexual activity, or how drug use is operant in these exchanges and early sexual experiences. In this article, we explore key dimensions of the early initiation of injection and sexual risk, and discuss how a social network approach might be instrumental in understanding the social course of drug injection and sexual activities among youth and young adult populations.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Mental retardation and developmental disabilities research reviews,Translating policy principles into practice to improve health care access for adults with intellectual disabilities: a research review of the past decade.,"This article extracts principles from two Surgeon General reports, Closing the Gap: A National Blueprint to Improve the Health of Persons with Mental Retardation (2002) and Call to Action to Improve the Health and Wellness of Persons with Disabilities (2005), and combines them with the Objectives from Chapter 6 of Healthy People 2010 to create a policy framework. This framework is used to review literature from the past decade on access to health care and health promotion for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Review of the literature indicates an emerging evidence base for health promotion programs for persons with IDD. Research in health care and health promotion access requires improvements in surveillance and measurement of quality of life, as well as increased participation of persons with IDD and their families in its implementation. While international guidelines for primary health care have been developed for people with IDD, US guidelines are specialty focused and address specific conditions. Despite its recognized importance, there is surprisingly little information on training programs for health care providers to improve care of persons with IDD. Financing of health care continues to threaten access to comprehensive care for persons with IDD, particularly regarding coordination of care and availability of providers who accept Medicaid patients.

Journal of psychiatric practice,Blackout Versus Pass Out in Allegations of Alcohol-involved Sexual Assault: Why Knowing the Difference Matters.,"It is common for not only laypersons but also courts, witnesses, attorneys, and even some experts involved in a criminal sexual assault investigation to confuse the terms 'blackout' and 'pass out' when referring to the memory, consciousness, and other behavioral ramifications of alcohol intoxication. A typical alcohol-involved sexual assault allegation often includes the partial or total absence of memory for events of the alleged incident. The etiology and behavioral presentations of the types of alcohol-induced memory deficiency evidenced are not all created equal and understanding the differences is crucial to understanding the reasonableness of the potential perceptions or misperceptions of an accused. By improving our understanding of these terms, we can assist the legal process with proper and more accurate history gathering and documentation if we become a party to such an investigation.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Substance use & misuse,Access to sterile syringes for injecting drug users in New York City: politics and perception (1984-2010).,"In the United States, political and social environments have shaped public health response to injecting drug use, and New York City represents a salient example. The history of 'harm reduction' in New York City is characterized within changing historical periods and in relation to the actions of stakeholders. The expansion is traced over four periods: (i) 1984-1989: emergence, activism, and science; (ii) 1990-1994 reckoning: syringe exchange legislation and consolidation; (iii) 1995-1999: bureaucratization, opposition, and challenges to institutional control; and (iv) 2000-2010 revitalization: expansion of syringe access and harm reduction. It is clear from this review that the leadership of activism and the work of advocates catalyzed syringe access policy and practice. Without this 'push,' it is unlikely that New York City would have experienced the dramatic decline in HIV infection among drug injectors in the 1990s. Second, successful arguments for expanding syringe access in New York City were based on the high HIV/AIDS infection rates. Thus, program developments were advocated as HIV prevention interventions, rather than as expanded services for addressing broader health and social issues of injecting drug use.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Singapore medical journal,Management of panic disorder.,"Symptoms of panic attack can be found in both medical disease and mental disorder. At least 4 of 13 diagnostic symptoms need to be present to constitute an attack which onset is sudden and unpredictable. The duration of attack usually lasts minutes but sometimes longer. In panic disorder there is recurrent attacks of severe anxiety which are unprovoked and unexpected. Dominant symptoms vary from person to person. The syndrome is likely to be heterogeneous as the biological aetiology may be related to abnormalities in the function of a number of neurotransmitters ie serotonin, noradrenaline, gamabutyric acid, dopamine and cholecystokinin. As such different benzodiazepines and anti-depressants are efficacious in the treatment of the disorder. Medications should be titrated to prevent attacks and restore confidence. Maintenance therapy needs to be balanced with premature termination of treatment. Reassurance is important and there is a place for cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation exercise and breathing control technique.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,[Social skills training groups for children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome: A review].,"First described in 1944 by Hans Asperger, Asperger syndrome (AS) is now considered in international diagnostic classifications as one of the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The main symptoms of AS are severe impairment in social interaction and communication, and restricted interests, without significant delay in cognitive and language development. Its prevalence is not clearly established but might be around 0.26 per 1000. Symptoms of high-functioning autism (HFA), which is not an official diagnostic category, are quite similar. Children and adolescents with AS or HFA mostly have a social skills deficit, in connection with a lack of understanding concerning the rules governing social interactions. This deficit often leads to social isolation and peer rejection, which can alter their quality of life. Their lack of social skills can also have effects on success at school or work, integration among peers and mental health. According to recent guidelines of the French national authority for health (Haute autorité de santé, HAS) about the special needs of persons with PDD, professionals have to develop evidence-based interventions, emphasizing social interactions and participation, as described by the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF): social and professional participation as well as participation in leisure activities, clubs and societies, etc.	To explore the studies that give evidence of the value of these social skills training groups, to review the methods and programs worked out in these groups, and to highlight the best general operating principles to be adopted and combined.	Systematic searches of electronic databases, journals, and reference lists identified 12 studies published since 1984, involving social competence group interventions, led by psychotherapists who were trained in cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), for children and adolescents from 6 to 18years old with a diagnosis of AS or HFA.	According to these 12 studies, these interventions are useful and significantly effective. Adaptation of their contents and educational means to how children and adolescents with AS function is necessary to facilitate learning and decrease anxiety. Concerning the groups' setting, most of these studies insist on the value of working with a small number of participants and creating a friendly, predictable and structured environment (even the progress of the sessions itself has to be structured). The programs' contents should ally didactic teaching and training exercises, which should be diverse and adapted to the objectives. The techniques usually applied in CBT (role plays, modeling, problem-solving strategies, etc.), must be completed with strategies known to be appropriate for children and adolescents with ASD, such as social scenarios.	Although new studies are necessary to assess the generalization and long-term efficacy of such approaches, this review confirms the advantages of the main methods of social skills training groups for children and adolescents with AS. It opens up perspectives to developing new programs of social skills training groups, integrating various approaches, dimensions and objectives, working on a long-term basis.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Current opinion in pediatrics,"Environmental exposure to metals, neurodevelopment, and psychosis.","This article presents a new hypothesis about the possible relation between early life exposure to metals and psychosis. We review limitations of available research, and discuss novel approaches to overcome previous methodological barriers.	Mechanistic studies suggest a possible association between excess lead, manganese, cadmium, arsenic, or copper, and zinc deficiency, and several biochemical disturbances related to psychosis, such as altered neurotransmitters levels, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Furthermore, studies suggest that some metals (lead, manganese, cadmium excess, and zinc deficiency) are associated with schizophrenia or psychosis-related phenotype. However, previous studies had multiple methodological limitations. Importantly, metal exposure was often measured after disease development and seldom determined during critical developmental periods. Most studies fell short of depicting the exact timing of exposure and the change in exposure over time. Here, we propose several methods to overcome these methodological limitations.	There is a plausible role of early life exposure to metals in the cause of psychosis. Owing to methodological limitations in exposure measurement, this has not been well characterized. Considering the wide exposure to metals and the high cost of psychosis to society, this hypothesis should be rigorously examined.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Current molecular medicine,The Role of immune and inflammatory mechanisms in ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe progressive neurodegenerative disease. The cause is unknown, but genetic abnormalities have been identified in subjects with familial ALS and also in subjects with sporadic ALS. Environmental factors such as occupational exposure have been shown to be risk factors for the development of ALS. Patients differ in their clinical features and differ in the clinical course of disease. Immune abnormalities have been found in the central nervous system by pathological studies and also in the blood and CSF of subjects with ALS. Inflammation and immune abnormalities are also found in animals with a model of ALS due to mutations in the SOD1 gene. Previously it has been considered that immune abnormalities might contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. However more recently it has become apparent that an immune response can occur as a response to damage to the nervous system and this can be protective.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Digital Interventions for Mental Disorders: Key Features, Efficacy, and Potential for Artificial Intelligence Applications.","Mental disorders are highly prevalent and often remain untreated. Many limitations of conventional face-to-face psychological interventions could potentially be overcome through Internet-based and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This chapter introduces core features of IMIs, describes areas of application, presents evidence on the efficacy of IMIs as well as potential effect mechanisms, and delineates how Artificial Intelligence combined with IMIs may improve current practices in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in adults. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials clearly show that therapist-guided IMIs can be highly effective for a broad range of mental health problems. Whether the effects of unguided IMIs are also clinically relevant, particularly under routine care conditions, is less clear. First studies on IMIs for the prevention of mental disorders have shown promising results. Despite limitations and challenges, IMIs are increasingly implemented into routine care worldwide. IMIs are also well suited for applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which provides ample opportunities to improve the identification and treatment of mental disorders. Together with methodological innovations, these approaches may also deepen our understanding of how psychological interventions work, and why. Ethical and professional restraints as well as potential contraindications of IMIs, however, should also be considered. In sum, IMIs have a high potential for improving the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders across various indications, settings, and populations. Therefore, implementing IMIs into routine care as both adjunct and alternative to face-to-face treatment is highly desirable. Technological advancements may further enhance the variability and flexibility of IMIs, and thus even further increase their impact in people's lives in the future.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Journal of the American Dental Association (1939),"Major depressive disorder. Psychopathology, medical management and dental implications.","Major depressive disorder, or MDD, is a psychiatric illness in which mood, thoughts and behavioral patterns are impaired for long periods. The illness distresses the person and impairs his or her social functioning and quality of life. MDD is characterized by marked sadness or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, and is accompanied by weight change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, physical impairment and a high suicide rate. In 2000, the World Health Organization, or WHO, identified MDD as the fourth ranked cause of disability and premature death in the world. WHO projected that by 2020, MDD would rise in disease burden to be second only to ischemic heart disease. The disorder is common in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence rate of 17 percent and a recurrence rate of more than 50 percent.	MDD may be associated with extensive dental disease, and people may seek dental treatment before becoming aware of their psychiatric illness. MDD frequently is associated with a disinterest in performing appropriate oral hygiene techniques, a cariogenic diet, diminished salivary flow, rampant dental caries, advanced periodontal disease and oral dysesthesias. Many medications used to treat the disease magnify the xerostomia and increase the incidence of dental disease. Appropriate dental management requires a vigorous dental education program, the use of saliva substitutes and anticaries agents containing fluoride, and special precautions when prescribing or administering analgesics and local anesthetics.	Dentists cognizant of these signs and symptoms have an opportunity to recognize patients with occult MDD. After confirmation of the diagnosis and institution of treatment by a mental health practitioner, dentists usually can provide a full range of services that may enhance patients' self-esteem and contribute to the psychotherapeutic aspect of management.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
British journal of addiction,Implications of gender for alcohol treatment research: a quantitative and qualitative review.,"Previous reviews of alcohol treatment research have indicated that in the majority of studies there are no sex differences in treatment outcome. The current meta-analysis was used to measure the magnitude and direction of trends of sex difference in treatment outcome. The results indicated that women had better treatment outcomes than men in the first 12 months after treatment while men showed greater improvement than women in follow-ups after 12 months. However, the estimated differences were small and derived from a heterogeneous sample of studies. Evidence from the studies in the meta-analysis is used to highlight the importance of gender-related factors which may impact on the processes and outcomes of treatment. In particular, sex differences in physiological responses to alcohol, in social norms for alcohol, and in socio-cultural experiences are considered important areas for future investigation in alcohol treatment research.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Effects of epilepsy surgery on psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities in children and adolescents.,"When considering surgery in children, it is important to think about the potential effect on psychiatric and behavioral outcome. A growing body of evidence suggests that the type of epilepsy (benign or catastrophic) and the age of the patient affect developmental outcome. In younger children with catastrophic epilepsy, the primary goal of therapy is not only to control seizures, but also to offer the child the opportunity for the best possible development. In older children with partial seizures, the therapeutic goal is to control seizures, which may allow a more normal life and improve behavior. Epilepsy surgery generally appears to have a positive effect on behavior and development in many younger children with catastrophic epilepsy. Psychiatric and behavioral outcomes in older children with complex partial epilepsy are less clear; many patients improve, but there does appear to be a small risk of developing new psychiatric or behavioral disorders postoperatively.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Acta neuropathologica,Risk stratification of childhood medulloblastoma in the molecular era: the current consensus.,"Historical risk stratification criteria for medulloblastoma rely primarily on clinicopathological variables pertaining to age, presence of metastases, extent of resection, histological subtypes and in some instances individual genetic aberrations such as MYC and MYCN amplification. In 2010, an international panel of experts established consensus defining four main subgroups of medulloblastoma (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4) delineated by transcriptional profiling. This has led to the current generation of biomarker-driven clinical trials assigning WNT tumors to a favorable prognosis group in addition to clinicopathological criteria including MYC and MYCN gene amplifications. However, outcome prediction of non-WNT subgroups is a challenge due to inconsistent survival reports. In 2015, a consensus conference was convened in Heidelberg with the objective to further refine the risk stratification in the context of subgroups and agree on a definition of risk groups of non-infant, childhood medulloblastoma (ages 3-17). Published and unpublished data over the past 5 years were reviewed, and a consensus was reached regarding the level of evidence for currently available biomarkers. The following risk groups were defined based on current survival rates: low risk (>90 % survival), average (standard) risk (75-90 % survival), high risk (50-75 % survival) and very high risk (<50 % survival) disease. The WNT subgroup and non-metastatic Group 4 tumors with whole chromosome 11 loss or whole chromosome 17 gain were recognized as low-risk tumors that may qualify for reduced therapy. High-risk strata were defined as patients with metastatic SHH or Group 4 tumors, or MYCN-amplified SHH medulloblastomas. Very high-risk patients are Group 3 with metastases or SHH with TP53 mutation. In addition, a number of consensus points were reached that should be standardized across future clinical trials. Although we anticipate new data will emerge from currently ongoing and recently completed clinical trials, this consensus can serve as an outline for prioritization of certain molecular subsets of tumors to define and validate risk groups as a basis for future clinical trials.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
American journal of psychotherapy,Imprisoned royalty: defensive failure and reconstitution on an inpatient unit.,"Treatment of schizophrenic patients in an inpatient setting has become ever-more challenging over time. Patients move in and out of hospital systems quickly, and the severity of patients' illnesses during their hospital stay makes the experience chaotic and intense. This paper offers a model for understanding psychotic patients' experiences on an inpatient unit, and for effectively working with them in this setting. I have drawn on a parallel in film, that of 'The Madness of King George,' to help illustrate the concept of the hospitalized schizophrenic patient as imprisoned royalty. Through this metaphor, I explore the process of defensive breakdown and repair in psychosis, as it occurs in the hospital setting. I examine the relationships between patients, clinicians, and aspects of the hospital, and review some of the common dilemmas in this type of treatment.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

CNS drugs,The triptan formulations : how to match patients and products.,"The 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists (the 'triptans') are migraine-specific agents that have revolutionised the treatment of migraine. They are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available in various strengths and formulations, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the triptans exist, as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including half-life, time to peak plasma concentrations, peak plasma concentrations, area under the concentration-time curve, metabolism and drug-drug interaction profiles. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability advantages for one agent over another is not well differentiated. However, delivery systems may play an important role in onset of action. Given that the clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle, identification of the most appropriate triptan for an individual patient requires consideration of the specific characteristics of the patient and knowledge of patient preference, an accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute-care medications and individual features of the drug being considered. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug also depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. Individual patient response to the triptans seems to be idiosyncratic and possibly genetically determined. Therefore, a set of specific questions can be used to determine whether a currently used triptan is optimally effective, whether the dose needs to be increased or whether another triptan should be tried. The clinician has in his/her armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of triptans, available in multiple formulations and dosages, which have good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimise therapeutic benefit. Use of the methods outlined in this review in choosing a triptan for an individual patient is probably more likely to lead to migraine relief than making an educated guess as to which triptan is most appropriate.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
AORN journal,The impaired nurse. Part II: Management strategies.,"The perioperative nurse manager faces an ethical dilemma when faced with an impaired colleague. An effort to support impaired practitioners and to ensure patient safety and quality of care seem incompatible. To facilitate both, violations of the state nurse practice act must be reported, and the employee terminated if your documentation is adequate and treatment options you offer are not pursued. This harsh approach is necessary when the impaired practitioner puts patient care at risk. Kindness promotes chemical dependency, and the harsh action may be the only event that breaks through the denial. Fifteen percent of impaired practitioners who receive coordinated, supportive, and confrontational management are not motivated to seek treatment. Nurses must remember, however, that the remaining 85% respond positively to an established and comprehensive chemical dependency policy. Defined decision-making strategies concerning chemical dependency at the state and local level motivate practitioners to seek treatment to avoid licensure action. Perioperative nurses must meet the challenge to effectively manage chemical dependency. Employing recovering nurses in a structured framework is creative resource management. The ability to conserve talented and skilled practitioners preserves the nurturing strength of nurses and increases professional cohesion.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The Lancet. Oncology,The seed and soil hypothesis: vascularisation and brain metastases.,"The development of a relevant mouse model for the establishment and growth of brain metastases is essential for study of the biology and therapy of brain metastasis. Injection of human tumour cells into the internal carotid artery of syngeneic or nude mice produces experimental metastases in specific regions of the brain; these are not due to patterns of initial cell arrest, motility, or invasiveness, but rather to the ability of metastatic tumour cells to grow. Whether the progressive growth of brain metastases depends on neovascularisation is not clear. Immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses show that the density of blood vessels within experimental metastases in the brains of nude mice, or within brain metastases derived from human lung cancer, is lower than in the adjacent, tumour-free brain parenchyma. However, blood vessels associated with brain metastases are dilated and contain many dividing endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis also reveals that tumour cells located less than 100 microm from a blood vessel are viable, whereas more distant tumour cells undergo apoptosis. The blood-brain barrier is intact in and around experimental brain metastases smaller than 0.25 mm in diameter, but is leaky in larger metastases. Nevertheless, the lesions are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The way in which the brain microenvironment influences the biological behaviour of tumour cells is a subject of intense investigation.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Both enuresis and encopresis are truly psychosomatic entities, in which psychosocial and physiologic elements act and react with one another in the development and maintenance of the problem. Further research, emphasizing concurrent psychological and biologic evaluation, is needed to answer the many still remaining questions about the etiology, natural course, and treatment of these common childhood symptoms.

Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,State-of-the-art review on automated lumen and adventitial border delineation and its measurements in carotid ultrasound.,"Accurate, reliable, efficient, and precise measurements of the lumen geometry of the common carotid artery (CCA) are important for (a) managing the progression/regression of atherosclerotic build-up and (b) the risk of stroke. The image-based degree of stenosis in the carotid artery and the plaque burden can be predicted using the automated carotid lumen diameter (LD)/inter-adventitial diameter (IAD) measurements from B-mode ultrasound images. The objective of this review is to present the state-of-the-art methods and systems for the measurement of LD/IAD in CCA based on automated or semi-automated strategies. Further, the performance of these systems is compared based on various metrics for its measurements.	The automated algorithms proposed for the segmentation of carotid lumen are broadly classified into two different categories as: region-based and boundary-based. These techniques are discussed in detail specifying their pros and cons. Further, we discuss the challenges encountered in the segmentation process along with its quantitative assessment. Lastly, we present stenosis quantification and risk stratification strategies.	Even though, we have found more boundary-based approaches compared to region-based approaches in the literature, however, the region-based strategy yield more satisfactory performance. Novel risk stratification strategies are presented. On a patient database containing 203 patients, 9 patients are identified as high risk patients, whereas 27 patients are identified as medium risk patients.	We have presented different techniques for the lumen segmentation of the common carotid artery from B-mode ultrasound images and measurement of lumen diameter and inter-adventitial diameter. We believe that the issue regarding boundary-based techniques can be compensated by taking regional statistics embedded with boundary-based information.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Revista de neurologia,[A proposal for a clinical registry of dementias].,"We outline a proposal for the structural and functional features needed to develop a registry of dementias which can be used to collect standardised information that is both reliable and valid concerning cases of dementia in the specialised health care centres within a particular geographical area.	Due to the shortage of information about aspects concerning the impact of dementias on the health care system (in terms of the usage of resources and patterns of detection, referral, diagnosis and treatment in usual clinical practice in primary and secondary care), a sequential implementation of the registry is proposed so that it can be adapted to each health district or region. The first step is to identify the cases and sources of information; second, a system for collecting data must be developed that allows information to be gathered in a standardised manner while at the same time making it possible to work in close collaboration with the specialists who diagnose dementia; and, third, it must be set up with the logistics and staff needed to centralise all the functions and activities of the registry.	Epidemiological surveillance is an essential instrument for planning, managing and distributing community health resources, for following up the natural history of chronic diseases and for assessing the impact of programmes of prevention. In this respect, and from a functional point of view, the proposed registry of dementias meets all the basic requirements of epidemiological surveillance.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Sleep medicine reviews,"The putative role of oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathophysiology of sleep dysfunction across neuropsychiatric disorders: Focus on chronic fatigue syndrome, bipolar disorder and multiple sclerosis.","Sleep and circadian abnormalities are prevalent and burdensome manifestations of diverse neuro-immune diseases, and may aggravate the course of several neuropsychiatric disorders. The underlying pathophysiology of sleep abnormalities across neuropsychiatric disorders remains unclear, and may involve the inter-play of several clinical variables and mechanistic pathways. In this review, we propose a heuristic framework in which reciprocal interactions of immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and mitochondrial pathways may drive sleep abnormalities across potentially neuroprogressive disorders. Specifically, it is proposed that systemic inflammation may activate microglial cells and astrocytes in brain regions involved in sleep and circadian regulation. Activated glial cells may secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (for example, interleukin-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha), nitric oxide and gliotransmitters, which may influence the expression of key circadian regulators (e.g., the Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) gene). Furthermore, sleep disruption may further aggravate oxidative and nitrosative, peripheral immune activation, and (neuro) inflammation across these disorders in a vicious pathophysiological loop. This review will focus on chronic fatigue syndrome, bipolar disorder, and multiple sclerosis as exemplars of neuro-immune disorders. We conclude that novel therapeutic targets exploring immune and oxidative & nitrosative pathways (p.e. melatonin and molecular hydrogen) hold promise in alleviating sleep and circadian dysfunction in these disorders.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

International reviews of immunology,"Rheumatic fever, autoimmunity, and molecular mimicry: the streptococcal connection.","The group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and its link to autoimmune sequelae, has acquired a new level of understanding. Studies support the hypothesis that molecular mimicry between the group A streptococcus and heart or brain are important in directing immune responses in rheumatic fever. Rheumatic carditis, Sydenham chorea and a new group of behavioral disorders called pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections are reviewed with consideration of autoantibody and T cell responses and the role of molecular mimicry between the heart, brain and group A streptococcus as well as how immune responses contribute to pathogenic mechanisms in disease. In rheumatic carditis, studies have investigated human monoclonal autoantibodies and T cell clones for their crossreactivity and their mechanisms leading to valve damage in rheumatic heart disease. Although studies of human and animal sera from group A streptococcal diseases or immunization models have been crucial in providing clues to molecular mimicry and its role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever, study of human monoclonal autoantibodies have provided important insights into how antibodies against the valve may activate the valve endothelium and lead to T cell infiltration. Passive transfer of anti-streptococcal T cell lines in a rat model of rheumatic carditis illustrates effects of CD4+ T cells on the valve. Although Sydenham chorea has been known as the neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever for decades, the combination of autoimmunity and behavior is a relatively new concept linking brain, behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders with streptococcal infections. In Sydenham chorea, human mAbs and their expression in transgenic mice have linked autoimmunity to central dopamine pathways as well as dopamine receptors and dopaminergic neurons in basal ganglia. Taken together, the studies reviewed provide a basis for understanding streptococcal sequelae and how immune responses against group A streptococci influence autoimmunity and inflammatory responses in the heart and brain.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

This review investigated the ubiquitin-proteasome system, lysosome-associated degradation, endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation, and the formation of advanced glycation end products. These pathways involved in proteostasis have been reported to be altered in AD, suggesting that their study may be critical for identifying new biomarkers and target molecules for AD.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,Case for and against specificity of depression in Alzheimer's disease.,"The aims of this study were to assess the epidemiological, phenomenological, and pathophysiological evidence that suggests the specificity of depression associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).	We reviewed the English-language literature.	Depression occurs significantly more often in patients with AD than in the general elderly population. While development of depression in response to the disability and emotional stress of AD may be a contributory factor in some patients, several studies showed that depression was not, or was only seldom, related to self-awareness of AD and these studies could not explain the high prevalence figures. To overcome the overlapping phenomenology of the two diseases, specific diagnostic criteria have been developed for depression in this context. Mixed findings have come from neuropathological and neuroimaging studies, with some evidence linking the underlying neural substrate of AD and depression, suggesting an overlapping cause of primary depression and depression comorbid with AD. Few randomized controlled trials for depression associated with AD have been conducted, with rather poor results for the use of antidepressants.	Currently, depression associated with AD is not considered a separate disorder by regulatory authorities and is unlikely to be considered as such in the near future. Several obstacles remain to support such a specific position, including the heterogenous nature of depression in general and within AD itself, the lack of a distinct set of symptoms, and limited treatment.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Neuroscience research,Mild hypothermia--a revived countermeasure against ischemic neuronal damages.,"Although hypothermia as a means of cerebral protection against and resuscitation from ischemic damage has a history of approximately six decades, extensive studies, both in basic and clinical fields, on the mechanisms, effects and methods of mild hypothermia at temperatures no less than 31 degrees C have started only in the last decade. In experiments on rodents, hypothermia in the postischemic period that is introduced up to several hours after reperfusion and is maintained for one day followed by a slow rewarming, significantly protects hippocampal neurons against damage. The mode of action of hypothermia is apparently non-specific and multi-focal in widely progressing cascade reactions in ischemic cells; namely, suppressing: (1) glutamate surge followed by; (2) intraneuronal calcium mobilization; (3) sustained activation of glutamate receptors; (4) dysfunction of blood brain barrier; (5) proliferation of microglial cells; and (6) production of superoxide anions and nitric oxide. In addition, mild hypothermia modulates processes in ischemic condition at the level of cell nucleus, such as the binding of transcription factor AP-1 to DNA, and ameliorates the depression of protein synthesis. This non-specific and widely affecting manner might explain why hypothermia is superior to any medicine developed. Recent clinical trials of mild hypothermia in various individual institutions have revealed significantly beneficial outcomes in some cases, along with an accumulation of practical knowledge of techniques and treatments. Large scale randomized studies involving multiple institutions as well as exchange of informations and ideas are needed for further development of hypothermia treatment.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,[Social cognitive impairment is an integral part of Parkinson disease].,"Parkinson disease (PD) is thought to be primarily a disorder of the motor system due to dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. However, recent studies have revealed that social cognition tasks, such as facial expression recognition, decision-making, and mind-reading, are also impaired in PD. The studies also demonstrated that these impairments can occur due to dysfunctions of mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, particularly in the amygdala. Furthermore social cognitive impairments may develop in the early stage of PD. Therefore we have to understand PD as a not only movement but also cognitive disorder.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Palliative medicine,Effects on pain of a stepwise multidisciplinary intervention (STA OP!) that targets pain and behavior in advanced dementia: A cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Pain in nursing home residents with advanced dementia remains a major challenge; it is difficult to detect and may be expressed as challenging behavior. STA OP! aims to identify physical and other needs as causes of behavioral changes and uses a stepwise approach for psychosocial and pharmacological management which was effective in improving challenging behavior.	To assess whether implementation of the stepwise multidisciplinary intervention also reduces pain and improves pain management.	In a cluster randomized controlled trial (Netherlands National Trial Register NTR1967), healthcare professionals of intervention units received the stepwise training, while training of the control group focused on knowledge and skills without the stepwise component. Observed and estimated pain was assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Logistic generalized estimating equations were used to test treatment and time effects.	A total of 21 clusters (single nursing home units) in 12 Dutch nursing homes included 288 residents with advanced dementia (Global Deterioration Scale score 5, 6, or 7): 148 in the intervention and 140 in the control condition.	The multilevel modeling showed an overall effect of the intervention on observed pain but not on estimated pain; Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate-Dutch version, mean difference: -1.21 points (95% confidence interval: -2.35 to -0.06); Minimum Dataset of the Resident Assessment Instrument pain scale, mean difference: -0.01 points (95% confidence interval: -0.36 to 0.35). Opioid use increased (odds ratio = 3.08; 95% confidence interval: 1.08-8.74); paracetamol use did not (odds ratio = 1.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.71-2.68).	STA OP! was found to decrease 'observed' pain but not estimated pain. Observing pain-related behavior might help improve pain management in dementia.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,Mandated college students' response to sequentially administered alcohol interventions in a randomized clinical trial using stepped care.,"Students referred to school administration for alcohol policies violations currently receive a wide variety of interventions. This study examined predictors of response to 2 interventions delivered to mandated college students (N = 598) using a stepped care approach incorporating a peer-delivered 15-min brief advice (BA) session (Step 1) and a 60- to 90-min brief motivational intervention (BMI) delivered by trained interventionists (Step 2).	Analyses were completed in 2 stages. First, 3 types of variables (screening variables, alcohol-related cognitions, mandated student profile) were examined in a logistic regression model as putative predictors of lower risk drinking (defined as 3 or fewer heavy episodic drinking [HED] episodes and/or 4 or fewer alcohol-related consequences in the past month) 6 weeks following the BA session. Second, we used generalized estimating equations to examine putative moderators of BMI effects on HED and peak blood alcohol content compared with assessment only (AO) control over the 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups.	Participants reporting lower scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, more benefits to changing alcohol use, and those who fit the 'Bad Incident' profile at baseline were more likely to report lower risk drinking 6 weeks after the BA session. Moderation analyses revealed that Bad Incident students who received the BMI reported more HED at 9-month follow-up than those who received AO.	Current alcohol use as well as personal reaction to the referral event may have clinical utility in identifying which mandated students benefit from treatments of varying content and intensity.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
Alzheimer disease and associated disorders,"Computer-based cognitive training for mild cognitive impairment: results from a pilot randomized, controlled trial.","We performed a pilot randomized, controlled trial of intensive, computer-based cognitive training in 47 subjects with mild cognitive impairment. The intervention group performed exercises specifically designed to improve auditory processing speed and accuracy for 100 min/d, 5 d/wk for 6 weeks; the control group performed more passive computer activities (reading, listening, visuospatial game) for similar amounts of time. Subjects had a mean age of 74 years and 60% were men; 77% successfully completed training. On our primary outcome, Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status total scores improved 0.36 standard deviations (SD) in the intervention group (P=0.097) compared with 0.03 SD in the control group (P=0.88) for a nonsignificant difference between the groups of 0.33 SD (P=0.26). On 12 secondary outcome measures, most differences between the groups were not statistically significant. However, we observed a pattern in which effect sizes for verbal learning and memory measures tended to favor the intervention group whereas effect sizes for language and visuospatial function measures tended to favor the control group, which raises the possibility that these training programs may have domain-specific effects. We conclude that intensive, computer-based mental activity is feasible in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and that larger trials are warranted.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
Tropical gastroenterology : official journal of the Digestive Diseases Foundation,A randomized double blind placebo controlled trial of probiotics in minimal hepatic encephalopathy.,"Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common and serious complication of liver disease. Minimal HE has major impact on all aspects of a patient's life. The aim of this study was to asses the efficacy of probiotics in minimal hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.	Stable cirrhotics with minimal hepatic encephalopathy diagnosed by number connection test and evoked responses were recruited for the study. The patients were randomized to two groups and the drugs were administered in a double blind fashion. Improvement in number connection test score, evoked response time and arterial ammonia levels were noted.	43 patients were recruited for the study; 21 in the probiotics group and 22 in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant change in the parameters like arterial ammonia, evoked responses and number connection test before and after treatment with probiotics when compared to placebo.

While animal-assisted therapy (AAT) can benefit physical function in older adults and improve symptoms of psychotic disorders, the effect of AAT on middle-aged patients with schizophrenia is unclear. The current randomized controlled trial aimed to explore the efficacy of AAT for middle-aged patients with schizophrenia. Forty participants were randomly assigned to either the AAT or control group. The AAT group participated in one-hour sessions with dog-assisted group activities once a week for 12 weeks. The controls participated in dose-matched, non-animal-related recreational activities. Both groups remained on their usual psychotropic medication during the trial. Evaluations included the Chair Stand Test (CST), Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 5-Meter walk test (5MWT), and Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills (ACIS). The increases in CST repetitions and ACIS scores were larger in the AAT group than in the controls. The two groups did not differ significantly in MoCA scores, TUG performance, or the 5MWT. The AAT group showed a greater increase in lower extremity strength and social skills, but no improvement in cognitive function, agility, or mobility. Further research with more sensitive evaluations and longer follow-up is needed.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,Can a brief antepartum preventive group intervention help reduce postpartum depressive symptomatology?,"Psychosocial and psychological interventions are generally effective in reducing depressive symptomatology in the postpartum period. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief preventive group intervention for postpartum depression (PPD) in a naturalistic setting, and study the effect of this on social and psychological risk factors.	We conducted a randomized controlled trial (n = 1,719) in south-eastern Hungary in 62 antepartum centers. Pregnant women (n = 710) underwent a 4-session preventive group intervention whereas a control group (n = 1,009) attended 4 sessions providing the same information given in usual care.	Our intervention appeared to significantly reduce the risk of PPD, as defined by Leverton Questionnaire total scores (OR = 0.69). It resulted in an absolute risk reduction of about 18% in those with antepartum depression and 0.5% in those with no depression at recruitment. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a much reduced risk in those with a perceived lack of partner support (OR = 0.4) in the treatment group. Unplanned pregnancy, an irreversible risk factor affecting every fifth woman, also seemed to have a reduced effect on PPD after our group intervention (OR = 0.81).	A brief preventive antepartum group intervention focusing on psychoeducation, stress management, improving coping mechanisms, and the development of social support can be effective in reducing postpartum depressive symptomatology.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
Depression and anxiety,Effectiveness of a culturally attuned Internet-based depression prevention program for Chinese adolescents: A randomized controlled trial.,"Depression prevention among adolescents is crucial for reducing the global disease burden. Internet-based depression prevention approaches are found to be effective but they were mostly evaluated in a Western context. Grasping the Opportunity is a Chinese Internet intervention, which was translated and modified from CATCH-IT developed in the West. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Grasp the Opportunity in reducing depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents.	In this randomized controlled trial, Chinese adolescents aged 13 to 17 years with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms were recruited from three secondary schools in Hong Kong. The participants (n = 257) were randomly assigned to receive either intervention or attention control. The primary outcome was the improvement in depressive symptoms according to the revised Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-R) at the 12-month follow-up. Analyses were performed using intention to treat (ITT).	The participants were randomly assigned to receive the intervention (n = 130) or attention control (n = 127). Follow-up data were obtained from 250 (97%) participants. Only 26 (10%) participants completed the intervention. Compared to the attention control, Grasp the Opportunity led to reductions in depressive symptoms at the 12-month follow-up with a medium effect size using ITT analysis (mean difference 2.6, 95% CI 0.59-5.55, effect size d = 0.36).	Grasp the Opportunity is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents over a long follow-up period.

A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted with 764 13-year olds from ten Australian secondary schools in 2007-2008. Half the schools were randomly allocated to the computerised prevention program (n=397), and half to their usual health classes (n=367). The Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis prevention course is facilitated by the internet and consists of novel, evidence-based, curriculum consistent lessons aimed at reducing alcohol and cannabis use. Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately post, and at six months following the intervention.	Compared to the control group, students in the intervention group showed significant improvements in alcohol and cannabis knowledge at the end of the course and the six month follow-up. In addition, the intervention group showed a reduction in average weekly alcohol consumption and frequency of cannabis use at the six month follow-up. No differences between groups were found on alcohol expectancies, cannabis attitudes, or alcohol and cannabis related harms.	The course is acceptable, scalable and fidelity is assured. It increased knowledge regarding alcohol and cannabis, and decreased use of these drugs.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
Addictive behaviors,Are experiences of sexual violence related to special needs in patients with substance use disorders? A study in opioid-dependent patients.,"A history of sexual violence has been related to more complex treatment needs in patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Most of the existing studies, however, included patients with various types of SUD, did not examine gender differences and focused on a small range of clinical domains. Our sample consisted of opioid-dependent outpatients treated during a three-year period in a German metropolitan region. The analysis was based on a local case register and included all patients for whom information on lifetime sexual violence was available (N=3531; 68.3% males). In a case-control design, patients with a history of sexual violence were compared to patients without these experiences regarding a wide range of clinical and social factors indicative of potential needs. Almost two thirds (65.6%) of the female patients and 10.9% of the males reported experiences of sexual violence. Victims differed from non-victims across a variety of domains, including more psychiatric symptoms and suicide attempts, more legal problems, financial and family problems, as well as a higher use of services. In contrast to a previous study among alcohol-dependent patients, no gender differences became apparent. Our findings suggest that experiences of sexual violence are an indicator for more complex needs in opioid-dependent patients of both genders. In addition to integrated trauma-informed approaches, an effort needs to be made to link addiction facilities to further institutions to meet these complex needs.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of religion and health,Sense of purpose in life and escape from self as the predictors of quality of life in clinical samples.,"Depression is a leading mental disorder from which suffer Europeans and especially women. In clinical groups with elevated risk of suicidal tendencies, both the negative factors and psychological variables that can protect a person should be analyzed. The aims of the current study were analysis of purpose in life function in perceived quality of life-self-efficacy and life satisfaction among people suffering from depression in comparison with control group and analysis of escape from self (EfS)-function as an indicator of suicidal thoughts occurrence, for suicide attempt and perceived quality of life (life satisfaction). Two studies were conducted on two clinical groups. The first study consists of females, 20 of them with depression and 40 without depression disorder as a control group. Measures used in this study are Purpose in Life Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). The second study consists of 60 participants, including 20 who attempted suicide. Measures used in this study are SWLS Scale and an EfS measure. There is a significant meaning of the sense of purpose of life for well-being and self-efficacy. The ability to maintain the feeling of sense of one's existence seems to be a significant factor that protects from a decrease in life quality and keeps the feeling of being able to deal in difficult situations, as well as helps to accept depression symptoms.",Remaining,0,0
Zeitschrift fur arztliche Fortbildung und Qualitatssicherung,[Development and evaluation of a basic documentation tool for guideline-oriented ambulatory care of depressive patients].,"Quality assurance in the treatment of mental disorders is becoming increasingly significant. In this context, documentation systems are important in order to control the implementation of guidelines, to analyse shortcomings and to reveal improvement possibilities. Up till now there is no specific documentation tool for the outpatient care of depressive disorders. Within the project 'Comprehensive Quality Management in Out-patient Care' a documentation tool for primary care as well as for psychiatric care of depressive patients has been developed, which embraces the principal diagnostic and therapeutic measures. This documentation tool consisting of an instrument for the physician to record the first consultation, a second instrument to record the following consultations as well as a patient questionnaire has been implemented and evaluated in primary care and psychiatric practices. The evaluation results demonstrate that the documentation tool is able to assess guideline-oriented treatment measures. Physicians evaluated the usefulness and practicability of the documentation tool positively. And although the documentation efforts required are quite extensive, this documentation tool provides a suitable basis for external or internal quality assurance as well as patient-oriented case-monitoring.",Remaining,0,0
Parkinsonism & related disorders,Dysphagia predicts poor outcome in late-stage Parkinson's disease.,"Few data exist on the rate of clinical progression for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who have entered a late stage of the disease.	Study the clinical progression of a late-stage PD (LSPD) population over one year follow-up.	50 LSPD patients (Schwab and England ADL Scale <50 or Hoehn Yahr Stage >3 in MED ON) underwent an extensive clinical assessment at baseline and after one year and an acute levodopa test at baseline.	Mean age of LSPD patients (female 46%) was 77.5 ± 5.9 years and mean disease duration was 15.5 ± 6.5 years. At baseline, 76% had levodopa-induced motor complications (MC), usually non-troublesome, 68% were demented, 54% had psychosis and 68% depression. Caregiver distress was high. l-dopa responsiveness was mild (18% ± 12 of improvement on MDS-UPDRS-III). After one-year, 20% of the patients were dead, institutionalized or HY 5. MDS-UPDRS-motor mean score worsened 7.2 ± 10.3 points although there was heterogeneity between patients, and there was a global worsening of non-motor symptoms, mostly in cognition/mood, urinary and gastrointestinal domains. Nevertheless, MC improved despite similar levodopa equivalent dose. Functional independence and quality of life worsened. Dysphagia severity at baseline predicted a poor outcome (death, institutionalization or HY 5) (Hazard ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.12-4.4; p = 0.01), whereas magnitude of l-dopa response of LSPD patients did not.	LSPD patients still present a significant, although heterogeneous, motor and non-motor progression over 1 year. Dysphagia severity predicts the occurrence of additional disease severity milestones and its management must be prioritized.",Remaining,0,0
Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,Quantifying handicap: a new measure of long-term rehabilitation outcomes.,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), handicaps exist when individuals are unable to fulfill expected social roles. Although ameliorating handicaps is one of the prime goals of rehabilitation, its effectiveness in this area is poorly measured and has not been documented empirically. Therefore, the Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART) was designed to quantify the extent of handicap in individuals. Using dimensions of handicap identified and described by the WHO, CHART uses measurable, behavioral terms to compare such individuals with the norms of able-bodied members of society. Test-retest, proxies, and independent raters have established the validity and reliability of CHART. Rasch analysis has verified the CHART scaling and scoring procedures. In addition, an initial application of CHART, with a group of 342 spinal cord injured individuals, is described. Beyond demonstrating the instrument's effectiveness in assessing the extent of handicap or social disadvantage, this application, by documenting rehabilitation outcomes, demonstrates the potential usefulness of CHART for program evaluation.",Remaining,0,0

Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,Behavioral syndromes in Alzheimer's disease: description and correlates.,"Behavioral disturbances in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are ill-defined conditions. We hypothesize that the many behavioral disturbances hitherto described and studied might be grouped into few syndromes with separate determinants and correlates.	162 consecutive patients with probable AD admitted to a dementia unit were assessed by the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).	Factor analysis was carried out on NPI subscales, leading to three syndromes: 'mood', 'psychotic' and 'frontal'. Patients with the 'psychotic' syndrome were older, had older age at dementia onset, had poorer cognition, were more often males, and had faster rate of dementia progression. Patients with the 'frontal' syndrome had higher education, longer disease duration, and slower rate of progression.	Some combinations of behavioral disturbances occur more frequently together and might represent separate behavioral syndromes. Different clinical correlates of the syndromes suggest separate etiologies.",Remaining,0,0
Depression and anxiety,Comorbid anxiety as a suicide risk factor among depressed veterans.,"Depressive disorders greatly increase suicide risk; however, little is known about the contribution of comorbid anxiety disorders or anxiety symptoms to the risk of suicide death among depressed patients. We examined whether depressed veterans with comorbid anxiety had higher risks of suicide death.	Using VA administrative databases we identified 887,859 patients with depression. We then used univariate and multivariate logistic regression, controlling for demographics and substance use disorders, to determine the odds ratios of completed suicide associated with individual comorbid anxiety disorders, the presence of any comorbid anxiety disorder, the prescription of an antianxiety medication, or the prescription of a high dose of an antianxiety medication.	In multivariate analyses, the odds of completed suicide were significantly increased for patients with panic disorder (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.53), generalized anxiety disorder (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.47), and anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified (OR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12-1.38). The odds of completed suicide were also greater among patients who received any antianxiety medication (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.55-1.88), and were further increased among those who received high dose treatment (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.98-2.57). Odds of completed suicide were decreased among patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.97), and there was no statistically significant relationship between social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and all other anxiety disorders and suicide.	These findings emphasize the importance of comorbid anxiety disorders and symptoms in increasing suicide risk among depressed patients and may inform suicide prevention efforts among these patients.",Remaining,0,0
Schizophrenia bulletin,Negative symptoms and social cognition: identifying targets for psychological interventions.,"How to improve treatment for negative symptoms is a continuing topic of debate. Suggestions have been made to advance psychological understanding of negative symptoms by focusing on the social cognitive processes involved in symptom formation and maintenance.	Following the recommendations by the National Institute of Mental Health workshop on social cognition in schizophrenia, this study investigated associations between negative symptoms and various aspects of social cognition including Theory of Mind (ToM), attribution, empathy, self-esteem, and interpersonal self-concepts in 75 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 75 healthy controls.	Negative symptoms were significantly associated with difficulties in ToM, less readiness to be empathic, lower self-esteem, less self-serving bias, negative self-concepts related to interpersonal abilities, and dysfunctional acceptance beliefs. Different aspects of social cognition were mildly to moderately correlated and interacted in their impact on negative symptoms: Difficulties in ToM were associated with negative symptoms in persons with low but not in persons with medium or high levels of self-esteem. Taken together, the social cognition variables and their hypothesized interaction explained 39% of the variance in negative symptoms after controlling for neurocognition and depression.	The results highlight the relevance of self-concepts related to social abilities, dysfunctional beliefs, and global self-worth alone and in interaction with ToM deficits for negative symptoms and thereby provide a helpful basis for advancing psychosocial interventions.",Remaining,0,0
Pediatrics,Relationship of pneumothorax to occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage in the premature newborn.,"The relationship of pneumothorax to the occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) has been studied in the premature newborn. The major objective of the study was to determine whether the systemic hemodynamic changes that occur with pneumothorax are reflected in the cerebral circulation and whether these changes play a role in pathogenesis of IVH. Blood flow velocity was measured in the anterior cerebral arteries by a transcutaneous Doppler technique in nine infants who developed pneumothorax in the first 3 days of life. At the time of pneumothorax there was a marked increase in flow velocity, especially during diastole, and, with resolution of pneumothorax, flow velocity returned to normal levels over the ensuing hours. The changes in flow velocity correlated closely with systemic hemodynamic changes that occurred with pneumothorax, ie, and increase in mean systemic blood pressure, especially diastolic pressure. IVH, documented by serial ultrasound scans, was observed shortly after pneumothorax in the nine infants. The data thus demonstrate a marked increase in flow velocity in the cerebral circulation at the time of pneumothorax. This increase is of importance in the genesis of IVH as is suggested further by the occurrence of IVH soon after the cerebral hemodynamic changes.",Remaining,0,0
Acta neuropathologica communications,The unfolded protein response is activated in the olfactory system in Alzheimer's disease.,"Olfactory dysfunction is an early and prevalent symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the olfactory bulb is a nexus of beta-amyloid plaque and tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during early AD progression. To mitigate the accumulation of misfolded proteins, an endoplasmic reticulum stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) occurs in the AD hippocampus. However, chronic UPR activation can lead to apoptosis and the upregulation of beta-amyloid and tau production. Therefore, UPR activation in the olfactory system could be one of the first changes in AD. In this study, we investigated whether two proteins that signal UPR activation are expressed in the olfactory system of AD cases with low or high amounts of aggregate pathology. We used immunohistochemistry to label two markers of UPR activation (p-PERK and p-eIF2α) concomitantly with neuronal markers (NeuN and PGP9.5) and pathology markers (beta-amyloid and tau) in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex and the CA1 region of the hippocampus in AD and normal cases. We show that UPR activation, as indicated by p-PERK and p-eIF2α expression, is significantly increased throughout the olfactory system in AD cases with low (Braak stage III-IV) and high-level (Braak stage V-VI) pathology. We further show that UPR activation occurs in the mitral cells and in the anterior olfactory nucleus of the olfactory bulb where tau and amyloid pathology is abundant. However, UPR activation is not present in neurons when they contain NFTs and only rarely occurs in neurons containing diffuse tau aggregates. We conclude that UPR activation is prevalent in all regions of the olfactory system and support previous findings suggesting that UPR activation likely precedes NFT formation. Our data indicate that chronic UPR activation in the olfactory system might contribute to the olfactory dysfunction that occurs early in the pathogenesis of AD.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of neurosurgery,Cerebral hemodynamic changes during plateau waves in brain-tumor patients.,"The plateau wave, one of the wave forms observed in patients with increased intracranial pressure, has previously been extensively investigated, but its pathophysiological aspect is as yet unclear. The authors undertook a study of cerebral hemodynamic changes while the plateau waves were observed in five brain-tumor patients. Although the number of cases studied was small, a remarkable decrease in cerebrovascular resistance was seen in all patients during the plateau waves. It is suggested that the plateau waves are caused by a marked cerebral vasodilatation. The present results support the thesis that cerebral blood volume is increased during the plateau waves. The plateau waves are closely related to the intrinsic vasomotor control of cerebral circulation, and can occur as long as cerebral vasodilating ability is maintained, irrespective of the existence of cerebral autoregulation.",Remaining,0,0

Acta medica portuguesa,[An analysis of plasma histaminase in schizophrenic patients and its relationship to clinical parameters].,"Previous studies have investigated putative alterations in histamine and histamine receptors in schizophrenia, and evidence in favour of the role of this amine as a neurotransmitter or as a neuromodulator was found. In the present study the activity of plasmatic histaminase was analysed, with histamine and with cadaverine as substrates, in a group of 23 schizophrenic patients and compared with that of healthy controls (n = 32). Plasma histaminase activity was determined using Gordon and Peters spectrophotometric method, and the results were expressed in mumoles of H2O2 transformed/hour/litre of plasma at 25 degrees C. Plasmatic histaminase, using histamine as substrate, was significantly increased in schizophrenic patients as a whole compared with the healthy controls. On the other hand, when cadaverine was used as substrate plasma histaminase was significantly reduced in female schizophrenics but not in males. When patients were divided according to 17 clinical characteristics it was found that the following subgroups were significantly associated to high levels of plasma histaminase (using histamine as substrate): the non mentally deteriorated schizophrenic patients compared with mentally deteriorated schizophrenic patients and those with thymic symptoms as opposed to those without thymic symptoms. An extension of this series and a prospective analysis are required to further define the clinical and biological significance of the alteration of this biochemical parameter in schizophrenia, and particularly in relation with a subgroup of schizophrenia with a more favourable course.",Remaining,0,0
Neuropsychologia,The role of the corpus callosum in visual orienting: importance of interhemispheric visual transfer.,"In a tachistoscopic visual search task, the effects of ipsi- and contralateral distractors on target search were investigated in two complete commissurotomy patients. Pop-out distractors slowed the search for contralateral targets in both patients, i.e. search was not independent in both hemifields. In normals, we previously observed an extinction-like asymmetry in that distractors in the right visual hemifield interfered with target search in the left visual hemifield, but not vice versa. This pattern was also found in one of our patients, N.G., whereas the other, L.B., showed a reversed laterality effect. While N.G. is able to transfer visual shape information between hemispheres, L.B. is not. The data suggest that the reversal of the contralateral distractor asymmetry in L.B. is due to the disruption of ipsilateral visual input to the right hemisphere.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of personality assessment,The effects of MMPI-A T-score elevation on classification accuracy for normal and clinical adolescent samples.,"In this investigation we examined the ability of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent (MMPI-A; Butcher et al., 1992) to classify accurately both clinical and normal adolescents using 2 different T-score elevation ranges, T > or = 60 and T > or = 65, and using 2 different clinical base rates for the occurrence of psychopathology. A clinical base rate of 50% and 20%, respectively, were created by comparing a clinical sample of 203 adolescent inpatients with cooccurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders with 2 subsamples from the MMPI-A normative group. These subsamples consisted of 203 adolescents matched for sex and age, and a larger subsample of 1,015 adolescents proportionately matched for sex and age, with the clinical group. Classification accuracy analyses revealed that although clinical base rate did affect the accurate classification of cases, a T-score cutoff of 65 resulted in higher levels of accurate classification overall while minimizing the misclassification of both clinical and normal cases. Implications of these findings for the recommended use of the MMPI-A 'gray zone' are presented, and the relative areas of strength and weakness of the MMPI-A are reviewed in the identification and description of psychopathology.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,Measuring the Integration of Tobacco Policy and Treatment into the Behavioral Health Care Delivery System: How Are We Doing?,"People with a mental illness and/or drug use disorder have a higher rate of smoking than adults in general. To address this challenge, recommendations include integrating tobacco-free policies and tobacco dependency treatment into the behavioral health care delivery system. Currently, little is known regarding levels of such integration. A 65-item Internet survey measuring integration assessed three areas: a) policies addressing the use of tobacco products; b) provision of evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment; and, c) capacity to help employees/volunteers quit tobacco use. The survey was distributed to representatives of all behavioral health programs in Wisconsin. The survey response rate was 27.1%. Programs, on average, were 40% integrated. A significant proportion of programs (20%) were less than 20% integrated. A few programs (4.3%) exceeded 80% integration. Integration of tobacco policies and treatment into the behavioral health care delivery system remains limited and there is a need for technical assistance and training.",Remaining,0,0
Psychological medicine,Development of a new self-report questionnaire to measure self esteem.,"In constructing a new self-report questionnaire for measuring self esteem, the aim has been to satisfy psychometric requirements without sacrificing the intuitive meaning of the concept. Self esteem is seen as a composite, and examination of its components may have more analytic or predictive value than 'global' scores. Preliminary reliability and validity data are encouraging.",Remaining,0,0
"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Utility of the Full ECG Waveform for Stress Classification.,"The detection of psychological stress using the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is most commonly based on the detection of the R peak-the most prominent part of the ECG waveform-and the heart rate variability (HRV) measurements derived from it. For stress detection algorithms focused on short-duration time windows, there is potential benefit in including HRV features derived from the detection of smaller peaks within the ECG waveform: the P, Q, S, and T waves. However, the potential drawback of using these small peaks is their smaller magnitude and subsequent susceptibility to noise, making them more difficult to reliably detect. In this work, we demonstrate the potential benefits of including smaller waves within binary stress classification using a pre-existing data set of ECG recordings from 57 participants (aged 18-40) with a self-reported fear of spiders during exposure to videos of spiders. We also present an analysis of the performance of an automated peak detection algorithm and the reliability of detection for each of the smaller parts of the ECG waveform. We compared two models, one with only R peak features and one with small peak features. They were similar in precision, recall, F1, area under ROC curve (AUC), and accuracy, with the greatest differences less than the standard deviations of each metric. There was a significant difference in the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which represented the information loss of the model. The inclusion of novel small peak features made the model 4.29×1028 times more probable to minimize the information loss, and the small peak features showed higher regression coefficients than the R peak features, indicating a stronger relationship with acute psychological stress. This difference and further analysis of the novel features suggest that small peak intervals could be indicative of independent processes within the heart, reflecting a psychophysiological response to stress that has not yet been leveraged in stress detection algorithms.",Remaining,0,0
BMC psychology,Metacognitive beliefs mediate the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and traits of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.,"Metacognition has been shown as a key contributor to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder as well as other anxiety-related disorders, yet its role in the development and maintenance of these disorders remains unclear. This study aims to investigate whether anxiety sensitivity traits are related to obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the general population and whether the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive symptoms is mediated by metacognition.	Non-clinical volunteers (N = 156, mean age: 23.97, 121 females) completed measures related to state/trait anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, obsessive compulsive symptoms and metacognition.	A direct relationship between anxiety sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive symptoms was established. Further analysis revealed that metacognition was the strongest mediator of this relationship, even when accounting for state and trait anxiety.	Results suggest that the relationships between traits of anxiety sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive symptoms are partially attributable to the role of metacognition.",Remaining,0,0
Sleep,The effect of total sleep deprivation on plasma melatonin and cortisol in healthy human volunteers.,"Twelve healthy volunteers were included in this study. Baseline curves for melatonin and cortisol were obtained after one night of adaptation to laboratory conditions. From 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., blood samples were drawn every hour. On the third night, the subjects were kept awake at the sleep unit. Curves for the two hormones were then obtained after 36 h of total sleep deprivation (SD). The levels of these hormones were evaluated by calculating the area under the curve at each hour in both situations (basal and after sleep deprivation). It was found that the melatonin levels were increased after sleep deprivation, whereas the cortisol levels remained the same. These results suggest a mechanism by which a reset of abnormal rhythms can occur in depression.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of neural transmission. General section,Plasma and CSF tryptophan in cancer anorexia.,"Eighteen untreated cancer patients and ten sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers were studied. In all patients eating behavior was investigated by means of a specific questionnaire from which the presence of anorexia and anorexia-related symptoms was assessed. To investigate the role of tryptophan in cancer anorexia, fasting plasma and CSF levels of tryptophan and other neutral amino acids were assayed in patients and controls. Cancer patients showed abnormally high plasma free tryptophan levels. In case of patients with cancer anorexia a significant rise of the ratio in plasma between free and tryptophan/large neutral amino acids, competing with tryptophan for its brain entry, was observed. This increase was correlated to a consistent rise of CSF tryptophan levels suggesting a specific role of the serotoninergic system in the pathogenesis of cancer anorexia.",Remaining,0,0
Parkinsonism & related disorders,Sexual and relationship dysfunction in people with Parkinson's disease.,"To quantify the extent of self-reported sexual and relationship problems in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).	A cross-sectional correlation design was used. All people with idiopathic PD, according to the UK Brain Bank criteria, who were known to the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust PD service, were asked to participate. Those who consented were assessed by a research nurse during a six month period using a series of rating scales, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the PD Questionnaire-39, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Szasz sexual functioning scale and, for those in long-term relationships, the Golombok Rust Inventory of Marital State.	Concern over sexual function was reported in 22 (25%) of the 88 participants in the study. Males (p = 0.001) and younger people with PD (p = 0.001) were significantly more likely to report problems with sexual function. Gender (p = 0.007) and UPDRS score (p = 0.045) were significant independent predictors of relationship problems. Males with PD and those with increasing functional problems (UPDRS score) were more likely to report problems in their relationship. Disease duration and levels of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) were not associated with sexual or relationship problems.	Sexual and relationship dysfunction was a problem for many people in this study, but these problems were unlikely to be volunteered unless specifically enquired about. Problems were apparent across all age groups and genders.",Remaining,0,0
Headache,Cardiovascular sympathetic hypofunction in muscle contraction headache and migraine.,"There have been some recent reports proposing that muscle contraction headache (MCH) and migraine are similar and may have a common etiology. It has been hypothesized that derangement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of migraine. However, reports on the ANS function in MCH have rarely been submitted. Therefore, in this report, MCH patients were investigated as well as migraine patients. The cardiovascular reflex responses by orthostatic test, isometric work test and the pulse rate (R-R interval) variation in fifteen MCH patients and fifteen migraine patients were recorded during headache-free intervals. The plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were also measured throughout the orthostatic tests. Fifteen healthy subjects served as the age-matched control group. In the MCH group and the migraine group, blood pressure immediately after going from the supine to the erect position decreased more significantly than in the control group. The basal NE level was significantly low in both the MCH group and the migraine group, in comparison with the control group. MCH patients as well as migraine patients showed cardiovascular sympathetic hypofunction.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of drug education,The expected personality characteristics of alcohol-dependent individuals.,"The Big Five personality factors were used as a framework for examining the expected personality characteristics of individuals who are alcohol-dependent. In an experimental study, participants used a measure of the Big Five personality factors to rate two individuals, each described with either signs of alcohol dependence or not. The ratings of the participants showed that they expected the alcohol-dependent versions of both individuals to be less agreeable and less conscientious. The participants expected the alcohol-dependent college student to be more extraverted and the alcohol-dependent lawyer-father to be more neurotic. The expected personality characteristics of the alcohol-dependent versions of the two described persons were very similar to the actual personality characteristics of alcohol-dependent individuals. The results were consistent with prior findings regarding narrow-band personality traits related to the Big Five. The results help explain prior findings about the social handicap of problem drinking with regard to making friends, dating, marriage, and working. The findings have potential use in alcohol-problem prevention and treatment.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,Enhancing electronic health record measurement of depression severity and suicide ideation: a Distributed Ambulatory Research in Therapeutics Network (DARTNet) study.,"Depression is a leading cause of morbidity worldwide. The majority of treatment for depression occurs in primary care, but effective care remains elusive. Clinical decision making and comparative studies of real-world antidepressant effectiveness are limited by the absence of clinical measures of severity of illness and suicidality.	The Distributed Ambulatory Research in Therapeutics Network (DARTNet) was engaged to systematically collect data using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at the point of care. We used electronic health records (EHRs) and the PHQ-9 to capture, describe, and compare data on both baseline severity of illness and suicidality and response and suicidality after diagnosis for depressed patients in participating DARTNet practices.	EHR data were obtained for 81,028 episodes of depression (61,464 patients) from 14 clinical organizations. Over 9 months, data for 4900 PHQ-9s were collected from 2969 patients in DARTNet practices (this included 1892 PHQ-9s for 1019 adults and adolescents who had at least one depression diagnosis). Only 8.3% of episodes identified in our depression cohort had severity of illness information available in the EHR. For these episodes, considerable variation existed in both severity of illness (32.05% with no depression, 26.89% with minimal, 19.54% with mild, 12.04% with moderate, and 9.47% with severe depression) and suicidality (69.43% with a score of 0, 22.58% with a score of 1, 4.97% with a score of 2, and 3.02% with a score of 3 on item 9 of the PHQ-9). Patients with an EHR diagnosis of depression and a PHQ-9 (n = 1019) had similar severity but slightly higher suicidality levels compared with all patients for which PHQ-9 data were available. The PHQ-9 showed higher sensitivity for identifying depression response and emergent (after diagnosis) severity and suicidality; 25% to 30% of subjects had some degree of suicidal thought at some point in time according to the PHQ-9.	This study demonstrated the value of adding PHQ-9 data and prescription fulfillment data to EHRs to improve diagnosis and management of depression in primary care and to enable more robust comparative effectiveness research on antidepressants.",Remaining,0,0
Acta cardiologica,Electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients presenting with intracranial parenchymal haemorrhage.,"The electrocardiographic abnormalities associated with ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage have been described frequently and studied systematically; however, these changes were not investigated thoroughly in patients with intracranial parenchymal haemorrhage (IPH).	We retrospectively reviewed the electrocardiograms (ECGs) and medical records of all patients who had been diagnosed with acute intraparynchemal haemorrhage (IPH) between 2006 and 2009.	We included 160 patients (56% males). The median age was 71 years (interquartile range (IQR) 59 to 80) and 69% were above the age of 60 years. Most patients were hypertensive (81%).The majority of patients (86%) had at least one ECG abnormality. Sixty-eight (43%) patients had T-wave inversion and 65 (41%) had QTc interval prolongation. There was a significant association between QTc prolongation and the bleeding size and the presence of midline shift; odd ratios were 2.8 (CI 1.4 to 5.5; P 0.003) and 2.2 (CI 1.1 to 4.2; P 0.04), respectively. In addition, sinus tachycardia was found to be significantly associated with the presence of hydrocephalus (OR 4.1; CI 1.3 to 12.8; P 0.02).	ECG abnormalities are a common finding in patients with IPH. Repolarizaion abnormalities occur the most frequently. QTc prolongation was associated with bleeding size and midline shift. Patients who had hydrocephalus were more likely to have sinus tachycardia at presentation.",Remaining,0,0
Archives of disease in childhood,Renal function in acute falciparum malaria.,"Renal function was assessed in 40 children during the acute illness and after recovery from falciparum malaria. Creatinine clearance was significantly lower during the acute illness than after recovery. Six of 18 children with impaired creatinine clearance (< 50 ml/min/1.73 m2) had evidence of acute tubular dysfunction. Hyponatraemia occurred in 12.5% during the acute phase. Fractional sodium excretion was raised in 27% during the acute illness and continuing sodium wastage occurred in 17% after recovery. Plasma potassium was significantly higher and fractional potassium excretion (FeK) significantly lower during the acute illness than after recovery. There was a positive correlation between FeNa and FeK both during and after recovery from the illness but they did not exactly mirror each other in every individual. Urine sodium:potassium ratios were similar during and after recovery from the illness and was related to FeNa. Fractional glucose excretion was zero. Mild proteinuria occurred in 40% during the acute illness but were not related to creatinine clearance, body temperature at presentation, or peripheral parasite density. Proteinuria was absent after recovery. Acute intrinsic renal impairment occurs during apparently 'uncomplicated' falciparum malaria in children.",Remaining,0,0
Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,Age differences in broader autism phenotype traits from young adulthood to older adulthood.,"Much of past research has been dedicated to refining the operationalization and correlates of the broader autism phenotype (BAP) and less on how the BAP differs by socio-demographic characteristics, like age-particularly after midlife. This gap is important because other nonclinical trait-like characteristics (e.g., personality) have shown considerable age differences, leading to work assessing the malleability of psychological characteristics and improving outcomes for individuals and their significant others. In the current study, we examined cross-sectional age differences in the BAP in a large sample of adults ranging in age from 18 to 85. We recruited a sample of 2966 adults ranging in age from 18 to 85 (Mage = 36.53, SD = 12.61; 58.9% Female; 1.1% with an ASD diagnosis) recruited from an online survey service. We found that total BAP scores were higher in younger adults and lower among older adults. These differences were particularly true for pragmatic language difficulties, with this component of the BAP showing the most dramatic age differences. Aloofness showed similar negative associations with age, albeit much smaller. Rigidity was not significantly associated with age. The results are consistent with other research showing an abatement of symptoms among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) across early life and theories predicting changes in other psychological characteristics (e.g., personality). The results are discussed in the context of the malleability of ASD and BAP traits across life, the clinical implications of these changes, and the origins and consequences for lifespan differences in BAP. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about how subclinical autistic-like traits among middle-aged and older adults compare to younger adults. We found that these subclinical traits were highest in young adults and lowest in older adults. Knowing how these traits differ by age can provide researchers and clinicians with a sense of how much these traits might change across life, if the traits might be sensitive to interventions, and when in development it might be best to intervene.",Remaining,0,0
European heart journal. Cardiovascular Imaging,[18F]FDG positron emission tomography in patients presenting with suspicion of giant cell arteritis-lessons from a vasculitis clinic.,"The usefulness of [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([18F]FDG-PET/CT) for diagnosing giant cell arteritis (GCA) has been previously reported. Yet, the interpretation of PET scans is not clear-cut. The present study aimed at determining the best method to analyse PET/CT in a large, real-life cohort of patients presenting with suspicion of GCA.	One hundred and three patients with clinical suspicion of GCA undergoing PET/CT between 2006 and 2012 were included. Clinical data were retrieved from patients' charts. PET/CT was categorized by visual scoring of the uptake and by the artery/liver standardized uptake values (SUV) ratios. Diagnosis of GCA was confirmed in 68 patients and excluded in 35 patients, which served as the controls. GCA patients were older (median age 75 vs. 68 years), and presented more often with ischaemic symptoms. The best discrimination between GCA patients and controls was achieved for PET/CT findings within the supra-aortic arteries (sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.91 for a SUV/LE cut-off value of 1.0). Specificity of PET/CT for the aorta and the iliofemoral arteries was lower (<0.34). Visual scoring correlated poorly to SUV measurements (Kendall Tau-b 0.13-0.55) and had a lower diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.75). Prednisone treatment for ≥10 days significantly reduced PET/CT sensitivity (P = 0.009).	SUV based analysis of PET/CT enhances diagnostic accuracy with best discrimination in the supra-aortic region, particularly in steroid naïve patients. For discrimination based on the aorta and the iliofemoral region, higher cut-off values have to be applied, resulting in lower sensitivities for diagnosing GCA.",Remaining,0,0
International journal of methods in psychiatric research,Pathways from maternal depression to young adult offspring depression: an exploratory longitudinal mediation analysis.,"Maternal depression in the peri-natal period is associated with increased risk for young adult depression in offspring. This study explored mediation of these links via trajectories of child conduct and emotional problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) from ages 4-16 years old in data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort (n = 13373). Through gender-specific structural equation models, a composite measure of exposure to early maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), predicted young adult depression at age 18 (Revised Clinical Interview Schedule - distal outcome). Mediational effects were then estimated by testing which parts of joint piecewise latent trajectory models for child/adolescent conduct and emotional problems were associated with both exposure and distal outcome. For girls, only conduct problems in early childhood were consistently indicated to mediate effects of early maternal depression on risk of young adulthood depression. Some evidence for a pathway via changing levels of childhood and adolescent emotional difficulties was also suggested. For boys, by contrast, the differing models gave less consistent findings providing some evidence for a small time-specific indirect effect via early childhood conduct problems. In addition to its practice implications the current methodological application offers considerable potential in exploratory longitudinal developmental mediation studies. © 2016 The Authors International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs,The Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index for Adolescent Alcohol and Drug Problems: A Comprehensive Modern Psychometric Study.,"The Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI) has been used extensively as a measure of alcohol-related problems experienced by adolescents and young adults. The present study aimed to comprehensively examine the psychometric profile and criterion-related validity of an 18-item RAPI adapted to measure negative consequences resulting from alcohol and other drug use in an at-risk adolescent population.	Categorical confirmatory factor analysis and the graded response model were used for evaluations of the latent factor structure, item properties, test information, and item invariance across gender, age groups (middle vs. late adolescence), and drug use profiles (readily available drugs vs. other illicit drugs), as well as computation of the item response theory scale scores for each of 617 alternative high school students (44% female).	A reduced set of 16 RAPI items provided plausible evidence of unidimensionality and good measurement precision at a relatively wide range of the latent trait continuum. All but two items were invariant across the drug use profiles. The other illicit drug group had higher levels of the latent substance-related problems than the readily available drug group. Criterion-related validity was supported using a measure of past-year polysubstance use.	The RAPI can be effectively modified to measure negative consequences resulting from alcohol and other drug use and reflects a sufficiently wide range of the latent continuum of problem use.",Remaining,0,0
Neurobiology of aging,Prefrontal cortex atrophy predicts dementia over a six-year period.,"The present study investigated prefrontal cortex (PFC) atrophy as a possible predictor of dementia. Eighty-eight older participants of the Maastricht Aging Study (MAAS) were administered for neuropsychological tests at baseline and after three years (t(3)). Magnetic resonance images were acquired at t(3) and nine years after baseline all participants were screened for dementia. Three groups were distinguished: (1) participants who did not develop dementia or cognitive decline, (2) participants who did not develop dementia but did show significant cognitive decline, and (3) participants who developed dementia. Gray matter volume of structures in the PFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL) was measured. Prefrontal volume was significantly smaller in group 3 than in the other two groups, and PFC volume was significantly better than MTL volume in distinguishing between groups 2 and 3. These findings suggest that PFC atrophy is highly associated with dementia and can be considered an important predictor of the disease. It may even be a better predictor than the MTL atrophy that has been found in earlier studies.",Remaining,0,0

No relationship was found between hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and Research Diagnostic Criteria subtypes of depression, with the exception of higher log post-dexamethasone cortisol levels in endogenous depressives. Patients with mood reactivity had lower cortisol values on all assessments. The data suggest that the presence of mood reactivity may be useful as a predictor of normal HPA function in depression.",Remaining,0,0
Helicobacter,Relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and serum interleukin-18 in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Levels of circulating interleukin-18 (IL-18) have been positively correlated with carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and coronary plaque area and have identified IL-18 levels as important predictors of coronary events and cardiovascular mortality. This study aimed to examine the relationship between serum IL-18 and H. pylori-IgG antibody as a sign of H. pylori infection in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.	The carotid IMT, traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, levels of serum H. pylori-IgG and IL-18 were measured in 573 health checkup examinees.	Serum IL-18 and H. pylori-IgG levels were significantly increased in subjects with increased IMT in comparison with those with normal IMT. In subjects with increased IMT, serum H. pylori-IgG was positively correlated with serum IL-18 (r = .402, p = .002), and the association was independent of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors (β = 0.310, p < .001).	In health checkup examinees with increased IMT, serum IL-18 and H. pylori-IgG were independently correlated and were significantly higher than in subjects with normal IMT.",Remaining,0,0
Neuroscience,Working memory load-related electroencephalographic parameters can differentiate progressive from stable mild cognitive impairment.,"Recent studies described several changes of endogenous event-related potentials (ERP) and brain rhythm synchronization during memory activation in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To examine whether memory-related EEG parameters may predict cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we assessed P200 and N200 latencies as well as beta event-related synchronization (ERS) in 16 elderly controls (EC), 29 MCI cases and 10 patients with AD during the successful performance of a pure attentional detection task as compared with a highly working memory demanding two-back task. At 1 year follow-up, 16 MCI patients showed progressive cognitive decline (PMCI) and 13 remained stable (SMCI). Both P200 and N200 latencies in the two-back task were longer in PMCI and AD cases compared with EC and SMCI cases. During the interval 1000 ms to 1700 ms after stimulus, beta ERS at parietal electrodes was of lower amplitude in PMCI and AD compared with EC and SMCI cases. Univariate models showed that P200, N200 and log% beta values were significantly related to the SMCI/PMCI distinction with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, 0.78 and 0.72, respectively. The combination of all three EEG hallmarks was the stronger predictor of MCI deterioration with 90% of correctly classified MCI cases. Our data reveal that PMCI and clinically overt AD share the same pattern of working memory-related EEG activation characterized by increased P200-N200 latencies and decreased beta ERS. They also show that P200 latency during the two-back task may be a simple and promising EEG marker of rapid cognitive decline in MCI.",Remaining,0,0
Neuroepidemiology,A Multicentre Study Comparing Cerebrovascular Disease Profiles in Pacific Islander and Caucasian Populations Presenting with Stroke and Transient Ischaemic Attack.,"In a multicentre study, we contrasted cerebrovascular disease profiles in Pacific Island (PI)-born patients (Indigenous Polynesian [IP] or Indo-Fijian [IF]) presenting with transient ischaemic attack (TIA), ischaemic stroke (IS) or intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) with those of Caucasians (CSs).	Using a retrospective case-control design, we compared PI-born patients with age- and gender-matched CS controls. Consecutive patients were admitted to 3 centres in South Western Sydney (July 2013-June 2020). Demographic and clinical data studied included vascular risk factors, stroke subtypes, and imaging characteristics.	There were 340 CS, 183 (27%) IP, and 157 (23%) IF patients; mean age 65 years; and 302 (44.4%) female. Of these, 587 and patients presented with TIA/IS and 93 (13.6%) had ICH. Both IP and IF patients were significantly more likely to present >24 h from symptom onset (odds ratios [ORs] vs. CS 1.87 and 2.23). IP patients more commonly had body mass indexes >30 (OR 1.94). Current smoking and excess alcohol intake were higher in CS. Hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease were significantly higher in both IP and IF groups in comparison to CS. IP patients had higher rates of AF and those with known AF were more commonly undertreated than both IF and CS patients (OR 2.24, p = 0.007). ICH was more common in IP patients (OR 2.32, p = 0.005), while more IF patients had intracranial arterial disease (OR 5.10, p < 0.001).	Distinct cerebrovascular disease profiles are identifiable in PI-born patients who present with TIA or stroke symptoms in Australia. These may be used in the future to direct targeted approaches to stroke prevention and care in culturally and linguistically diverse populations.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,Patient-Specific Polyvinyl Alcohol Phantom Fabrication with Ultrasound and X-Ray Contrast for Brain Tumor Surgery Planning.,"Phantoms are essential tools for clinical training, surgical planning and the development of novel medical devices. However, it is challenging to create anatomically accurate head phantoms with realistic brain imaging properties because standard fabrication methods are not optimized to replicate any patient-specific anatomical detail and 3D printing materials are not optimized for imaging properties. In order to test and validate a novel navigation system for use during brain tumor surgery, an anatomically accurate phantom with realistic imaging and mechanical properties was required. Therefore, a phantom was developed using real patient data as input and 3D printing of molds to fabricate a patient-specific head phantom comprising the skull, brain and tumor with both ultrasound and X-ray contrast. The phantom also had mechanical properties that allowed the phantom tissue to be manipulated in a similar manner to how human brain tissue is handled during surgery. The phantom was successfully tested during a surgical simulation in a virtual operating room. The phantom fabrication method uses commercially available materials and is easy to reproduce. The 3D printing files can be readily shared, and the technique can be adapted to encompass many different types of tumor.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of transcultural nursing : official journal of the Transcultural Nursing Society,Baridi: a culture-bound syndrome among the Bena peoples in Tanzania.,"The aim of this ethnographic study is to describe baridi, a culture-bound syndrome of the Bena peoples in the village of Ilembula, Tanzania. The data were collected through open-ended interviews (n = 49), observation and personal field diary, and analyzed by qualitative content analysis. The findings showed that baridi, emotional coldness, was a slowly progressing condition. It started with mild symptoms, such as feeling cold, tired and sick. Later, it influenced the sufferer's physical, mental, social, sexual, and economical well being. Treatment of baridi was based on identification of the cause, asking for forgiveness and sharing a ritual confirming family unity. Prevention of baridi required respect of the elderly and familial norms. The findings may advance professional understanding of cultural knowledge by demonstrating how sociocultural conditions produce variations in health.",Remaining,0,0

Hepato-gastroenterology,Acute pancreatic injury in asymptomatic individuals after heavy drinking over the long-term.,"Recently, high-dose short-term alcohol exposure has been observed not to induce acute pancreatic damage, as evaluated by serum pancreatic enzyme activities. In this study the effect of high-dose, long-term alcohol exposure on the pancreas was investigated in 32 consecutive alcoholics admitted to a unit to treat the problems of withdrawal after a long period of heavy drinking. None of the alcoholics complained of abdominal symptoms. The signs of clinical acute pancreatitis (pain, increased serum C-reactive protein concentration or blood white cell count) were not observed in any of the alcoholics. A significant increase in serum total amylase, pancreatic isoamylase and lipase activities developed by the second day after termination of alcohol intake. These enzyme activities remained significantly increased for one week after cessation of drinking. Seven alcoholics had signs of chronic pancreatitis at ultrasonography (pancreatic calcification, pseudocyst). These results suggest that heavy alcohol intake over the long term may frequently induce subclinical pancreatic injury.",Remaining,0,0
Minerva medica,[Study of mapped slow auditory evoked potentials in Alzheimer's disease].,"Alzheimer's disease affects around 500,000 persons in Italy and its diagnosis remains essentially clinical. Our aim was to contribute to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by mapping auditory evoked potentials (AEP). Evoked potentials represent the electric response of the CNS to an external stimulus and can be represented as a sequence of waves. Brain mapping allows a chromotopogram to be compiled showing chromatic maps.	A group of 12 patients were studied aged between 68 and 84 years old who were referred to our attention at the Department of Geriatrics and Gerontology at Catania University and the A.O. Cannizzaro, Geriatrics Unit. All patients completed an assessment form (MM-SE, ADAS) and underwent brain NMR and AEP.	These tests enabled us to identify two types of patients (Group A and Group B) based on the responses shown. The overall evaluation of results revealed that patients with Alzheimer-type dementia present an anomalous cortical neurogenic response to mapped AEP, and that patients in Group A showed anomalous wave morphology, latency and localisation and asymmetric impregnation. The data gathered in this study did not confirm any specific characteristics of AEP given that similar anomalies are found in metabolic dysfunction syndromes and demyelination pathologies.	However, while it does not constitute a specific technique for screening against Alzheimer's disease, the mapping of AEP may contribute to the diagnosis of this disease.",Remaining,0,0

The International journal of social psychiatry,'Modelling social exclusion in a diagnostically-mixed sample of people with severe mental illness'.,"Social inclusion is an important indicator of recovery in individuals with severe mental illness. The Social Inclusion Questionnaire User Experience (SInQUE) is a new measure of social inclusion for mental health service users which assesses five domains (consumption, production, access to services, social integration and civil engagement). It has good psychometric properties and is acceptable to service users and mental health professionals. It is not clear whether individuals with different diagnostic conditions experience a similar reduction in social inclusion.	(1) Investigate whether current social inclusion differs between diagnostic groups (people with schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders, common mental disorder or personality disorder); (2) Identify factors associated with lower social inclusion; (3) Examine associations between social inclusion and stigma, quality of life and loneliness.	Mental health service users with psychotic disorder, personality disorder or common mental disorder, living in the community, completed the SInQUE, alongside other validated outcome measures. Multiple regression investigated associations.	About 192 service users (55% with psychotic disorder; 26% with common mental disorder; 19% with personality disorder). Current social inclusion did not vary according to diagnosis, except for the sub-domain of productivity, where individuals with personality disorder were more socially included than the other two groups. Lower social inclusion was associated with older age (p = .008), lack of higher education (p < .001), more previous admissions (p = .005), severity of current symptoms and greater experienced stigma (p = .006) and anticipated stigma (p = .035). Greater social inclusion was associated with better quality of life (p < .001) and less loneliness (p < .001).	Barriers to social inclusion in individuals with severe mental health problems include factors related to the illness, such as symptom severity and external factors, such as stigma and discrimination. Social inclusion is a recovery goal and should be routinely assessed. Increasing people's social inclusion benefits service users in terms of improved mental health, better quality of life and reduced loneliness.",Remaining,0,0
"Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53",The cognitive content of thought-listed worry episodes in clinic-referred anxious and nonreferred children.,"We investigated the cognitive content of worry in 8- to 13-year-old clinic-referred anxious (n = 38) and nonreferred (n = 51) children. The children were interviewed individually. They thought-listed their latest worry episodes, rated the uncontrollability of the episodes, and reported on the strategies they used to terminate worry. Content analyses showed that children's worry episodes contained predominantly thoughts reflecting negative outcome anticipation, but other types of thought content also were present. These included problem-solving, ruminating, and self-blaming thoughts. Compared to clinic-referred children, nonreferred children reported more problem solving and less ruminating. In the nonreferred group, increasing age was associated with more problem solving and less ruminating. No such age-related associations were found in the clinic-referred group. The 2 groups did not differ in the types of worry-termination strategies they reported, but clinic-referred children were more likely to keep worrying until the perceived threat was removed. The results suggest that the problem-solving function of worry is still emerging during late childhood and that developmental delays in problem solving may be associated with excessive and uncontrollable worrying.",Remaining,0,0
Schizophrenia research,The impact of context processing deficits on task-switching performance in schizophrenia.,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been described as important for maintaining and implementing contextual information in the service of goal-oriented behavior. Accordingly, impairments in context processing are thought to underlie cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, a clinical disorder that has been linked to PFC dysfunction (Servan-Schreiber et al., 1996). However, task switching, a cognitive ability linked to PFC function, has not been consistently impaired in schizophrenia. In this experiment, we assessed whether task-switching performance would be selectively impaired for patients when context demands were high. In the rule-switching condition, a switch required the updating of the relevant task response rules whereas perceptual switching did not entail a switching of contextual information. Instead, a perceptual switch entailed a shift of visuospatial attention to the relevant feature. A second goal was to determine whether potential deficits in context switching would be observed in schizophrenia even in situations when these patients do not need to overcome a prepotent response. Studies of context processing have typically required patients with schizophrenia to use contextual rules to overcome prepotent response tendencies whereas our switching paradigm did not require the inhibition of a competing response. Patients were much slower to switch tasks than controls when contextual rules switched from one trial to the next whereas their performance was intact when the switch occurred between different feature sets and contextual demands were low. Our results demonstrate that context processing deficits are observable in schizophrenia even when there is no prepotent response tendency to inhibit. Moreover, our results suggest that PFC impairments influence performance primarily when patients are required to switch the application of one explicit rule to another.",Remaining,0,0
"Neuropsychiatry, neuropsychology, and behavioral neurology",Behavioral changes in Huntington Disease.,"This study aimed to gain a better understanding of behavioral abnormalities in Huntington disease (HD) and to develop a method for reliably assessing these changes.	Behavioral changes are a central feature of HD and often cause considerable distress and difficulty to patients and their relatives. However, they have received little attention from research despite their prevalence and clinical significance.	One hundred thirty-four patients with HD were assessed using the Problem Behaviors Assessment for Huntington Disease (PBA-HD), an instrument for rating the presence, severity and frequency of behavioral abnormalities in HD.	The findings confirm that behavioral problems are common among patients with HD. The most common symptoms were loss of energy and initiative, poor perseverance and quality of work, impaired judgment, poor self-care and emotional blunting. Affective symptoms such as depression, anxiety and irritability occurred in around half the patients studied. Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) were rarely reported. Factor analysis distinguished three clusters of behavioral symptoms, which were interpreted respectively as reflecting Apathy, Depression and Irritability. The 'Apathy' factor was highly correlated with duration of illness, whereas no such relationship was observed for the 'Depression' and 'Irritability' factors.	The results suggest that certain behavioral changes are fundamental to the progression of HD, whereas others have a more complex relationship to the disease process. The findings have implications for the choice of behavioral measures used to evaluate efficacy of therapeutic interventions.",Remaining,0,0
Psychiatria polska,[Risk factors for dementia of the Alzheimer's type].,"A case-control study was conducted on 16 cases of probable Alzheimer's disease and 32 controls matched for age. The first control group was younger while the second was at the same age as patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The patients were diagnosed according to DSM IIIR criteria. Information was obtained on birth and childhood, medical and surgical history, exposure to various social, psychological and biological factors as well as a family history of dementia. A structured questionnaire based on the AMDP--system was completed. Some of the variables studied reached statistical significance. First of all the sum of unfavourable environmental factors taking place during the person's childhood and elderly was predictive. Also head trauma was more frequent in patients with dementia. The findings suggest a possible etiologic role for some environmental factors in dementia of the Alzheimer's type.",Remaining,0,0
Annals of physical and rehabilitation medicine,"Cause of death trends among adults with and without cerebral palsy in the United States, 2013-2017.","Adults with cerebral palsy (CP) in the United States die much earlier than those without CP, a health inequality likely shaped by causes of death. Existing research has not considered demographic differences in mortality patterns.	To analyze differences in cause of death for adults who did/did not have CP reported on their death certificates and to assess sex and racial-ethnic difference in causes of death among adult decedents with CP.	Data are from the 2013-2017 US Multiple Cause of Death Mortality files (N = 13,332,871; n = 13,897 with CP). Multiple logistic regression models were used to compare differences in causes of death between adults with and without CP and to determine sex and racial-ethnic differences in causes of death among adults with CP. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.	As compared with decedents without CP, those with CP were more likely to die from pneumonitis (aOR 31.14, 95% CI 29.42-32.96), influenza/pneumonia (8.78, 8.30-9.29), respiratory failure (17.24, 15.19-18.69), and choking (20.66, 18.86-22.62) and less likely to die from heart disease (0.61, 0.58-0.65), cancer (0.12, 0.11-0.13), chronic lower respiratory diseases (0.50, 0.44-0.56), and cerebrovascular diseases (0.66, 0.59-0.75). Among adults with CP, female decedents were more likely than males to die from respiratory failure (1.21, 1.03-1.42), and non-Hispanic Black decedents were more likely than non-Hispanic White decedents to die from heart disease (1.24, 1.07-1.45) and cerebrovascular disease (1.77, 1.29-2.49).	In 2013-2017, heart disease was the leading cause of death for adults with and without CP. However, for people with compared to those without CP, likelihood of death from likely preventable respiratory causes of death was higher. Non-Hispanic Black adults were more likely than non-Hispanic White adults to die from heart and cerebrovascular diseases. Public health, clinical, and rehabilitation efforts must use a multifaceted approach to address respiratory and circulatory health among people with CP.

Spine,Isolated congenital cervical block vertebrae below the axis with neurological symptoms.,"A reviews of 13 cases of symptomatic isolated congenital cervical fusion (block vertebrae) below the C2 level is presented. Ten cases were collected from a review of the English literature and three new cases were added. All 13 patients presented neurologic symptoms of radiculopathy and/or myelopathy with either no history of trauma or only minor trauma. Pathogenesis of symptoms is due to degenerative arthritis of the adjacent mobile segments, spinal stenosis, and subluxation of the adjacent mobile segments. The significance of coexisting spinal stenosis and segmental instability is emphasized and is related to the symptoms and treatment of the condition. Symptomatic patients can be treated satisfactorily with adequate decompressive laminectomy and fusion of the unstable segments.",Remaining,0,0
Drug and alcohol dependence,Long-term naturalistic follow-up of chronic pain in adults with prescription opioid use disorder.,"Chronic pain is common in patients with prescription opioid use disorder (OUD), and pain severity has been shown to predict opioid use for those with chronic pain. However, recent research suggests that focusing on pain status (i.e., the presence or absence of chronic pain) at treatment initiation may not reflect the clinical significance of pain over the long-term course of OUD. Reports of variability in chronic pain and its clinical significance over time have yet to be investigated in patients with prescription OUD. The present study examined variability in chronic pain status from entry into prescription OUD treatment through 3.5-year follow-up. Additionally, we examined the association between concurrent chronic pain and opioid use at three follow-up time points.	This secondary analysis (N = 309) of a national, randomized, controlled trial of prescription OUD treatment used generalized estimating equations to assess variability in the prevalence of chronic pain from study entry to 3.5-year follow-up, and the association between chronic pain status and concurrent opioid use.	Fifty-three percent of participants reported variability in chronic pain status over time. The prevalence of chronic pain decreased from study entry through follow-up (aOR = 0.47, p < 0.001). Chronic pain was associated with increased opioid use at each follow-up assessment (aOR = 3.56, p < 0.001).	Chronic pain status may vary over time in those with prescription OUD, and chronic pain appears to be associated with concurrent opioid use. The present findings highlight the importance of assessing chronic pain throughout the course of prescription OUD.",Remaining,0,0
Pharmacopsychiatry,Drug prescription patterns in schizophrenia outpatients: analysis of data from a German health insurance fund.,"The aim of this study was to investigate routine administrative data from a major German health insurance fund, Techniker Krankenkasse, which covers 5.4 million insured individuals. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study analysed data collected from patients with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia in 2003 (index hospitalisation) in order to evaluate prescription patterns of antipsychotic drugs.	Patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia, at least one year prior membership with the insurance fund and a follow-up period of one year were identified. Results were standardised by age and stratified by the severity of their illness, defined by the number of hospital bed days during the three years preceding the index hospitalisation.	A total of 3,121 patients with schizophrenia (male 56.4%, female 43.6%) received 56 692 single prescriptions of antipsychotics. Of these, 35.4% of the prescriptions were for typical and 64.6% for atypical antipsychotics; 55% were for high-potency, 45% for low-potency typical antipsychotics. The most frequently prescribed drugs were olanzapine (26.6%), clozapine (21.3%) and risperidone (19%). There were no relevant gender differences concerning prescription patterns. During a 12-month follow-up period after the first hospitalisation, 1 372 patients (43.9%) were treated exclusively with an atypical antipsychotic, another 499 patients (16%) had a combination of an atypical plus a low-potency typical antipsychotic. Thus, basal therapy with an atypical was observed in 59.9% of our study population. Only 327 patients (10.5%) were treated exclusively with a typical antipsychotic. A total of 645 patients (20.7%) were treated with a combination of atypical plus typical antipsychotic. Changes of medication within one substance group occurred more often with typical antipsychotics (50%) as compared to atypical antipsychotics (25%).	At 60%, the proportion of patients in this study treated with atypical antipsychotics was surprisingly high. Of significant interest is the frequent prescription of clozapine (14%). The results are discussed in comparison to comparable studies from other countries.",Remaining,0,0
Epidemiology and infection,Hepatitis C virus prevalence in The Netherlands: migrants account for most infections.,"A population-based anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence is important for surveillance purposes and it provides insight into the burden of disease. The outcomes of recent studies in the general Dutch population as well as recent HCV data from specific risk groups including migrants, men who have sex with men (MSM) and injecting drug users (IDUs), were implemented in a modified version of the Workbook Method (a spreadsheet originally designed for HIV estimations), to estimate Dutch HCV seroprevalence. The estimated national seroprevalence of HCV was 0·22% (min 0·07%, max 0·37%), corresponding to 28 100 (min n = 9600, max n = 48 000) HCV-infected individuals in The Netherlands. Of these, first-generation migrants from HCV-endemic countries (HCV prevalence ≥2%) accounted for the largest HCV-infected group, followed by IDUs and HIV-positive MSM.",Remaining,0,0

Behavior genetics,Examining the Role of Genetic Risk and Longitudinal Transmission Processes Underlying Maternal Parenting and Psychopathology and Children's ADHD Symptoms and Aggression: Utilizing the Advantages of a Prospective Adoption Design.,"Although genetic factors may contribute to initial liability for ADHD onset, there is growing evidence of the potential importance of the rearing environment on the developmental course of ADHD symptomatology. However, associations between family-level variables (maternal hostility, maternal depressive symptoms) and child behaviors (developmental course of ADHD and aggression) may be explained by genes that are shared by biologically related parents and children. Furthermore, ADHD symptoms and aggression commonly co-occur: it is important to consider both simultaneously to have a better understanding of processes underlying the developmental course of ADHD and aggression. To addresses these issues, we employed a longitudinal genetically sensitive parent-offspring adoption design. Analyses were conducted using Cohort I (n = 340) of the Early Growth and Development Study with cross-validation analyses conducted with Cohort II (n = 178). Adoptive mother hostility, but not depression, was associated with later child ADHD symptoms and aggression. Mothers and their adopted children were genetically unrelated, removing passive rGE as a possible explanation. Early child impulsivity/activation was associated with later ADHD symptoms and aggression. Child impulsivity/activation was also associated with maternal hostility, with some evidence for evocative gene-environment correlation processes on adoptive mother depressive symptoms. This study provides novel insights into family-based environmental influences on child ADHD and aggression symptoms, independent of shared parental genetic factors, implications of which are further explicated in the discussion.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,The INECO Frontal Screening for the Evaluation of Executive Dysfunction in Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: Evidence from Quantitative MRI in a CADASIL Cohort from Colombia.,"Executive dysfunction is a predominant cognitive symptom in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). The Institute of Cognitive Neurology Frontal Screening (IFS) is a well-validated screening tool allowing the rapid assessment of multiple components of executive function in Spanish-speaking individuals. In this study, we examined performance on the IFS in subjects with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), an inherited condition leading to the early onset of SVD. We further explored associations between performance on the IFS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of SVD.	We recruited 24 asymptomatic CADASIL subjects and 23 noncarriers from Colombia. All subjects underwent a research MRI and a neuropsychological evaluation, including the IFS. Structural MRI markers of SVD were quantified in each subject, together with an SVD Sum Score representing the overall burden of cerebrovascular alterations. General linear model, correlation, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to explore group differences on the IFS and relationships with MRI markers of SVD.	CADASIL subjects had a significantly reduced performance on the IFS Total Score. Performance on the IFS correlated with all quantified markers of SVD, except for brain atrophy and perivascular spaces enlargement. Finally, while the IFS Total Score was not able to accurately discriminate between carriers and noncarriers, it showed adequate sensitivity and specificity in detecting the presence of multiple MRI markers of SVD.	These results suggest that the IFS may be a useful screening tool to assess executive function and disease severity in the context of SVD.",Remaining,0,0
European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,Nightmare frequency in adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"Nightmare frequency in adult ADHD patients has not yet been studied systematically. In a sample of 65 patients, it could be shown that nightmare frequency was elevated in ADHD patients compared to a sample representative for Germany. Frequent nightmares (once a week or more often) were reported by 4.62 % of the patients and 1.77 % of the controls. This increase was neither explained by the increased dream recall in general nor by the presence of a comorbid mental disorder. Questions about nightmares should be included in the diagnostic procedures for ADHD patients, and it should be tested whether well-established nightmare treatment strategies like imagery rehearsal treatment might be beneficial to those patients with nightmares.",Remaining,0,0

Molecular psychiatry,"Sleep duration, brain structure, and psychiatric and cognitive problems in children.","Low sleep duration in adults is correlated with psychiatric and cognitive problems. We performed for the first time a large-scale analysis of sleep duration in children, and how this relates to psychiatric problems including depression, to cognition, and to brain structure. Structural MRI was analyzed in relation to sleep duration, and psychiatric and cognitive measures in 11,067 9-11-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, using a linear mixed model, mediation analysis, and structural equation methods in a longitudinal analysis. Dimensional psychopathology (including depression, anxiety, impulsive behavior) in the children was negatively correlated with sleep duration. Dimensional psychopathology in the parents was also correlated with short sleep duration in their children. The brain areas in which higher volume was correlated with longer sleep duration included the orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal and temporal cortex, precuneus, and supramarginal gyrus. Longitudinal data analysis showed that the psychiatric problems, especially the depressive problems, were significantly associated with short sleep duration 1 year later. Further, mediation analysis showed that depressive problems significantly mediate the effect of these brain regions on sleep. Higher cognitive scores were associated with higher volume of the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Public health implications are that psychopathology in the parents should be considered in relation to sleep problems in children. Moreover, we show that brain structure is associated with sleep problems in children, and that this is related to whether or not the child has depressive problems.",Remaining,0,0

Sexually transmitted diseases,Sexual behaviors and HIV/syphilis testing among transgender individuals in China: implications for expanding HIV testing services.,"HIV and syphilis are disproportionately common among transgender individuals globally, yet few studies have investigated transgender HIV/syphilis risk and testing in low- and middle-income nations. We conducted an online survey of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender individuals to examine sexual behaviors and HIV/syphilis testing in China.	We recruited MSM and transgender individuals from 2 major Chinese lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Web platforms. χ Test and logistic regression were used to compare risk behaviors, HIV and syphilis testing history, and prevalence between transgender individuals and other MSM.	Among the 1320 participants, 52 (3.9%) self-identified as transgender. Demographics, including education, employment, and marital status, were similar between both groups, whereas transgender individuals were older. Condomless anal intercourse rate was comparable between the groups. Transgender individuals were less likely to report ever testing for HIV (34.6% vs. 62.0%) and syphilis (15.7% vs. 31.2%) with adjusted odds ratios of 0.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.65) and 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.91), respectively. We found a trend toward a higher HIV prevalence among transgender individuals (11.1% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.12).	Transgender individuals have suboptimal HIV and syphilis testing rates in China. Given the substantial risk behaviors and burden of HIV/STI in the general Chinese MSM population and a lack of knowledge about transgender individuals, enhanced HIV/syphilis testing programs for transgender individuals in China are needed.",Remaining,0,0

In-depth interviews with staff working at 11 dedicated community-based personality disorder services in England together with a cross-sectional staff survey using the Maslach Burnout Inventory.	Levels of burnout were generally lower than those reported in previous studies among mental health workers and levels of personal accomplishment were higher. Staff reported positive as well as negative experiences of working with people with PD. Strong team-work, clear leadership and opportunities for reflective practice were thought to protect staff from burnout.	The low levels of burnout we found may reflect the early stage of the development of these services. However, it is also possible that working with people with PD does not in itself lead to burnout, especially when services are organized to share and contain work-related anxiety.",Remaining,0,0
The American journal of surgical pathology,Correlation Between Immunohistochemistry and Sequencing in H3G34-Mutant Gliomas.,"Recurrent glycine-to-arginine/valine alterations at codon 34 (G34R/V) within H3F3A gene characterize a subset of hemispheric high-grade gliomas (HGG) affecting children and young adults. These tumors, defined as G34R/V-mutant gliomas, are histologically heterogenous, with microscopic features of either HGG or embryonal tumors (primitve neuroectodermal tumor-like features). To assess the value of immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect G34R/V-mutated cases, we tested anti-histone G34V (clone 329E5) and anti-histone G34R (clone RM240) antibodies in a series of 28 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples. A total of 28 cases of hemispheric, IDH-wt HGG mainly affecting children and young adults were evaluated by IHC and by sequencing. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 17 years (0.1 to 26 y). By IHC, 10 of the 28 cases showed nuclear positivity for G34R and 3 of the 28 cases for G34V. Molecular analysis of G34R/V-mutation status was successful in 24 of the 28 cases. Mutation at glycine 34 of the H3F3A gene was identified in 9 of the 24 tumors (37%) by direct sequencing, revealing 7 of 9 positive case by sequencing and 2 of 9 false negative cases by IHC. Two of 15 negative case by sequencing demonstrated a false positivity by IHC. In total, in 4 (16.6%) of 24 cases, IHC and mutational results were discordant: 2 tumors were negative by IHC (false negative) but harbored G34R mutation by sequencing, and 2 cases were positive by IHC (false positive by IHC) but wild type by sequencing. Moreover, most mutated cases showed loss of ATRX expression and/or p53 expression. The positivity by IHC with specific antibody tested is not highly predictive for presence of G34R/V mutation, but confirmation by sequencing is mandatory; G34R/V mutations should be suspected in all hemispheric tumor IDH1/2 wild type, showing loss of OLIG2 and ATRX and/or p53 expression.",Remaining,0,0

We found that the distribution of ACE gene polymorphism frequency was significantly different between the 3 groups. The DD genotype was far more common in stroke patients compared to controls. It was also significantly more common in each of the patient groups compared to controls but rather similar in the 2 patient groups with SV and LV diseases.

World neurosurgery,Clinical Accuracy of Customized Stereotactic Fixtures for Stereoelectroencephalography.,"Stereoelectroencephalograpy (SEEG) is a diagnostic method involving 3-dimensional exploration of brain structures using depth electrodes for locating epileptogenic foci in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A variety of frame-based, frameless, and robotic stereotactic systems have been designed for the accurate placement of depth electrodes.	Using the FHC microTargeting platform as a model, we introduce a fully customized design that has all the constructive elements positioned by a computer algorithm, according to the planned trajectories, anchoring points, and anatomic constraints. All the constructive elements form a single-body fixture, which allows for the efficient implantation of multiple depth electrodes following trajectories having a wide range of orientations. We aim at evaluating the safety and accuracy of this stereotactic system in a clinical setting.	A total of 173 depth electrodes were implanted in 21 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Matlab and DEETO software packages were used to postoperatively evaluate the targeting accuracy. Automatic detection of electrode locations eliminated any subjectivity in calculating the targeting errors.	As a result of using custom geometry of the stereotactic platform, the new design is optimized for each patient and streamlines the surgical procedures. The most important results characterizing the platform's accuracy are the values of 1.22 mm for the median lateral target point localization error and 1.17 mm for the median lateral entry point localization error.	The patient-customized platforms are comparable in terms of safety, accuracy, and simplicity of use to the existing robotic devices for implantation of depth electrodes in patients undergoing SEEG investigations.",Remaining,0,0

Neuro endocrinology letters,The effect of insulin resistance on inflammatory response and oxidative stress in acute cerebral ischemia.,"Insulin resistance (IR) has effects on inflammation and oxidative stress which have importance in acute stroke. Our aim was to investigate the relationships between IR, inflammation, oxidative stress and stroke severity in acute ischemic stroke patients.	We examined the relationships between inflammation, oxidative stress and stroke severity in 75 acute stroke patients with and without IR. Serum levels of oxidative stress markers (nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH)) were measured as well as the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10).	The levels of IL-10 (13.7±19.11 vs 51.20±89.32 pg/ml, p<0.00) in IR group were significantly reduced. Patients with IR had higher levels of NO (30.26±17.63 vs 22.57±14.5 µmol/L, p=0.04) and IL6 (27.44±57.13 vs 8.68±11.8 pg/ml, p<0.00) and higher NIHSS scores (11.40±5.35 vs 8.81±5.76, p=0.04) when compared with noninsulin resistant group. IL-10 was found negatively correlated with HOMA. Additionally, the parameters with positive correlations with HOMA were NIHSS, IL-6 and NO.	Inflammation and oxidative stress are more evident in acute stoke patients with insulin resistance which may cause worse stroke severity.

"Journal of mental health (Abingdon, England)",The effect of Interaction Anxiousness Scale and Brief Social Phobia Scale for screening social anxiety disorder in college students: a study on discriminative validity.,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most prevalent mental health problems, but there is little research concerning the effective screening instruments in practice.	This study was designed to examine the discriminative validity of Interaction Anxiousness Scale (IAS) and Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS) for the screening of SAD through the compared and combined analysis. Firstly, 421 Chinese undergraduates were screened by the IAS and BSPS. Secondly, in the follow-up stage, 248 students were interviewed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used, and the related psychometric characters were checked.	The results indicated that the ROC in these two scales demonstrated discrimination is in satisfactory level (range: 0.7-0.8). However, the highest agreement (92.17%) was identified when a cut-off point of 50 measured by the IAS and a cut-off point of 34 by the BSPS were combined, also with higher PPV, SENS, SPEC and OA than that reached when BSPS was used individually, as well as PPV, SPEC and OA in IAS.	The findings indicate that the combination of these two scales is valid as the general screening instrument for SAD in maximizing the discriminative validity.",Remaining,0,0
Acta neurologica Scandinavica,Serum cystatin C and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.,"Cystatin C (CysC) is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders and autoimmune diseases, but its relationship with anti-N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is unknown.	Serum levels of CysC were determined in 66 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and 115 healthy controls. Of the 66 patients, 30 had a follow-up evaluation at 3 months after admission. Association of CysC with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and its clinical parameters were evaluated in the patients.	The serum levels of CysC were significantly lower in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis than in controls (0.70 ± 0.13 vs 0.83 ± 0.17 mg/mL, P < .001). Disease severity and disease duration were significantly associated with CysC levels. Furthermore, a follow-up evaluation revealed that after treatment anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients had significantly increased serum CysC levels (P < .001) and significantly decreased modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores (P < .001) compared with before treatment. In addition, a significant negative correlation was observed between the change in CysC levels and the change in mRS scores (r = -.700, P < .001).	Our results show that the serum levels of CysC are associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and its clinical parameters and that the changes in CysC levels correlate with therapeutic effect. Therefore, our findings provide new insights into the association between serum CysC and anti-NMDAR encephalitis.",Remaining,0,0
"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",Personality and self-reported delinquency: a longitudinal analysis.,"This study assessed the personality factors associated with self-reported delinquency. Respondents were 282 14-year-olds who were traced for follow-up 2 years later. The follow-up success rate was more than 80%. In line with previous work which has adopted a trait personality perspective to understanding antisocial and delinquent behaviours, it was predicted that psychoticism, extroversion, and low self-esteem as measured at Time 1 would be significant predictors of self-reported delinquency at Time 2. However, the results of structural equation modelling suggested that the three personality variables explained just over 16% of the variance of delinquency at Time 1, but only 6.61% of the variance of delinquency at Time 2. Alone, psychoticism explained 15.3% of the variance of delinquency at Time 1, but only 4.36% of the variance of delinquency at Time 2. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed and some suggestions for future research are made.",Remaining,0,0
"Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",[Relationship of sick leave before treatment to severity of symptoms and treatment outcome in in-patients with anxiety disorders].,"The aim of this study is to explore whether or not being already on sick leave at admission to a psychosomatic clinic indicates a higher level of severity of symptoms in patients with anxiety disorders, and whether or not this has an impact on therapy outcome. We examined 194 in-patients at 8 psychosomatic clinics upon admission and discharge by interview and psychometric testing. Being on sick leave before admission proved to be an indicator for higher global symptom distress as well as a higher severity of anxiety symptoms. Treatment duration was longer for the sick leave group than for the patients that had not been on sick leave, but each group experienced the same degree of change in pre-and-post treatment symptoms. We conclude that sick leave before admission does give information about illness severity and need of treatment in patients with anxiety disorders.",Remaining,0,0
Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,Clinical epidemiological study of 171 cases of cryptococcosis.,"We retrospectively studied 171 patients with cryptococcosis who were divided into three groups according to their associated predisposing conditions (if any): group 1 comprised nonimmunosuppressed patients, group 2 comprised patients with AIDS, and group 3 comprised those patients with other conditions and/or who were users of immunosuppressive drugs. Analysis and correlation of the behavior of the mycosis among the three groups showed differences in the demographic data, clinical forms and manifestations of cryptococcosis, laboratory results, morbidity and mortality rates, and histopathologic aspects. Study of the clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans from 83 patients with cryptococcosis showed that 75 were characterized as C. neoformans variety neoformans and eight as C. neoformans var. gatti. Comparison of the distribution of the gattii and neoformans varieties between the nonimmunosuppressed (group 1) and immunosuppressed (groups 2 and 3) patients showed a significant statistical difference (P < .01).",Remaining,0,0

Available data from six Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations indicated that 1429 isolation of enteroviruses from fecal samples of those patients were performed. The most frequently isolated enterovirus serotype was echovirus type 30: 138/203 isolated enteroviruses, but also others enterovirus serotypes were isolated in a study period. In the years 1995 and 1996 the percentage of positive results of isolation was highest with the numbers of 31% and 28.27% respectively. The decrease in positive isolation results has been observed from 1997 year. Negative results of isolation come up to 90% of investigated cases. Only 1.5% of enterovirus isolation attempts finished successfully in 2002 year. The situation when percentage of positive results of isolation is on so low level, the natural alterations in a profile of enterovirus serotype infected population cannot be observed, and serological investigations can be conducted for enterovirus serotypes others than really circulating and causing infections in population.",Remaining,0,0
Acta neurologica Scandinavica,Expression of hepatocyte growth factor in the skin of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent survival-promoting factors for motor neurons. Overexpression of neuronal HGF has been shown to result in the attenuation of neuronal cell death and progression of disease in a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) transgenic mouse model. HGF might be beneficial for motor neuron survival and is a good candidate agent for the treatment of ALS. So far, studies of the skin of ALS have shown unique pathological and biochemical abnormalities. However, there has been no study of HGF in ALS skin.	We made a quantitative immunohistochemical study of the expression of HGF in the skin from 19 patients with sporadic ALS and 16 controls.	Hepatocyte growth factor immunoreactivity was positive in the epidermis, some dermal blood vessels, and glands in patients with ALS. These findings became more conspicuous as ALS progressed. The optical density for HGF immunoreactivity of the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the epidermis in ALS was significantly higher (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) than in controls. There was a significant positive relation (r = 0.53, P < 0.02 and r = 0.73, P < 0.001) between HGF immunoreactivity and duration of illness in the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the epidermis in patients with ALS.	These findings suggest that changes in HGF in ALS skin are related to the disease process and that metabolic alterations of HGF may take place in the skin of patients with ALS.",Remaining,0,0
"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",Time processing in children and adults with ADHD.,"A time-processing deficit has been proposed as a neuropsychological candidate endophenotype for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but its developmental trajectory still needs to be explored. In the present study, children (N = 33) and adults (N = 22) with ADHD were compared to normal controls on two time-processing tasks. For time reproduction, ADHD-related impairment was found in the full group, but not when adults were analyzed separately. For the discrimination of brief intervals, children and adults with ADHD showed different patterns of deficit. We conclude that in ADHD some time-processing deficits are still present in adults, but may take on age-related different forms.",Remaining,0,0
Adolescence,The relationship between adolescent depression and a history of sexual abuse.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the occurrence of depression among adolescents attending family planning clinics, and to determine the relationship among depression, a history of sexual abuse, and other risk behaviors. The sample consisted of 279 minority females. Results of the study indicated that 40 adolescents (14.3%) scored at or above a raw score of 77 for depression based on the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS). This suggests that these adolescents should be identified for further evaluation. Results of the Stepwise Linear Regression indicated that a history of sexual abuse was the most potent factor in predicting depression. These findings highlight the importance of screening concurrently for depression and a history of sexual abuse in family planning and other healthcare settings.",Remaining,0,0
"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",Alcohol consumption and sexually transmitted disease risk behavior: partner mix among male Korean university students.,"This study examined alcohol consumption and sexually transmitted disease risk behavior as related to prostitute visits and sex partner mix among male Korean university students in 1993 to 1994.	Questionnaires were completed by a representative sample of 1103 university students in Seoul. Lifetime sexually transmitted disease risk behavior was categorized as none, only one, and multiple sexual experiences with prostitutes, whereas risk according to partner mix was classified as no sexual experience with prostitutes, sexual experience with prostitutes only, and with both prostitutes and girlfriends. The proportional odds model was applied to the data.	A total of 25.8% of the university students had visited prostitutes--17.6% visited twice or more, and 12.9% had sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends. Heavier alcohol consumption was significantly related to multiple visits to prostitutes (odds ratio = 1.71) and to sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends (odds ratio = 2.30).	In this first systematic study of the association between alcohol consumption and sexual experiences among Korean male university students, alcohol use was associated with risky sexual behaviors, and with first and most recent sexual experience with prostitutes, supporting our hypotheses.	In Asia, where men frequently have sex with prostitutes, there is a direct and statistically significant dose-response relationship between frequency of sex with prostitutes and HIV-1 seroprevalence. Young Korean men are reported to routinely have sex with prostitutes. Findings are reported from an examination of alcohol consumption and sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk behavior as related to prostitute visits and sex partner mix among 1095 representative male Korean university students aged 17-32 years, of mean age 22.1 years, during 1993-94. The men were drawn from 4 universities in Seoul. 25.8% of surveyed university students had visited prostitutes, 17.6% at least 2 times, and 12.9% had sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends. Heavier alcohol consumption was significantly related to multiple visits to prostitutes and to sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends.",Remaining,0,0
No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,[The value of neuron specific enolase (NSE) in patients with brain tumors].,"gamma gamma-Enolase is considered a specific protein of neuron, which is called neuron specific enolase (NSE). Recent reports clarified that NSE exists not only in neurons but also in neuroendocrine cells, thrombocytes and lymphocytes. Besides normal neuronal tissues, high serum levels of NSE were noticed in the patients with neuroblastomas, small cell carcinomas of the lung, and malignant gliomas, etc. In order to clarify the usefulness of NSE as a marker for intracranial neoplasms or an indicator for prognosis of the patients with intra-cranial tumors, we studied serum, CSF and intratumoral fluid levels of NSE in 62 patients with intra-cranial tumors by radioimmunoassay. Serum level of NSE in healthy adults ranged from 4.1 to 8.9 ng/ml (5.6 +/- 1.38 ng/ml, n = 15) and that of CSF ranged from 4.9 to 7.3 ng/ml (means 6.1 ng/ml, n = 3). Serum samples from patients with malignant gliomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors contained abnormally high level of NSE, of which mean value were 22.3 ng/ml and 16.1 ng/ml, respectively. However, serum samples from patients with low grade gliomas and other intracranial tumors arising from non-neuroectodermal tissues were within normal range. In 9 patients, not only serum levels but CSF levels and/or intratumoral cyst levels of NSE were examined at the same time. Except one meningioma case, CSF levels of NSE were higher (4.9-55.3 ng/ml, mean: 19.3 ng/ml) than that of serum levels (2.3-17.3 ng/ml, mean: 12.7 ng/ml). Mean NSE concentrations of intratumoral fluids in both malignant and benign tumors were 181.7 ng/ml, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Remaining,0,0
International journal of environmental research and public health,Association between Cognitive Status and Physical Activity: Study Profile on Baseline Survey of the My Mind Project.,"The incidence of people with dementia is expected to increase significantly in the coming years, but it seems that there is a relationship between an active lifestyle and cognitive decline. The present study aimed to compare the characteristics and engagement in the physical activity (PA) of three groups of Italian elderly with different cognitive statuses at baseline phase.	Data were examined using the results from the 'My Mind Project' on 305 community-dwelling Italians. The sample was comprised of 93 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 109 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 103 healthy elderly (HE).	Classification of subjects on the basis of Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score showed that 47% of HE performed the highest level of physical activity while 40% of AD performed the lowest level. MCI subjects were distributed quite homogeneously across the levels (p < 0.001). Physical activity such as walking and light sports was carried out mainly and more frequently by HE as compared to the others (p < 0.05). As regards functional status, AD presented worse conditions in basic and instrumental activities of daily living than the other groups (p < 0.001).	Our results evidenced that subjects with cognitive decline had the tendency to engage in PA less than HE. In particular, age and education negatively affected engagement in PA.",Remaining,0,0
Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,Gaucher's disease: a disease with chronic stimulation of the immune system.,"Concentrations of IgA, IgG, and IgM were measured in 25 patients with Gaucher's disease. The mean of each was significantly higher than that generally observed in healthy adults. A direct correlation was noted between IgA and IgG concentrations and age. Patients who underwent splenectomy had IgM concentrations significantly lower than those of persons who did not. In two of 25 patients, multiple myeloma of the nonsecretory type developed. The migration inhibition factor (MIF) test performed with the lymphocytes of our patients was positive to glucocerebroside in four of 17 patients, to glucocerebrosidase in four of 19 patients, and to the extracts of the spleen of a patient with Gaucher's disease in three of eight patients. The results of al MIF tests were negative in six control subjects with splenomegaly of other causes. Our results suggest that in Gaucher's disease there is chronic stimulation of the humoral immune system. The first expression of this stimulation is the production of polyclonal immunoglobulins and, in due time, the development of monoclonal immunoglobulin as well as multiple myeloma.",Remaining,0,0
Drug and alcohol dependence,Some personality characteristics of imprisoned heroin addicts.,"A group of 20 imprisoned heroin addicts was compared on 4 personality dimensions with a group of non-addict fellow prisoners and a group of normal controls. The 4 personality measures examined were level of self-esteem, perceived locus of control, tendency to self-deception and tendency to project a flattering self-image. The addict group was significantly lower in self-esteem and significantly less inclined to project a flattering self-image than the normal controls. However the addicts were similar to their fellow prisoners on all the psychological measures. The addict and non-addict prisoners were also similar in respect of various socioeconomic indices and criminal history. The belief that one could give up use of heroin without outside help was found to distinguish a subgroup of addicts who were at an earlier stage in the addiction process. However this subgroup did not differ from the more experienced addicts on the 4 psychological measures.",Remaining,0,0
The American journal of medicine,The Impact of Atrial Fibrillation on Outcomes of Peripheral Arterial Disease: Analysis of Routinely Collected Primary Care Data.,"The combination of peripheral arterial disease and atrial fibrillation is linked with high risk of mortality and stroke. This study aims to investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation on patients with diagnosed peripheral arterial disease.	This is a retrospective study using The Health Improvement Network database, which contains prospectively collected data from participating primary care practices. Patients with a new diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease between January 8, 1995 and January 5, 2017 were identified in the database alongside relevant demographic information, clinical history, and medications. Every patient in the dataset with peripheral arterial disease and baseline atrial fibrillation (case) was matched to a patient without atrial fibrillation (control) with similar characteristics using propensity score matching. Cox-regression analysis was performed and hazard ratios (HR) calculated for the outcomes of death, stroke, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and major amputation.	Prevalence of atrial fibrillation in this cohort was 10.2%. All patients with peripheral arterial disease and atrial fibrillation (n = 5685) were matched with 5685 patients without atrial fibrillation but otherwise similar characteristics. After multivariate analysis, atrial fibrillation was independently associated with mortality (HR 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.26; P < .01), cerebrovascular events (HR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17-1.57; P < .01), and heart failure (HR 1.87; 95% CI, 1.62-2.15; P < .01), but not with ischemic heart disease or limb loss.	In peripheral arterial disease patients, atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for mortality, stroke, and heart failure. This emphasizes the need for proactive surveillance and holistic management of these patients.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of inherited metabolic disease,Allele-specific amplification of genomic DNA for detection of deletion mutations: identification of a French-Canadian Tay-Sachs mutation.,"A rapid and efficient method for the detection of a 7.6-kb deletion in the beta-hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit gene, a mutant allele causing Tay-Sachs disease in French Canadians, is described. The protocol involves PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of target sequences on normal and mutant chromosomes. Three amplification primers, a single 5' primer complementary to normal and mutant DNA templates and two 3' primers specific for normal and mutant DNA templates are required. The primers direct amplification of two unique fragments (normal and mutant) that are easily separated by gel electrophoresis. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization using normal and mutant probes to genomic DNA samples from normal, heterozygous and homozygous individuals confirms these results and is consistent with results of genotypic classification of individuals using Southern analysis. The method is applicable to detection of deletion mutations in cases where some deletion-flanking sequence is known.",Remaining,0,0
AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,Spinal cord pial metastases: MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine.,"The purpose of this investigation was to describe gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced MR findings in metastatic disease to the pial lining of the spinal cord. Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinoma (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one). Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS. We conclude that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of pial spread of metastatic disease in patients with a known primary malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms.",Remaining,0,0
European eating disorders review : the journal of the Eating Disorders Association,Understanding your own and other's minds: the relationship to eating disorder related symptoms.,"A study using a cross-sectional survey design examined whether eating disorder (ED) related symptoms are associated with understanding one's own and others' minds. A non-clinical sample of 145 women completed self-report questionnaires and recorded their emotional, cognitive and behavioural responses to descriptions of scenarios (vignettes). Responses to scenarios were made from the perspective of self, an attachment figure and a same sex acquaintance. Data were analysed using multiple regression statistics with ED related symptoms as the dependent variable. High levels of ED related symptoms were associated with 'concretised' understanding of own emotions (i.e. a greater number of food related responses), but sophisticated understanding of same sex acquaintance's emotions. They were associated with fewer positive thoughts for self, fewer negative emotions about their own behaviour, and more food responses for same sex acquaintance's behaviour. Similarities and differences were observed in the different perspectives. Limitations are discussed. Implications for further research related to this topic and relevant to EDs are briefly summarised.",Remaining,0,0

The possible occurrence of retinal vascular caliber changes was investigated in a population of hyperhomocysteinaemic (plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) >13 micromol/l) adult epileptic patients.	Retinal photographs of cases and controls were evaluated for generalized narrowing of the retinal arterioles, measured as AVR, by graders masked to case-control status using standardized protocols. Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels were assayed by HPLC.	Sixty-seven patients (36M/31F, 36.4+/-7.5 years of age; mean level of tHcy 22.8+/-11.4 micromol/l), and 75 control subjects (42M/33F, 35.4+/-8.5 years of age; mean level of tHcy 7.8+/-2.3 micromol/l) were enroled. No retinal caliber changes were detected in any patient and healthy subject. The analysis of retinal photographs failed to identify any difference in the venular diameters, arteriolar diameters, and AVR measurements between the two groups (P=0.98).

"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",Characterizing Fast and Slow Progressors in Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Strokes.,"Infarct growth rate (IGR) in acute ischemic stroke is highly variable. We sought to evaluate impact of symptom-reperfusion time on outcomes in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy (MT).	A prospectively maintained database from January,2012-August,2020 was reviewed. All patients with isolated MCA-M1 occlusion who achieved complete reperfusion(mTICI2C-3), had a witnessed symptom onset and follow-up MRI were included. IGR was calculated as final infarct volume (FIV)(ml)/symptom onset to reperfusion time(hours) and was dichotomized according to the median value into slow-(SP) versus fast-progressors (FP). The primary analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of symptom-reperfusion time on 90-day mRS in SP and FP. Secondary analysis was performed to identify predictors of IGR.	A total of 137 patients were eligible for analysis. Mean age was 63 ± 15.4 years and median IGR was 5.13ml/hour. SP(n = 69) had higher median ASPECTS, lower median rCBF<30% lesion volume, higher proportion of favorable collaterals and hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR)<0.4, higher minimal mean arterial blood pressure before reperfusion, and lower rates of general anesthesia compared to FP(n = 68). Symptom-reperfusion time was comparable between both groups. SP had higher rates of 90-day mRS0-2(71.9%vs.38.9%,aOR;7.226,95%CI[2.431-21.482],p < 0.001) and lower median FIV. Symptom-reperfusion time was associated with 90-day mRS0-2 in FP (aOR;0.541,95%CI[0.309-0.946],p = 0.03) but not in SP (aOR;0.874,95%CI[0.742-1.056],p = 0.16). On multivariable analysis, high ASPECTS and favorable collaterals in the NCCT/CTA model, and low rCBF<30% and HIR<0.4 in the CTP model were independent predictors of SP.	The impact of symptom-reperfusion time on outcomes significantly varies across slow-versus fast-progressors.

European journal of medical genetics,Long-term follow-up and novel variant in Suleiman-El-Hattab syndrome: Expanding the genotypic and clinical spectrum of a rare neurodevelopmental disorder.,"Suleiman-El-Hattab syndrome (SULEHS, OMIM #618950) is an autosomal recessive multisystem developmental disorder characterized by distinctive facial appearance, global developmental delay/intellectual disability, poor expressive speech and happy demeanor. SULEHS is an ultra-rare disorder associated with biallelic loss-of-function variants of the TASP1 gene, and up-to-date, seven patients from five families have been reported in the literature. Loss of TASP1 function has been reported to alter H3K4 histone modifications and expression of TFIIA and HOX transcription factors in the SULEHS phenotype. In this report, a new patient molecularly diagnosed with SULEHS by a novel homozygous c.404-2A > G variant in the TASP1 gene is presented with the long-term follow-up. Although the majority of the patient's clinical characteristics were similar to those of previously reported SULEHS patients, this study was the first to describe some additional anomalies, such as cystic hygroma, increased nuchal thickness, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary sequestration anomaly, chronic constipation, encephalomalacia, and aggressive behavior. Because of the remarkable similarities between the clinical features of Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BRWS) and the patient, BRWS was considered the most likely diagnosis before the molecular diagnosis. Network analysis also supported that the interaction of the SULEHS-associated TASP1 gene with the BRWS-associated ACTB and ACTG1 genes through common intermediate molecules. Overall, despite the existence of differences in clinical features, inheritance patterns, and underlying pathophysiology between BRWS and SULEHS, both diseases could be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the high clinical similarities, including the dysmorphic features, growth parameters, neurodevelopmental phenotype, neurological problems, and multisystem involvement. Additionally, this report could contribute to a better understanding of the genotypic and clinical features of SULEHS by describing a novel pathogenic variant and new clinical features, such as prenatal manifestations.",Remaining,0,0

Their ictal perfusion patterns were analyzed in relation to temporal and frontal hyperperfusion during TLE seizures using SPECT subtraction.	Thirty-three TLE patients had interictal and ictal SPECT, video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, and volumetric MRI. SPECT subtraction with MRI coregistration was performed using commercial software. The presence of ictal hyperperfusion was determined in the ipsilateral and contralateral temporal lobe, frontal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia.	All patients showed ictal hyperperfusion in the temporal lobe of seizure origin. Vermian cerebellar hyperperfusion (CH) was observed in 26 patients (78.8%) and hemispheric CH was found in 25 (75.8%). Compared with the side of the epileptogenic temporal lobe, there were 7 patients with ipsilateral hemispheric CH (28.0%), 15 with contralateral hemispheric CH (60.0%), and 3 with bilateral hemispheric CH (12.0%). CH was observed more frequently in patients with additional frontal hyperperfusion (14/15, 93.3%; 2 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 10 contralateral, and 2 bilateral) than in patients without frontal hyperperfusion (11/18, 61.1%). Among 18 patients with temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion, 11 patients showed hemispheric CH (5 ipsilateral to seizure focus, 5 contralateral, 1 bilateral). Hyperperfusion in the basal ganglia (BGH) was seen in 11 of the 15 patients with temporal and frontal hyperperfusion (73.3%) and in 11 of the 18 with only temporal hyperperfusion (61.1%). In 17 patients with unilateral BGH (13 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 4 contralateral), CH contralateral to the BGH was observed in 14 (82.5%), CH ipsilateral to the BGH was found in 2 (11.8%), and CH bilateral to the BGH was found in 1 (5.9%).	During TLE seizures, hemispheric CH occurred not only in contralateral but also in ipsilateral or bilateral cerebellar hemispheres to the side of seizure origin. Although temporal lobe origin seizures associated with additional frontal hyperperfusion produced more frequent hemispheric CH, seizures showing only temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion could produce BGH and CH.

We aimed to evaluate which antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs psychiatrists would prefer for themselves, their partners and children in case of a mental illness.	The study was conducted among psychiatrists in Serbia. The sample consisted of 90 psychiatrists who were asked to complete the questionnaire about their drug selection in hypothetical situations of becoming ill with schizophrenia or depression or these conditions occurring in their partners and children.	In case of schizophrenia, risperidone was the first choice made by most psychiatrists for themselves, their partners or children, followed by clozapine, haloperidol and olanzapine. In case of depression, SSRIs and SNRIs were generally favored, with sertraline and escitalopram being the preferred medications for psychiatrists, partners and their children. With regards to depression, 82.3% of participants would opt for an antidepressant as monotherapy or in combination, but 13.3% would opt for anxiolytic monotherapy. The preferred doses were slightly lower than the recommended ones, especially for antipsychotic agents.	Most psychiatrists would take or administer atypical antipsychotics or SSRIs as the first choice for themselves, their partners or children. These preferences are mostly in accordance with current treatment guidelines, but there is still room to narrow the gap between guideline recommendations and psychiatrists' medication choices in personally meaningful situations.",Remaining,0,0

Brain research,Apathy in frontotemporal dementia is related to medial prefrontal atrophy and is independent of executive dysfunction.,"Apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric syndrome in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and encompasses cognitive, behavioral and affective symptoms. The neural basis of apathy in bvFTD is not completely understood. Previous neuroimaging studies have poorly considered executive impairment and dementia severity as possible confounding factors. Herein we investigated the neural basis of apathy in bvFTD through structural neuroimaging taking into account these factors.	We included patients with probable bvFTD (n = 21) and cognitively healthy controls (HC, n = 22). Participants were matched for age, sex and schooling. All subjects underwent a thorough neuropsychological examination, including tests for executive functions and social cognition. Apathy was assessed with the Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS). All subjects underwent 3T brain MRI. We investigated correlations between SAS scores and gray matter atrophy within the bvFTD group. Executive function (Frontal Assessment Battery) and disease severity were considered as covariates in neuroimaging analyses.	Compared to HC, bvFTD patients had lower scores on global cognitive efficiency, executive functions and social cognition. All bvFTD had clinically relevant apathy (scores greater than 14 in the SAS). Performance in executive function tests did not correlate with apathy scores. The severity of apathy was negatively correlated with gray matter volumes in midline prefrontal regions, namely orbitofrontal cortex and both anterior and dorsal regions of cingulate cortex.	Apathy in bvFTD is related to a specific network of prefrontal cortical areas critically involved in effort-based behavior for rewards and appears to be independent of executive dysfunction.",Remaining,0,0
"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",A New Device for Remote Monitoring of Vital Parameters in Acromegalic Patients: Pilot Study.,"Acromegaly is a rare disease that results from growth hormone (GH) excess. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension,cardiomyopathy, and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome(OSAS) are frequent complications.	Identify a useful system to obtain a reliable remote monitoring of glucose and the most important vital parameters in the acromegalic subjects.	Sixteen acromegalic patients (from 30 to 73 years old) were enrolled. We provided health monitor devices to the patients for continuous acquisition of physiological signals including twelve-lead electrocardiography (EKG) and nocturnal SpO2. At the same time, we applied on the same patients the blinded continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS).	The lowest saturation peaks at night (<80%) were achieved in patients with a known diagnosis of OSAS. A positive correlation was demonstrated between the lowest oxygen saturation values and the CGM peaks (pV <0,0001) and between the average values of oxygen saturation and CGM (pV<0,0003). Patients with a previous diagnosis of OSAS, obtained by polysomnography, showed on the multiparametric monitor recordings superimposable to their known condition. Instead we noticed a discordance in the two EKG recording: the wireless mode showed an irregular rhythm in 5/16 patients, which was not confirmed by the recording mode with cables.	The health monitor device associated with CGM may be a new useful and versatile tool for fragile patients who can self-manage remote monitoring, and for physicians who can obtain real-time information for the clinical and therapeutic management of patients. It is also a useful tool for the follow-up of patients with OSAS. Moreover, once the interference of the OSAS is excluded, the CGM allows us to obtain a more reliable and accurate diagnosis of DM.",Remaining,0,0
Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,Diagnostic accuracy of CompCog: reaction time as a screening measure for mild cognitive impairment.,"Reaction time is affected under different neurological conditions but has not been much investigated considering all types of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).	This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CompCog, a computerized cognitive screening battery focusing on reaction time measurements.	A sample of 52 older adults underwent neuropsychological assessments, including CompCog, and medical appointments, to be classified as a control group or be diagnosed with MCI. The accuracy of CompCog for distinguishing between the two groups was calculated.	The results from diagnostic accuracy analyses showed that the AUCs of ROC curves were as high as 0.915 (CI 0.837-0.993). The subtest with the highest sensitivity and specificity (choice reaction time subtest) had 91.7% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity. The logistic regression final model correctly classified 92.3% of individuals, with 92.9% specificity and 91.7% sensitivity, and included only four variables from different subtests.	In summary, the study showed that reaction time assessed through CompCog is a good screening measure to differentiate between normal aging and MCI. Reaction time measurements in milliseconds were more accurate than correct answers. This test can form part of routine clinical tests to achieve the objectives of screening for MCI, indicating further procedures for investigation and diagnosis and planning interventions.	O tempo de reação é afetado em diferentes condições neurológicas, mas não foi muito investigado considerando todos os tipos de comprometimento cognitivo leve (CCL).	Este estudo investigou a acurácia diagnóstica do CompCog, uma bateria computadorizada de rastreio cognitivo focada em medidas de tempo de reação.	Uma amostra de 52 idosos passou por uma avaliação neuropsicológica, incluindo o CompCog, e uma consulta médica para serem classificados como grupo controle ou serem diagnósticos com CCL. A acurácia do teste para distinguir entre os dois grupos foi calculada.	Os resultados das análises de acurácia diagnóstica mostraram AUC das curvas ROC tão altas quanto 0,915 (CI 0,837-0,993). O subteste com maior sensibilidade e especificidade - subteste de tempo de reação de escolha - apresentou sensibilidade de 91,7% e especificidade de 89,3%. O modelo final de regressão logística classificou corretamente 92,3% dos indivíduos, com especificidade de 92,9% e sensibilidade de 91,7%, e incluiu apenas 4 variáveis ​​de diferentes subtestes.	Em resumo, o estudo mostrou que o tempo de reação avaliado pelo CompCog é uma boa medida de rastreio para diferenciar entre envelhecimento normal e CCL. Medidas de tempo de reação em milissegundos se mostraram melhores que o número de respostas corretas. O teste pode fazer parte de testes clínicos de rotina para atingir o objetivo de rastrear o CCL, indicar outros procedimentos para investigação e diagnóstico e planejar intervenções.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,COVID-19 Vaccines for Children with Developmental Disabilities: Survey of New York State Parents' Willingness and Concerns.,"While 1 in 6 US children have a developmental disability (DD), and such children are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, little is known about their vaccination status. We surveyed New York State parents of children with DDs to ascertain willingness and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines.	An online survey was distributed to statewide DD networks from June to September 2021 (vaccines were authorized for adolescents in May 2021). We report associations between vaccine willingness and concerns and race/ethnicity, child age, in-person schooling, routine/flu vaccinations, and DD diagnoses. Willingness was categorized as 'got/will get ASAP' (high), 'wait and see/only if required,' or 'definitely not.'	A total of 352 parents (49.1% White) responded. Willingness differed by age (p < 0.001). High willingness was reported for 73.9%, 50.0%, and 36.0% of children aged 12 to 17, 6 to 11, and 0 to 5 years, respectively. Willingness differed by autism diagnosis (p < 0.01) and routine and flu vaccination status (p < 0.001). Predominant concerns included side effects (89%) and children with disabilities not being in trials (80%). Less common concerns were COVID not serious enough in children to warrant vaccine (23%) and misinformation (e.g., microchips, 5G, DNA changes) (24%). Concerns about vaccine safety differed by age (p < 0.01) and were highest for older and then the youngest children. In age-stratified adjusted models, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was negatively associated with high willingness for age 5 or younger (OR = 0.02, 95% confidence interval, <0.001-0.622).	Parents of children with DD in New York seemed highly willing for them to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Although few factors predicted willingness to vaccinate, addressing safety and developmental concerns regarding young children is warranted. Given their increased vulnerability, improved COVID-19 surveillance for children with DD is warranted.",Remaining,0,0
Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,Pediatric Chiari I malformation: novel and traditional measurements associated with syrinx and surgery.,"Multiple imaging parameters have been examined to estimate the presence of syrinx and the need for surgery in Chiari I patients (CM1); however, no consistent or definitive criteria have been proposed. The objective of this study was to review existing and identify novel radiological and clinical characteristics of CM1 patients that associate syrinx development and surgical intervention.	Patients with Chiari I malformation diagnosed on imaging between 0 and 18 years were retrospectively reviewed from January 1, 2007 to February 12, 2020. Participants were included if they had a baseline MRI of the head and spine prior to surgical intervention if required. Forty age-matched controls with cranial imaging were identified for comparison. Imaging parameters and clinical symptoms were recorded.	A total of 122 CM1 patients were included in this study. Of the 122 patients, 28 (23%) had syrinx, and 27 (22%) had surgery. The following imaging parameters associated with syrinx and surgical intervention were identified: midbrain length (P < 0.001; P = 0.032), the obex position (P = 0.002; P < 0.001) and medullary kinking (P = 0.041; P < 0.001). Among the clinical features, the presence of overall pain (P = 0.017; P = 0.042), neck pain (P = 0.005; P = 0.027), and sensory dysfunction (P < 0.001) were found to be strongly associated with syrinx and surgery.	While further investigation is needed, these specific radiological and clinical parameters should be considered when evaluating CM1 patients and may be used to guide further management.",Remaining,0,0

The failure to recognize that non-motor, and specifically speech and language delay are common features of this disease may detract from the motor difficulties in affected children and contribute to the late diagnosis of this disorder.

Current psychiatry reports,Clinical and legal characteristics of inmates with bipolar disorder.,"Individuals with bipolar disorder are at an increased risk of criminal arrest compared with those in the population at large. The combination of manic symptoms and substance abuse seem to be the primary illness factors for this increased risk, and the public mental health system has faced challenges in treating these patients successfully in community settings. To decrease the risk for arrest in bipolar patients, clinicians can screen and refer patients for substance use disorders, stabilize mania in hospital settings, and take measures to improve outpatient adherence in the postmanic hospitalization period. Psychiatric advance directives, new developments in civil commitment law, and mental health courts are legal mechanisms that may be critical in preventing the criminalization of those with bipolar disorder.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of neurosurgery,"Complications of invasive subdural electrode monitoring at St. Louis Children's Hospital, 1994-2005.","The purpose of this study was to better define the incidence of complications associated with placement of subdural electrodes for localization of seizure foci and functional mapping in children.	The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 112 consecutive patients (53 boys, 59 girls; mean age 10.9 years, range 10 months-21.7 years) with medically intractable epilepsy who underwent invasive monitoring at the Pediatric Epilepsy Center at St. Louis Children's Hospital between January 1994 and July 2005. There were 122 implantation procedures (85 grids and strips, 32 strips only, five grids only, four with additional depth electrodes), with a mean monitoring period of 7.1 days (range 2-21 days). Operative complications included the need for repeated surgery for additional electrode placement (5.7%); wound infection (2.4%); cerebrospinal fluid leak (1.6%); and subdural hematoma, symptomatic pneumocephalus, bone flap osteomyelitis, and strip electrode fracture requiring operative retrieval (one patient [0.8%] each). There were four cases of transient neurological deficit (3.3%) and no permanent deficit or death associated with invasive monitoring.	Placement of subdural grid and strip electrodes for invasive video electroencephalographic monitoring is generally well tolerated in the pediatric population. The authors found that aggressive initial electrode coverage was not associated with higher rates of blood transfusion or perioperative complications, and reduced the frequency of repeated operations for placement of supplemental electrodes.",Remaining,0,0
European neurology,Cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid beta-peptide in Alzheimer's disease and major depression - inverse correlation with dementia severity.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia that ultimately leads to death. Histopathological hallmarks of AD include brain amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. Major depression is a frequent diagnosis in every gerontopsychiatric clinic that sees patients with both cognitive and affective disorders. Many depressed patients, in fact, are clinically characterized by cognitive impairments. Thus, an assay that excludes - or confirms - probable AD in cognitively impaired patients is desirable. Such assays may use protein markers that are derived from such histopathologically relevant molecules as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its derivatives including the amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta). To evaluate the differential diagnostic properties of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta and secreted soluble ectodomain (APPs), we quantitated CSF levels of these measures in AD patients and compared them to age-matched control patients with major depression. CSF levels of APPs and Abeta were similar in patients with AD or major depression, and the apolipoprotein E genotype had no influence on CSF levels of Abeta in AD patients. Measurement of Abeta peptide using a novel zinc/copper capture ELISA that detects aggregated Abeta peptides as well demonstrated similar levels in AD and major depression. In AD patients, CSF levels of total Abeta (Abeta1-40 plus Abeta1-42) were inversely correlated with a functional measure of dementia severity (NOSGER), suggesting that CSF levels of Abeta decrease with advancing severity of AD. Thus, CSF levels of Abeta are not useful for the differentiation of AD from major depression. However, CSF levels of Abeta reflect the severity of dementia and may be useful as biological markers of the stage of the disease.",Remaining,0,0
Professional case management,The Montreal Cognitive Test Intervention: The Relationship Between Cognitive-Impaired Patients and Readmissions.,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between cognitive impairment among Medicare patients and hospital readmissions. Although there has been research on cognitive impairment and readmissions, seldom action has been done in regard to economic costs with hospitals. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) established the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program in 2012. Hospitals may not be fully reimbursed for Medicare patient readmissions within 30 days ().	An ethnographic approach was utilized with purposive sampling.This was a nonrandomized purposive sampling intervention study using data from Epic health systems database.	The intervention spanned over 5 months and the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) intervention was conducted in the hospital in a 3-phase study. The purpose of the study was for quality improvement and to detect cognitive impairment among Medicare readmitted patients.	The result shows cognitive impairment is prevalent among the Medicare population. Seventy-one (61%) had evidence of cognitive impairment (i.e., obtained a score below 25). The mean MoCA score for the 71 patients identified as having evidence of cognitive impairment was 17.84 (SD, ±5.06; range, 5-24). MoCA is useful in the acute care setting for identifying patients who are at increased risk for readmission. A randomly assigned controlled clinical trial test is warranted to further validate the association between cognitive impairment and readmissions.	The ACA aims to improve case management by improving effective outcomes for individuals, care coordination among hospital professionals, economic efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and the collaborative process that services the patient. Hospitals across the country are implementing polices that adhere to patient-centered care. Before the ACA was passed, health care services were value metric. The ACA regulates hospitals toward holistic care or quality metrics. Case management will be critical, as hospitals look toward innovative methods to evaluate their patients.",Remaining,0,0
Autism : the international journal of research and practice,Defining crisis in families of individuals with autism spectrum disorders.,"Parents of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder often report higher levels of depression, anxiety, and mental health-related issues. The combination of stressors and family adjustment difficulties can cause distress which may develop into a crisis. Understanding crisis in the family is important to mental health practice since it can serve as a guide in delivering service to at-risk families. This study investigated the subjective experience of crisis in 155 mothers of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Thematic analysis revealed that crisis is characterized by factors influencing four major areas: demands, internal capabilities, external resources, and subjective appraisal. Understanding what crisis means to families of individuals with autism spectrum disorder can help inform effective preventative and crisis services.",Remaining,0,0

Further, most of the addicts who were drinking in excessive patterns while maintained on methadone had pretreatment histories of similar alcohol use.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of affective disorders,Personality traits in children of parents with unipolar and bipolar mood disorders.,"Using family study data, the following questions regarding the mechanisms of association between personality traits and mood disorders were addressed: 1) Is there an association between unipolar and bipolar mood disorders and personality traits in probands? 2) Are personality traits associated with depression in their 9 to 17 year-old children? 3) Is there an association between parental mood disorders and personality traits in offspring? 4) Are parental personality traits associated with the risk of depression in offspring?	The study included 50 probands with bipolar and 37 with unipolar mood disorder, 34 healthy controls as well as 178 of their children between 9 and 17 years. Diagnoses were made according to a best-estimate procedure based on a semi-structured interview (DIGS), medical records and family history information. Personality traits were assessed using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire in adults and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Junior in offspring.	Personality traits, and in particular Neuroticism, were found to be associated with mood disorders in currently affected as well as remitted probands and offspring. However, there was no association between mood disorders in parents and personality traits in their children, and conversely, parental personality traits were not associated with the risk of depression in offspring.	1) Relatively small proportion of offspring who were still unaffected but likely to subsequently develop mood disorders; 2) cross-sectional design.	The findings were best compatible with the complication or scar hypothesis, which assumes the occurrence of abnormal personality traits as a consequence of previous depressive episodes.",Remaining,0,0

Participants included 349 women, among whom 42% currently self-ascribed a non-exclusively heterosexual sexual identity. Among women reporting higher levels of sexual self-concept ambiguity, greater risk for active suicide ideation is found when perceptions of burden and feelings of thwarted belonging co-occur with feelings of hopelessness.

Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome.,"Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, localized to the lentiform nucleus, was carried out in nine patients with a clinical diagnosis of Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (SRO) and in eight healthy age-matched controls. Three of the nine SRO patients had a so-called 'eye of the tiger sign' with high signal in the globus pallidus surrounded by a ring of low signal on T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging previously only reported in Hallervorden-Spatz disease. One of these patients had pathologically proven SRO at postmortem. The SRO group showed a significant reduction in the median concentration from N-acetyl groups (median, 6.87 mM; range, 4.92-10.59 mM; p < 0.015) compared with the control group (median, 9.85 mM; range, 9.26-11.0 mM). The N-acetylaspartate concentration was significantly reduced in seven of the nine patients studied. The reduction of the N-acetylaspartate-creatine ratio from the lentiform nucleus in the SRO group may reflect neuronal loss, occurring predominantly in the globus pallidus. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy may be a useful, noninvasive technique to help differentiate the various parkinsonian syndromes.",Remaining,0,0
Psychiatry research,Sleep and circadian rhythms in affective patients isolated from external time cues.,"Sleep electroencephalographic activity, circadian rhythms in motor activity and rectal temperature, and clinical state were monitored longitudinally in four affectively ill patients (two depressed, one manic, and one rapidly cycling between depression and mania) who lived in isolation from external time cues (zeitgebers) for 3 to 4 weeks. In these conditions it was possible to observe the intrinsic or free-running behavior of circadian pacemakers and thereby to test several hypotheses about the role of sleep and circadian rhythms in the pathogenesis of depression. No hypothesis was consistently supported by the results. We found that the intrinsic rhythm of a circadian pacemaker appeared to free-run with an abnormally fast frequency in one patient. No patient remained stably depressed during temporal isolation. Our experience suggests that this type of study can be carried out safely with appropriate precautions. Temporal isolation is a means to test decisively predictions of several chronobiological hypotheses about affective illness and should be applied to additional patients.",Remaining,0,0

"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Amyloidosis in surgically resected atrial appendages: a study of 345 consecutive cases with clinical implications.,"Histomorphologic parameters of atrial appendages removed during the Cox-Maze procedure have been shown to correlate with recurrence of atrial fibrillation. While amyloid deposition has been noted within atrial appendages, the incidence and significance remains incompletely understood. More accurate amyloid typing methodologies and targeted pharmacotherapeutics have recently been developed, prompting pathologists to provide more detailed information about the type of amyloid identified in such samples. This study sought to fully characterize the morphologic characteristics of atrial amyloid as well as its incidence and clinical significance. Tissue archives were queried for atrial appendages removed during the cardiac surgeries (2010-2014). Patient demographics, imaging features, and salient clinical findings were recorded. Pattern and extent of amyloid deposition were recorded. Typing of the amyloid protein, when present, was performed on a subset of cases by laser capture microdissection with mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. A total of 383 atrial appendages from 345 consecutive patients were included in the study (mean age, 69 years; range, 26-92 years). Amyloid was present in 46% of patients. A linear relationship was observed between age and presence of atrial amyloidosis. Women were more likely to have atrial amyloidosis. Two distinct morphologies of amyloid were observed: filamentous and nonfilamentous, and correlated perfectly with amyloid type (filamentous = AANF-type amyloid; nonfilamentous = ATTR-type amyloid). Filamentous deposits were observed in 91% of those with amyloid. Amyloid was more likely to be found in the left atrial appendage than the right. Patients with atrial amyloid, irrespective of type, were more likely to have experienced stroke or TIA and more likely to have atrial arrhythmia preoperatively. Postoperatively, those with atrial amyloid are more likely to experience recurrence of arrhythmia than those who did not have atrial amyloid. Understanding the morphologic characteristics of AANF-type amyloid will allow for identification by the light microscopy and obviates the need for expensive ancillary typing techniques. The finding of nonfilamentous amyloid, should still prompt confirmation of amyloid type so that targeted therapy may be employed.",Remaining,0,0
Acta medica portuguesa,Portuguese Adaptation and Input for the Validation of the Views on Inpatient Care (VOICE) Outcome Measure to Assess Service Users'Perceptions of Inpatient Psychiatric Care.,"Patient satisfaction is an important measure of health care quality. Patients' views have seldom been considered in the construction of measures addressing satisfaction with inpatient facilities in psychiatry. The Views on Inpatient Care - VOICE - is a first service-user generated outcome measure relying solely on their perceptions of acute care, representing a valuable indicator of service users' perceived quality of care. The present study aimed to contribute to the validation of the Portuguese version of VOICE.	The questionnaire was translated into Portuguese and applied to a sample of eighty-five female inpatients of a psychiatric institution. Data analysis focused on assessing reliability and exploring the impact of demographic and clinical variables on participants' satisfaction.	Internal consistency of the questionnaire was high (α = 0.87). Participants' age and marital status were associated with differences in scores, with older patients and patients who were married or involved in a close relationship presenting higher satisfaction levels.	The questionnaire demonstrated good internal consistency and acceptability, as well as construct validity. Further studies should expand the analysis of the psychometric properties of this measure e.g., test-retest reliability.	The Portuguese version of VOICE is a promising tool to assess service users' perceptions of inpatient psychiatric care in Portugal.	Introdução: A satisfação com os serviços de saúde é uma medida importante da qualidade dos cuidados formais prestados. Os doentes raramente têm sido envolvidos na construção de instrumentos para avaliar a satisfação com estruturas de internamento psiquiátrico. A medida Views on Inpatient Care (VOICE) recorre, pela primeira vez, às perceções dos próprios doentes sobre um internamento em cuidados agudos, apresentando-se como um indicador valioso da qualidade dos cuidados tal como percebida pelos utentes. O presente estudo visou contribuir para a validação da versão portuguesa desta medida. Material e Métodos: O questionário foi traduzido e adaptado para português, e aplicado a uma amostra de 85 mulheres admitidas num serviço de internamento psiquiátrico. A análise focou-se na consistência interna da medida e no impacto das variáveis demográficas e clínicas nos níveis de satisfação. Resultados: A consistência interna foi elevada (α = 0,87). Encontrámos associações entre a idade e o estado civil e as pontuações obtidas: doentes mais velhos e doentes casados, ou vivendo maritalmente, apresentaram níveis mais elevados de satisfação. Discussão: O questionário apresentou boa consistência interna e aceitabilidade entre os participantes, bem como validade de constructo.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders,Electrophysiological Endophenotypes and the Error-Related Negativity (ERN) in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Family Study.,"We examined the error-related negativity (ERN) as an endophenotype of ASD by comparing the ERN in families of ASD probands to control families. We hypothesized that ASD probands and families would display reduced-amplitude ERN relative to controls. Participants included 148 individuals within 39 families consisting of a mother, father, sibling, and proband. Robust ANOVAs revealed non-significant differences in ERN amplitude and behavioral performance among ASD probands relative to control youth. In subsequent multiple regression analyses group and kinship (proband, sibling, mother, father) did not significantly predict ΔERN (error minus correct ERN) or behavioral performance. Results do not provide evidence for the ERN as an endophenotype of ASD. Future research is needed to examine state- or trait-related factors influencing ERN amplitudes in ASD.",Remaining,0,0
Caries research,Is attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder a risk factor for dental caries?

To date, however, this impression has not been systematically investigated. A case-control study of children in Otago, New Zealand (case DMFT > or = 5; control DMFT <5; case status determined from School Dental Service dental records) was conducted by postal survey and reference to the School Dental Service records. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, and school socio-economic status. The purpose of the study was to assess whether having ADHD was associated with higher odds of having high caries experience. Questionnaires were returned for a total of 128 case-control pairs. Conditional logistical regression analysis showed that, after controlling for fluoride history, medical problems, diet, and self-reported oral hygiene, children with ADHD had nearly 12 times the odds of having a high DMFT score than children who did not have ADHD (OR = 11.98; 95% CI 1.13, 91.81).

Journal of analytical toxicology,Increasing Prevalence of Ketamine in Drivers in New York City Including the Identification of 2-Fluoro-Deschloroketamine.,"Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used in veterinary and human medicine since the 1970s. Its clinical use has expanded to control of seizures, by pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS), and is finding new purpose as an analgesic alternative and antidepressant. Ketamine brings hope for effective management of chronic pain in the absence of opioids and decreasing suicidal ideations; however, its persistence as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic properties remains. In the wake of expanding medicinal purposes, the diversity of New York City's population was explored to better understand its misuse. This retrospective study looks at the prevalence of ketamine in driver fatalities over a period of 18 years (2003-2020) and cases involving suspected driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) over a period of 6 years (2015-2020). Ketamine was identified in 6 driver fatalities and in 47 DUID cases. None of the driver fatalities were suspected of ketamine misuse, due to administration either in hospital or by EMS. In the DUID cases, an increasing trend was observed over the 6-year study period with 100% (n = 47) of the cases confirmed as non-hospital/non-EMS administered ketamine. Of the DUID cases, 94% were male with the majority between the age of 21 and 39 years (85%) and were predominantly Hispanic (36%) and Asian (34%). Blood concentrations of ketamine ranged from 27 to >2000 ng/mL with polydrug use prevalent. The most common drug classes detected in addition to ketamine were cannabinoids (38%), ethanol (32%), benzodiazepines (26%), cocaine (19%) and amphetamines/3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (15%). In 2019, 2-fluoro-deschloroketamine was identified in two cases for the first time. Despite its increased acceptance for mental health disorders, ketamine's persistence and misuse as a recreational drug remains and should continue to be monitored by relevant toxicological, clinical and law enforcement communities along with emerging illicit ketamine analogs.",Remaining,0,0
Acta biomaterialia,Material properties of components in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques: a uniaxial extension study.,"Computational modelling to calculate the mechanical loading within atherosclerotic plaques has been shown to be complementary to defining anatomical plaque features in determining plaque vulnerability. However, its application has been partially impeded by the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the mechanical properties of various tissues within the plaque. Twenty-one human carotid plaques were collected from endarterectomy. The plaque was cut into rings, and different type of atherosclerotic tissues, including media, fibrous cap (FC), lipid and intraplaque haemorrhage/thrombus (IPH/T) was dissected for uniaxial extension testing. In total, 65 media strips from 17 samples, 59 FC strips from 14 samples, 38 lipid strips from 11 samples, and 21 IPH/T strips from 11 samples were tested successfully. A modified Mooney-Rivlin strain energy density function was used to characterize the stretch-stress relationship. The stiffnesses of media and FC are comparable, as are lipid and IPH/T. However, both media and FC are stiffer than either lipid or IPH/T. The median values of incremental Young's modulus of media, FC, lipid and IPH/T at λ=1 are 290.1, 244.5, 104.4, 52.9, respectively; they increase to 1019.5, 817.4, 220.7 and 176.9 at λ=1.1; and 4302.7, 3335.0, 533.4 and 268.8 at λ=1.15 (unit, kPa; λ, stretch ratio). The material constants of each tissue type are suggested to be: media, c1=0.138kPa, D1=3.833kPa and D2=18.803; FC, c1=0.186kPa, D1=5.769kPa and D2=18.219; lipid, c1=0.046kPa, D1=4.885kPa and D2=5.426; and IPH/T, c1=0.212kPa, D1=4.260kPa and D2=5.312. It is concluded that all soft atherosclerotic tissues are non-linear, and both media and FC are stiffer than either lipid or IPH/T.",Remaining,0,0
European journal of pediatrics,Seizure disorders and developmental disorders: impact on life of affected families-a structured interview.,"Seizure disorder and developmental disorder are two of the most common chronic disorders in childhood. Data on perceived parental burden and specific effects on daily life is scarce. We performed a structured interview, consecutively talking to all parents of pediatric outpatients of our university hospital diagnosed with seizure or developmental disorder. Three hundred seven parents (of 317 affected children: 53 with seizure disorder, 44 with specific developmental disorder, 35 with learning disorder, 71 with intellectual disability, 15 with seizure + specific developmental disorder, 23 with seizure + learning disorder, 76 with seizure disorder + intellectual disability) were interviewed. Parents of children with both seizure disorder and intellectual disability stated the highest constraints in daily life, regarding friends, hobbies, emotional pressure, occupation, partnership, habitation, and financial burden. Due to diagnosis of seizure or developmental disorder, 155/307 (51%) parents reduced their working hours/stopped working, 62/307 (20%) changed their habitation, and 46/307 (15%) broke up. As judged by parents, 148/317 (47%) children are being discriminated against, even own family/friends and educators are held responsible.	Parents perceive changes in their daily life and discrimination of their children due to their children's seizure and developmental disorders. An intellectual disability combined with seizure disorder caused the highest constraint. What is Known: • Seizure and/or developmental disorders of children may adversely influence quality of life for affected parents. • Caring for a child with special health care needs can take complete attention and own parental needs may therefore be difficult to meet. What is New: • Two out of three parents stated changes of their daily life such as quitting work, change of habitation, or breakup of partnership due to their child's diagnosis. • As judged by the parents, one in two children with developmental disorder of any kind is being discriminated against, even teachers and own family are held responsible.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of general internal medicine,Screening for Substance Use in Rural Primary Care: a Qualitative Study of Providers and Patients.,"Substance use frequently goes undetected in primary care. Though barriers to implementing systematic screening for alcohol and drug use have been examined in urban settings, less is known about screening in rural primary care.	To identify current screening practices, barriers, facilitators, and recommendations for the implementation of substance use screening in rural federally qualified health centers (FQHCs).	As part of a multi-phase study implementing electronic health record-integrated screening, focus groups (n = 60: all stakeholder groups) and individual interviews (n = 10 primary care providers (PCPs)) were conducted.	Three stakeholder groups (PCPs, medical assistants (MAs), and patients) at three rural FQHCs in Maine.	Focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed. Themes surrounding current substance use screening practices, barriers to screening, and recommendations for implementation were identified and organized by the Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework.	Identifying the problem: Stakeholders unanimously agreed that screening is important, and that universal screening is preferred to targeted approaches. Adapting to the local context: PCPs and MAs agreed that screening should be done annually. Views were mixed regarding the delivery of screening; patients preferred self-administered, tablet-based screening, while MAs and PCPs were divided between self-administered and face-to-face approaches. Assessing barriers: For patients, barriers to screening centered around a perceived lack of rapport with providers, which contributed to concerns about trust, judgment, and privacy. For PCPs and MAs, barriers included lack of comfort, training, and preparedness to address screening results and offer treatment.	Though stakeholders agree on the importance of implementing universal screening, concerns about the patient-provider relationship, the consequences of disclosure, and privacy appear heightened by the rural context. Findings highlight that strong relationships with providers are critical for patients, while in-clinic resources and training are needed to increase provider comfort and preparedness to address substance use.",Remaining,0,0
"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Depletion of Highly Abundant Proteins of the Human Blood Plasma: Applications in Proteomics Studies of Psychiatric Disorders.,"Psychiatric disorders are complex diseases involving exogenous and endogenous factors. Biomarkers for diagnosis or prediction of successful treatment are not existent. In addition, the molecular basis of these diseases is still poorly understood. Blood plasma represents the most complex proteome as it contains subproteomes from several body tissues. However, the high abundance of some little proteins can obscure the analysis of hundreds of low abundance proteins, which are potential biomarkers. Therefore, removal of these high abundance proteins is pivotal in any proteomic study of plasma. Here, we present a method of depleting these proteins using immunoaffinity liquid chromatography.",Remaining,0,0
Pediatric neurology,An MRI and MRS study of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.,"Earlier reports on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the classical form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease seemed to divide the patterns of the high-intensity lesions in the white matter into three subtypes: type I, diffusely hemispheric and corticospinal; type II, diffusely hemispheric without brainstem lesions; and type III, patchy in the hemispheres. The four boys presented in our study, between 10 and 17 years of age, with classical Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, who all had a duplicated proteolipid protein gene, invariably manifested type I despite their various clinical severities. Follow-up MRI after an interval of 5 years and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in three of the patients. The white matter on the last MRI was unchanged in volume and the distribution of high-intense areas. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed no abnormal peaks. These results were consistent with the lack of definite neurologic regression in the last 5 years and with the pathologic characteristics of well-preserved axons and the absence of sclerosis. Further study is required to precisely determine whether the patterns of MRI findings can be divided into subtypes corresponding to those of proteolipid protein gene abnormalities.",Remaining,0,0
Neurology,Multifocal VZV vasculopathy with temporal artery infection mimics giant cell arteritis.,"To address the incidence of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection in patients with biopsy-negative giant cell arteritis (GCA), we examined archived biopsy-negative temporal arteries from subjects with clinically suspected GCA for the presence of VZV antigen.	Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded temporal arteries that were pathologically negative for GCA and normal temporal arteries were analyzed immunohistochemically for VZV and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) antigen.	Five (21%) of 24 temporal arteries from patients who were clinically suspect but biopsy negative for GCA revealed VZV but not HSV-1 by immunohistochemical analysis. Thirteen normal temporal arteries did not contain VZV or HSV-1 antigen. All 5 subjects whose temporal arteries contained VZV antigen presented with clinical and laboratory features of GCA and early visual disturbances.	Multifocal VZV vasculopathy can present with the full spectrum of clinical features and laboratory abnormalities characteristically seen in GCA.",Remaining,0,0
European radiology,Uncontrolled hypertension associates with subclinical cerebrovascular health globally: a multimodal imaging study.,"The study aimed to analyze the association between hypertension control and subclinical cerebrovascular health using a comprehensive multimodal imaging approach.	The study included 200 hypertensive older males without previous cardiovascular diseases. Clinic blood pressure (BP) was measured using a standard approach. Cerebrovascular health was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging in the following four aspects: Intracranial atherosclerosis as determined by vessel wall imaging; Vascular rarefaction (defined as less discernible vessels on angiography) was evaluated using a custom-developed technique. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) were assessed using arterial spin-labeling imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, respectively.	A total of 189 subjects had MRI scans. The mean age was 64.9 (± 7.2) years. For intracranial atherosclerosis, there was a significant association between uncontrolled hypertension and presence of intracranial plaque. When systolic and diastolic BP were analyzed separately, the association remained significant for both. For vascular rarefaction, uncontrolled hypertension was associated with less discernible vessel branches or shorter vessel length on angiography. Further analysis revealed that this is due to uncontrolled diastolic BP, but not uncontrolled systolic BP. There was an association between uncontrolled hypertension and reduced CBF, which was also mainly driven by uncontrolled diastolic BP. We also found that uncontrolled diastolic BP, but not uncontrolled systolic BP, was associated with increased WMH volume.	Uncontrolled hypertension was associated with subclinical cerebrovascular injury globally, with both small and medium-to-large arteries being affected.	• In this study, we leveraged the advantage of a series of cutting-edge MR imaging and analysis techniques and found uncontrolled hypertension is associated with subclinical globally compromised cerebrovascular health. • The detrimental consequences of uncontrolled BP affect not only the small vessels but also the medium-to-large arteries, and uncontrolled systolic and diastolic BP are both independently associated with certain types of cerebrovascular injury. • Our data suggest that cerebrovascular health is impaired globally in uncontrolled hypertension before the onset of stroke.",Remaining,0,0
Medicina clinica,[Factors associated with sharing syringes among street-recruited injecting drug users].,"To estimate the prevalence of risk behaviors related to drug use and to identify factors associated with of accepting and passing on used syringes among intravenous drug users (IDU) recruited in Barcelona city and other surrounding areas in 2004.	A cross-sectional study of IDU recruited from the streets by ex-IDU interviewers. A standardized and anonymous questionnaire which explored behaviors in the previous 6 months was used. Saliva samples were collected to determine human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence. Logistic regression models were used to identify determinants of accepting and passing on used syringes.	Of the 300 participants, 17.7% and 13.3% accepted and passed on used syringes, respectively. 74.8% practiced front-backloading (to prepare the drug solution in a syringe and then divide it up into other syringes) and 77.9% shared other equipment. The prevalence of HIV was 57.7%. The predictors of accepting used syringes were using more than 4 drugs (odds ratio [OR] = 5.6), having a positive hepatitis C virus status (OR = 7.3), practising front/backloading (OR = 12.6) and having an IDU steady partner (OR = 2.9); and with passing on used syringes were practicing front/backloading (OR = 4.9), having an IDU steady partner (OR = 5.8), and having sexual risk behaviors with casual partners (OR = 4.0). Starting to inject drugs older than 15 years of age was a protective factor (OR = 0.2).	The prevalence of risk behaviors related to drug use remains high, especially indirect sharing, just as the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C virus. Prevention programs should be targeted to IDU, especially to young IDU, polydrug users and those who have an IDU steady partner.",Remaining,0,0
Neurologic clinics,Polyarteritis Nodosa Neurologic Manifestations.,"Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a necrotizing vasculitis affecting medium-sized vessels whose main manifestations are weight loss, fever, peripheral neuropathy, renal, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal tract and/or cutaneous involvement(s), hypertension and/or cardiac failure. Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most frequent and earliest symptoms, affecting 50% to 75% of PAN patients. Central nervous system involvement affects only 2% to 10% of PAN patients, often late during the disease course. Treatment relies on combining corticosteroids and an immunosuppressant (mainly cyclophosphamide) in patients with poor prognoses. In patients with hepatitis B virus-related PAN, plasma exchanges and antiviral drugs should be combined with corticosteroids.",Remaining,0,0
Acta neurochirurgica,A comparative study of the Reaction Level Scale (RLS85) with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Edinburgh-2 Coma Scale (modified) (E2CS(M)).,"In this work a new coma scale for the assessment of responsiveness in acute brain disorders, constructed near the year 1985 by Scandinavian investigators, the Reaction Level Scale (RLS85), is compared with two other coma scales namely: (i) the Glasgow Coma Scale: (GCS); (ii) the Edinburgh-2 Coma Scale, after modification: (E2CS(M)). The study proceeded in the form of a statistical analysis of assessments made on 46 patients according to RLS85 and GCS (i.e., when comparison was with GCS) and on 28 patients according to RLS85 and E2CS(M). In all 74 cases two physicians participating as 'observers' carried out the assessments. They were both contacting the patient--not together but--successively within a time interval of less than 20'. Hence the data appeared as 'pairwise' observations for any of the three scales above. The results of the analysis, arising from a rather strict statistical reasoning, can be summarized as follows: (1) The rank correlation coefficient r(s) between: (i) RLS85 and GCS sum score, (ii) RLS85 and E2CS(M), was found to be at a satisfactory level meaning that all three scales indicate almost the same 'ranking order of severity'. (2) Reliability was compared by taking into account as to what extent the two observers agreed on RLS85 and--simultaneously--disagreed on the other scale. The 'sign' test was applied and as a result RLS85 proved to be more reliable than; (i) GCS (EMY profile), (ii) GCS sum score, and (iii) E2CS(M), in all the above mentioned at a high level of significance. (3) Apart from the test above, some values of the index kappa (kappa) of interobserver agreement were calculated. Those corresponding to RLS85 are considerably higher. In particular the overall value based on 74 pairwise assessments amounted to kappa = 0.733 associated with a standard error sigma(kappa) = 0.061. This was a satisfactory result regarding the features of RLS85. (4) As far as coverage is concerned, again--by the 'sign' test--the predominance of RLS85 versus GCS (EMY profile) was accepted.",Remaining,0,0
Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,Prevalence and correlates of cognitive impairment in adults with subjective memory complaints in primary care centres.,"To examine the prevalence and correlates of cognitive impairment (CI) in adults over 50 years old attending primary care centres with complaints of memory failure.	A sample of 580 individuals aged 50+ years with no previous diagnosis of dementia was assessed by use of the Mini Mental State Examination, the Cambridge Cognitive Assessment-Revised and the California Verbal Learning Test - to evaluate CI-dependent variables - and administration of a questionnaire on memory complaints and other instruments - to measure correlates.	The prevalence of CI was 46.20% and positive associations were found for age, gender, level of education, subjective memory complaints, instrumental activities of daily living, reading habits and frequency of leisure activities. In the logistic regression, modelled CI was associated with older age, gender (49.12% women, 39.66% men), instrumental activities of daily living, and reading habits.	Almost half of the adults aged 50+ years attending primary care centres with subjective memory complaints were affected by CI. Early evaluation of cognitive functioning is essential to establish adequate preventive and intervention strategies.",Remaining,0,0
International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,"Development and internal validation of an aneurysm rupture probability model based on patient characteristics and aneurysm location, morphology, and hemodynamics.","Unruptured cerebral aneurysms pose a dilemma for physicians who need to weigh the risk of a devastating subarachnoid hemorrhage against the risk of surgery or endovascular treatment and their complications when deciding on a treatment strategy. A prediction model could potentially support such treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to develop and internally validate a model for aneurysm rupture based on hemodynamic and geometric parameters, aneurysm location, and patient gender and age.	Cross-sectional data from 1061 patients were used for image-based computational fluid dynamics and shape characterization of 1631 aneurysms for training an aneurysm rupture probability model using logistic group Lasso regression. The model's discrimination and calibration were internally validated based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic and calibration plots.	The final model retained 11 hemodynamic and 12 morphological variables, aneurysm location, as well as patient age and gender. An adverse hemodynamic environment characterized by a higher maximum oscillatory shear index, higher kinetic energy and smaller low shear area as well as a more complex aneurysm shape, male gender and younger age were associated with an increased rupture risk. The corresponding AUC of the model was 0.86 (95% CI [0.85, 0.86], after correction for optimism 0.84).	The model combining variables from various domains was able to discriminate between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms with an AUC of 86%. Internal validation indicated potential for the application of this model in clinical practice after evaluation with longitudinal data.",Remaining,0,0
Nordic journal of psychiatry,"Dual diagnosis and mechanical restraint - a register based study of 31,793 patients and 6562 episodes of mechanical restraint in the Capital region of Denmark from 2010-2014.","To investigate whether patients with dual diagnosis have a higher risk of being mechanical restraint compared to patients with only psychiatric diagnoses.	Data on all patients admitted to a psychiatric ward from 2010-2014 in the Capital Region of Denmark was linked with information from the register of coercive measures. Patients were based on diagnosis divided into six groups. The three main patient groups were: only psychiatric diagnosis defined as all ICD-10 F-diagnosis except F10-F19, dual diagnosis (co-occurrence of diagnoses of harmful use or dependency and psychiatric diagnoses) and only other substance use diagnosis (i.e. other than harmful use or dependency). The risk of mechanical restraint was investigated by analyzing all first-time admissions in the period using Cox-proportional hazard models.	In the crude rates patients with dual diagnosis were more often mechanically restrained compared to patients with only psychiatric diagnoses or only other substance use diagnoses. However, this was attenuated when the characteristics of patients were accounted for. Patients with only other substance related diagnoses had the highest risk of being mechanically restrained.	When preventing mechanical restraint, the focus should be on actual use of substances or withdrawal effects and not on the dual diagnoses patients in them-self.",Remaining,0,0
Biochemical and biophysical research communications,A novel primer extension method to detect the number of CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene in families with X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.,"X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), an adult-onset form of motor neuron disease, was recently reported to be caused by amplification of the CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene. We report here a simple and rapid strategy to detect the precise number of the CAGs. After the DNA fragment containing the CAG repeats is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, a primer extension is carried out; the extension of the end-labelled reverse primer adjacent to 3' end of CAG repeats stops at the first T after CAG repeats with the incorporation of dideoxy ATP in the reaction mixture. The resultant primer products are analysed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. This method could be quite useful to detect not only CAG repeats in SBMA but also other polymorphic dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats.",Remaining,0,0

The American journal of pathology,Microtubule reduction in Alzheimer's disease and aging is independent of tau filament formation.,"Biochemical studies show that phosphorylated tau, like that found in paired helical filaments (PHFs), does not promote microtubule assembly leading to the view that PHF formation leads to microtubule deficiency in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, although this issue is one of the most important aspects to further understanding the cell biology of AD, no quantitative examination of microtubule diminution in AD and its relationship with PHFs has been performed. To examine this issue directly, we undertook a morphometric study of brain biopsy specimens from AD and control cases. Ultrastructural analysis of neurons was performed to compare the microtubule assembly state in neurons of diseased and control cases and to examine the effect of PHF accumulation. We found that both number and total length of microtubules were significantly and selectively reduced in pyramidal neurons from AD in comparison to control cases (P = 0.000004) but that this decrement in microtubule density was surprisingly unrelated to PHFs (P = 0.8). Further, we found a significant age-dependent decrease in microtubule density with aging in the control cases (P = 0.016). These findings suggest that reduction in microtubule assembly is not dependent on tau abnormalities of AD and aging.",Remaining,0,0

Data for this paired case-control study was collected in 2004 and 2005 in the city of Joao Pessoa, in Northeastern Brazil. The sample included 260 women, divided into 130 battered individuals and 130 non-battered. The case study group consisted of women who lodged complaints for domestic violence at the Specialist Women's Police Station. The control group was made up of women living in the same neighborhood as those who had made the complaint. Cohesion, adaptability and mental risk were all measured using the 'Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales'. For the statistical analysis the Chi-square and the Fisher's Exact Tests ere used, at a significance level of 5%.	The two groups differed for measures relating to mental risk and cohesion, but had similar results for family adaptability (p=0.0917). The women victims of domestic violence had high (43.1%) and medium (39.2%) mental risk, while the non-victims had only medium risk (55.4%). There was a significant difference in drug use between the two groups, with greater consumption among the families of battered women (90.8%) compared with those of non-battered women (56.9%). The most widely used drug was alcohol, which also represented the highest risk factor for aggression if consumed daily (OR=37.33) or in conjunction with other drugs (OR=29,56).

Neuropsychobiology,Temperament Profiles of Children and Adolescents with Psychotic and Mood Disorders.,"Psychiatric disorders are often linked to dysfunctions within neurotransmitter systems, and the same systems play a role in healthy temperaments. Development of a common bio-behavioural taxonomy based on functionality of neurotransmitter systems suggests examining temperament profiles in patients with various psychiatric disorders.	(1) To investigate temperament profiles in two age groups of children with delusional disorders; (2) to investigate temperament profiles in adolescents with mood disorders; (3) to investigate temperament profiles in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) children.	Sample: in total 171 participants (M/F = 91/80), healthy children and teenagers (volunteers); two age groups of children with psychotic disorders; teens with mood disorders (clients of the Federal Mental Health Center) and healthy IVF. Parents of participants completed a test based on the neurochemical model Functional Ensemble of Temperament (FET).	(1) Both age groups of children with psychotic disorders had significantly lower scores on the scales of physical endurance, tempo, plasticity, and self-satisfaction, in comparison to healthy controls; the psychotic group aged 5-11 had also lower scores on the impulsivity scale, whereas the psychotic group 12-17 had lower scores on the social endurance and social tempo scales and higher neuroticism. (2) Teens with mood disorders had lower scores on the self-confidence-satisfaction scale and higher scores on the impulsivity scale, in comparison to controls. (3) No difference between IVF and naturally conceived children were found. The results show the benefits of using the FET framework for structuring the correspondence between psychiatric disorders and temperament as it differentiates between social versus physical aspects of behaviour and orientational versus executive aspects.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of proteomics,"Isotopic N,N-dimethyl leucine tags for absolute quantification of clusterin and apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. In the past decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to biomarker discovery for early diagnosis and treatment of AD. Herein, this study aims to quantify clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in blood samples from AD patients and evaluate these two proteins as potential biomarkers in AD diagnosis. In-house synthesized 5-plex isotopic N,N-dimethyl leucine (iDiLeu) tags were used to label target peptide standards at different concentrations to construct standard curves. Our study revealed that the levels of CLU and APOE exhibited clear differences in male vs. female AD groups but not in male vs. female non-AD groups. In contrast, the levels of serum CLU and APOE did not show statistically significant differences in the AD groups and non-AD groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) with CLU and APOE showed some separation between the AD and non-AD participants. Significance: Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for sex-related pathways, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: As blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis are cost-effective and introduce less invasiveness, discovery and validation of biomarkers in the blood samples of AD patients have become a hot topic in Alzheimer's and dementia research. Thus far, amyloid β (Aβ), total-tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in blood show great accuracy and specificity in diagnosis of AD. However, the underlying mechanism of AD pathology remains to be elusive and complex. Besides these well studied proteins, many other proteins, such as clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) have also been found to be related to AD development. It has been implicated that these two proteins are involved in Aβ clearance and deposition. In this study, we measure the absolute concentrations of these two proteins in blood and shed some light on the potential roles of CLU and APOE in AD pathology. Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for specific pathways between different genders, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD.",Remaining,0,0
Journal of rehabilitation medicine,How to interpret normal electromyographic findings in patients with an alleged history of polio.,"In some patients with a history of polio, the electromyography is normal, not showing the typical neurogenic signs. The aim of this study was to explain the normal findings in electromyography, especially in paralytic polio.	Retrospective study.	Concentric needle electromyography, macro electromyography (including single fibre electromyography) and neurography were performed in various combinations in 688 patients with an alleged history of polio.	Thirty-five patients with paralytic polio had normal or minimally abnormal neurophysiology. In 6 patients the diagnosis of polio was rejected and was instead found to be other diagnoses. Three patients had a very atypical history. Of the 26 with possible paralytic polio, 17 showed a strong suspicion of previous paralytic polio without any neurophysiological signs of degeneration of the anterior horn cells.	If neurophysiological findings are normal in patients with a history of polio, the original diagnosis may be incorrect. However, the absence of electromyography changes does not entirely exclude a previous history of polio with transient functional loss without degeneration of anterior horn cells vulnerable for later functional impairment.",Remaining,0,0
European journal of preventive cardiology,Burden of carotid artery atherosclerosis in Chinese adults: Implications for future risk of cardiovascular diseases.,"Background Population-based studies of ultrasound measures of carotid atherosclerosis are informative about future risks of cardiovascular disease. Design Cross-sectional studies of carotid artery atherosclerosis in 24,822 Chinese adults from the China Kadoorie Biobank and 2579 Europeans from the UK Biobank. Methods Mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries and presence of carotid artery plaque were examined in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) findings in Chinese (mean age 59 years) were compared with a European population (mean age 62 years). Results Overall, the mean cIMT in Chinese was 0.70 mm (SD 0.16) and increased with age by 0.08 mm (SE 0.008) per 10-years older age. About 31% of the Chinese had carotid plaques and the prevalence varied 10-fold with age (6% at 40-49 to 63% at 70-89 years) and four-fold by region (range, 14%-57%). After adjustment for age, sex and region, plaque prevalence was higher in smokers than in non-smokers (36% vs. 28%) and two-fold higher in individuals with systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg than those with systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg (44% vs. 22%) in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Mean cIMT was similar in the younger Chinese and European adults, but increased more steeply with age in the Chinese (p = 0.002). Conclusions About one-third of Chinese adults had carotid plaques. The rate of progression of carotid atherosclerosis with age was more extreme in the Chinese compared with the European population, highlighting the need for more intensive strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention in China.",Remaining,0,0
Psychiatry research,Electronic gaming machines and gambling disorder: A cross-cultural comparison between treatment-seeking subjects from Brazil and the United States.,"The objective of this paper is to perform a cross-cultural comparison of gambling disorder (GD) due to electronic gaming machines (EGM), a form of gambling that may have a high addictive potential. Our goal is to investigate two treatment-seeking samples of adults collected in Brazil and the United States, countries with different socio-cultural backgrounds. This comparison may lead to a better understanding of cultural influences on GD.	The total studied sample involved 733 treatment-seeking subjects: 353 men and 380 women (average age=45.80, standard deviation ±10.9). The Brazilian sample had 517 individuals and the American sample 216. Subjects were recruited by analogous strategies.	We found that the Brazilian sample was younger, predominantly male, less likely to be Caucasian, more likely to be partnered, tended to have a faster progression from recreational gambling to GD, and were more likely to endorse chasing losses.	This study demonstrated that there are significant differences between treatment-seeking samples of adults presenting GD due to EGM in Brazil and in the United States.

After being translated into Spanish, the scale was applied to a sample of 80 patients. All had a history of auditory hallucinations, 71 with Schizophrenia and 9 with schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Demographic and clinical data were collected by a semi-structured interview, tape recording the sessions for every patient. For the reliability study, 27 patients of the sample were evaluated independently by the first four auhors of this paper. For the study of concurrent validity the results of this scale were compared with those of the Krawiecka scale in 60 patients of the sample.	In the Spanish version, the 11 items were conserved with slight modifications in two of them. The scale showed high reliability with coefficients in the 11 items higher than 0.85. The concurrent validity showed high association between the hallucination item of the Krawiecka scale and the PSYRATS. In the factorial analysis four factors that explained 62% of the variance were obtained.	The Spanish version of the PSYRATS (for hallucinations) is, to our knowledge, the first scale adapted to Spanish for the study of auditory hallucinations, showing excellent psychometric properties.",Remaining,0,0
Revue neurologique,[Incidence of constipation after recent vascular hemiplegia: a prospective cohort of 152 patients].,Constipation is a major problem for institutionalized patients. This prospective study was performed on a population of 152 in-patients of a stroke rehabilitation center. Constipation was defined as less than three stools weekly or the use of laxative medication. Constipation occurred in sixty percent of the patients. The incidence of constipation was not related to age or sex but was strongly related to functional status of patients assessed by Barthel Index (p<0.003). The influence of both brain lesion or reduce activity is evaluated.,Remaining,0,0
Psychological reports,The Patient Satisfaction Interview for partial hospitalization programs.,"The Patient Satisfaction Interview was developed to assess consumers' satisfaction with four dimensions of partial hospitalization programs: the physical environment, the therapists, the treatment strategies, and the preparation for community autonomy. Content validity of the measure was examined and cross-validated by independent samples of expert raters and patients. The measure was then administered to 30 patients participating in a six-month partial hospitalization program. Analyses showed test dimensions had good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Six-month stability was good for three of the four scales as well as the over-all test score. Research using the test must examine its utility for description of satisfaction with community-based programs.",Remaining,0,0
American journal of public health,A 6-year follow-up of behavior and activity disorders in the Taiwan Yu-cheng children.,"The relationship of behavior and activity levels to the interval between outbreak and year of birth and to age of children is explored in Taiwanese children exposed in utero to heat-degraded polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)--the Yu-cheng children. Additionally, the relationship of the scores to chemical, physical, and cognitive findings is described.	With Rutter's Child Behavior Scale A and a modified Werry-Weiss-Peters Activity Scale, 118 Yu-chen children and matched controls were followed biannually from 1985 to 1991.	At each year, the Yu-cheng children scored 7% to 43% worse (mean = 23%) than control children on the Rutter scale. At any fixed age, the Yu-cheng children scored 11% to 63% (mean = 28%) worse. The effect for children born later did not differ from that for those born earlier; neither was there any improvement as the children aged. A similar but weaker picture was seen for the activity score. These behavioral findings were not related to physical or cognitive findings or to serum PCB levels.	In utero exposure to heat-degraded PCBs appears to cause mildly disordered behavior and increased activity level; the effect persists over time and is similar in children born up to 6 years after the mothers were exposed.",Remaining,0,0
European journal of internal medicine,Blood cultures in the evaluation of uncomplicated cellulitis.,"The frequency of bacteremia and the array of microorganisms involved in cellulitis vary greatly among studies. Although current guidelines do not recommend routine blood culture in uncomplicated cellulitis, their implementation in clinical practice remains challenging. We therefore aimed to assess the frequency, determinants and microbiology of bacteremia in hospitalized patients with uncomplicated cellulitis.	We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all adult patients admitted at a primary-care hospital with a diagnosis of community-acquired uncomplicated cellulitis during a 4-year period. We looked at the factors associated with blood cultures sampling and at the incidence, determinants and microbiology of bacteremia in this population.	Among the 476 patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of cellulitis, 250 (52.5%) had blood cultures. Fever, high C-reactive protein and lymphatic insufficiency were significantly associated with the sampling of blood cultures. Twelve (4.8%) patients had bacteremia. Alcoholism and duration of hospitalization were associated with bacteremia in multivariate analysis. Among the 12 patients with bacteremia, 9 had Streptococcus sp. and 3 had Staphylococcus aureus infection.	In our study population with uncomplicated cellulitis, representative of unselected population admitted at primary-care hospitals, bacteremia was uncommon and not associated with discriminant patient characteristics, except for alcohol abuse. Episodes of bacteremia were exclusively due to gram-positive cocci susceptible to co-amoxicilin, a common first-line empirical therapy. In accordance with existing guidelines, we do not recommend to collect blood for cultures in uncomplicated cellulitis. Clinicians' awareness of guidelines and of the poor yield of blood cultures could reduce useless investigation.",Remaining,0,0
Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,Reduction of Computed Tomography Use for Pediatric Closed Head Injury Evaluation at a Nonpediatric Community Emergency Department.,"The purpose of this study was to determine if implementation of a Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN)-based Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool could safely decrease computed tomography (CT) use for pediatric head injury evaluation at a nonpediatric community emergency department (ED).	A quality improvement project was initiated at a nonpediatric community ED to implement an institution-specific, PECARN-based Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool. Baseline head CT use at the participating ED was determined for children with closed head injury through retrospective chart review from March 2014 through November 2015. Head injury patients were identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes for head injury, unspecified (959.01) and concussion with and without loss of consciousness (850-850.9) until October 2015, after which ICD-9 was no longer used. To identify eligible patients after October 2015, lists of all pediatric patients evaluated at the participating ED were reviewed, and patients were included in the analysis if they had a physician-assigned discharge diagnosis of head injury or concussion. Exclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, penetrating head trauma, history of brain tumor, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, bleeding disorder, or presentation > 24 hours postinjury. Medical history, injury mechanism, symptoms, head CT use, and disposition were recorded. Implementation of the Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool was achieved through provider education sessions beginning in December 2015 and ending in August 2016. Head CT use was monitored for 12 months postimplementation, from September 2016 through August 2017. Patients were classified into low, intermediate, or high risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) by chart review. ED length of stay (LOS), disposition, and ED returns within 72 hours were recorded. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables, using Kruskal-Wallis test.	A total of 252 children with closed head injury were evaluated preimplementation (March 2014 through November 2015), 132 children were evaluated during implementation (December 2015 through August 2016), and 172 children were evaluated postimplementation (September 2016 through August 2017). Overall CT use decreased from 37.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 31.7-43.7) preimplementation to 16.9% (95% CI = 11.3-22.5) postimplementation (p < 0.001). Only 1% (95% CI = 0%-2.9%) of low-risk patients received a head CT postimplementation compared to 22.6% (95% CI = 16.1%-29.1%) preimplementation (p < 0.001). CT use among patients ≥ 24 months decreased from 42.9% (95% CI = 36.5%-49.6%) to 19.6% (95% CI = 13.1%-26.1%; p < 0.001) and remained low and unchanged for patients < 24 months. Transfers to a pediatric trauma center and ED returns within 72 hours were unchanged, while median ED LOS improved from 1.5 to 1.3 hours (p = 0.03). There were no missed ciTBIs after implementation of the guideline.	Implementation of the PECARN-based Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool reduced head CT use in a nonpediatric ED. The greatest impact was seen among children aged ≥ 24 months at very low risk for ciTBI.",Remaining,0,0

Three subjects (all women; 37, 31, and 32 years of age) developed childhood or late onset chronic focal encephalitis, with a relatively nonprogressive form of the disorder.	In our patients, clinical features were dominated by partial seizures without marked focal motor deficit and in two with choreo-dystonic movements. The diagnosis of RE was supported by histologic examination and anatomic and functional MRI.	These cases extend the phenotypic presentations of Rasmussen encephalitis and confirm Theodore Rasmussen's suggestion that there may be mild and nonprogressive forms of the disease.",Remaining,0,0
The Permanente journal,Patient Preferences for Discussing Childhood Trauma in Primary Care.,"Exposure to traumatic events is common in primary care patients, yet health care professionals may be hesitant to assess and address the impact of childhood trauma in their patients.	To assess patient preferences for discussing traumatic experiences and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with clinicians in underserved, predominantly Latino primary care patients.	Cross-sectional study.	We evaluated patients with a questionnaire assessing comfort to discuss trauma exposure and symptoms using the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study questionnaire and the Primary Care-PTSD screen. The questionnaire also assessed patients' confidence in their clinicians' ability to help with trauma-related issues. Surveys were collected at an integrated medical and behavioral health care clinic.	Of 178 adult patients asked, 152 (83%) agreed to participate. Among participants, 37% screened positive for PTSD, 42% reported 4 or more ACEs, and 26% had elevated scores on both measures. Primary Care-PTSD and ACE scores were strongly positively correlated (r = 0.57, p < 0.001). Most patients agreed they were comfortable being asked about trauma directly or through screening questionnaires and did not oppose the inclusion of trauma-related information in their medical record. In addition, most patients perceived their clinician as comfortable asking questions about childhood trauma and able to address trauma-related problems.	Screening is acceptable to most primary care patients regardless of trauma exposure or positive PTSD screening. Findings may aid primary care clinicians to consider screening regularly for ACEs and PTSD to better serve the health care needs of trauma-exposed patients.",Remaining,0,0
Lung,Chronic sleep complaints in premenopausal women and their association with sleep-disordered breathing.,"In clinical practice, we have found that premenopausal women have delayed diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).	During a 4-year period, we systematically collected the clinical and polysomnographic variables for all women referred for sleep complaints using preestablished questionnaires, scales, clinical grid, polygraphic montage, and scoring criteria. The variables collected on premenopausal SDB women were analyzed and compared to those of postmenopausal women within 5 years of menopause.	Of 977 women, 316 were premenopausal with SDB. Complaints of chronic insomnia and sleepwalking were the most common reasons for referral, had been present for a mean of 6.4 +/- 5.4 years, and had lead to unsuccessful symptomatic treatment. The normal-weight premenopausal SDB group had anatomically small upper airways, while those with body mass index (BMI) >/= 25 kg/m(2) complained more frequently of snoring and daytime sleepiness and their clinical presentation was closer to those of the postmenopausal SDB comparison group. Premenopausal women often had a low apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), but there was a discrepancy between the low AHI and the amount of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) needed to control the SDB, and there was a need for higher pressures in overweight premenopausal SDB women (mean 9.1 +/- 1.9 and 10.1 +/- 2.6 cmH(2)O).	Normal-weight premenopausal SDB women often present with atypical sleep complaints of chronic insomnia and parasomnias. Clinical attention paid to craniofacial features and use of specific scales such as Mallampati help with the suspicion of the presence of SDB, and a low AHI is unrelated to the positive clinical impact of nasal CPAP treatment.",Remaining,0,0
PLoS medicine,Association of coincident self-reported mental health problems and alcohol intake with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality: A Norwegian pooled population analysis.,"The disease burden attributable to mental health problems and to excess or harmful alcohol use is considerable. Despite a strong relationship between these 2 important factors in population health, there are few studies quantifying the mortality risk associated with their co-occurrence in the general population. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality according to self-reported mental health problems and alcohol intake in the general population.	We followed 243,372 participants in Norwegian health surveys (1994-2002) through 2014 for all-cause and CVD mortality by data linkage to national registries. The mean (SD) age at the time of participation in the survey was 43.9 (10.6) years, and 47.8% were men. During a mean (SD) follow-up period of 16.7 (3.2) years, 6,587 participants died from CVD, and 21,376 died from all causes. Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs according to a mental health index (low, 1.00-1.50; high, 2.01-4.00; low score is favourable) based on the General Health Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and according to self-reported alcohol intake (low, <2; light, 2-11.99; moderate, 12-23.99; high, ≥24 grams/day). HRs were adjusted for age, sex, educational level, marital status, and CVD risk factors. Compared to a reference group with low mental health index score and low alcohol intake, HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality were 0.93 (0.89, 0.97; p = 0.001), 1.00 (0.92, 1.09; p = 0.926), and 1.14 (0.96, 1.35; p = 0.119) for low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. HRs (95% CIs) were 1.22 (1.14, 1.31; p < 0.001), 1.24 (1.15, 1.33; p < 0.001), 1.43 (1.23, 1.66; p < 0.001), and 2.29 (1.87, 2.80; p < 0.001) for high index score combined with low, light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. For CVD mortality, HRs (95% CIs) were 0.93 (0.86, 1.00; p = 0.058), 0.90 (0.76, 1.07; p = 0.225), and 0.95 (0.67, 1.33; p = 0.760) for a low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively, and 1.11 (0.98, 1.25; p = 0.102), 0.97 (0.83, 1.13; p = 0.689), 1.01 (0.71, 1.44; p = 0.956), and 1.78 (1.14, 2.78; p = 0.011) for high index score combined with low, light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. HRs for the combination of a high index score and high alcohol intake (HRs: 2.29 for all-cause and 1.78 for CVD mortality) were 64% (95% CI 53%, 74%; p < 0.001) and 69% (95% CI 42%, 97%; p < 0.001) higher than expected for all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, respectively, under the assumption of a multiplicative interaction structure. A limitation of our study is that the findings were based on average reported intake of alcohol without accounting for the drinking pattern.	In the general population, the mortality rates associated with more mental health problems and a high alcohol intake were increased when the risk factors occurred together.",Remaining,0,0
The International journal of neuroscience,Another look at VIQ-PIQ scores and unilateral brain damage.,"The relationship of WAIS, VIQ, PIQ and Aphasia Screening scores to unilateral brain damage was investigated using 18 subjects with left hemisphere damage (LHD) and 19 subjects with right hemisphere damage (RHD). Expected VIQ-PIQ difference scores were demonstrated only for the RHD subjects. Aphasia was significantly associated with PIQ in the LHD group. ANCOVAR using Aphasia Screening as a covariate produced significant LHD versus RHD differences on PIQ. These data question the utility of VIQ-PIQ difference scores in the diagnosis of unilateral brain damage. Second, the data suggest that LHD 'non-verbal' deficits are the result of underlying language disturbance and not the consequence of impaired visuoperceptive or visuospatial processes.",Remaining,0,0

All had a history of childhood trauma: Sexual abuse (73%), physical abuse (73%), and emotional abuse (82%). Seventy-three percent had a parent with a diagnosable dissociative disorder; 36% of the mothers had MPD. These adolescents had a mean number of 24.1 alter personalities and appear to have become multiple at a mean age of 3 years, 1 month.

Early jaundice was the first manifestation in both cases and was followed by cachexia and a rapidly fatal outcome. Neurologic involvement was obvious in both patients. Biologic phenotype was consistent with a diagnosis of type C sphingomyelinase, although clinical expression was different. These two cases should be classified within the infantile and early forms of Niemann-Pick disease type C. Antenatal diagnosis was performed during a third pregnancy.

Human brain mapping,In-vivo measurements of human brain tissue conductivity using focal electrical current injection through intracerebral multicontact electrodes.,"In-vivo measurements of human brain tissue conductivity at body temperature were conducted using focal electrical currents injected through intracerebral multicontact electrodes. A total of 1,421 measurements in 15 epileptic patients (age: 28 ± 10) using a radiofrequency generator (50 kHz current injection) were analyzed. Each contact pair was classified as being from healthy (gray matter, n = 696; white matter, n = 530) or pathological (epileptogenic zone, n = 195) tissue using neuroimaging analysis of the local tissue environment and intracerebral EEG recordings. Brain tissue conductivities were obtained using numerical simulations based on conductivity estimates that accounted for the current flow in the local brain volume around the contact pairs (a cube with a side length of 13 mm). Conductivity values were 0.26 S/m for gray matter and 0.17 S/m for white matter. Healthy gray and white matter had statistically different median impedances (P < 0.0001). White matter conductivity was found to be homogeneous as normality tests did not find evidence of multiple subgroups. Gray matter had lower conductivity in healthy tissue than in the epileptogenic zone (0.26 vs. 0.29 S/m; P = 0.012), even when the epileptogenic zone was not visible in the magnetic resonance image (MRI) (P = 0.005). The present in-vivo conductivity values could serve to create more accurate volume conduction models and could help to refine the identification of relevant intracerebral contacts, especially when located within the epileptogenic zone of an MRI-invisible lesion.

Psychiatry research,The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the treated incidence of psychotic disorders in South London.,"Evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychotic disorders is so far scarce. We conducted an incidence study to ascertain rates of first-episode psychosis (FEP) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in South London. We screened clinical records of individuals living in the London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth who were referred to the early intervention services before (from 1/3/2019 to 28/2/2020) and during (from 1/3/2020 to 28/2/2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the Office for National Statistics to determine the population at risk. We computed crude and sex-age standardised FEP incidence per 100,000 person-years. We used Poisson regression to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) across the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 321 incident cases of FEP were identified during the COVID-19 pandemic, accounting for a crude rate of 69.8 (95% CI 62.1-77.4) per 100,000 person-years. The crude rate for the year before was 47.5 (95% CI 41.2-53.8). The incidence variation between the two years accounted for an adjusted IRR of 1.45 (95% CI 1.22-1.72). The pandemic was accompanied by a 45% spike in the rates of first-episode psychosis.

American journal of medical genetics,Cognitive profiles of the carrier fragile X woman.,"Cognitive deficits in females with fragile X [fra(X)] syndrome have been reported, but studies have rarely focused on women with normal intelligence, nor have they separated fra(X)-negative carriers from fra(X)-positive carriers. Questions specifically addressed here are: 1) is the degree of fragility predictive of IQ? 2) are cognitive patterns consistent across fragility levels? and 3) do consistent individual profiles exist? These questions were addressed with the help of 74 heterozygous women, 38 of whom were fra(X)-negative carriers. All women completed the WAIS-R, and full-scale IQ was normally distributed (mean = 99.65). A strong inverse relationship between IQ and fragility levels was found. Also, the group of fra(X)-positive women had a significantly different subtest pattern from that of the fra(X)-negative women. However, when results were analyzed individually, no consistent patterns emerged. The cognitive performance of fra(X)-negative carriers has probably been underestimated due to the lack of differentiation between positive and negative carrier females in previous studies. These women appear to be cognitively unimpaired and should be considered separately from fra(X)-positive women. Since consistent WAIS-R patterns are not observable on an individual basis, their use as a diagnostic/predictive tool appears to be inappropriate.",Remaining,0,0
Family practice research journal,"Sleep, psychological distress, and somatic symptoms in perimenopausal women.","Self-report and somnographic data from 135 volunteer, disease-free, women (37-59 years) were used to determine the prevalence of perceived poor sleep and to compare women with and without 'poor' sleep on menopausal status, somnographic sleep, psychological distress, and somatic symptom cluster frequencies.	Data from identical measures done on two groups of perimenopausal-age women, one recruited for menopausal age and the other for same age but sleep problems plus controls, were tested using a two-way analysis of variance for the main effects of recruitment group and the presence or absence of 'poor' sleep as well as the joint effects of both.	'Poor' sleep was reported by more than one-third of the women, but menopausal status and perceived sleep quality were not statistically related. Women with 'poor' sleep took longer to fall asleep, spent longer in bed, and had higher scores for psychological distress and for four out of five somatic symptom clusters (p < or = 0.03), compared to women with 'good' sleep.	In sum, midlife women reporting poor sleep are likely to have trouble falling asleep and to have higher psychological distress and somatic symptoms, especially musculoskeletal discomfort and fatigue, coinciding with their perceived poor sleep.",Remaining,0,0
"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",Genetic variation in FADS genes is associated with maternal long-chain PUFA status but not with cognitive development of infants in a high fish-eating observational study.,"Long-chain n-6 and n-3 PUFA (LC-PUFA), arachidonic acid (AA) (20:4n-6) and DHA (22:6n-3), are critical for optimal brain development. These fatty acids can be consumed directly from the diet, or synthesized endogenously from precursor PUFA by Δ-5 (encoded by FADS1) and Δ-6 desaturases (encoded by FADS2). The aim of this study was to determine the potential importance of maternal genetic variability in FADS1 and FADS2 genes to maternal LC-PUFA status and infant neurodevelopment in populations with high fish intakes. The Nutrition Cohorts 1 (NC1) and 2 (NC2) are longitudinal observational mother-child cohorts in the Republic of Seychelles. Maternal serum LC-PUFA was measured at 28 weeks gestation and genotyping for rs174537 (FADS1), rs174561 (FADS1), rs3834458 (FADS1-FADS2) and rs174575 (FADS2) was performed in both cohorts. The children completed the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II) at 30 months in NC1 and at 20 months in NC2. Complete data were available for 221 and 1310 mothers from NC1 and NC2 respectively. With increasing number of rs3834458 minor alleles, maternal concentrations of AA were significantly decreased (NC1 p=0.004; NC2 p<0.001) and precursor:product ratios for linoleic acid (LA) (18:2n-6)-to-AA (NC1 p<0.001; NC2 p<0.001) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) (18:3n-3)-to-DHA were increased (NC2 p=0.028). There were no significant associations between maternal FADS genotype and BSID-II scores in either cohort. A trend for improved PDI was found among infants born to mothers with the minor rs3834458 allele.In these high fish-eating cohorts, genetic variability in FADS genes was associated with maternal AA status measured in serum and a subtle association of the FADS genotype was found with neurodevelopment.",Remaining,0,0
Molecular neurobiology,Systemic Inflammation and Multimodal Biomarkers in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"There is increasing evidence suggesting that one of the most relevant pathophysiological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuroinflammation, which plays an important role in the production and regulation of AD-related proteins (amyloid beta (Aβ) and Tau) and exacerbates AD pathology. Neuroinflammation can also be induced by systemic influences (factors from outside the central nervous system). However, the role of systemic inflammation in AD pathophysiology is much less understood. Thus, our main objective in this study was to verify whether the presence of serum cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α) affects different AD biomarkers: Aβ1-42 and Tau protein levels, hippocampal volumes (HV), and default mode network functional connectivity (DMN FC) in healthy elderly controls, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients due to AD, and mild AD patients. To accomplish this, we acquired 3-T MRI, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 42 healthy controls, 55 aMCI patients due to AD, and 33 mild AD patients. Comparing the groups, we found that the mild AD patients presented smaller HV, disrupted DMN FC, and proportionally less IL-1β than the controls. The aMCI patients only differed from the controls in DMN FC. In intra-group comparison, aMCI and mild AD with detectable levels of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-12) had decreased DMN FC. On the other hand, patients with detectable levels of IL-10 and IL-12 presented a more favorable AD biomarkers profile (larger HV, more CSF Aβ1-42, and less p-Tau), indicating a possible protective role of these ILs. Our findings indicate a possible relationship between systemic inflammation with DMN FC disruption, hippocampal atrophy, and CSF protein levels in the subjects with mild AD and aMCI.",Remaining,0,0

Descriptive study of use and prescription of cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine in 2011 according to 2 databases: Farm@drid (pharmacy billing records for the Region of Madrid) and BIFAP (database for pharmacoepidemiology research in primary care, with diagnosis and prescription records). We tested the comparability of drug use results from each database using the chi-square test and prevalence ratios. The prevalence of dementia in Madrid was estimated based on the dose per 100 inhabitants/day, adjusting the result for data obtained from BIFAP on combination treatment in the general population (0.37%) and the percentage of dementia patients undergoing treatment (41.13%).	Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine were taken by 2.08% and 0.72% of Madrid residents aged 65 and older was respectively. Both databases displayed similar results for use of these drugs. The estimated prevalence of dementia in individuals aged 65 and older is 5.91% (95% CI%, 5.85-5.95) (52 287 people), and it is higher in women (7.16%) than in men (4.00%).

A representative sample of clubhouses more than three years old that were based on the Fountain House model participated in a 1998 mail survey. To verify that ICCD certification is a valid indicator of program quality for use in setting benchmark performance rates, 71 certified and 48 noncertified programs were compared on a variety of organizational variables.	Even though certified and noncertified clubhouses were similar in organizational structure and resources, findings from a logistic regression analysis confirmed that certified clubhouses provided a wider array of rehabilitation services and achieved higher rates of employment.	The findings suggest that ICCD certification is a valid indicator of program quality. The ICCD has therefore proposed that the average performance of certified U.S. clubhouses in specific domains be adopted as benchmarks for organizational performance. When tailored for programs in particular regions and with specific levels of funding, the ICCD benchmarks for clubhouse performance set fair and reasonable expectations for clubhouse programs and for the design of performance contracts between departments of mental health and ICCD clubhouses.",Remaining,0,0
Medicina intensiva,Portable gamma-camera for the diagnosis of brain death diagnosis.,"To evaluate the feasibility of using the Sentinella® portable gamma-camera for the diagnosis of brain death (BD).	A prospective, observational feasibility study was carried out.	Intensive Care Unit of a third level hospital.	Consecutive recording was made of the adults diagnosed with brain death based on clinical criteria following admission to the Intensive Care Unit in the period from January to December 2017.	The procedure was performed at the patient bedside with the intravenous administration of technetium 99 metastable hexamethylpropylene amine oxime. The absence of perfusion in the cerebral hemispheres and brainstem was described as a pattern consistent with BD. The diagnosis was correlated to the transcranial Doppler and / or electroencephalographic findings.	A total of 66.1% of the patients were men with an average age of 60 years [IQR: 51-72]. The most frequent causes resulting in BD were hemorrhagic stroke (48.2%, n=27), followed by traumatic brain injury (30.4%, n=17), ischemic stroke (10.7%, n=6) and post-cardiac arrest anoxic encephalopathy (7.1%, n=4). A clinical diagnosis of BD was made in all cases, and the portable gamma-camera confirmed the diagnosis in 100% of the patients with a pattern characterized by the absence of brain perfusion. In addition, the results were compared with the transcranial Doppler findings in 46 patients, confirming the presence of diastolic reverberation and / or systolic peaks. The electroencephalographic tracing was obtained in 10 cases, with the appearance of electrical silence, due to the absence of an acoustic window in the transcranial Doppler study.	A portable gamma-camera could be a useful and feasible tool for the diagnosis of BD.",Remaining,0,0
International journal of older people nursing,How much do residential aged care staff members know about the nutritional needs of residents?,"Undernutrition, weight loss and dehydration are major clinical issues for people with dementia in residential care, with excessive weight loss contributing to increased risk of frailty, immobility, illness and premature morbidity. This paper discusses a nutritional knowledge and attitudes survey conducted as part of a larger project focused on improving nutritional intake of people with dementia within a residential care facility in Brisbane, Australia.	The specific aims of the survey were to identify (i) knowledge of the nutritional needs of aged care facility residents; (ii) mealtime practices; and (iii) attitudes towards mealtime practices and organisation.	A survey based on those used in other healthcare settings was completed by 76 staff members. The survey included questions about nutritional knowledge, opinions of the food service, frequency of feeding assistance provided and feeding assessment practices.	Nutritional knowledge scores ranged from 1 to 9 of a possible 10, with a mean score of 4.67. While 76% of respondents correctly identified risk factors associated with malnutrition in nursing home residents, only 38% of participants correctly identified the need for increased protein and energy in residents with pressure ulcers, and just 15% exhibited correct knowledge of fluid requirements. Further, while nutritional assessment was considered an important part of practice by 83% of respondents, just 53% indicated that they actually carried out such assessments. Identified barriers to promoting optimal nutrition included insufficient time to observe residents (56%); being unaware of residents' feeding issues (46%); poor knowledge of nutritional assessments (44%); and unappetising appearance of food served (57%).	An important step towards improving health and quality of life for residents of aged care facilities would be to enhance staff nutritional awareness and assessment skills. This should be carried out through increased attention to both preservice curricula and on-the-job training.	The residential facility staff surveyed demonstrated low levels of nutrition knowledge, which reflects findings from the international literature. This has implications for the provision of responsive care to residents of these facilities and should be explored further.",Remaining,0,0

The International journal of social psychiatry,The profile of parasucide repeaters in Kuwait.,"A one-year cohort of 92 parasuicides was followed up at 6 monthly intervals for a period of 2 years since their index parasuicide to study the outcome and evaluate the level of social readjustment. One male patient died of suicide (1.1%) and 18 (19.6%) individuals repeated parasuicide using self-poisoning. The rate of repeated parasuicidal behaviour in this investigation was considerably higher than that reported in comparable studies from developing countries but similar to that from a number of western European cities. The data indicated that the probability of further episodes of parasuicidal behaviour increased in the few months after the index episode. Although the repeaters and non-repeaters were essentially similar in most of their sociodemographic characteristics, the former were a distinctive group in many respects. The factors found to be significantly associated with subsequent parasuicide included self-poisoning by prescribed drugs at the index parasuicide, previous parasuicidal behaviour prior to the index, occupational status of a housewife, past history of depression and/or dependence and precipitating life events in the family environment. Contrary to our hypothesized theory, none of the types of attitudes received by the patients from their family members at the index parasuicide related to outcome. The global level of social readjustment of non-repeaters was about three times higher than that of repeaters of parasuicide. The implications of these findings for future policy making were discussed with respect to prevention of parasuicide.",Remaining,0,0
Schizophrenia bulletin,Reduced red blood cell membrane essential polyunsaturated fatty acids in first episode schizophrenia at neuroleptic-naive baseline.,"There is emerging evidence in schizophrenia of membrane abnormalities, primarily reductions in the essential omega-3 and omega-6 series of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Because previous studies have largely been in chronic patients, it is not known whether these membrane abnormalities also occur early in illness. In the present study, red blood cell membrane fatty acid levels were determined by capillary gas chromatography from 24 neuroleptic-naive patients with first episode schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 31 age-matched normal controls. Relative to normal subjects, patients had significant reductions in total PUFA (-13%) but not in monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids. Specifically, significant reductions were found in arachidonic acid (-18%), docosapentaenoic acid (-36%), and docosahexaenoic acid (-26%) concentrations. These reductions were not related to age, gender, smoking status, or cotinine levels. These results confirm previous findings of membrane deficits in schizophrenia and show that significant PUFA reductions occur early in the illness, prior to initiation of treatment, raising the possibility that these deficits are trait related. The findings also suggest that membrane fatty acid losses are quite specific to the highly unsaturated fatty acids.",Remaining,0,0
Neuroscience letters,Cerebellar pathology in childhood-onset vs. adult-onset essential tremor.,"Although the incidence of ET increases with advancing age, the disease may begin at any age, including childhood. The question arises as to whether childhood-onset ET cases manifest the same sets of pathological changes in the cerebellum as those whose onset is during adult life. We quantified a broad range of postmortem features (Purkinje cell [PC] counts, PC axonal torpedoes, a host of associated axonal changes [PC axonal recurrent collateral count, PC thickened axonal profile count, PC axonal branching count], heterotopic PCs, and basket cell rating) in 60 ET cases (11 childhood-onset and 49 adult-onset) and 30 controls. Compared to controls, childhood-onset ET cases had lower PC counts, higher torpedo counts, higher heterotopic PC counts, higher basket cell plexus rating, and marginally higher PC axonal recurrent collateral counts. The median PC thickened axonal profile count and median PC axonal branching count were two to five times higher in childhood-onset ET than controls, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Childhood-onset and adult-onset ET had similar PC counts, torpedo counts, heterotopic PC counts, basket cell plexus rating, PC axonal recurrent collateral counts, PC thickened axonal profile count and PC axonal branching count. In conclusion, we found that childhood-onset and adult-onset ET shared similar pathological changes in the cerebellum. The data suggest that pathological changes we have observed in the cerebellum in ET are a part of the pathophysiological cascade of events in both forms of the disease and that both groups seem to reach the same pathological endpoints at a similar age of death.",Remaining,0,0
Pediatrics,"Relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance in females with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: report from the Maternal Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study.","To examine the relationship of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotypes to biochemical phenotype and cognitive development in maternal phenylketonuria (PKU).	PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS). A total of 84 different mutations were detected, and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals. Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations, 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity (severe PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). Then, 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications. The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity. These patients are considered functionally hemizygous.	The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level. Cognitive performance (IQ) was also significantly related to genotype. The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96, respectively, whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84, respectively. Of the patients with PKU, 92% had been treated during childhood. Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations. Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for >6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group.	The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances. Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU. The significant relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy.",Remaining,0,0

Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,External Validation of START nomogram to predict 3-Month unfavorable outcome in Chinese acute stroke patients.,"Recently, the NIHSS STroke Scale score, Age, pre-stroke mRS score, onset-to-treatment Time (START nomogram) predicts 3-month functional outcome after intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke patients. However, this model has not yet been an external validation. We aim to validate the performance of START nomogram.	Data were derived from the stroke center of the Nanjing First Hospital (China). Patients who lacked the necessary data to calculate the nomogram and missed 3-month modified Ranking scale scores were excluded. Modified Rankin Scale score more than 2 at 3-month was assessed as an unfavorable outcome. We used areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC-ROC) to quantify the prognostic value. Calibration was assessed by calibration plots and Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness of fit test.	The final cohort included 306 eligible patients. For 3-month unfavorable outcome, the AUC-ROC of the START nomogram was .766 (95%CI: .7013-.8304, P < .0001), suggesting good discrimination in the START nomogram. It also showed good calibration (HL goodness of fit test P = .1261) in the external validation sample.	The START nomogram with good predictive performance is a reliable and simple clinical instrument to predict unfavorable outcome after acute stroke.",Remaining,0,0
Psychiatric genetics,Physical mapping of a glutamate receptor gene in relation to a balanced translocation associated with schizophrenia in a large Scottish family.,"The metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5a (mGluR5a) gene has been localised on the Gene Map of the Human Genome to chromosome 11q, approximately 1 cM from the genetic marker D11S931. D11S931 has been shown to lie close to a translocation breakpoint associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders in a large Scottish family. Because glutamate receptor genes are excellent candidates for psychiatric disorders, we have investigated the physical distance of this gene from the translocation breakpoint on chromosome 11. We have shown that the mGluR5a gene lies at least 850 kb from the breakpoint and, hence, cannot be directly disrupted in translocation carriers. However, a long range position effect of the translocation on this gene, or co-segregation of the translocation with a mutant allele of mGluR5a cannot be ruled out.",Remaining,0,0
Brain topography,Cortical and Subcortical Changes in MEG Activity Reflect Parkinson's Progression over a Period of 7 Years.,"In this study of early functional changes in Parkinson's disease (PD), we aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the development of changes in both cortical and subcortical neurophysiological brain activity, including their association with clinical measures of disease severity. Repeated resting-state MEG recordings and clinical assessments were obtained in the context of a unique longitudinal cohort study over a seven-year period using a multiple longitudinal design. We used linear mixed-models to analyze the relationship between neurophysiological (spectral power and functional connectivity) and clinical data. At baseline, early-stage (drug-naïve) PD patients demonstrated spectral slowing compared to healthy controls in both subcortical and cortical brain regions, most outspoken in the latter. Over time, spectral slowing progressed in strong association with clinical measures of disease progression (cognitive and motor). Global functional connectivity was not different between groups at baseline and hardly changed over time. Therefore, investigation of associations with clinical measures of disease progression were not deemed useful. An analysis of individual connections demonstrated differences between groups at baseline (higher frontal theta, lower parieto-occipital alpha2 band functional connectivity) and over time in PD patients (increase in frontal delta and theta band functional connectivity). Our results suggest that spectral measures are promising candidates in the search for non-invasive markers of both early-stage PD and of the ongoing disease process.",Remaining,0,0

Neurobiology of aging,Increased cholesterol in Abeta-positive nerve terminals from Alzheimer's disease cortex.,"Synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is poorly understood but evidence suggests it is a key pathological event. In order to precisely detect stable synaptic changes, we have developed methods for flow cytometry analysis of synaptosomes prepared from cryopreserved AD samples, and have previously shown that amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulates in surviving presynaptic terminals in AD cortex. In the present experiments we have examined amyloid-containing terminals in more detail, first dual labeling synaptosomes from AD cortex for Abeta and a series of markers, and then using quadrant analysis to compare amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative terminals. Amyloid-positive synaptosomes were larger in size than amyloid-negatives (p<0.007), and significant increases were observed in mean fluorescence for the lipid raft markers cholesterol (27%; p<0.0005) and GM1 ganglioside (24%; p<0.005). SNAP-25 immunofluorescence was increased by 31% (p<0.0001) in amyloid-bearing terminals, consistent with a sprouting response to amyloid accumulation. These results suggest that Abeta accumulation in synaptic terminals may underly dysfunction prior to or independent of extracellular amyloid deposition.",In-vitro-study,8,0
Acta neuropathologica communications,Mass cytometric analysis of the immune cell landscape after traumatic brain injury elucidates the role of complement and complement receptors in neurologic outcomes.,"Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), a neuroinflammatory response can persist for years and contribute to the development of chronic neurological manifestations. Complement plays a central role in post-TBI neuroinflammation, and C3 opsonins and the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) have been implicated in promoting secondary injury. We used single cell mass cytometry to characterize the immune cell landscape of the brain at different time points after TBI. To specifically investigate how complement shapes the post-TBI immune cell landscape, we analyzed TBI brains in the context of CR2-Crry treatment, an inhibitor of C3 activation. We analyzed 13 immune cell types, including peripheral and brain resident cells, and assessed expression of various receptors. TBI modulated the expression of phagocytic and complement receptors on both brain resident and infiltrating peripheral immune cells, and distinct functional clusters were identified within same cell populations that emerge at different phases after TBI. In particular, a CD11c+ (CR4) microglia subpopulation continued to expand over 28 days after injury, and was the only receptor to show continuous increase over time. Complement inhibition affected the abundance of brain resident immune cells in the injured hemisphere and impacted the expression of functional receptors on infiltrating cells. A role for C5a has also been indicated in models of brain injury, and we found significant upregulation of C5aR1 on many immune cell types after TBI. However, we demonstrated experimentally that while C5aR1 is involved in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain after injury, it does not alone affect histological or behavioral outcomes. However, CR2-Crry improved post-TBI outcomes and reduced resident immune cell populations, as well as complement and phagocytic receptor expression, indicating that its neuroprotective effects are mediated upstream of C5a generation, likely via modulating C3 opsonization and complement receptor expression.",In-vitro-study,8,0
Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],[Cerebral lymphatic blockage aggravates apoptosis of hippocampal neurons induced by cerebrospinal fluid from experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"This work was performed to determine the role of cerebral lymphatic drainage pathway in the development of neural injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). SAH and cerebral lymphatic blockage (CLB) models in adult New Zealand rabbits were used. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from experimental animals 5 d after modeling and was added into cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The neurons were randomly divided into blank control, normal CSF, SAH, and SAH+CLB groups. At different points of time, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was detected by colorimetric method. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of neurons. Expressions of Bax and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) were determined by immunohistochemical staining. LDH leakage detection revealed that, compared with blank control group, CSF from normal rabbit did not damage the neurons, whereas the leakage of LDH increased in SAH group and SAH+CLB group. The increasing effect was more obvious in SAH+CLB group than that in SAH group. Normal CSF did not induce the apoptosis of neurons, whereas neuron apoptosis was found in SAH group and the apoptosis was even more severe in SAH+CLB group. Bax and Hsp70 protein expressions were found in both SAH and SAH+CLB groups. Expression of Bax protein in SAH+CLB group was stronger than that in SAH group in a time-dependent manner. At 0.5 h and 1 h, the expression of Hsp70 protein in SAH+CLB group was stronger than that in SAH group, whereas the expression became weaker at 2 h and 4 h. These results suggest that blockage of cerebral lymphatic drainage pathway deteriorates the damage of neurons treated with CSF from SAH, indicating this pathway may act as an endogenous protective role in SAH.",In-vitro-study,8,0
Neurobiology of aging,Interferon-gamma-dependent cytotoxic activation of human astrocytes and astrocytoma cells.,"Astrocytes and microglia become activated in a broad spectrum of inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases. Activated microglia are widely believed to be the principal source of inflammation-induced neuronal degeneration in these disorders. To investigate the neurotoxic potential of human astrocytes, we exposed them and human astrocytic U-373 MG cells to a variety of inflammatory stimulants. We then assessed the effects of their supernatants on human SH-SY5 cells. When astrocytes and U-373 MG cells were stimulated with interferon (IFN)-gamma (150U/ml), their supernatants significantly reduced SH-SY5Y cell viability. Other powerful inflammatory stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide (0.5mug/ml), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (10ng/ml) and interleukin-1beta (10ng/ml), alone or in combination, were without effect. These combinations were also unable to enhance the IFN-gamma effect. The induced cytotoxicities were reversed by JAK inhibitor I, a potent and specific inhibitor of JAKs. This result indicates that the neurotoxic effect was proceeding through the IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR)-JAK-STAT intracellular pathway. To establish that the IFNGR is expressed on both cultured astrocytes and U-373 MG cells, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA extracts to identify a specific IFNGR product. We showed the protein product on these cultured cells by immunocytochemistry using an antibody to IFNGR. Finally, using human postmortem material, we showed sharp upregulation of the IFNGR on activated astrocytes in affected areas in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. These findings suggest that activated astrocytes may become neurotoxic when stimulated by IFN-gamma and may therefore exacerbate the pathology in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases.",In-vitro-study,8,0
Oncology research,"Overexpression of Protease Serine 8 Inhibits Glioma Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion via Suppressing the Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathway.","Protease serine 8 (PRSS8), a serine peptidase, has a widespread expression in normal epidermal cells. Recently, many researchers demonstrated downregulation of PRSS8 in cancer tissues as well as its tumor suppressor role in cancer development. However, the biological functions of PRSS8 in glioma remain unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated a decreased expression of PRSS8 in glioma tissues and cell lines. PRSS8 upregulation inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, xenograft experiments showed that PRSS8 overexpression suppressed glioma cell growth in vivo. We also found that upregulated PRSS8 reduced the protein expression levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR in glioma cells. Taken together, our study demonstrated that overexpression of PRSS8 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, PRSS8 may act as a novel therapeutic target for glioma.",In-vitro-study,8,0
Nucleic acids research,Full length RTEL1 is required for the elongation of the single-stranded telomeric overhang by telomerase.,"Telomeres cap the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and distinguish them from broken DNA ends to suppress DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest and genomic instability. Telomeres are elongated by telomerase to compensate for incomplete replication and nuclease degradation and to extend the proliferation potential of germ and stem cells and most cancers. However, telomeres in somatic cells gradually shorten with age, ultimately leading to cellular senescence. Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HHS) is characterized by accelerated telomere shortening and diverse symptoms including bone marrow failure, immunodeficiency, and neurodevelopmental defects. HHS is caused by germline mutations in telomerase subunits, factors essential for its biogenesis and recruitment to telomeres, and in the helicase RTEL1. While diverse phenotypes were associated with RTEL1 deficiency, the telomeric role of RTEL1 affected in HHS is yet unknown. Inducible ectopic expression of wild-type RTEL1 in patient fibroblasts rescued the cells, enabled telomerase-dependent telomere elongation and suppressed the abnormal cellular phenotypes, while silencing its expression resulted in gradual telomere shortening. Our observations reveal an essential role of the RTEL1 C-terminus in facilitating telomerase action at the telomeric 3' overhang. Thus, the common etiology for HHS is the compromised telomerase action, resulting in telomere shortening and reduced lifespan of telomerase positive cells.",In-vitro-study,8,0
American journal of medical genetics,Gaucher disease: functional expression of the normal glucocerebrosidase and Gaucher T1366G and G1604A alleles in Baculovirus-transfected Spodoptera frugiperda cells.,"Gaucher disease is an inherited sphingolipidosis resulting from deficient glucocerebrosidase activity. Three clinical forms of Gaucher disease have been described: type 1 as non-neuronopathic, type 2 as acute neuronopathic, and type 3 as subacute neuronopathic. We recently identified a rare mutation (G-->A at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1604) [Choy et al., 1994a, Am J Med Genet 51:156-160] and a novel mutation (T-->G at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1366) in two type 1 Gaucher patients by sequence analysis of the entire glucocerebrosidase coding region [Choy et al., 1994a, 1994b, Hum Mol Genet 3:821-823]. To demonstrate that these are deleterious and not neutral mutations, we cloned the full-length glucocerebrosidase cDNA of patients and of a normal control in the plasmid vector pAcUW1, recombined the human gene into the Baculovirus genome downstream of its polyhedron p10 promoter, and expressed the inserted gene in cultured cells of Spodoptera frugiperda transfected by recombinant Baculovirus. The levels of residual glucocerebrosidase activity determined in transfected cells with the Gaucher G1604A and T1366G alleles are 6.9% and 2.9% of that expressed by the normal allele (normal = 352.0 nmol/hr/mg protein or 100%). By comparison, the enzyme-specific activity expressed in transfected cells by 2 known Gaucher alleles, A1226G and T1448C, that are prevalent in type 1 and type 2 Gaucher disease are 23.4% and 3.3% of normal. No endogeneous glucocerebrosidase activity was detected in cultured cells transfected by either the wild-type Baculovirus or Baculovirus with the pAcUW1 plasmid vector without the glucocerebrosidase cDNA insert. These findings show that the Baculovirus expression system in cultured Spodoptera frugiperda cells is a suitable system for the functional expression and characterization of the normal and mutant glucocerebrosidase alleles. Moreover, the use of this expression system demonstrates that the G1604A and T1366G mutations are both deleterious mutations resulting in profoundly deficient glucocerebrosidase activity and subsequent Gaucher disease.",In-vitro-study,8,0
The New England journal of medicine,Inhibition of terminal axonal sprouting by serum from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"To investigate the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we compared the effect of serum from patients with this disease on the regenerative sprouting of terminal axons in botulinum-treated mouse gluteus muscle with the effects of serum from controls and from patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Serum from 9 of 19 patients with the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and from 2 of 6 patients with the familial form caused a reduction in the proportion of sprouting terminal axons, as compared with that found in muscles treated with serum from controls or diabetic patients. Immunoglobulin from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, when tested on immunoblots, recognized a 56-kilodalton protein secreted by denervated rat diaphragm muscle; rabbit antiserum raised against this protein also suppressed terminal axonal sprouting. Thus, we have detected an antibody in the serum of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that inhibits sprouting of neurons and subsequent reinnervation of skeletal muscle. Whether this antibody is of primary pathogenic importance or represents a secondary response to neuromuscular destruction is not known. In either case, serum from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may provide reagents for studies of the trophic communications between muscle and motor neurons.",In-vitro-study,8,0
Experimental neurology,Selective neuronal vulnerability and specific glial reactions in hippocampal and neocortical organotypic cultures submitted to ischemia.,"Neurons from cerebral neocortex and hippocampus exhibit a striking difference in vulnerability to transient global ischemia. In order to study the contribution of neuronal connections and neuron-glia interactions to this variation in neuronal vulnerability, we used hippocampal and neocortical cultures submitted to various periods of histotoxic ischemia. Organotypic cultures were exposed at 37 degrees C for 0, 7, 30 and 60 min to a glucose-free NaCN-containing medium. Histological analysis using thionin staining and MAP2 immunostaining showed differences in the temporal profile of neuronal damage in hippocampal and neocortical structures, i.e., in decreasing order, CA1 (7 min) > CA3 and neocortical layers II, III, V, VI (30 min) > DG and neocortical layer IV (60 min). In parallel to the neurodegeneration study, the time course and the regional pattern of microglial and astroglial changes were also examined using GS-B4 isolectin and GFAP as immunohistochemical markers, respectively. The GS-B4 isolectin staining revealed an early (at 7 min for the hippocampus) and a specific microglial activation located in areas undergoing neuronal damage. For both organotypic cultures, astrogliosis occurred later (after 30 min of stress) with no specific regional distribution. Both hippocampal and neocortical cultures submitted to histotoxic ischemia allowed the replication of many of the cellular events observed in response to global ischemia in vivo. These findings support the hypothesis that neuron-neuron connections as well as interactions between neurons and glial cells are essential to reproduce in vitro the selective neuronal vulnerability described in vivo.",In-vitro-study,8,0
Journal of the neurological sciences,Presence of neuronal proteins in serially cultured cells from autopsy human brain.,"Cells that contain the high (NF-H) and medium (NF-M) molecular weight neurofilaments and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) have been cultured from human brain (Brodmann frontal area 9 and hippocampus) obtained at routine autopsy. Three of these cultures (from a 52-year-old man with vascular dementia, a 75-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease, and an 80-year-old normal woman) have been propagated to passage 12-14 and studied in detail. Cellular morphology was pleomorphic and consistent with a relatively low level of differentiation, by both light microscopic and ultrastructural examination. Immunocytochemical reactivity in a characteristic filamentous pattern was observed with monoclonal antibodies to nonphosphorylated epitopes of NF-H and NF-M as well as with redundant antibody probes specific for NF-H and NF-M. Immunoblotting studies confirmed the presence of NF-H and NF-M. Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting also demonstrated the presence of NSE, but not of glial fibrillary acidic protein or other glial markers. Immunocytochemical studies also indicated the presence of proline hydroxylase, an enzyme found in fibroblasts but not neurons. These studies indicate that cells can be cultured from autopsy human brain which are not neurons but nevertheless express molecules used as markers (NF-H, NF-M, and NSE) of adult neurons in vivo and in culture.",In-vitro-study,8,0
Journal of medical Internet research,"Usability of Health Information Websites Designed for Adolescents: Systematic Review, Neurodevelopmental Model, and Design Brief.","Adolescence is a unique developmental period characterized by biological, social, and cognitive changes, as well as an interest in managing one's own health care. Many adolescents use the internet to seek health care information. However, young people face barriers before they can understand and apply the health information that they access on the web. It is essential that usability of adolescent health websites on the internet is improved to help adolescents overcome these barriers and allow them to engage successfully with web-based health care content.	The aim of this review was to synthesize the usability of specific health information websites. These findings were mapped onto the adolescent neurodevelopmental profile, and a design brief based on the findings was developed to tailor future websites for specific adolescent requirements.	A systematic search conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) identified 25 studies that assessed the usability of health information websites. Adolescent feedback was collected by a mixture of surveys, focus groups, interviews, and think-aloud procedures.	A majority of the information websites were developed for specific health issues that may be relevant to adolescents. The most preferred website features were interactive content such as games and quizzes, as well as videos, images, audio clips, and animations. Participants also preferred communicating with other adolescents with similar conditions or learning about their experience through real stories and testimonials. Adolescents found it difficult to use health information websites if they contained too much text, were too cluttered, or had features that made it difficult to access. The findings are considered in the context of adolescent social processes, low tolerance of delayed gratification, and attraction to novelty and mapped onto a neurodevelopmental model of adolescence.	Young people's feedback can determine usability and content that make a health information website easy or informative to use. Neurodevelopmental profiles and the users' specific preferences and skills should be addressed in future development of health information websites for adolescents.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,Electroconvulsive Therapy for Agitation and Aggression in Dementia: A Systematic Review.,"Many patients with dementia develop agitation or aggression in the course of their disease. In some severe cases, behavioral, environmental, and pharmacological interventions are not sufficient to alleviate these potentially life-threatening symptoms. It has been suggested that in those cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) could be an option. This review summarizes the scientific literature on ECT for agitation and aggression in dementia.	We performed a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Two reviewers extracted the following data from the retrieved articles: number of patients and their age, gender, diagnoses, types of problem behavior, treatments tried before ECT, specifications of the ECT treatment, use of rating scales, treatment results, follow-up data, and adverse effects.	The initial search yielded 264 articles, 17 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, one was a prospective cohort study, one was a case-control study, and the others were retrospective chart reviews, case series, or case reports. Clinically significant improvement was observed in the majority (88%) of the 122 patients described, often early in the treatment course. Adverse effects were most commonly mild, transient, or not reported.	The reviewed articles suggest that ECT could be an effective treatment for severe and treatment-refractory agitation and aggression in dementia, with few adverse consequences. Nevertheless, because of the substantial risk of selection bias, the designs of the studies reviewed, and their small number, further prospective studies are needed to substantiate these preliminary positive results.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
BMJ clinical evidence,Bulimia nervosa.,"Up to 1% of young women may have bulimia nervosa, characterised by an intense preoccupation with body weight, uncontrolled binge-eating episodes, and use of extreme measures to counteract the feared effects of overeating. People with bulimia nervosa may be of normal weight, making it difficult to diagnose. After ten years, about half of people with bulimia nervosa will have recovered fully, a third will have made a partial recovery, and 10-20% will still have symptoms.	We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for bulimia nervosa in adults? What are the effects of discontinuing treatment in people with bulimia nervosa in remission? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to June 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).	We found 26 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.	In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy (alone or plus exposure response prevention enhancement); cognitive orientation therapy; dialectical behavioural therapy; discontinuing fluoxetine in people with remission; guided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy; hypnobehavioural therapy; interpersonal psychotherapy; mirtazapine; monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs); motivational enhancement therapy; pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy; pure or unguided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); reboxetine; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); topiramate; tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); and venlafaxine.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume,Thromboprophylaxis in patients with acute spinal injuries: an evidence-based analysis.,"The increased risk for venous thromboembolic events following spinal trauma is well established. The purpose of the present study was to examine the literature in order to determine the optimum thromboprophylaxis regimen for patients with acute spinal injuries with or without spinal cord injury.	EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched from the earliest available date to April 2008 for clinical trials comparing different methods of thromboprophylaxis in adult patients following acute spinal injuries (with or without spinal cord injury). Outcome measures included the prevalences of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treatment-related adverse events.	The search yielded 489 studies, but only twenty-one of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis was significantly lower in patients without spinal cord injury as compared with patients with spinal cord injury (odds ratio = 6.0; 95% confidence interval = 2.9 to 12.7). Patients with an acute spinal cord injury who were receiving oral anticoagulants had significantly fewer episodes of pulmonary embolism (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.01 to 0.63) than those who were not receiving oral anticoagulants (either untreated controls or patients managed with low-molecular-weight heparin). The start of thromboprophylaxis within the first two weeks after the injury resulted in significantly fewer deep-vein-thrombosis events than delayed initiation did (odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1 to 0.4). With regard to heparin-based pharmacoprophylaxis in patients with spinal trauma, low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduced the rates of deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding episodes in comparison with the findings in patients who received unfractionated heparin, with odds ratios of 2.6 (95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 5.6) and 7.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 58.4) for deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding, respectively.	The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis following a spine injury is higher among patients who have a spinal cord injury than among those who do not have a spinal cord injury. Therefore, thromboprophylaxis in these patients should start as early as possible once it is deemed safe in terms of potential bleeding complications. Within this population, low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis, with fewer bleeding complications, than unfractionated heparin is. The use of vitamin K antagonists appeared to be effective for the prevention of pulmonary embolism.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Atypical antidepressants versus imipramine in the treatment of major depression: a meta-analysis.,"Our investigation involved a quantitative literature review technique known as meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of three newer antidepressants and imipramine.	We examined seven major journals in psychiatry from 1980 through 1990, inclusive, and selected those investigations of imipramine, trazodone, bupropion, and fluoxetine that met our minimal criteria for interpretability. These criteria included: (1) the presence of a placebo control, (2) double-blind status, (3) the use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression as a dependent variable measure, (4) the use of nongeriatric adults with a diagnosis of major depression by DSM or RDC standards, and (5) the presence of reported means and standard deviations in the investigation, or sufficient data that allowed such to be computed. Each study of four antidepressants was analyzed for an effect size of the drug investigated. The effect size allows for a determination of the efficacy of a particular drug as compared with placebo, measured in standard deviation units.	The data indicated that all four agents are effective as compared with placebo. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the newer heterocyclic agents are less effective than imipramine, as an ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference between the effect sizes of the four antidepressants.	These data are discussed in terms of characteristics of the various investigations and the need for further research comparing the efficacy of psychopharmacologic agents.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
Autism : the international journal of research and practice,A systematic review of training programs for parents of children with autism spectrum disorders: single subject contributions.,"The purpose of this systematic review was to examine research utilizing single subject research designs (SSRD) to explore the effectiveness of interventions designed to increase parents' ability to support communication and social development in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).	Included studies were systematically assessed for methodological quality (Logan et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2007) and intervention effects. Data examining participant characteristics, study methodology, outcomes, and analysis were systematically extracted.	Eleven SSRD parent-training intervention studies examining 44 participants with ASD were included. Overall, the studies were of moderate quality and reported increases in parent skills and child language and communication outcomes.	The results supported by improvement rate difference (IRD) analysis indicated several interventions demonstrated positive effects for both parent and child outcomes. However, limited generalization and follow-up data suggested only one intervention demonstrated parents' accurate and ongoing intervention implementation beyond training.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Dan Shen agents for acute ischaemic stroke.,"Based mainly on experimental data which indicates improvement to the cerebral microcirculation, Dan Shen, a form of herbal medicine, is widely used in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in China. We aimed to assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials of their effects.	To review the randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of Dan Shen agents for acute ischaemic stroke. The primary objective was to determine whether Dan Shen agents improve functional outcome without causing undue harm in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of Dan Shen agents on impairment and on quality of life.	We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched September 2003), the register of the Cochrane Complementary Field (last searched September 2003) and the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (last searched September 2003). In addition we searched the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2002), MEDLINE (1996 to December 2002), EMBASE (1980 to December 2002), CINAHL (1982 to December 2002), AMED (1985 to December 2002) and China Biological Medicine Database (CBM-disc 1979 to December 2002). We handsearched 10 Chinese journals, searched clinical trials and research databases, scanned reference lists and contacted the pharmaceutical company manufacturing Dan Shen.	Randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing Dan Shen agents with placebo or open control (no placebo) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.	Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.	Eight potentially eligible trials were identified, of which three trials (304 patients) were included. Two trials were excluded and three trials are awaiting assessment. Numbers of deaths and dependent patients at the end of follow-up of at least three months were not reported in the three included trials. Only one trial reported adverse events. Three trials measured the outcome 'significant improvement in neurological deficit at the end of treatment'. Compound Dan Shen agents were associated with a significant increase in the number of patients with the outcome (Peto Odds Ratio (OR) 2.72, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.10 to 6.72). No deaths were reported within the first two weeks of treatment or during the whole follow-up period (21 to 28 days). The trials did not include any assessment of quality of life.	There were too few patients and outcome events to draw reliable conclusions from the present data. The methodological qualities of all included studies were poor. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials should be performed.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Massage and touch for dementia.,"Massage and touch have been suggested as a non-pharmacological alternative or supplement to other treatments offered in order to reduce or manage a range of conditions associated with dementia such as anxiety, agitated behaviour and depression. It has also been suggested that massage and touch may counteract cognitive decline.	To assess the effects of a range of massage and touch therapies on conditions associated with dementia, such as anxiety, agitated behaviour and depression, identify any adverse effects, and provide recommendations about future trials.	We identified trials from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 12 July 2005 using the terms massage, reflexology, touch and shiatsu. This Register contains records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. In addition, general and specific literature databases were searched and patient and therapist organizations contacted.	Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which a massage or touch intervention was given to persons suffering from dementia of any type, compared with other treatments or no treatment, and in which effect parameters included measures of behavioural problems, caregiver burden, emotional distress or cognitive abilities, were eligible for inclusion. Furthermore, we employed a set of minimal methodological quality criteria as a selection filter.	We identified 34 references in the initial searches. Of these, seven were actual or possible RCTs, but only two were found to meet the requirements of the set of minimal methodological criteria.	The very limited amount of reliable evidence available is in favour of massage and touch interventions for problems associated with dementia. However, this evidence addresses only two specific applications: hand massage for the immediate or short-term reduction of agitated behaviour, and the addition of touch to verbal encouragement to eat for the normalization of nutritional intake. The existing evidence does not support general conclusions about the effect or possible side effects of such interventions. No severe side effects were identified.	Massage and touch may serve as alternatives or complements to other therapies for the management of behavioural, emotional and perhaps other conditions associated with dementia. More research is needed, however, to provide definitive evidence about the benefits of these interventions.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
PLoS medicine,Prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Depression is the most frequent psychiatric condition after stroke and is associated with negative health outcomes. We aim to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke.	Studies published up to 4 November 2022 on Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched. We included studies of adults with stroke, where depression was assessed at a prespecified time point. Studies excluding people with aphasia and history of depression are excluded. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme(CASP) cohort study tool was used to assess risk of bias. A total of 77 studies were included in the pooled estimates of the prevalence of poststroke depression (PSD). The overall prevalence of depression was 27% (95% CI 25 to 30). Prevalence of depression was 24% (95% CI 21 to 28) by clinical interview and 29% (95% CI 25 to 32) by rating scales. Twenty-four studies with more than one assessment time point reported the natural history of PSD. Among people who were depressed within 3 months of stroke, 53% (95% CI 47 to 59) experienced persistent depression, while 44% (95% CI 38 to 50) recovered. The incidence of later depression (3 to 12 months after stroke) was 9% (95% CI 7 to 12). The cumulative incidence during 1 year after stroke was 38% (95% CI 33 to 43), and the majority (71% (95% CI 65 to 76)) of depression had onset within 3 months after stroke. The main limitation of the present study is that excluding people in source studies with severe impairments may produce imprecise estimates of the prevalence of PSD.	In this study, we observed that stroke survivors with early-onset depression (within 3 months after stroke) are at high risks for remaining depressed and make up two-thirds of the incident cases during 1 year after stroke. This highlights the need for ongoing clinical monitoring of patients depressed shortly after stroke.	PROSPERO CRD42022314146.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
Comprehensive psychiatry,The Hypomania Checklist (HCL) - systematic review of its properties to screen for bipolar disorders.,"Bipolar disorders (BDs) are often not recognised with potentially drastic consequences for the individuals and their families. In clinical practice self-reports can be used to screen to enhance recognition. We therefore present a systematic review of the screening properties for the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32).	A systematic literature search was conducted to identify all relevant studies looking at the screening properties of the HCL-32 in adults.	Out of 196 papers 21 papers reported data on 22 independent samples. We narratively reviewed these studies. Weighted estimated Sensitivity was 80% regardless of whether a BD diagnosis was compared to unipolar depression or any other non-bipolar diagnosis. Specificity indicated that the HCL-32 was better when comparing BD to unipolar depression (65.3%) than to any other diagnostic category (57.3%). Fewer studies provided estimates for predictive powers, leading to less reliable overall estimates for these indicators.	Despite some limitations, using the HCL-32 as a first screening in patients seeking help for depression can be recommended, but should never be used on its own for diagnosing. Future research should examine whether screening properties can be improved by developing an algorithm incorporating the negative consequences reported for different areas in the HCL-32.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,Greater cognitive deterioration in women than men with Alzheimer's disease: a meta analysis.,"Studies reporting on the cognitive abilities of men and women with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are surprisingly rare. We carried out a meta-analysis of neurocognitive data from 15 studies (n = 828 men; 1,238 women), which revealed a consistent male advantage on verbal and visuospatial tasks and tests of episodic and semantic memory. Moderator regression analyses showed that age, education level, and dementia severity did not significantly predict the male advantage. Reasons posited for this advantage include a reduction of estrogen in postmenopausal women, sex differences in AD pathology, and greater cognitive reserve in men.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
Journal of neurotrauma,Adherence to Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines for Management of Traumatic Brain Injury Patients and Its Effect on Outcomes: Systematic Review.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) management based on Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines is widely accepted and thought to improve outcome. The objectives of this study are to provide an overview of adherence to BTF guidelines and to explore which factors influence adherence. We conducted a search of relevant electronic bibliographic databases. Twenty articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria out of 666 articles screened. All were cohort studies. Wide variation in adherence to BTF guidelines was observed with a median of 66.2% (range 0-100%). The lowest median adherence was observed with surgical management (14%), whereas the highest was observed with oxygenation (100%), steroid (97.8%), and blood pressure recommendation (92.3%). Variability was primarily explained by the variation in the strength of evidence of each recommendation. Treating patients with higher severity of injury as well as treatment in a Level I trauma center positively influenced adherence. Overall, adherence to BTF guidelines varies. Further research is required to strengthen the current evidence and to identify factors related to adherence to guidelines from a professional prospective.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
Journal of psychiatric practice,Light therapy for seasonal affective disorder in a clinical office setting.,"To determine predictors of response to light therapy (LT) for seasonal affective disorder, winter version, in a clinical office setting for patients with a spectrum of seasonality defined by the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ).	A retrospective review was done of charts of 51 patients who had been treated with a 1-week light therapy intervention. Patient self-rated scales applied in a standard manner were used to measure clinical progress. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) with added atypical features was used as the primary outcome variable. Sleep patterns were analyzed and the effect of psychotropic medications on outcome was determined. Seven point scales were used to assess expected response and global response. The importance of having LT set up and available in an office setting was evaluated. Retrospective degree of disability was measured based on the SPAQ degree of problem. The severity of the depressive episode was determined based on BDI score at entry.	Seasonality (how a patient's symptoms vary as a function of the season of the year), degree of disability based on the SPAQ, and severity of depressive episode at entry based on the BDI predicted response to LT. Greater severity at baseline based on BDI score predicted less chance of attaining full remission within 7 days of treatment compared with patients with lower severity scores at entry on the BDI. Sleep patterns relative to a fixed treatment time of 7 AM did not predict LT response. Light therapy was effective on its own, and the results were mixed as to whether adding LT to an existing antidepressant medication produced superior results.	Degree of seasonality can be used as a predictor of response to LT and may be clinically useful when suggesting that patients consider a trial of LT.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The highest incidence of remission following the operation occurred in those women with only osseous metastases (83%) or with previous remission to both therapeutic oophorectomy and androgen administration (86%). No patient with primary central nervous system metastases, only one of ten with hepatic metastases, and none who had failed to respond to both oophorectomy and exogenous androgen administration experienced remission after hypophysectomy. The operative approach to the pituitary was via a periorbital incision, the posterior ethmoid cells, and the sphenoid sinus.

Collegium antropologicum,Influence of the Monitored Youth Mentoring Program for adolescents with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders.,"This aimed to measure the influence of the Monitored Youth Mentoring Program (MYMP) for adolescents with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders. The MYMP commenced in 1997 and was completed in 2003. The model of the program was for one university student of Pedagogy to mentor one pupil between the ages of 13 and 17 years, demonstrating risk seeking behaviours for a whole school year. The specimen group was made up of 141 pupils, approximately 20 pupils from each year level. The short-term goal was to influence positive change in participants demonstrating risk seeking behaviour. The long-term goal was to enhance the respective school's programs to enable preventative approaches to lessen negative and risk seeking behaviours amongst pupils with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders. The research results demonstrate statistically significant success of the applied program in two measured variables. Firstly, learning success (p < 0.05), and secondly a decrease in truancy and disciplinary misdemeanours (p < 0.05). Both of which were observed in participants with behavioural problems. The program was not as successful for participants with behavioural disorders, but not without some effect. Although the program can be generally described as achieving a medium level of success, the fact that there was a lack of progressive worsening in participant's behaviour is a substantial bi-product of the program. The mentors involved in the program made it extremely clear by their feedback that, MYMP positively enhanced their formal Pedagogy training, through hands-on practise that they otherwise would not have received through their academic programs. They were provided with vital exposure to a preventative program and managed to gain insight into the possibilities of introducing early intervention and prevention into Croatian schools.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,Experiences of acute mental health care in an ethnically diverse inner city: qualitative interview study.,"Ethnic inequalities in experiences of mental health care persist in the UK, although most evidence derives from in-patient settings. We aimed to explore service users' and carers' accounts of recent episodes of severe mental illness and of the care received in a multi-cultural inner city. We sought to examine factors impacting on these experiences, including whether and how users and carers felt that their experiences were mediated by ethnicity.	Forty service users and thirteen carers were recruited following an acute psychotic episode using typical case sampling. In-depth interviews explored illness and treatment experiences. Ethnicity was allowed to emerge in participants' narratives and was prompted if necessary.	Ethnicity was not perceived to impact significantly on therapeutic relationships, and nor were there ethnic differences in care pathways, or in the roles of families and friends. Ethnic diversity was commonplace among both service users and mental health professionals. This was tolerated in community settings if efforts were made to ensure high-quality care. Home Treatment was rated highly, irrespective of service users' ethnicity. In-patient care was equally unpopular and was the one setting where ethnicity appeared to mediate unsatisfactory care experiences. These findings highlight the risks of generalising from reports of (dis)satisfaction with care based predominantly on in-patient experiences.	Home treatment was popular but hard to deliver in deprived surroundings and placed a strain on carers. Interventions to enhance community treatments in deprived areas are needed, along with remedial interventions to improve therapeutic relationships in hospital settings.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Developmental medicine and child neurology. Supplement,Some factors relating to intelligence in treated children with spina bifida cystica.,"The 83 survivors of a consecutive series of children with spina bifida cystica, born between 1963 and 1971 and treated non-selectively since birth, were assessed by intelligence and developmental testing. In nine of the children who had not required shunts the distribution of intelligence was within the normal range. The need for a shunt was significantly related to the presence of craniolacunae and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Seven of the 74 shunt-treated children had suffered ventriculitis, meningitis or septicaemia, and their intelligence was significantly worse than the others. In the 67 shunt-treated children who had not suffered infection, intelligence was significantly related to the thickness of the pallium when the shunt was inserted during the first four weeks of life, and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Intelligence was not related to the function of the shunt at time of assessment, to the number of revisions of the shunt, or to the rate of increase in head size during the first four weeks of life. It is concluded that the best indication of later intelligence can be gained at birth from the thickness of the pallium and the sensory level of the lesion.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
No to hattatsu = Brain and development,[Evaluation of surgical treatment for intractable aspiration in neurologically impaired patients: our experience with 20 patients].,"The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of surgical treatment for intractable aspiration in patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities (SMID) and neuromuscular diseases (NMD).	A retrospective analysis was performed of 20 patients who underwent laryngotracheal separation (LTS) or the tracheal flap method (TFM) between 2003 and 2012 at Gunma Children's Medical Center.	All patients were bedridden and fed either through a naso-gastric or naso-esophageal tube or via a gastric fistula. Of the 20 participants, 60% underwent surgical treatment before 3 years of age. The incidence of aspiration pneumonia decreased after surgery, and 8 of 10 patients, who were previously hospitalized for a long duration, were discharged. The most frequent complications observed were granulation around the tracheostomy stoma and endotracheal granuloma. Two patients presented with a tracheal fistula.	LTS and TFM can be used as treatment modalities for patients with intractable aspiration along with SMID and NMD. In patients with intractable aspiration, after considering their underlying conditions, adaptation and type of operative procedures should be determined.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs,Alcohol treatment effects on secondary nondrinking outcomes and quality of life: the COMBINE study.,"To evaluate the full range of alcohol treatment effectiveness, it is important to assess secondary nondrinking outcome dimensions in addition to primary alcohol consumption outcomes.	We used a large sample (n=1,226) of alcohol-dependent participants entering the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism-sponsored COMBINE (Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions) Study, a multisite clinical trial of pharmacological (naltrexone [ReVia] and acamprosate [Campral]) and behavioral interventions, to examine the effects of specific treatment combinations on nondrinking functional outcomes. We assessed the outcomes at baseline and at the end of 16 weeks of alcohol treatment and again at the 26-week and/or 52-week postrandomization follow-ups.	(1) Drinking and secondary outcomes were significantly related, especially at the follow-up periods. A higher percentage of heavy drinking days, more drinks per drinking day, and lower percentage of days abstinent were associated with lower quality-of-life measures. (2) All nondrinking outcomes showed improvement at the end of 16 weeks of treatment and most maintained improvement over the 26-week and 52-week follow-ups. Only two measures returned to pretreatment levels at 52 weeks: percentage of days paid for work and physical health. Improvements of nondrinking outcomes remained even after adjusting for posttreatment heavy drinking status. (3) Although nondrinking outcomes showed overall improvement, specific pharmacological and behavioral treatment combinations were not differentially effective on specific secondary outcomes.	In the current study, changes that resulted from treatment were multidimensional, and improvements in nondrinking outcomes reflected the overall significant improvement in drinking but they were not differentiated between treatment combination groups. Findings from this study support the importance of including secondary nondrinking outcomes in clinical alcohol-treatment trials.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al],Craniospinal axis irradiation in children. Treatment in supine position including field verification as a prerequisite for anesthesia without intubation.,"For craniospinal axis irradiation in young children sometimes anesthesia is required. In order to minimize risks from the anesthesist's point of view supine position would be preferable to standard prone position. In case of irradiation in supine position verification of the 3-field junction in the cervical region causes problems, because there is no direct visual control. For such situations the clinical application of a new technique is presented.	For treatment planning a modern 3D planning system was necessary. Patient's positioning was done by using a vacuum-form body immobilizer and an integrated head mask. Radiation fields were placed only by table movements being calculated by the planning system in relation to a reference point at the patient's surface. In addition to common verification films specially prepared small films were used for the 3-field junction in the cervical region. These films were placed close to the patient for the whole time of each radiation session being exposed by every radiation field.	Two children (age 3 and 5 years, respectively) were irradiated as described. Twenty-eight of those specially prepared films were exposed. Two films (7%) had to be excluded because of inadequate exposure. An overlap of radiation fields was seen on 1 of the 26 remaining films (4%), whereas an unacceptable gap was not found. Acute skin reactions were comparable to those observed in patients being irradiated in standard prone position.	The presented technique for craniospinal axis irradiation in supine position including field verification was not only precise and reproducable, but also comfortable and safe for the patient. We suggest it as a new option for craniospinal axis irradiation in children.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
PloS one,A high diet quality is associated with lower incidence of cardiovascular events in the Malmö diet and cancer cohort.,"To investigate if diet quality is related to incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events.	A diet quality index based on the 2005 Swedish Nutrition Recommendations and the Swedish Dietary Guidelines was created and included six dietary components: saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fish and shellfish, dietary fiber, fruit and vegetables, and sucrose. The index ranked 17126 participants (59% women) of the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort (Sweden) on their dietary intakes. Total index score was categorized as low, medium or high. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to model associations between index score categories and index components with risk of incident CV events, with adjustment for potential confounders. The incidence of first CV events (non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke or death from ischemic heart disease) was monitored from baseline (1991-1996) until December 31, 2008; 703 CV events occurred in women and 1093 in men.	A high diet quality was associated with decreased risk of CV events when compared to a low diet quality. In multivariate analysis, the risk reduction was 32% (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.49-0.73) in men and 27% (hazard ratio = 0.73, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.91) in women. When examined separately and mutually adjusted for each other, the individual components were either not associated with CV risk or marginally decreased risks were seen.	High quality diets in line with current recommendations may reduce the risk of CV events. This study illustrates the importance of considering a combination of dietary factors when evaluating diet-disease associations.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Disability and rehabilitation. Assistive technology,Evaluation of the performance of paraplegic subjects during walking with a new design of reciprocal gait orthosis.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) influences a person's ability to stand and walk. Various orthoses have been developed to solve these standing and walking problems, however, patients still experience high energy consumption during walking and high forces on the upper limbs. A new reciprocal gait orthosis (RGO) was designed to address these problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the new orthosis design with paraplegic subjects.	Three paraplegic subjects with the lesion at level T12 and three able-bodied subjects were included in this study. Hip and pelvis range of motion and vertical ground reaction force were evaluated using the Qualysis motion analyzer system and a Kistler force plate. Energy consumption was measured with the Polar heart rate monitoring system. The differences between SCI individuals when walking with a Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis (KAFO) and the new RGO, and the differences between able-bodied and paraplegic subjects were evaluated by the use of paired sample and two sample t test, respectively.	The results showed that energy consumption and gait analysis outcomes with new RGO orthosis were better than the KAFO. However, there was a large difference between paraplegic and able-bodied subjects while walking with the new orthosis.	The new RGO design performed better than a KAFO in terms of energy consumption, walking style and vertical ground reaction force. Therefore, it appears that RGO may be a useful orthosis for patients with paraplegia. Implications for Rehabilitation Walking and standing of the subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI) improve their physiological and physiological health. This study introduces a new type of orthosis design in order to improve the abilities of SCI subjects during walking and standing. It seems that the new design works better than available orthoses (KAFO).",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Journal of spinal disorders & techniques,Effects of surgical treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy in patients > or = 70 years of age: a retrospective comparative study.,"The objective of this study was to compare efficacy of cervical surgery for myelopathy in patients > or = 70 and < or = 60 years of age. Forty patients > or = 70 years and 50 patients < or = 60 years of age with MRI and CT proven myelopathy were neurologically assessed using the JOA score. Three operative procedures were performed: anterior spinal fusion, laminoplasty, and laminectomy. Postoperatively, patients exhibited comparable outcomes irrespective of age or operative procedure performed. The only exception was the increase in postoperative neurologic complications noted for the older individuals with greater comorbidities.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Acta neurochirurgica,Carotid endarterectomy: a new technique replacing internal shunts.,"Carotid endarterectomy has been reported to increase the time free from cerebral ischemic events in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a high grade of stenosis of the internal carotid artery. In cases in whom the compensatory circulation during the carotid clamp time is not sufficient, the use of intraluminal shunts has been proposed. However, the use of intraluminal shunts present several problems, such as the technical difficulties in positioning the shunt, the variability of time requested for the placement, the inconstancy of the blood flow during surgery, and the need to clamp off the carotid to introduce and remove the shunt. For these reasons, most operators prefer not to employ intraluminal shunts, while others do use them only in selected cases. The purpose of this work is to present, for the first time, a new type of temporary extraluminal shunt, connecting the femoral to the internal carotid artery with the interposition of a roller pump to regulate the blood flow. This method allows one to perform carotid endarterectomy without interrupting the blood flow to the brain.	407 consecutive patients, who underwent carotid endarterectomy between August 1992 and April 2000, were considered. 35 patients presented an absolutely insufficient collateral circulation, demonstrated by important modifications of the electroencephalographic monitoring during the carotid clamp time. In these patients the endarterectomy was performed using a new femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt.	In all the cases in whom the femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt was positioned, the normalisation of electroencephalographic monitoring was achieved by regulating the blood flow with the interposed roller pump. The use and the placement of the shunt was simple and easy. None of the patients showed postoperative complications, except for one who had a stroke two days after surgery.	The results obtained, although to be confirmed by further studies, seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of our femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt, which was simple to use and safe.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
The International journal of eating disorders,Reduction of food cravings through concurrent visuospatial processing.,"Two experiments adopted a working memory approach to evaluate the effectiveness of visuospatial tasks as a technique for reducing food cravings.	Dieting and non-dieting women were asked to form images of both food-related and nonfood items, induced by either pictures (Experiment 1) or verbal cues (Experiment 2). They were required to concurrently perform one of three tasks that load on the visuospatial sketch pad of working memory: saccadic eye movements, dynamic visual noise, or spatial tapping.	In support of the working memory model of limited visuospatial capacity, concurrent visuospatial activity reduced the vividness of food-related images which, in turn, reduced the intensity of the associated craving. The same pattern of results was observed across dieters and non-dieters and for all stimulus types.	Visuospatial tasks may provide a useful technique for the treatment of food craving episodes in both nonclinical and clinical populations.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
BJU international,Chitosan membranes applied on the prostatic neurovascular bundles after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a phase II study.,"To evaluate the feasibility and the safety of applying chitosan membrane (ChiMe) on the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (NS-RARP). The secondary aim of the study was to report preliminary data and in particular potency recovery data.	This was a single-centre, single-arm prospective study, enrolling all patients with localised prostate cancer scheduled for RARP with five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function scores of >17, from July 2015 to September 2016. All patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. The demographics, perioperative, postoperative and complications data were evaluated. Potency recovery data were evaluated in particular and any sign/symptom of local allergy/intolerance to the ChiMe was recorded and evaluated.	In all, 140 patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. Applying the ChiMe was easy in almost all the cases, and did not compromise the safety of the procedure. None of the patients reported signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging.	In our experience, ChiMe applied on the NVBs after NS-RARP was feasible and safe, without compromising the duration, difficulty or complication rate of the 'standard' procedure. No patients had signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. A comparative cohort would have added value to the study.

Scandinavian journal of rehabilitation medicine,Blood redistribution and circulatory responses to submaximal arm exercise in persons with spinal cord injury.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate responses to submaximal arm exercise (20%, 40%, and 60% of peak power output) using four conditions to support the circulatory redistribution in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Five males with tetraplegia (TP) and four males with paraplegia (PR) exercised 1) sitting, 2) supine, and 3) sitting with the addition of a) an anti-gravity suit (anti-G), b) elastic stockings and abdominal binder, and c) functional electrical stimulation of the leg muscles. Compared to sitting, the following significant changes were observed: in the supine position, heart rate (HR) decreased (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 76 vs 92 b/min) and stroke volume (SV) increased (PR: 132 vs 116 ml, TP: 96 vs 83 ml). The anti-G suit induced a decrease in heart rate (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 87 vs 92 b/min) and a decrease in oxygen uptake (VO2) in PR. Stockings only affected TP, i.e. a decrease in heart rate with 5 b/min and an increase in stroke volume with 13 ml/beat. Functional electrical stimulation produced an increase in VO2 (PR: 1.00 vs 0.95 l/min, TP: 0.68 vs 0.53 l/min) and a rise in stroke volume in TP. Results indicate that the methods employed to support the circulatory redistribution have different working mechanisms and, in addition, that the effects are different for TP and PR probably because of differences in active muscle mass, sympathetic impairment and blood pressure values.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Substance use & misuse,Implementing a national alcohol consumption prevention program at the local level: what does early evaluation tell us?,"The current Swedish national plan for preventing alcohol consumption-related problems puts greater emphasis on community-level prevention measures. This report describes early results from the implementation of this plan in the county of Västra Götaland, in southwestern Sweden. During 2002-2004 interviews were conducted with the main project representative in each of the county's 49 municipalities. In addition, more extensive data gathering, involving interviews with a broad range of stakeholders and systematic examination of project-related documentation, was undertaken in four representative municipalities. Findings indicated that community* alcohol consumption prevention has been strengthened and that the activity level is high in all municipalities, especially in relation to youth. However, problematic alcoholic beverage consumption by adults was rarely targeted; the limited resources were dispersed over too many projects; there was too little collaboration between stakeholding authorities and adherence to evidence-based practice still is lacking.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Cancer,Should extrapulmonary small cell cancer be managed like small cell lung cancer?,"The aim of this study was to determine if extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (EPSCC) should be managed using protocols similar to those for small cell lung cancer (SCLC).	Treatment strategies, survival, patterns of failure, and prognostic factors for patients with EPSCC were analyzed retrospectively at a large cancer center. SCLC was excluded by thoracic computed tomography (75%) or chest radiography (25%).	Of 120 eligible patients, 70% had limited disease (LD). Treatment modalities included chemotherapy (n = 82; 68%), radiotherapy (RT) (n = 80; 67%), and surgery (n = 41, 34%). The median survival for patients with LD and extensive disease was 1.4 years and 0.7 years, respectively. Gynecologic (n = 31) and gastrointestinal (n = 28) were the most common primary tumor sites. Gynecologic and head and neck primary tumor sites had better 1-year survival than other sites (P = .019 and 0.005, respectively). Brain metastasis was the site of first distant failure in 4.1% of patients versus 35% for soft tissue metastases. The lifetime risk of brain metastasis was 13%. Definitive RT (P = .004), LD (P = .028), and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) (P = .022) were found to be positive prognostic factors and weight loss (P < .001) was a negative prognostic factor on multivariate analysis.	Patients with EPSCC usually experienced short survival, often with early distant metastasis. Although PCI was associated with improved overall survival, brain metastasis was less frequent than in patients with SCLC, and therefore the potential benefit of PCI was less than in patients with SCLC. Definitive chemoradiotherapy was associated with better outcomes and should be delivered whenever feasible.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Neurosurgery,Short-term progressive spinal deformity following laminoplasty versus laminectomy for resection of intradural spinal tumors: analysis of 238 patients.,"Gross total resection of intradural spinal tumors can be achieved in the majority of cases with preservation of long-term neurological function. However, postoperative progressive spinal deformity complicates outcome in a subset of patients after surgery. We set out to determine whether the use of laminoplasty (LP) vs laminectomy (LM) has reduced the incidence of subsequent spinal deformity following intradural tumor resection at our institution.	We retrospectively reviewed the records of 238 consecutive patients undergoing resection of intradural tumor at a single institution. The incidence of subsequent progressive kyphosis or scoliosis, perioperative morbidity, and neurological outcome were compared between the LP and LM cohorts.	One hundred eighty patients underwent LM and 58 underwent LP. Patients were 46 +/- 19 years old with median modified McCormick score of 2. Tumors were intramedullary in 102 (43%) and extramedullary in 102 (43%). All baseline clinical, radiographic, and operative variables were similar between the LP and LM cohorts. LP was associated with a decreased mean length of hospitalization (5 vs 7 days; P = .002) and trend of decreased incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak (3% vs 9%; P = .14). Following LP vs LM, 5 (9%) vs 21 (12%) patients developed progressive deformity (P = .728) a mean of 14 months after surgery. The incidence of progressive deformity was also similar between LP vs LM in pediatric patients < 18 years of age (43% vs 36%), with preoperative scoliosis or loss of cervical/lumbar lordosis (28% vs 22%), or with intramedullary tumors (11% vs 11%).	LP for the resection of intradural spinal tumors was not associated with a decreased incidence of short-term progressive spinal deformity or improved neurological function. However, LP may be associated with a reduction in incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak. Longer-term follow-up is warranted to definitively assess the long-term effect of LP and the risk of deformity over time.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

"Work (Reading, Mass.)",A pilot study on the operationalization of the Model of Occupational Self Efficacy: A model for the reintegration of persons with brain injuries to their worker roles.,"Traumatic brain injury causes functional limitations that can cause people to struggle to reintegrate in the workplace despite participating in work rehabilitation programmes.	The aim of the study was to explore, and describe the experiences of individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury regarding returning to work through the use of the model of occupational self-efficacy.	In the study 10 individuals who were diagnosed with a mild to moderate brain injury participated in the study.	The research study was positioned within the qualitative paradigm specifically utilizing case study methodology. In order to gather data from the participants, individual interviews and participant observation techniques were used.	Two themes emerged from the findings of the study theme one reflected the barriers related to the use of the model (i.e. Theme one: Effective participation in the model is affected by financial assistance). The second theme related to the enabling factors related to the use of the model (i.e. Theme two: A sense of normality).	The findings of this study indicated that the Model of Occupational Self Efficacy (MOS) is a useful model to use in retraining the work skills of individual's who sustained a traumatic brain injury. The participants in this study could maintain employment in the open labour market for a period of at least 12 months and it improved their ability to accept their brain injury as well as adapt to their worker roles. The MOS also provides a framework for facilitating community integration.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Journal of neurotrauma,Predicting the Individual Treatment Effect of Neurosurgery for Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury in the Low-Resource Setting: A Machine Learning Approach in Uganda.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In these low-resource settings, effective triage of patients with TBI-including the decision of whether or not to perform neurosurgery-is critical in optimizing patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. Machine learning may allow for effective predictions of patient outcomes both with and without surgery. Data from patients with TBI was collected prospectively at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, from 2016 to 2019. One linear and six non-linear machine learning models were designed to predict good versus poor outcome near hospital discharge and internally validated using nested five-fold cross-validation. The 13 predictors included clinical variables easily acquired on admission and whether or not the patient received surgery. Using an elastic-net regularized logistic regression model (GLMnet), with predictions calibrated using Platt scaling, the probability of poor outcome was calculated for each patient both with and without surgery (with the difference quantifying the 'individual treatment effect,' ITE). Relative ITE represents the percent reduction in chance of poor outcome, equaling this ITE divided by the probability of poor outcome with no surgery. Ultimately, 1766 patients were included. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) ranged from 83.1% (single C5.0 ruleset) to 88.5% (random forest), with the GLMnet at 87.5%. The two variables promoting good outcomes in the GLMnet model were high Glasgow Coma Scale score and receiving surgery. For the subgroup not receiving surgery, the median relative ITE was 42.9% (interquartile range [IQR], 32.7% to 53.5%); similarly, in those receiving surgery, it was 43.2% (IQR, 32.9% to 54.3%). We provide the first machine learning-based model to predict TBI outcomes with and without surgery in LMICs, thus enabling more effective surgical decision making in the resource-limited setting. Predicted ITE similarity between surgical and non-surgical groups suggests that, currently, patients are not being chosen optimally for neurosurgical intervention. Our clinical decision aid has the potential to improve outcomes.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Journal of neuro-oncology,Cognitive rehabilitation training in patients with brain tumor-related epilepsy and cognitive deficits: a pilot study.,"The aim of this pilot observational study was to evaluate effect of cognitive rehabilitation training (RehabTr) on cognitive performances in patients with brain tumor-related epilepsy (BTRE) and cognitive disturbances. Medical inclusion criteria: patients (M/F) ≥ 18 years ≤ 75 with symptomatic seizures due to primary brain tumors or brain metastases in stable treatment with antiepileptic drugs; previous surgical resection or biopsy; >70 Karnofsky Performance Status; stable oncological disease. Eligible patients recruited from 100 consecutive patients with BTRE at first visit to our Center from 2011 to 2012. All recruited patients were administered battery of neuropsychological tests exploring various cognitive domains. Patients considered to have a neuropsychological deficit were those with at least one test score for a given domain indicative of impairment. Thirty patients out of 100 showed cognitive deficits, and were offered participation in RehabTr, of which 16 accepted (5 low grade glioma, 4 high grade glioma, 2 glioblastoma, 2 meningioma and 3 metastases) and 14 declined for various reasons. The RehabTr consisted of one weekly individual session of 1 h, for a total of 10 weeks, carried out by a trained psychologist. The functions trained were: memory, attention, visuo-spatial functions, language and reasoning by means of Training NeuroPsicologico (TNP(®)) software. To evaluate the effect of the RehabTr, the same battery of tests was administered directly after cognitive rehabilitation (T1), and at six-month follow-up (T2). Statistical analysis with Student T test for paired data showed that short-term verbal memory, episodic memory, fluency and long term visuo-spatial memory improved immediately after the T1 and remained stable at T2. At final follow-up all patients showed an improvement in at least one domain that had been lower than normal at baseline. Our results demonstrated a positive effect of rehabilitative training at different times, and, for these reasons, should encourage future research in this area with large, randomized clinical trials that evaluate the impact of a cognitive rehabilitation in patients with BTRE and cognitive deficits.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Spine,A Comparison of Anterior Cervical Corpectomy and Fusion Combined With Artificial Disc Replacement and Cage Fusion in Patients With Multilevel Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy.,"A retrospective study.	The aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes of anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) combined with artificial disc replacement (C-ADR) and ACCF combined with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in patients with consecutive 3-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).	The optimal surgical strategy for multilevel CSM (MCSM) remains undefined. C-ADR maintains motion at the level of the surgical procedure and decreases strain on the adjacent segments. The clinical results of multilevel C-ADR have not yet been elucidated. ACCF combined with 1-level C-ADR for the treatment of consecutive 3-level CSM may be a reasonable alternative to 3-level fusion.	We retrospectively reviewed the histories of patients who underwent surgery for consecutive 3-level CSM between C3-4 and C6-7 from June 2007 to August 2011. A total of 42 patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 19) underwent ACCF combined with 1-level C-ADR; group B (n = 23) underwent ACCF combined with 1-level ACDF. We compared perioperative parameters, clinical parameters, and radiological parameters.	There were no significant differences in the average age, sex ratio, the preoperative heights of the disc space or average blood loss between the 2 groups. Group A had longer operation times than group B (P < 0.05). During the follow-up period, group A showed a better Neck Dysfunction Index recovery (P < 0.05) at 24 months postoperatively, and less visual analogue scale scores at 12 and 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, group A exhibited better C2-C7 range of motion recovery at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.05, respectively).	Group A was superior to Group B in terms of better Neck Dysfunction Index recovery, less intermediate term pain, and better C2-C7 ROM recovery. ACCF hybrid 1-level C-ADR may be a suitable choice for the management of 3-level CSM in appropriate patients.	3.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Issues in mental health nursing,Exploring the benefits of an exercise program for people with schizophrenia: a qualitative study.,"The relationship between regular exercise and physical health and well-being is extensively documented in the literature. However, considerably less attention is devoted to the impact of exercise on health outcomes for people experiencing a mental illness. In response to the recognized paucity, a structured exercise program was developed and implemented for residents of a Community Care Unit in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Six residents participated in the program over a period of three months. This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study. A focus group interview was conducted with the resident participants (n=6), the exercise physiologists who developed and implemented the program (n=2), and nursing staff involved in implementing and supporting the program (n=4). Analysis of the data collected revealed that four main themes had emerged: the individual nature of the program, physical improvement, group dynamics, and future plans. The findings of this study suggest that involvement in the program produced very positive outcomes, most notably in the physical fitness of residents. The individual nature of the program which enabled gradual participation, and the cohesive approach of the group as a whole were considered very important factors contributing to the overall success. Furthermore, the participants planned to continue with some form of physical activity in the future. The potential value of regular exercise for patients experiencing a mental illness has significant implications for nursing and requires further research exploration.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Psychological reports,Effects of Psychoeducation and Stress Coping Techniques on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms.,"This study examined the effects of psychoeducation and stress management techniques on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms in Libya. The 41 Libyan patients who volunteered to take part in the study were first assessed using the PTSD Checklist. They attended workshops on PTSD symptoms, stress management techniques, and communication skills on three successive days after which they were asked to answer the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations two weeks after they completed the workshops. Among the 39% of the participants who were diagnosed with PTSD prior to the intervention, 15% met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD after the intervention. The preintervention scores were consistently higher than the postintervention scores, and there were significant differences in the PTSD Checklist total score and the re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptom scores. This study concluded that in mass-trauma events such as war and natural disasters, PTSD education can reduce the PTSD symptoms of those affected. Whether the benefits of psychoeducation on the participants are long term or short term is recommended for further study due to the limitations imposed by the willingness of the participants to participate, the amount of time they are willing to stay with the program, and the duration of the psychoeducation program itself.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Brain and behavior,Efficacy and safety profile of neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation combined with intraventricular lavage in severe intraventricular hemorrhage patients.,"The present study was conducted to explore the effect of neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation in severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).	Totally 81 patients with severe IVH in our hospital from November 2017 to March 2019 were divided into the intervention group (38 cases who received neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation combined with intraventricular lavage) and the control group (40 cases who received trepanation drainage). The perioperative condition, hematoma clearance rate, Glasgow coma score (GCS), hematoma recurrence rate, and prognosis were observed and compared between the two groups after treatment.	The operative time, time of cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and intracranial infection rate in the intervention group elicited superior results to those in the control group (p < .05). The clearance rate of hematoma in the intervention group was higher than that in the control group at 6 hr, 1, 3, and 7 days postoperatively (p < .05). The postoperative 3- and 7-day GCS scores in the intervention group were higher than those in the control group, and the recurrence rate of hematoma in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < .05), and the good/excellent rate of ADL in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p < .05).	Neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation combined with intraventricular lavage showed evident beneficial outcomes in patients with severe IVH. It can effectively improve the perioperative condition and improve the hematoma clearance rate and is beneficial to the prognosis of patients with severe IVH.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,Phenol block for hip flexor muscle spasticity under ultrasonic monitoring.,"Hip flexor spasticity, which is often associated with central nervous system (CNS) diseases, is a major impediment in rehabilitation. In order to cope with this problem, lumbar nerve blocking techniques developed by Meelhuysen and major and minor psoas muscle blocking techniques developed by Awad have been used in combination with physical therapies. Based on these techniques, we conducted major and minor psoas muscle phenol block (motor point block or intramuscular nerve block) under ultrasonic monitoring. Phenol block was conducted in nine patients with cerebral infarction (13 blocking procedures) and three with spinal cord injuries (six blocking procedures) while keeping them in a lateral position with the operation side upside. The beginning of the femoral nerves and part of the lumbar artery were visualized by ultrasound in some patients. As a result of the improvement of hip flexor spasticity, the range of hip joint motion (determined by the Mundale technique, prone hip extension and Thomas test) improved shortly after blocking. When physical therapy was conducted after blocking, improvement of skin care management was observed in eight cases, ability to keep in a stable sitting position in nine, improvement of a standing posture in three, increases in the ability to walk in two and alleviation of pain in three. Although nerve block is reported to result in hematoma, decreases in muscle force, pain, cystic/rectal disorders and hypogonadism, we have observed no such complication in our patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,Effects of treadmill training on walking economy in Parkinson's disease: a pilot study.,"Gait disturbances are frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and are associated with increased energy expenditure during walking. This study evaluated whether the effects of treadmill training are associated with an improvement of walking economy. Ten patients with idiopathic PD underwent treadmill training (30 min, three times a week for 4 weeks). Walking performance (Tauimed Up and Go, 6-min and 10-m walking tests) and metabolic function (oxygen uptake, heart and respiratory rate) were evaluated before training, at the end of treatment and after 30 days with two different graded exercises (treadmill and cycloergometer). Training significantly improved walking performance. Oxygen uptake, and heart and respiratory rates were significantly decreased only during graded exercise on the treadmill, but not on the cycloergometer. Treadmill training reduces energy expenditure during walking in PD, but the improvements of metabolic walking economy are associated with the specifically trained motor activity.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Surgical neurology,Surgical management of medullary hemangioblastoma. Report of 47 cases.,"Hemangioblastomas of the medulla are rare and seldom reported. Surgical resection of medullary hemangioblastomas is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. We present a unique institutional experience over a 12-year period.	Between 1987 to 1998, 47 hemangioblastomas were surgically resected and analyzed retrospectively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to 136 months with an average of 35 months.	Thirty-nine single hemangioblastomas were distributed in 3 anatomical areas: pontomedullary, medullary, and cervico-medullary. They were either focal intramedullary or dorsal exophytic. There were cyst formations in 97.4% of the single hemangioblastomas. The major feeding arteries and the tumor blush could be clearly visualized on angiogram, sometimes even on MRA. All medullary hemangioblastomas were radically removed. Postoperatively, 61.5% patients had clinical improvement, two patients' symptoms remained unchanged and 11 patients deteriorated; of the latter, 8 patients improved later with proper therapy, and 2 patients died.	Preoperative diagnosis of medullary hemangioblastoma is possible with MRI. With improved microsurgical technique and better understanding of the vascular pattern of the tumor, total surgical resection can be performed with <5% mortality. The surgical strategy is en bloc excision, as piecemeal resection can lead to uncontrollable hemorrhage. Removal of large solid hemangioblastomas may result in severe postoperative edema and/or hemorrhage in the medulla affecting the respiratory and vagal centers. Preoperative embolization through the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) can be helpful in this situation.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
Molecular medicine reports,Therapeutic window for YC‑1 following glutamate‑induced neuronal damage and transient focal cerebral ischemia.,"3-(5'-Hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1), has been demonstrated to inhibit platelet aggregation, vascular contraction and hypoxia‑inducible factor 1 activity in vitro and in vivo. The present study investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of YC‑1 in cultured neurons exposed to glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity and in an animal model of stroke. In a cortical neuronal culture model, YC‑1 demonstrated neurotoxicity at a concentration >100 µM, and YC‑1 (10‑30 µM) achieved potent cytoprotection against glutamate‑induced neuronal damage. Additionally, YC‑1 (30 µM) effectively attenuated the increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Delayed treatment of YC‑1 (30 µM) also protected against glutamate‑induced neuronal damage and cell swelling in cultured neurons, though only at 4 h post‑treatment. In addition, immediate treatment of YC‑1 (30 µM) following the exposure of cortical neurons to glutamate (300 µM) produced a marked reduction in intracellular pH. Delayed treatment of YC‑1 (25 mg/kg) protected against ischemic brain damage in vivo, though only when administered at 3 h post‑insult. Thus, YC‑1 exhibited neuroprotection against glutamate-induced neuronal damage and in mice subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia. This neuroprotection may be mediated via its ability to limit the glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity. However, the neuroprotective therapeutic window of YC‑1 is only at 3 h in vivo and 4 h in vitro, which may, at least in part, be attributed to its ability to reduce the intracellular pH in the early phase of ischemic stroke. Although YC‑1 provided the potential for clinical therapy, the treatment time point must be carefully evaluated following ischemia.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Neurological research,Atorvastatin and pitavastatin reduce oxidative stress and improve IR/LDL-R signals in Alzheimer's disease.,"To examine and compare the pleiotropic effects on oxidative stress and metabolic signaling pathways of atorvastatin and pitavastatin in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD).	We gave the transgenic (Tg) mice either atorvastatin or pitavastatin from 5-20 months (M) of age, and performed immunohistological analysis [4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE)-positive, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R)-positive neurons, apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-positive senile plaque (SP), and insulin receptor (IR)-positive endothelium], and biochemistry analysis (adiponectin and leptin).	The numbers of 4-HNE- and AGE-positive neurons and the sum of ApoE-positive SP size progressively increased with age in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-Tg mice, while the amount of IR-positive endothelium and the number of LDL-R-positive neurons decreased. Adiponectin and leptin serum levels were lower in APP-Tg mice than in non-Tg mice. Treatment with statins reduced the number of AGE-positive neurons from as early as 10 M, preserved the numbers of 4-HNE- and LDL-R-positive neurons and the amount of IR-positive endothelium at 15 M, and reduced the sum of ApoE-positive SP size and adiponectin serum level at 20 M.	Atorvastatin and pitavastatin reduced the level of oxidative stress, as revealed by the presence of 4-HNE and AGE, in AD mouse brains, and that treatment with statins improves insulin signaling and LDL-R/ApoE systems. The beneficial effects of these statins may be associated with direct pleiotropic effects on AD mouse brains, indirect effects through improving the serum adiponectin/leptin balance, or both.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Life sciences,Modulation of MK-801-elicited mouse popping behavior by galantamine is complex and dose-dependent.,"The ability of phencyclidine (PCP), a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, to precipitate a schizophreniform psychosis in susceptible individuals is consistent with the hypothesized pathologic occurrence of NMDA receptor hypofunction in this disorder. Because the psychosis caused by PCP resembles schizophrenia in all of the relevant domains of psychopathology, investigators have sought to characterize animal models of NMDA receptor hypofunction. MK-801 (dizocilpine) binds to the same hydrophobic channel domain in the NMDA receptor-associated ionophore as PCP, and has been shown to elicit intense irregular episodes of jumping behavior in mice, termed 'popping.' MK-801-elicited mouse popping is an animal model of NMDA receptor hypofunction that has been used to screen novel candidate compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia. Recently, a selective abnormality in the transduction of the acetylcholine signal at the level of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor has been described in schizophrenia. The existence of a nicotinic cholinergic abnormality in schizophrenia has stimulated interest in a potential therapeutic role for positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic receptors. Galantamine is a compound that possesses two interesting properties: inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic neurotransmission. Theoretically, galantamine would be expected to increase the efficiency or likelihood that acetylcholine will promote channel opening and ionic conductance at nicotinic receptors. As expected, in the current investigation statistically significant popping behavior was elicited by MK-801 in mice (T(22) = 2.16, P < 0.05). This MK-801-elicited popping was significantly attenuated by 100 mg/kg of galantamine (T(22) = 2.24, P < 0.05). The data show that nicotinic interventions can influence NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the intact mouse.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Enhancement of the liver's neuroprotective role ameliorates traumatic brain injury pathology.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a pervasive problem worldwide for which no effective treatment is currently available. Although most studies have focused on the pathology of the injured brain, we have noted that the liver plays an important role in TBI. Using two mouse models of TBI, we found that the enzymatic activity of hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) was rapidly decreased and then returned to normal levels following TBI, whereas such changes were not observed in the kidney, heart, spleen, or lung. Interestingly, genetic downregulation of hepatic Ephx2 (which encodes sEH) ameliorates TBI-induced neurological deficits and promotes neurological function recovery, whereas overexpression of hepatic sEH exacerbates TBI-associated neurological impairments. Furthermore, hepatic sEH ablation was found to promote the generation of A2 phenotype astrocytes and facilitate the production of various neuroprotective factors associated with astrocytes following TBI. We also observed an inverted V-shaped alteration in the plasma levels of four EET (epoxyeicosatrienoic acid) isoforms (5,6-, 8,9-,11,12-, and 14,15-EET) following TBI which were negatively correlated with hepatic sEH activity. However, hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally regulates the plasma levels of 14,15-EET, which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, we found that the application of 14,15-EET mimicked the neuroprotective effect of hepatic sEH ablation, while 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid blocked this effect, indicating that the increased plasma levels of 14,15-EET mediated the neuroprotective effect observed after hepatic sEH ablation. These results highlight the neuroprotective role of the liver in TBI and suggest that targeting hepatic EET signaling could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating TBI.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",Neuropeptide Y in the central nucleus of the amygdala suppresses dependence-induced increases in alcohol drinking.,"The anxiolytic effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) are mediated in part by the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a brain region involved in the regulation of alcohol-drinking behaviors. Centrally administered NPY suppresses alcohol drinking in subpopulations of rats vulnerable to the development of high alcohol-drinking behavior. The purpose of the current study was to determine the role of NPY in the CeA on elevated alcohol drinking produced by alcohol dependence. Adult male Wistar rats were trained to respond for 10% w/v alcohol in an operant situation with the use of a supersaccharin fading procedure. Following stabilization of responding, rats were divided into two groups matched for intake and given daily access to either alcohol-containing (9.2% v/v) liquid diet or an isocaloric control diet. Following extended access to the diet and reliable separation of operant responding between dependent and non-dependent rats during 6-h withdrawal tests, all rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae aimed at the CeA. Rats were then infused with 4 NPY doses (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 microg/0.5 microl aCSF) in a within-subjects Latin-square design during acute withdrawal and tested for operant alcohol responding 30 min later. Alcohol-dependent rats exhibited higher operant alcohol responding than non-dependent rats when infused with vehicle, but responding was similar in the two groups following infusion of all doses of NPY. These results indicate that NPY abolishes dependence-induced elevations in alcohol drinking and implicate the recruitment of limbic NPY systems in the motivational drive to consume alcohol following the transition to dependence.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Biological research for nursing,Effects of estrogen on platelet reactivity after transient forebrain ischemia in rats.,"Estrogen's prothrombotic effects are of increasing concern, particularly in stroke risk and recovery. Using an ischemic rodent model, the authors sought to determine (a) if estrogen replacement increases postischemic platelet reactivity, (b) if changes in estrogen status alter intraplatelet endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) synthesis, and (c) if estrogen-mediated effects on platelets alter cerebral blood flow during reperfusion. Intact (I), ovariectomized (OVX), and OVX + 17 beta-estradiol (E50) rats were subjected to 30 min of forebrain ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. Using the platelet activation marker P-selectin, postischemic platelet reactivity was quantified by flow cytometry. In a separate cohort (I, OVX, E50), the authors quantified platelet eNOS by Western blot. Another cohort (OVX, E50) was subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, and cerebral blood flow was determined using the iodoantipyrine technique. Collagen-stimulated platelet P-selectin expression was increased in the OVX rats at 60 min of reperfusion, and this effect was reversed by estrogen treatment. No differences in platelet eNOS expression were detected among groups. Cerebral blood flow at 60 min reperfusion was comparable between the OVX and the E50 rats. The authors conclude that during reper-fusion, estrogen deficiency increases postischemic platelet sensitivity to stimuli in estrogen-deficient rats. Estrogen treatment mitigates effects of estrogen loss on platelets, but this early effect is apparently not caused by intraplatelet eNOS depression. Neither estrogen deficiency nor estrogen treatment changes early postischemic regional brain blood flow. In this rodent global cerebral ischemic model, physiologic doses of estrogen are not deleterious to platelet reactivity and may initially reduce postischemic platelet reactivity.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Antiepileptic action of exogenous dehydroepiandrosterone in iron-induced epilepsy in rat brain.,"In the study described here, the antiepileptic effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatment on iron-induced focal epileptiform activity in the rat brain was investigated. DHEA is a neuroactive corticosteroid hormone synthesized both in the adrenal cortex and in the brain. Its antioxidant properties are well known. As oxidative stress seems to play a major role in epileptogenesis in the iron-induced model of posttraumatic epilepsy, it was of interest to examine whether DHEA would exert antiepileptic activity. DHEA at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day administered intraperitoneally for 7, 14, and 21 days to iron-induced epileptic rats prevented epileptiform electrophysiological activity. Morris water maze and open-field tests on iron-induced epileptic rats revealed that DHEA also prevented behavioral alterations related to epileptiform activity. Thus, DHEA attenuated the cognitive defects produced by epileptic activity. Moreover, alterations in epileptogenesis-related biochemical parameters-lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase (sodium pump) activity--were also countered by DHEA.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Acta neurochirurgica,The NMDA antagonist MK-801 improved metabolic recovery after 10 minutes global cerebral ischaemia in rats measured with 31 phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,"The blockade of postsynaptic receptors for excitatory amino acids is a promising new field for the possible treatment of cerebral ischaemia. The most important receptor seems to be the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the glutamate receptors and MK-801 is a potent non-competitive antagonist to the NMDA receptor. 31P NMR Spectroscopy was used to measure the recovery of intracellular pH and the high energy phosphates Phosphocreatine (PCr) and ATP after ten minutes of temporary global cerebral ischaemia in the rat. Cerebral ischaemia was obtained by combining bilateral carotid ligation and systemic hypotension (2 vessel occlusion model). Two intervention groups with intravenous injection of MK-801 in doses of 0.25 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg 15 minutes before onset of ischaemia were compared to a control group. Both intervention groups showed a more rapid recovery of PCr and ATP than the control group, but there were no significant differences for intracellular pH.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S. Korsakova,[Protective effect of meloxicam against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in normo- and hypertensive].,Normotensive and hypertensive male Wistar rats were subjected to the 3 h bilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by 72 h of reperfusion. The selective cycloxygenase-2 inhibitor meloxicam was administered intramuscularly after the cerebral reperfusion at a daily dose of 15 mg/kg. Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate the cerebral blood flow during the reperfusion phase. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) within the brain tissue homogenate was determined using spectrophotometry. The presence of arterial hypertension caused the altered response of brain tissue to ischemia/reperfusion. The meloxicam treatment significantly decreased the MDA level in normotensive rats subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. The protective effect of meloxicam against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury was more pronounced in hypertensive rats as compared to normotensive animals.,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Constitutively active micro opioid receptors mediate the enhanced conditioned aversive effect of naloxone in morphine-dependent mice.,"Naloxone administration produces a robust conditioned place aversion (CPA) in opiate-naive rodents by blocking the action of enkephalins at mu opioid receptors. This aversive response is potentiated by prior exposure to morphine. In vitro studies indicate that morphine treatment may promote constitutive activity of mu opioid receptors. We hypothesized that such enhanced constitutive activity in vivo may underlie the increased aversive property of naloxone by uncovering the inverse agonist property of this drug. The CPA produced by naloxone was compared with that produced by the neutral antagonists 6-alpha- and 6-beta-naloxol in mice with and without prior morphine exposure. While all three drugs produced CPA, only naloxone CPA was enhanced by morphine given 20 h prior to each naloxone injection. Furthermore, only naloxone produced withdrawal jumping when given 20 h after morphine, even though 6-alpha-naloxol was able to produce jumping when given 4 h after morphine. These data suggest that morphine may enhance naloxone CPA by increasing levels of constitutively active mu receptors and further support the role of such constitutive activity in mediating naloxone-precipitated physical withdrawal. Such long-term changes in constitutive activity of the mu receptor induced by exogenous opiate exposure may thus be an important factor in hedonic homeostatic dysregulation proposed to underlie the addictive process.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Journal of the National Cancer Institute,FGL2 as a Multimodality Regulator of Tumor-Mediated Immune Suppression and Therapeutic Target in Gliomas.,"Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) may promote glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cancer development by inducing multiple immune-suppression mechanisms.	The biological significance of FGL2 expression was assessed using the The Cancer Genome Atlast (TCGA) glioma database and tumor lysates analysis. The therapeutic effects of an anti-Fgl2 antibody and the role of immune suppression regulation by Fgl2 were determined in immune-competent, NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG), and FcɣRIIB-/- mice (n = 3-18 per group). Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance, log-rank survival analysis, and Pearson correlation. All statistical tests were two-sided.	In low-grade gliomas, 72.5% of patients maintained two copies of the FGL2 gene, whereas 83.8% of GBM patients had gene amplification or copy gain. Patients with high levels of FGL2 mRNA in glioma tissues had a lower overall survival (P = .009). Protein levels of FGL2 in GBM lysates were higher relative to low-grade glioma lysates (11.48±5.75ng/mg vs 3.96±1.01ng/mg, P = .003). In GL261 mice treated with an anti-FGL2 antibody, median survival was 27 days compared with only 17 days for mice treated with an isotype control antibody (P = .01). The anti-FGL2 antibody treatment reduced CD39(+) Tregs, M2 macrophages, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). FGL2-induced increases in M2, CD39, and PD-1 were ablated in FcɣRIIB-/- mice.	FGL2 augments glioma immunosuppression by increasing the expression levels of PD-1 and CD39, expanding the frequency of tumor-supportive M2 macrophages via the FcγRIIB pathway, and enhancing the number of MDSCs and CD39(+) regulatory T cells. Collectively, these results show that FGL2 functions as a key immune-suppressive modulator and has potential as an immunotherapeutic target for treating GBM.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
"Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)","Opioids, benzodiazepines and intake of ethanol.","Deprived rats were given the opportunity to take water or a sweetened ethanol solution for one hour/day. Across days, intake of the ethanol solution increased. Doses of morphine prior to an opportunity to drink increased avidity for the ethanol solutions, while doses of chlordiazepoxide did not. The opioid antagonist naloxone decreased intake, whereas, the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 failed to do so. These findings confirm that certain opioids can increase ethanol intake, and further specify that, under the same testing regimen, benzodiazepines do not reliably modify rats' propensity to drink a solution containing ethanol",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,"Isobolographic additivity among lacosamide, lamotrigine and phenobarbital in a mouse tonic-clonic seizure model.","Epilepsy is a serious neurological disease affecting about 1% of people worldwide (65 million). Seizures are controllable with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in about 70% of epilepsy patients, however, there remains about 30% of patients inadequately medicated with these AEDs, who need a satisfactory control of their seizure attacks. For these patients, one of the treatment options is administration of 2 or 3 AEDs in combination.	To determine the anticonvulsant effects of a combination of 3 selected AEDs (i.e., lacosamide - LCM, lamotrigine - LTG and phenobarbital - PB) at the fixed-ratio of 1:1:1 in a mouse maximal electroshock-induced (tonic-clonic) seizure model by using isobolographic analysis.	Seizure activity was evoked in adult male albino Swiss mice by a current (sinewave, 25 mA, 500 V, 50 Hz, 0.2 s stimulus duration) delivered via auricular electrodes. Type I isobolographic analysis was used to detect interaction for the 3-drug combination.	With type I isobolographic analysis, the combination of LCM, LTG and PB (at the fixed-ratio of 1:1:1) exerted additive interaction in the mouse maximal electroshock-induced (tonic-clonic) seizure model.	The combination of LCM with LTG and PB produced additive interaction in the mouse tonicclonic seizure model, despite various molecular mechanisms of action of the tested AEDs.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Nutrients,Natural Docosahexaenoic Acid in the Triglyceride Form Attenuates In Vitro Microglial Activation and Ameliorates Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis in Mice.,"Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated, at least in part, to an inflammatory process in which microglia plays a major role. The effect of the triglyceride form of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (TG-DHA) was assayed in vitro and in vivo to assess the protective and anti-inflammatory activity of this compound. In the in vitro study, BV-2 microglia cells were previously treated with TG-DHA and then activated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). TG-DHA treatment protected BV-2 microglia cells from oxidative stress toxicity attenuating NO production and suppressing the induction of inflammatory cytokines. When compared with DHA in the ethyl-ester form, a significant difference in the ability to inhibit NO production in favor of TG-DHA was observed. TG-DHA inhibited significantly splenocyte proliferation but isolated CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation was unaffected. In a mice model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 250 mg/kg/day oral TG-DHA treatment was associated with a significant amelioration of the course and severity of the disease as compared to untreated animals. TG-DHA-treated EAE mice showed a better weight profile, which is a symptom related to a better course of encephalomyelitis. TG-DHA may be a promising therapeutic agent in neuroinflammatory processes and merit to be more extensively studied in human neurodegenerative disorders.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

This study investigated the vasodilator and neuroprotective effects of darbepoetin alpha on an experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage model and compared it with erythropoietin.	Forty adult male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups of ten rabbits each: group 1 (control), group 2 (subarachnoid hemorrhage), group 3 (erythropoietin), and group 4 (darbepoetin alpha). Recombinant human erythropoietin was administered at a dose of 1,000 U/kg intraperitoneally after the induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage and continued every 8 h up to 72 h. Darbepoetin alpha was administered at a single intraperitoneal dose of 30 μg/kg. Animals were killed 72 h after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Basilar artery cross-sectional areas, arterial wall thicknesses, hippocampal degeneration scores and biochemical analyses were measured in all groups.	Both erythropoietin and darbepoetin alpha treatments were found to attenuate cerebral vasospasm and provide neuroprotection after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits. Darbepoetin alpha revealed better morphometric and histopathological results than erythropoietin among experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm.	Our findings, for the first time, showed that darbepoetin alpha can prevent vasospasm and provides neuroprotection following experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Moreover, darbepoetin alpha showed better results when compared with erythropoietin.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,"1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid, an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, causes hypotensive and antioxidant effects with upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.","1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACPC) has been shown to protect neurons against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by reducing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation. Recent studies have demonstrated that several antagonists of NMDA receptors have important cardiovascular effects. In this study, we examined whether the cardiovascular effects of ACPC involve the role of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its antioxidant effect in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Male SHRSP were divided into two groups: a control group and an ACPC group administered ACPC at 50 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks by peritoneal injection. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mortality of stroke were significantly lower in the ACPC group than in the control group. Urinary Na(+) and Cl(-) excretion and plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were increased in the ACPC group. Western analysis detected proteins that were immunoreactive to anti-nitrotyrosine antibody and showed lower levels of expression in the cerebral cortex compared to that in the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was reduced in the ACPC group. Quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that administration of ACPC also significantly decreased the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA in the hippocampus and endotherial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA in the cerebral cortex, and drastically increased HO-1 mRNA in the cerebral cortex. Enhanced HO-1 staining on sections from the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was observed in the ACPC group. These data suggest that the normalization by ACPC of blood pressure elevation and mortality of stroke involves induction of the expression of HO-1, which exerts antioxidant and vascular relaxation effects, in SHRSP.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
The Journal of general virology,A humanized murine monoclonal antibody protects mice either before or after challenge with virulent Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus.,"A humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been developed and its potential to protect from or cure a Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEEV) infection was evaluated. The VEEV-neutralizing, protective murine mAb 3B4C-4 was humanized using combinatorial antibody libraries and phage-display technology. Humanized VEEV-binding Fabs were evaluated for virus-neutralizing capacity, then selected Fabs were converted to whole immunoglobulin (Ig) G1, and stable cell lines were generated. The humanized mAb Hy4-26C, designated Hy4 IgG, had virus-neutralizing capacity similar to that of 3B4C-4. Passive antibody protection studies with purified Hy4 IgG were performed in adult Swiss Webster mice. As little as 100 ng Hy4 IgG protected 90 % of mice challenged with 100 intraperitoneal (i.p.) mean morbidity (MD(50)) doses of virulent VEEV (Trinidad donkey) 24 h after antibody transfer; also, 500 mug Hy4 IgG protected 80 % of mice inoculated with 100 intranasal MD(50) doses of VEEV. Moreover, 10 mug passive Hy4 IgG protected 70 % of mice from a VEEV challenge dose as great as 10(7) i.p. MD(50). Hy4 IgG also protected mice from challenge with another epizootic VEEV variety, 1C (P676). Importantly, therapeutic administration of the humanized mAb to mice already infected with VEEV cured 90 % of mice treated with Hy4 IgG within 1 h of VEEV inoculation and 75 % of mice treated 24 h after virus infection.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",Apigenin Ameliorates Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction and Neuronal Damage in Mice.,"We investigated the protective effect and mechanisms of apigenin against cognitive impairments in a scopolamine-injected mouse model. Our results showed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of scopolamine leads to learning and memory dysfunction, whereas the administration of apigenin (synthetic compound, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) improved cognitive ability, which was confirmed by behavioral tests such as the T-maze test, novel objective recognition test, and Morris water maze test in mice. In addition, scopolamine-induced lipid peroxidation in the brain was attenuated by administration of apigenin. To further evaluate the protective mechanisms of apigenin on cognitive and memory function, Western blot analysis was carried out. Administration of apigenin decreased the B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio and suppressed caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. Furthermore, apigenin down-regulated the β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme, along with presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 protein levels. Apigenin-administered mice showed lower protein levels of a receptor for advanced glycation end-products, whereas insulin-degrading enzyme, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression were promoted by treatment with apigenin. Therefore, this study demonstrated that apigenin is an active substance that can improve cognitive and memory functions by regulating apoptosis, amyloidogenesis, and BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Medicina,[Cadasil: a case with molecular diagnosis].,"CADASIL disease (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) was described in 1991 by Tourmier-Lasserve. Two years later the same authors described its association with chromosome 19; nonetheless, the mutations in gene Notch3 were not described until 1996. Clinical findings depend on the age at onset. The early form of the illness is found in young patients, generally less than 30 years old, and the main clinical manifestation is a migraine headache with subcortical lesions in the white matter, while in the later form ischemic events and behavioral symptoms are predominant. Anatomo-pathological findings in CADASIL include the presence of osmophilic granular deposits in vessel walls, skin, muscles and cerebral arteries. We present a patient with CADASIL and cavernous angioma. We studied a 40-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a left temporal-parietal cavernous angioma, with aphasia as the only symptom, two years before admission. Her family history showed that her father had suffered from vascular dementia. She was admitted to our hospital with right-side hemiparesis and dysarthria. A CT scan showed the presence of ischemic vascular lesions and former surgery sequelae. The duplex scan of the neck vessels and a transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out an embolic source. Laboratory tests including VDRL, HIV, prothrombotic profile and rheumatologic screening tests were normal. An MRI in T2W and FLAIR showed the presence of multiple subcortical cerebral lesions and hyperintensity in the white matter (leukoencephalopaty). We found a left acute putaminal-capsular infarct in the diffusion-MRI. The MRA was normal. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid was unremarkable. A molecular DNA test was performed, and a nucleotide substitution in position 583 in exon 4 of gene Notch3 was detected. This mutation was found only in CADASIL patients. The association with cavernous angioma has not been previously reported, and we believe that it was unrelated to CADASIL, either clinically or genetically. To our knowledge, this is the first case of CADASIL diagnosed by molecular DNA test in our country.",Human-case-report,4,0

Research indicates that people with AvPD also show disturbances in narrative identity, which is an internal and evolving story created about the personal past, present, and presumed future. Here, the novel Guide for Narrative Repair (GNaR) recently developed by (Thomsen et al., 2020) is introduced as a potentially useful tool to help people with AvPD in crafting more adaptive narrative identities. The guide is brought to life via a case study analysis of Adam, a male outpatient suffering from AvPD.

JPMA. The Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association,Cerebral toxoplasmosis in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"Cerebral toxoplasmosis commonly affects patients with advanced HIV immunodeficiency. Toxoplasmosis in patients who are immunocompromised can be severe and debilitating in patients with Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement and the condition may be fatal. We report the case of a 40-year-old man who was a known case of HIV and presented with cerebral toxoplasmosis. His Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan showed multiple ring enhancing lesions with extensive surrounding oedema in supratentorial as well as infratentorial region. Lesions were mainly located in the periventricular region as well as at the grey-white matter junction and showed enhancement in the periphery as well as a tiny nodular enhancement in the centre. Patient was started on Septran DS, empirically for toxoplasmosis and steroids to reduce intracranial pressure. On follow up MRI scan after 10 days there was a reduction in size, number and enhancement of the masses with decrease in the surrounding oedema. Patient was clinically stable, oriented and his fever settled. He was discharged from hospital on same medication and advised to continue regular follow-up.",Human-case-report,4,0
Journal of child neurology,Use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator in a 16-year-old patient with basilar occlusion.,"Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ischemic stroke in patients > 18 years of age who present within 3 hours of stroke onset and meet certain criteria. We report a case of a 16-year-old, previously healthy female who presented with a basilar artery occlusion and pontine ischemic stroke. She was treated with intravenous t-PA approximately 4 hours after the onset of symptoms. The patient demonstrated a remarkable recovery 6 hours after onset of her symptoms and had minimal deficits on discharge from the hospital 1 week later. She was found to have a lupus anticoagulant and was heterozygous for the prothrombin gene G2010A mutation. These were likely contributing causes for her stroke. She was also homozygous for plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) 4G/4G, which at present is a controversial stroke risk factor.",Human-case-report,4,0
Molecular genetics and metabolism,Expanding the genetic cause of multiple sulfatase deficiency: A novel SUMF1 variant in a patient displaying a severe late infantile form of the disease.,"Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by defective cellular sulfatases. Activity of sulfatases depends on post-translational modification catalyzed by formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), encoded by the SUMF1 gene. SUMF1 pathologic variants cause MSD, a syndrome presenting with a complex phenotype. We describe the first Polish patient with MSD caused by a yet undescribed pathologic variant c.337G>A [p.Glu113Lys] (i.e. p.E113K) in heterozygous combination with the known deletion allele c.519+5_519+8del [p.Ala149_Ala173del]. The clinical picture of the patient initially suggested late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy, with developmental delay followed by regression of visual, hearing and motor abilities as the most apparent clinical symptoms. Transient signs of ichthyosis and minor dysmorphic features guided the laboratory workup towards MSD. Since MSD is a rare disease and there is a variable clinical spectrum, we thoroughly describe the clinical outcome of our patient. The FGE-E113K variant, expressed in cell culture, correctly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum but was retained intracellularly in contrast to the wild type FGE. Analysis of FGE-mediated activation of steroid sulfatase in immortalized MSD cells revealed that FGE-E113K exhibited only approx. 15% of the activity of wild type FGE. Based on the crystal structure we predict that the exchange of glutamate-113 against lysine should induce a strong destabilization of the secondary structure, possibly affecting the folding for correct disulfide bridging between C235-C346 as well as distortion of the active site groove that could affect both the intracellular stability as well as the activity of FGE. Thus, the novel variant of the SUMF1 gene obviously results in functionally impaired FGE protein leading to a severe late infantile type of MSD.",Human-case-report,4,0
Pituitary,First demonstration of the effectiveness of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with 111In-DTPA-octreotide in a giant PRL-secreting pituitary adenoma resistant to conventional treatment.,"In prolactin-secreting giant adenomas, cabergoline treatment is the first line approach. Surgery and/or radiotherapy are indicated when the tumour is resistant to medical treatment and continues growing, causing visual field impairment. Data concerning other therapeutic approach are scanty. Although PRL-secreting tumours may express somatostatin receptors type 2, 3 and 5, somatostatin analogs treatment is generally ineffective and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has never been reported. A 58 year-old woman complaining of severe neurological symptoms caused by a giant prolactinoma, relapsing after surgery and not-responding to dopamine-agonists and octreotide LAR treatment, underwent four cycles of PRRT with 111-Indium-DTPA-octreotide with remarkable tumour shrinkage and a significant improvement in clinical conditions. No side effects were reported. This is the first report on the effectiveness and safety of PRRT with radio-labelled somatostatin analogs in a patient with aggressive giant prolactinoma resistant to conventional treatment.",Human-case-report,4,0

Herein, we present a case of a 34-year-old man with a genetically confirmed Moyamoya disease who showed unilateral myoclonus as an initial manifestation. Neuroimaging studies showed prominent asymmetrically developed Moyamoya disease on the right hemisphere with near-complete loss of normal vessels while the left hemisphere was adjunctively fed with extension of posterior cerebral artery: uneven progression of vasculature. [99][m]Tc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography demonstrated impaired vascular reserve.

However, clinical disease due to arsenic containing ayurvedic medicines has rarely been reported. We seek to highlight the existence of toxic levels of arsenic in certain ayurvedic preparations that can produce serious systemic manifestations.	An 11-year-old girl developed manifestations of arsenical keratosis (punctuate palmoplantar keratoderma and leucomelanoderma) and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, 6 months and 18 months respectively after intake of ayurvedic medications, prescribed for epilepsy. The eight ayurvedic preparations consumed by the patient and her serum levels were analyzed for arsenic content.	Arsenic content of ayurvedic medicines ranged from 5 mg/L to 248 mg/L. The serum arsenic level was 202.20 microg/L (normal < 60 microg/L). Skin manifestations improved after the discontinuation of ayurvedic medications.	Ayurvedic medications should be consumed under strict guidance and supervision of qualified practitioners to prevent such catastrophies.",Human-case-report,4,0
Clinical neuroradiology,[Intracerebral hemorrhage misjudged as tumor].,"Report of a 33-year-old woman who had sudden vision problems and homonymous hemianopia on the left. A cranial computed tomography (CCT) was carried out in a radiologic practice. A native homogeneous, smooth-edged hyperdense intracerebral mass of about 5.5 cm diameter on the right parietooccipital region with density values of +50 HU was found. Only a small proportion of about 2 cm diameter was more hyperdense with density values of +65 HU. Following intravenous administration of contrast medium, a patchy increase in density of about 1 cm was seen. The mass had only a thin hypodense rim. The patient was informed that she had a tumor. Three days later, magnetic resonance imaging was to be done for further evaluation. After the patient had returned home, she had headaches, nausea and vomiting in the evening. At night, she was admitted to a hospital as emergency case. With further increase of intracranial pressure, a craniotomy was done and a hemorrhage was removed. Histologically, a bleeding of a cavernous hemangioma was found. The patient appealed to the fact-finding board for medical liability questions because she had not been admitted to a hospital immediately after the CCT. Therefore, surgery was done delayed. The board found that the behavior of the radiologist was wrong.

Journal de pharmacie de Belgique,Basic epidemiology of opiate misuse substitution treatment in Belgium.,"The Substitution Treatment National Registry provided from mid 2006 till mid 2009 an exhaustive documentation on all patients being prescribed methadone or buprenorphine in Belgium. This endeavour was possible through cooperation of all community pharmacies and their representative organizations was supported at the time by the former Health federal minister. The Liberal belgian opiate medical substitution process authorizes untill now de facto any doctor to prescribe methadone and pharmacists are supported to dispense it. Results show the regional, provincial and county numbers of professionals and patients prevalence in the population. Nationwide, n = 16974 patients (prevalence for population aged 20-64: 26/10000) have been offered substitution from mid 2008 till mid 2009, n = 3390 pharmacies 164,4% of all pharmacies) and n = 2937 MDs (16,75% of all MDs) have been involved. Subutex or Suboxone have been dispensed to 11,1% of substitution patients with 7,4% receiving only buprenorphine on a yearly basis. Number of substitution patients by MD and prevalence by gender, age group and region are presented. Important variations are observed locally, possibly mirroring heroin addiction due to widespread access to substitution treatment. Younger patients are more prevalent in semi rural or border areas. The exhaustivity of available data enables also to observe patients quitting substitution altogether and a strong difference of maintenance rate is observed favoring methadone over buprenorphine.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,Cognitive functions of epileptic patients on monotherapy with phenobarbitone and healthy controls.,"Quantitative measurements have indicated that heredity, cerebral damage, psycho-social aspects, ictal and inter-ictal phenomena and antiepileptic drugs may interfere in the cognitive dysfunction of epileptic patients. In the present study objective methods included immediate and late recall and recognition of pictures, Stroop test and auditory selection. Twenty patients with symptomatic localized epilepsy aged 17-52 years (27 +/- 10, mean +/- sd) were compared to age and socially matched healthy controls. Patients were on therapeutic serum concentrations (25 +/- 12 mu/ml) of phenobarbitone and had active epilepsy with 1.94 generalized tonic-clonic, 0.85 simple partial and 6.28 complex partial seizures monthly (means). Patients performed worse than controls in all 6 tests (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.001), indicating a generalized cognitive deficit related to seizures and/or barbiturate therapy. We suggest further studies should be carried out in populations with uniform monotherapeutic regimens and epileptic syndromes in order to isolate factors related to the cognitive dysfunction of epileptic patients.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This was a prospective observational questionnaire study using ePAQ-PF (electronic Pelvic Assessment Questionnaire-Pelvic Floor), PISQ 12 and PGI-I for overactive bladder and sexual function. Sexually active women with overactive bladder were included in the study. Prolapse and voiding dysfunction were exclusion criteria for the study. All women were followed up for 6 months and were treatment naïve. Sexual function before and after treatment was compared. The data were analysed using SPSS. Formal ethical approval was obtained.	34 women were included in the study. Only 8 % of women commenced on anticholinergics had an improvement in sexual function, compared to 66 % who experienced an improvement in OAB symptoms. Women who did experience a benefit in sexual function did so in the first 3 months of treatment of their overactive bladder and always noted an improvement in OAB symptoms.

We enrolled Japanese spinal cord injury patients with cystometrically confirmed neurogenic detrusor overactivity who experienced urinary incontinence at least once a week either because they were refractory to anticholinergics or had to discontinue treatment because of adverse events. Patients received 200 units of onabotulinumtoxinA injected into the bladder wall after a 2-week washout of anticholinergics, and urodynamic variables were assessed before and 1 month after injection. Catheterization and urinary incontinence data, as well as International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form scores, were assessed before injection and every month thereafter until the cessation of treatment effects.	The study enrolled 19 patients (13 men, six women, age range 22-67 years). One month after injection, the mean number of urinary incontinence episodes decreased from 4.3 to 1.5 times/day (P = 0.004), and the maximum cystometric capacity increased from 100 mL to 296 mL (P = 0.0004). The rate of effective cases whose daily urinary incontinence frequency was decreased to less than 50% was 74%. The duration of efficacy without anticholinergic medication ranged from 3 to 12 months (median 8.5 months). Clinically significant adverse events were not observed.

Journal of medicine and life,A retrospective study of Cerebrolysin in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: Cognitive and functional outcomes.,"In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the neurotrophic compound Cerebrolysin on executive, cognitive, and functional performance in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) with a highly severe disability level. A total of 44 patients were included in the study, with 33 patients in the control group and 11 patients in the interventional group who received intravenous infusions of 30 mL Cerebrolysin. Both groups received standard rehabilitation therapy following the rehabilitation protocol for patients with TBI at Hospital Clínico Mutual de Seguridad. Functional and cognitive scales were evaluated at baseline, at four months, and at the endpoint of the intervention therapy at seven months (on average). The results revealed a significant improvement in the Cerebrolysin-treated group compared to the control group. Specifically, patients who received Cerebrolysin showed a moderate residual disability and a significant reduction in the need for care. Concerning the promising results and considering the limitations of the retrospective study design, we suggest that randomized controlled studies be initiated to corroborate the positive findings for Cerebrolysin in patients with moderate to severe brain trauma.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

There have been reports suggesting that amoxapine itself or its metabolites have neuroleptic as well as antidepressant properties. With in vitro studies using a radioreceptor assay for neuroleptics, the authors found that amoxapine--and one of its metabolites in particular (7-hydroxyamoxapine)--have potent neuroleptic-like activity. Furthermore, blood specimens from patients receiving amoxapine showed the presence of neuroleptic activity in the same assay.

Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,Influence of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase inducers and inhibitors on the plasma lamotrigine concentration in pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy.,"This study evaluated the influence of concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the plasma concentration of lamotrigine (LTG) in pediatric patients with epilepsy. We retrospectively reviewed 1653 plasma samples from 709 patients (aged 6 months to 16 years) and compared the concentration-to-dose ratio (CD ratio) of LTG among different AED regimens. The median CD ratio of patients receiving LTG monotherapy was 1.25 μg/mL/mg/kg. In patients receiving LTG plus VPA, the CD ratio was increased by about 140%. The CD ratio was elevated from a low VPA concentration (<40 μg/mL) and the increase was VPA concentration-dependent. In contrast, the median CD ratio of patients treated with LTG plus the inducers phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine was 0.42, 0.63, and 0.66, respectively, and phenytoin significantly reduced the CD ratio in comparison with phenobarbital or carbamazepine (p < 0.001). Pediatric patients of all ages beyond infancy showed similar susceptibility to VPA or inducers, but infants had higher CD ratios compared with the other age groups. Among other AEDs, topiramate, ethosuximide, and rufinamide reduced the CD ratio. These findings should be useful for estimating interactions between LTG and concomitant AEDs.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
The International journal on drug policy,New psychoactive substance use as a survival strategy in rural marginalised communities in Hungary.,"New psychoactive substance (NPS) use has become a widespread phenomenon among marginalised communities in Hungary. Since 2010, a growing number of reports in grey literature and anecdotal information among professionals have become available on NPS use among previously unaffected groups, such as people living in rural, socioeconomically deprived communities. In our research, we aimed to explore NPS use among these communities.	We conducted a mixed method research with convergent parallel design. Data collection took place in 2017 in marginalised communities in villages in two regions in Hungary, where 150 questionnaires were recorded and 50 interviews were conducted with current NPS users.	According to the survey results, NPS is very easy to access, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist (SCRA) are easily bought in marginalised rural communities (79% found SCRA easy to obtain). Both SCRA and synthetic cathinones are used regularly; 57% of SCRA users and 37% of synthetic cathinone users used the respective substance at least once a week in the past 30 days. Besides NPS, sedative use (without prescription) and alcohol consumption are common among the respondents. 17% of the sample has already injected NPS. The overwhelming majority of the respondents rated regular consumption of NPS as 'very dangerous' (SCRA: 75%, synthetic cathinones 72%). NPS users have limited knowledge of consequences and the social and health treatment options available. Most themes in the interviews are associated with surviving stress, crisis and anxiety, as well as the wish to escape from insecurity and chaotic life. Positive effects of substance use (community, joy, energy) are rarely present.	People who use drugs (PWUD) living in these rural communities face the consequences of the rural risk environment: easy access to NPS, inadequate access to services, poor labour market situation and attributions of marginalised groups, for example disaffiliation. NPS use is not a recreational activity in this population; individuals mainly use NPS to get away from reality, problems, pain, poverty and marginalisation. NPS use is a survival strategy. Effective responses have to address substance use and social integration; we need complex interventions addressing structural factors.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Stroke,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use is associated with reduced plasma concentration of C-reactive protein in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke.,"High levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with an increased risk of future cardiovascular events in ischemic stroke. It has been hypothesized that the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients at high vascular risk may also result from their anti-inflammatory action. Data evaluating this hypothesis are limited in ischemic stroke.	We conducted a prospective observational study in 507 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke to analyze the effect of ACE inhibitor treatment at the time of stroke onset on CRP levels within the first 24 hours and the relationship to outcome. Risk estimates were calculated according to Cox regression analysis controlled for blood pressure (BP) levels, clinical and neuroradiological confounding variables, and log-normalized CRP levels at entry.	ACE inhibitor treatment was associated with lower (2.6-fold; P<0.0001) median CRP levels and with a reduced 2-year cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.53; P<0.0001) compared with a different BP-lowering regimen. The relationship between ACE inhibitor status and log-normalized CRP levels remained significant (P<0.0001) after we controlled for important confounding variables and concomitant treatments. The reduced risk was also evident in multivariable analysis when ACE inhibitor treatment was controlled for BP, associated risk factors, neuroradiological findings, and concomitant treatments (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.62; P<0.0001). This risk reduction was greatly attenuated and not more significant when log-normalized CRP levels were included (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.04; P=0.0721) in the model.	Concomitant treatment with ACE inhibitor at the time of an acute stroke is associated with lower inflammatory response and better long-term outcomes, apparently apart from the effects on BP.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Journal of affective disorders,A preliminary open trial of nefazodone added to mood stabilizers for bipolar depression.,"Little information exists on the use of nefazodone to treat bipolar depression. We hypothesized that nefazodone added to a standard mood stabilizer would show significant antidepressant efficacy with minimal agitation or induction of mania, by virtue of its selective 5-HT(2A) blockade.	Thirteen DSM-IV pure depressed-phase nonpsychotic bipolar outpatients received an open-label 8-week pilot trial of flexibly dosed nefazodone (mean±SD peak dose=462.5±164.0mg/day) with a concurrent mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic. Primary outcomes included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI-S).	All subjects completed at least 4 weeks of treatment, while 9 (69%) completed the 8-week protocol. Based on last observation point, 8 (62%) had at least a 50% reduction from baseline HAM-D scores. Significant improvement from baseline was observed in both HAM-D (z=2.05, p=.04) and CGI severity ratings (z=2.21, p=.03). Induction of mania occurred in 1 subject (7%). No subjects manifested clinical signs of hepatic failure, and none prematurely terminated the study due to other adverse events (most common side effects included fatigue, insomnia, nausea, or headache).	This was a small open-label pilot study with use of varied concomitant pharmacotherapies and no placebo comparator.	While nefazodone is seldom used in clinical practice due to concerns about rare but severe hepatotoxicity, it may represent a model for postsynaptic 5HT(2A) antagonism that mechanistically could help to inform the development of future treatments for bipolar depression.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Low rate of membrane lithium transport during treatment correlates with outcome of maintenance pharmacotherapy in bipolar disorder.,"Lithium is transported across cell membranes by an exchange diffusion process (Na(+)-Li+ countertransport) that is inhibited during lithium treatment. We hypothesized that low rates of lithium efflux (a potential manifestation of strong transport inhibition) would be associated with better clinical outcome of maintenance pharmacotherapy. We measured the erythrocyte (RBC) apparent rate constant for lithium efflux (kexch) in 22 patients with bipolar disorder who had been euthymic on lithium for 1 month. Subsequently, clinical mood ratings and in vivo RBC: plasma lithium ratios (LiR) were determined monthly. Outcome was categorized according to whether subjects completed 1 year of successful maintenance treatment (n = 10), experienced a recurrent affective episode (n = 8), or dropped out (n = 4). The kexch at the outset of the study was significantly lower (potentially because of greater transport inhibition) in 1-year completers than in patients with recurrences or those who dropped out (median kexch = 0.09, 0.24, and 0.27 h-1, respectively; P < .03). Moreover, 77% of patients with a kexch of 0.11 h-1 or lower were successfully maintained on lithium for 1 year, whereas only 23% of those with a kexch greater than or equal to 0.12 h-1 had a successful treatment outcome. LiR measured during the course of maintenance treatment was significantly higher (suggesting greater transport inhibition) in 1-year completers than in noncompleters (recurrences and dropouts). Measurement of kexch at an early point in treatment may provide a means for prospectively identifying those bipolar patients at greater risk for failure of maintenance lithium therapy.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Experimental brain research,Dopamine boosts intention and action awareness in Parkinson's disease.,"Dopaminergic deficiency in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with underactivation of the supplementary motor area and a reduction of voluntary actions. In these patients, awareness of intention to act has been shown to be delayed. However, delayed awareness of intention to act has also been shown in patients with hyperdopaminergic states and an excess of unwilled movements, as in Tourette's, and in patients with functional movement disorders. Hence, the role of dopamine in the awareness of intention and action remains unclear. 36 PD patients were tested ON and OFF dopaminergic medication and compared with 35 healthy age-matched controls. In addition, 17 PD patients with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) were tested ON medication and ON and OFF stimulation. Participants judged either the moment a self-generated action was performed, or the moment the urge to perform the action was felt, using the 'Libet method'. Temporal judgments of intention and action awareness were comparable between unmedicated PD patients and controls. Dopaminergic medication boosted anticipatory awareness of both intentions and actions in PD patients, relative to an unmedicated condition. The difference between ON/OFF DBS was not statistically reliable. Functional improvement of motor ability in PD through dopaminergic supplementation leads to earlier awareness of both intention, and of voluntary action.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

However, clinical studies are conducted with specific populations that differ from the real world. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of alectinib in real-world settings. Patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EML4-ALK fusion were enrolled from two medical centers between June 2018 and June 2020. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) to alectinib. The secondary endpoint was response of brain metastases. The risk factors for disease progression were also investigated. In total, 127 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled into this study. Of them, 54.3% received first-line alectinib. The 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 77.4% and 68.3%, respectively. ORR and disease control rate (DCR) were 53.5% and 91.3%, respectively. Among patients with brain metastases, intracranial ORR and DCR were 63.6% and 88.6%, respectively. In addition, we found that 'crizotinib pretreatment', 'liver metastasis' and 'TP53 co-mutation' were individually associated with shorter PFS in alectinib treatment. In conclusion, this study confirms the salient clinical outcomes of alectinib for ALK-fusion-driven NSCLC patients with or without brain metastases, adding real-world evidence to the priority of alectinib in clinical practice.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Obstetrics and gynecology,Antenatal Corticosteroids and Outcomes in Preterm Twins.,"To estimate whether improvement in outcomes from antenatal corticosteroid treatment in extremely and very preterm twins is similar to that observed in singletons, and to investigate whether antenatal corticosteroid treatment has different effects according to chorionicity or birth order.	This population-based study was based on an analysis of data collected by the Neonatal Research Network of Japan from 2003 to 2015 of neonates weighing 1,500 g or less at birth, from gestational ages of 24 0/7 to 31 6/7 weeks of gestation. After propensity score matching, univariate logistic and interaction analyses were performed to compare short-term (neonatal period) and medium-term (3 years of age) outcomes of the children of mothers who received antenatal corticosteroids with those of children of mothers who did not receive antenatal corticosteroids. We focused on differences between singletons and twins, between monochorionic and dichorionic twins and between the first and second twin.	The study comprised 23,502 singletons and 6,546 twins. Antenatal corticosteroid treatment was associated with significant decreased short-term neurologic outcomes in both singletons and twins. However, antenatal corticosteroid treatment was associated with significantly decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.53-0.70), respiratory distress syndrome (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67-0.76), and cerebral palsy (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) in singletons but not in twins (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68-1.17; OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87-1.12; and OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61-1.11, respectively). No association was found between chorionicity and the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on outcomes. Further, no association was found between birth order and the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on outcomes, except for periventricular leukomalacia and necrotizing enterocolitis (interaction: P=.02 and P=.04, respectively).	Antenatal corticosteroid treatment in twins was associated with a beneficial effect on short-term neurologic outcomes only, without improvement in other short-term and medium-term outcomes. There was no difference related to chorionicity.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Journal of autoimmunity,Impact of cytokine in type 1 narcolepsy: Role of pandemic H1N1 vaccination ?,"Recent advances in the identification of susceptibility genes and environmental exposures (pandemic influenza 2009 vaccination) provide strong support that narcolepsy type 1 is an immune-mediated disease. Considering the limited knowledge regarding the immune mechanisms involved in narcolepsy whether related to flu vaccination or not and the recent progresses in cytokine measurement technology, we assessed 30 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors using the Luminex technology in either peripheral (serum) or central (CSF) compartments in a large population of 90 children and adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 in comparison to 58 non-hypocretin deficient hypersomniacs and 41 healthy controls. Furthermore, we compared their levels in patients with narcolepsy whether exposed to pandemic flu vaccine or not, and analyzed the effect of age, duration of disease and symptom severity. Comparison for sera biomarkers between narcolepsy (n = 84, 54 males, median age: 15.5 years old) and healthy controls (n = 41, 13 males, median age: 20 years old) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of several pro- and anti-inflammatory serum cytokines and growth factors with interferon-γ, CCL11, epidermal growth factor, and interleukin-2 receptor being independently associated with narcolepsy. Increased levels of interferon-γ, CCL11, and interleukin-12 were found when close to narcolepsy onset. After several adjustments, only one CSF biomarker differed between narcolepsy (n = 44, 26 males, median age: 15 years old) and non-hypocretin deficient hypersomnias (n = 57, 24 males, median age: 36 years old) with higher CCL 3 levels found in narcolepsy. Comparison for sera biomarkers between patients with narcolepsy who developed the disease post-pandemic flu vaccination (n = 36) to those without vaccination (n = 48) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of three cytokines, regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted, CXCL10, and CXCL9, being independently and significantly increased in the group exposed to the vaccine. No significant differences were found between narcoleptics whether exposed to flu vaccination or not for CSF biomarkers except for a lower CXCL10 level found in the exposed group. To conclude, we highlighted the role of sera cytokine with pro-inflammatory properties and especially interferon-γ being independently associated with narcolepsy close to disease onset. The activity of the interferon-γ network was also increased in the context of narcolepsy after the pandemic flu vaccination being a potential key player in the immune mechanism that triggers narcolepsy and that coordinates the immune response necessary for resolving vaccination assaults.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Drug and alcohol dependence,Buprenorphine in primary care: risk factors for treatment injection and implications for clinical management.,"Though the introduction of office-based buprenorphine has greatly contributed to stem the HIV epidemic since 1995, concerns have been raised about the intravenous use of buprenorphine even in patients on substitution treatment. The aim of this study was to identify which factors are predictive of buprenorphine injection in patients receiving office-based buprenorphine.	Subazur is a survey consisting of two longitudinal assessments of 111 stabilized patients receiving office-based buprenorphine in southeastern France.	Patients were interviewed by phone at enrolment and 6 months later about social characteristics, addictive behaviors, treatment experiences, overdoses and suicide ideation or attempt. A logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to identify factors associated with buprenorphine injection at any interview.	Among the 111 patients (32% women, mean age 38 years), 36 reported buprenorphine injection after having started treatment initiation in 40 interviews. After adjustment for time since first injection, individuals perceiving their prescribed dosage as inadequate (OR=2.6 95%CI[1.2-5.7]) and those reporting a history of suicide ideation or attempt (OR=2.7 95%CI[1.1-7.0]) had approximately a three-fold higher risk of injecting buprenorphine.	Providing adequate care for both drug dependence and psychiatric comorbidities in primary care is a major issue. Like heroin use during methadone treatment, buprenorphine injection should be regarded more as a response to inadequate care than simply as a 'misuse'. A re-assessment of the treatment efficacy through a possible dosage increase or a switch to methadone could potentially reduce diversion and assure sustained adherence to OST.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,The effects of greater occipital nerve blockage with lidocaine on sleep characteristics in chronic migraine patients.,"The aim of our study was to determine the effects of greater occipital nerve block (GONB) with lidocaine on sleep characteristics in patients with chronic migraine.	Twenty female patients who underwent GONB with lidocaine were included in the study. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale (RLSSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and headache diary results before and after the treatment of the patients were compared.	We included 20 patients (all females) in our study. The mean age was 35.80 ± 8.82 years (range 24-50). After GON blockade, the number of days with pain (p < 0.001), duration of pain (p < 0.001), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score (p < 0.001) were significantly lower than before. After GONB, BDI (p = 0.007), BAI (p = 0.022), ISI (p = 0.009), and PSQI (p = 0.026) scores were significantly lower than before. After GONB, sleep quality was better than before (p = 0.035).	This study showed that GONB with lidocaine can improve sleep quality, insomnia, and symptoms of depression and anxiety while reducing migraine headache.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Pediatric neurosurgery,The results of a practice survey on the management of patients with shunted hydrocephalus.,"The care of patients with shunted hydrocephalus is one of the most common clinical problems facing a pediatric neurosurgeon. Despite the prevalence of this clinical entity, it is our impression that the management strategies for these patients vary significantly amongst pediatric neurosurgeons. In an effort to better understand how varied these practices are, we surveyed 261 neurosurgeons with an expressed interest in pediatric neurosurgery, of whom 149 (57%) responded. The survey contained questions pertaining to preoperative and intraoperative management, choice of shunt valve, treatment philosophies with respect to shunt revision, evaluation process for potential shunt malfunction, treatment strategies for shunt infections and routine follow-up care. The answers to the questions confirmed our expectations that there are a variety of ways to manage these patients.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Gastroenterology,The nature and prognostic significance of serial amino acid determinations in severe chronic active liver disease.,"Serum amino acid levels were determined in 29 patients with severe chronic active liver disease before, during, and after administration of prednisone or placebo and in 22 healthy controls. The pretreatment molar ratio of amino acids was less in patients than in controls (p less than 0.001) and was lower in those with cirrhosis (p less than 0.02). Branched-chain amino acid levels were elevated in patients without cirrhosis (p less than 0.02) but not in those with cirrhosis; aromatic amino acid concentrations were increased in all (p less than 0.01). The ratio improved with remission and predicted behavior after discontinuation of treatment. Patients who deteriorated failed to improve the ratio and those whose ratio improved incompletely relapsed. The ratio correlated with histologic severity and serum concentrations of albumin, bilirubin, and gamma-globulin and not with clinical manifestations of encephalopathy. We conclude that amino acid abnormalities reflect liver dysfunction and that normalization of the molar ratio may have therapeutic and prognostic significance.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
International clinical psychopharmacology,A controlled study of the efficacy and safety of mianserin and maprotiline in outpatients with major depression.,"Efficacy and tolerability of mianserin (60-90 mg/day) or maprotiline (100-150 mg/day) were tested in a 4-week double-blind control group study on 317 depressive outpatients. The patients had to fulfill the criteria of a major depression according to DSM-III. The study was performed by psychiatrists after special rater training. Standardized rating procedures were applied to evaluate depressive symptoms and unwanted effects at three measurement points. A significant improvement was found in both groups, without any statistical differences between mianserin and maprotiline. According to the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) 65% of the patients in both groups were judged as responders. A good tolerability of both drugs were demonstrated. With respect to anticholinergic side-effects there was a certain advantage in favor to mianserin.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,Does hormone therapy affect attention and memory in sleep-deprived women?,"To evaluate whether hormone therapy (HT) modifies cognitive performance during sleep deprivation in postmenopausal women. Comparison was made with a group of young women.	Participants included 26 postmenopausal women (age 58-72 years, 16 HT users, 10 non-users), 11 young women (age 20-26 years). They spent four consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. Cognitive tests of attention, working memory, and verbal episodic memory were carried out after the baseline night, 25-h sleep deprivation, and recovery night.	Sleep deprivation impaired performance in all groups. It was manifested either as delayed practice effect or deteriorated performance (p < 0.05). In simple reaction time and 10-choice reaction time, non-users and young maintained their performance, whereas HT users suffered a minor impairment (p < 0.01). In other measurements, there was no interaction of group and condition. In 10-choice reaction time and vigilance, postmenopausal women made fewer errors and omissions than the young (p < 0.05). For most tasks, all groups showed improvement after one recovery night.	HT had a minor adverse effect on cognitive performance during sleep deprivation. Attention and memory deteriorated similarly in postmenopausal and young women, despite the lower initial performance level of postmenopausal women. One night of sleep ensured recovery in most tasks.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
BJU international,"Increased urinary nitrite excretion in primary enuresis: effects of indomethacin treatment on urinary and serum osmolality and electrolytes, urinary volumes and nitrite excretion.","To assess urinary nitrite excretion, a stable end product of nitric oxide (NO), in patients with enuresis and in normal controls, and to evaluate the effects of indomethacin (a potent prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor) on urinary nitrite excretion, other urinary variables and bladder capacity.	The study comprised 10 patients with primary enuresis and 10 normal comparable controls (age range 6-14 years). Nitrite was assayed in 'spot' morning urine samples in both the enuretics and normal controls. Enuretics were then given 50 mg indomethacin suppositories each night; urine volume, urinary osmolality and electrolytes, serum osmolality and electrolytes and urinary nitrite were assayed before indomethacin treatment and after 15 days of treatment.	The mean (sd) urinary nitrite excretion was 24.4 (19.6) micromol/L in normal children and 275.9 (111.2) micromol/L in enuretics (P<0.05). With indomethacin, the urinary nitrite concentration was significantly decreased to 141 (45.1) micromol/L (P<0.05) and associated with a significant reduction in bed-wetting episodes and voiding frequency. The functional bladder capacity was <70% of the predicted value for age in six of the patients; they had significant improvements on indomethacin, to values similar to those in patients with a nearly normal functional bladder capacity. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary volume by 41%, the night volume by 40%, clearance of free water by 46% and increased the day : night urinary volume ratio by 55%. The absolute amounts of urinary calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, urea, creatinine, and glucose were lower on indomethacin, although not statistically significantly so. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary and 'spot' morning osmolality and osmotic clearance. There were no significant changes in serum osmolality and electrolyte concentrations. Indomethacin also decreased the absolute amount of urinary sodium, chloride and potassium, fractional sodium and potassium excretion, and filtered sodium. Creatinine clearance was decreased by 20% (P>0.05) and normal 24-h urinary protein was significantly lower, by 47%, after indomethacin treatment (P<0.05).	Urinary nitrite excretion increased significantly in patients with primary nocturnal enuresis; indomethacin markedly reduced bed-wetting episodes and decreased the frequency of voiding in enuretics with small or normal functional bladder capacity, which was associated with a significant decrease in urinary nitrite excretion. Indomethacin reduced bed-wetting by decreasing the urine volume, clearance of free water and urinary electrolytes, and through possible effects on bladder and urethral contraction, by inhibiting NO and prostaglandin synthesis. NO and prostaglandins might be important in the pathogenesis of primary enuresis.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
Sleep,Tiagabine is associated with sustained attention during sleep restriction: evidence for the value of slow-wave sleep enhancement?,"To evaluate the impact of enhanced slow-wave sleep (SWS) on behavioral, psychological, and physiologic changes resulting from sleep restriction	A double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled design was used to compare tiagabine, 8 mg, (a SWS-enhancing drug) to placebo during 4 nights of sleep restriction (time in bed = 5 hours per night). Behavioral, psychological, and physiologic measures of the impact of sleep restriction were compared between groups at baseline, during sleep restriction, and following recovery sleep.	Two sleep research laboratories.	Thirty-eight healthy adults; 9 men and 10 women (mean age: 26.0 +/- 6.1 years) in the placebo group and 8 men and 11 women (mean age: 26.7 +/- 8.1 years) in the tiagabine 8 mg group	Both experimental groups underwent 4 nights of sleep restriction. Each group received either tiagabine 8 mg or placebo on all sleep-restriction nights, and both groups received placebo on baseline and recovery nights.	Polysomnography documented a SWS-enhancing effect of tiagabine. The placebo group displayed the predicted deficits due to sleep restriction on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Compared with placebo, the tiagabine group did not demonstrate impairment in sustained attention on the Psychomotor Vigilance Test, performed better on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, reported more restorative sleep, and had less of an increase in afternoon-evening salivary free cortisol. Multiple Sleep Latency Test, ratings of sleepiness, recovery sleep, and other measures did not differ between groups.	To our knowledge these findings are the first to be consistent with the hypothesis that pharmacologic SWS enhancement reduces selective aspects of the behavioral, psychological, and physiologic impact of sleep restriction.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Neurology,"Relation of NSAIDs to incident AD, change in cognitive function, and AD pathology.","To examine the relation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to incident Alzheimer disease (AD), change in cognition, and AD pathology.	Participants were 1,019 older Catholic clergy followed up annually for up to 12 years (mean baseline age = 75.0 years, education = 18.1 years, Mini-Mental State Examination score = 28.5), enrolled in the Religious Orders Study, a longitudinal clinical-pathologic study of aging and AD. Clinical evaluations allowed for AD classification and assessment of global cognition and five cognitive domains. NSAIDs were identified by direct medication inspection at baseline and follow-up evaluations. Neuropathologic data were available on 328 deceased participants. AD pathology was summarized as a global measure and as measures of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. We used Cox proportional hazards models and mixed models for incident AD and cognitive decline, respectively, and logistic and linear regression for pathologic outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, and education.	Overall, we found no apparent relation of NSAIDs to incident AD (n = 209 cases), change in cognition, or AD pathology. The hazard ratio of incident AD was 1.19 (95% CI 0.87-1.62) comparing those using NSAIDs with those not using NSAIDs at baseline, and 0.84 (95% CI 0.63-1.11) for specific use of aspirin. Findings were similar in analyses in which we considered NSAID use during follow-up. NSAIDs were not related to change in cognition (all p values > 0.14). There was no relation of NSAIDs to global AD pathology or plaques or tangles.	These data do not support a strong relation between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Alzheimer disease or cognition. Consistent findings across clinical and pathologic outcomes provide additional confidence in these results.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The Journal of toxicological sciences,Biochemical evaluation of the neurotoxicity of MPTP and MPP[+] in embryonic and newborn mice.,"One of the toxicities caused by 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is damage to dopaminergic neurons. When injected into C57BL/6J mice, MPTP penetrates into the brain and is converted to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP[+]) by monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B in astrocytes. MPP[+] has high affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) on dopaminergic neurons, and is taken up into the cell to cause cell death. There have been relatively few researches on the acute MPTP toxicity to embryonic or newborn mice. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the influence of MPTP and MPP[+] on embryonic and newborn mice by measuring sequential changes in major indexes of MPTP toxicity and MPTP metabolism; levels of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), DAT, MAO-A and MAO-B. In addition, we measured the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in the brain of newborn mice. A single injection of MPTP and MPP[+] reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, in the brain of newborn mice about 6-12 hr after the injection. Similarly the levels of mRNAs and proteins of DAT and TH were lowered in the brain of embryonic and newborn mice as well. The levels of these indexes were generally recovered at 24 hr after injection, indicating that the neurotoxicity induced by a single injection of MPTP or MPP[+] is temporary and recoverable in embryonic and newborn mice. By contrast, no significant changes in the expression levels of MAO-A and MAO-B were observed in either MPTP- or MPP[+]-treated mice.",Animal-other,5,1
Neuroscience letters,Deletion of both ICAM-1 and C3 enhances severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis compared to C3-deficient mice.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and leukocyte infiltration, demyelination of neurons, and blood-brain barrier breakdown. The development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for MS is dependent on a number of components of the immune system including complement and adhesion molecules. Previous studies in our lab have examined the role of C3, the central complement component, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) a key cell adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation including the CNS. In these studies we demonstrated that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE is markedly attenuated in both ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) mice. Given the pivotal role that these proteins play in EAE, we hypothesized that EAE in ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) double mutant mice would likely fail to develop. Unexpectedly, EAE in ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice was only modestly attenuated compared to wild type mice and significantly worse than C3(-/-) mice. Leukocyte infiltration was commensurate with disease severity between the three groups of mice. Spinal cord T cells from ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice produced the highest levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, despite reduced disease severity compared to wild type mice. The mechanisms behind the elevated EAE severity in ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice may relate to altered homing of leukocytes or processing of self-antigens in the double mutant background.",Animal-other,5,1
Nature aging,Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Preserves Neuron Survival and Cognition in Alzheimer's Disease Models.,"Amyloid-induced neurodegeneration plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, we show that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) haploinsufficiency decreases BDNF and increases amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor in murine brain. Moreover, prior to disease onset, the TERT locus sustains accumulation of repressive epigenetic marks in murine and human AD neurons, implicating TERT repression in amyloid-induced neurodegeneration. To test the impact of sustained TERT expression on AD pathobiology, AD mouse models were engineered to maintain physiological levels of TERT in adult neurons, resulting in reduced Aβ accumulation, improved spine morphology, and preserved cognitive function. Mechanistically, integrated profiling revealed that TERT interacts with β-catenin and RNA polymerase II at gene promoters and upregulates gene networks governing synaptic signaling and learning processes. These TERT-directed transcriptional activities do not require its catalytic activity nor telomerase RNA. These findings provide genetic proof-of-concept for somatic TERT gene activation therapy in attenuating AD progression including cognitive decline.",Animal-other,5,1
Life sciences,Elevation of naloxone-sensitive 3H-dihydromorphine binding in hippocampal formation of genetically epilepsy-prone rats.,"3H-Dihydromorphine (DHM) binding sites were measured in the brain of non-epileptic control and GEPR rats using in vitro autoradiographic techniques. The number of naloxone-sensitive 3H-DHM binding sites was increased 38-57% in the pyramidal cell layer of ventral hippocampal CA3 and Ca1 of GEPR-3 and GEPR-9 rats compared to non-epileptic controls. No significant differences in 3H-DHM binding were observed in dorsal hippocampal formation, lateral entorhinal cortex, lateral geniculate or cerebellum. The results suggest that an increase in the number of opioid receptors in ventral hippocampus of GEPR rats may be one factor contributing to the enhanced sensitivity of GEPR-9 rats to the proconvulsant effects of morphine.",Animal-other,5,1
Physiology & behavior,Perinatal undernutrition associated to experimental model of cerebral palsy increases adverse effects on chewing in young rats.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of perinatal undernutrition on the sensorimotor pattern of chewing in rats submitted to cerebral palsy experimental model. A total of 60 male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into four groups: Nourished/Control (NC, n=15), Nourished/Cerebral Palsy (NCP, n=15); Undernourished/Control (UC, n=15) and Undernourished/Cerebral Palsy (UCP, n=15). Animals of cerebral palsy (CP) group were subjected to an experimental model based on the combination of perinatal anoxia associated with sensorimotor restriction of the hindlimb. In the rats were evaluated body weight gain, intake of breast milk, feed post-weaning consumption, parameters of the chewing, intra-oral sensitivity and muscle properties (muscle weight and distribution of types of fibers) of the masseter and digastric. Animals from undernourished CP group showed greater reduction in most data evaluated including body weight (P<0.05), food intake post-weaning (P<0.05), frequency of chewing cycles (P<0.05), duration of the reactions of 'taste' (P<0.05), muscle weight and decrease of the proportion of type IIB fibers in the masseter muscle (P<0.05). These results demonstrated in rats submitted a cerebral palsy that perinatal undernutrition intensifies the damage in morphological and functional parameters of chewing.",Animal-other,5,1
PLoS neglected tropical diseases,Post-treatment vascular leakage and inflammatory responses around brain cysts in porcine neurocysticercosis.,"Cysticidal treatment of neurocysticercosis, an infection of humans and pig brains with Taenia solium, results in an early inflammatory response directed to cysts causing seizures and focal neurological manifestations. Treatment-induced pericystic inflammation and its association with blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, as determined by Evans blue (EB) extravasation, was studied in infected untreated and anthelmintic-treated pigs. We compared the magnitude and extent of the pericystic inflammation, presence of EB-stained capsules, the level of damage to the parasite, expression of genes for proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue remodeling by quantitative PCR assays between treated and untreated infected pigs and between EB-stained (blue) and non stained (clear) cysts. Inflammatory scores were higher in pericystic tissues from EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts from untreated pigs and also from anthelmintic-treated pigs 48 hr and 120 hr after treatment. The degree of inflammation correlated with the severity of cyst wall damage and both increased significantly at 120 hours. Expression levels of the proinflammatory genes for IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α were higher in EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts and unaffected brain tissues, and were generally highest at 120 hr. Additionally, expression of some markers of immunoregulatory activity (IL-10, IL-2Rα) were decreased in EB-stained capsules. An increase in other markers for regulatory T cells (CTLA4, FoxP3) was found, as well as significant increases in expression of two metalloproteases, MMP1 and MMP2 at 48 hr and 120 hr post-treatment. We conclude that the increase in severity of the inflammation caused by treatment is accompanied by both a proinflammatory and a complex regulatory response, largely limited to pericystic tissues with compromised vascular integrity. Because treatment induced inflammation occurs in porcine NCC similar to that in human cases, this model can be used to investigate mechanisms involved in host damaging inflammatory responses and agents or modalities that may control damaging post treatment inflammation.",Animal-other,5,1
Journal of the neurological sciences,Regional tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase concentrations in the brains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis-infected mice.,"The neurotransmitter biosynthesis enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase were investigated in selected brain areas of Nya : NYLAR mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. Statistically significant alterations in the concentrations of both enzymes occurred in the olfactory, caudate, and neocortical regions at 5 days postinfection. No such alterations occurred in mice given cytoxan (150 mg/kg) 3 days postinfection and examined 5 days postinfection. At 10 days postinfection, however, the cytoxan-treated animals had significantly altered enzyme concentrations in the olfactory region, though not in the caudate or neocortex. This alteration appeared to be transitory, since it was not found in cytoxan-treated animals 60 days postinfection. A possible explanation is that virus production or interference in a brain region cycles over a period of hours or days. Still undetermined is whether these neurochemical changes are a primary effect of the virus or a secondary effect due to the immune response. It is noteworthy that cytoxan caused a marked increase in the enzyme activities studied in most of the brain areas.",Animal-other,5,1
Journal of neurotrauma,Differential behavioral and histopathological responses to graded cortical impact injury in mice.,"Controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, a model of contusive brain injury in humans, is being used with increasing frequency in mice to investigate post-traumatic cell damage and death and to evaluate treatment strategies. Because cellular injury mechanisms and therapeutic approaches may depend on the severity of the initial insult, it is important to utilize a model in which outcomes are sensitive to injury severity. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized and subjected to sham injury (n = 23) or CCI injury at either 0.5 mm (n = 22) or 1.0 mm (n = 22) depth of impact at a velocity of 5 m/sec. At 2 days, brain-injured mice exhibited significant memory (p < 0.05) and motor function (p < 0.001) deficits compared to sham-injured mice; furthermore, mice subjected to an impact of 1.0 mm were significantly more impaired in both outcome measures than those injured at 0.5 mm (p < 0.05). The cortical lesion increased in size between 24 h and 7 days in both injury groups, but was significantly larger in the 1.0 mm group. Hippocampal cell loss was observed in the hilar and CA3 regions in both groups, and in the CA1 and dentate granule cell layers in the 1.0 mm group. Regional patterns of IgG extravasation and reactive astrocytosis were similar in the two injured groups, but changes were more persistent in the 1.0 mm group. Both levels of injury resulted in acute loss of neuronal MAP-2 immunoreactivity in the cortex and sub-region specific changes in the hippocampus. Thus, increasing the depth of impact led to similar structural alterations in neurons, astrocytes and the vasculature, but resulted in greater behavioral deficits and cortical and hippocampal cell death.",Animal-other,5,1
Stroke,Differential regulation of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.,"Angiogenesis occurs after cerebral ischemia, and the extent of angiogenesis has been correlated with survival in stroke patients. However, postischemic angiogenesis is short-lived and may be completely terminated within a few weeks after ischemic insult. The molecular mechanism underlying the dissolution of postischemic angiogenic processes is poorly understood. Although the expression of angiogenic genes has been studied in ischemic stroke models, the activation of angiostatic genes after cerebral ischemia has not been investigated. Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and TSP-2 are naturally occurring angiostatic factors, which inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. The aim of the present study was to explore the expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2 in relation to the evolution of angiogenic process in a focal ischemia model in rats.	Rats underwent cortical ischemia in the middle cerebral artery territory for 60 minutes and reperfusion for up to 2 weeks. Northern and Western blot analysis were used to study the temporal profile of TSP-1 and TSP-2 expression at the mRNA and protein level, respectively. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies were used to examine the spatial expression patterns. Double immunostaining was applied to define the cellular origins of TSP-1 and TSP-2.	A biphasic expression of TSP-1 was noted after ischemia, peaking at 1 and 72 hours. Endothelial cells in the leptomeninges were the only source of the first TSP-1 peak, whereas endothelial, glial, neuronal, and macrophage cells contributed to the second peak of TSP-1 expression. TSP-2 expression occurred much later and in a monophasic manner, peaking 2 weeks after ischemia. TSP-2 immunoreactivity was observed in endothelial, neuronal, and macrophage, but not glial, cells. TSP-1 was expressed before the peak of angiogenesis, whereas robust TSP-2 expression occurred at the peak of angiogenesis and continued into the period when angiogenesis had completely resolved.	Robust expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2, 2 major angiostatic factors, was noted in the ischemic brain with different temporal expression profiles from different cellular origins. The expression of these angiostatic factors, especially TSP-2, likely contributes to the spontaneous resolution of postischemic angiogenesis. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance of angiogenic and angiostatic factors in the ischemic brain.",Animal-other,5,1
Fa yi xue za zhi,[Time-dependent expression of astroglial S100beta following diffuse brain injury in rats].,"To investigate the dynamics of the induction of S100beta in different parts of rat brain following the diffuse brain injury.	Immunohistochemistry and auto-image analysis were to determine the expression of astroglial S100beta after diffuse brain injury in rats. Forty rats were distributed into groups according to injury time of 30min, and2,4,12,24h, and 3,6 d after diffuse brain injury, and normal rats as control.	The number of S100beta positive cells in the four areas increased significantly followed by a decrease, and then a further increase. The expression of S100beta could be detected increasing in 2h, and increased significantly in 4h, and it reached apex 12h after DBI, and decreased gradually to the level less than normal 3d, and returned to normal 7d following injury. In the postmortem injury groups, there were no significant changes in anti-S100beta immunoreactivities in four areas of brain compared to the control group.	The present study showed the time-dependent expression of S100beta is obvious following diffuse brain injury, and suggested S100beta be suitable as a marker for brain injury age determination.",Animal-other,5,1
Experimental neurology,Changes in dopaminergic and glutamatergic excitatory mechanisms of micturition reflex after middle cerebral artery occlusion in conscious rats.,"Previous reports have shown that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic and D2 dopaminergic mechanisms have independent excitatory effects on bladder activity in normal and cerebral infarcted (CI) rats under urethane anesthesia. The study presented here was undertaken to investigate the interaction between these two mechanisms on bladder activity in conscious Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without cerebral infarction. Occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery or a sham operation (SO) was performed under halothane anesthesia. After recovery from the anesthesia, bladder activity was monitored continuously by means of infusion cystometrography in awake rats. The effects of cumulative intravenous doses of quinpirole (0.001-1 mg/kg), a D2 dopamine receptor agonist, were studied in awake SO and CI rats with or without dizocilpine (10 mg/kg) pretreatment. The effects of dizocilpine (1 or 10 mg/kg) were also examined in other SO or CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole. Bladder capacity in CI rats was significantly smaller (0.18 ml) than that in SO rats (0.48 ml). Quinpirole (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) further reduced bladder capacity in both types of rats, an effect blocked by sulpiride (20 mg/kg), a D2 dopamine receptor antagonist. The effect of quinpirole was also antagonized by dizocilpine (1 mg/kg) to a significantly (P < 0.01) greater degree in CI than in SO rats. In SO rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, dizocilpine significantly increased bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. After the maximum dose (10 mg/kg) of dizocilpine, sulpiride did not produce any changes in bladder activity. In CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, 1 mg/kg of dizocilpine increased bladder capacity. After administration of the maximum dose of dizocilpine (10 mg/kg), which did not produce an additional effect, sulpiride (20 mg/kg) increased bladder capacity by 58.3%. These results indicate that in awake rats D2 dopaminergic excitatory effects on the urinary bladder are mediated in part by NMDA glutamatergic mechanisms and in part by non-NMDA mechanisms. The latter type was more prominent in CI rats, indicating that the bladder hyperactivity induced by cerebral infarction may be mediated by an alteration in dopaminergic-glutamatergic interactions in the brain.",Animal-other,5,1
The Journal of general virology,High resolution in situ hybridization to determine the cellular distribution of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus RNA in the tissues of persistently infected mice: relevance to arenavirus disease and mechanisms of viral persistence.,"By the application of in situ hybridization to thin sections of paraffin-embedded tissues we have been able to determine with high resolution the cell types containing lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleic acid in the tissues of persistently infected mice. We confirm and extend previous observations of virus persistence in the brain, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, thyroid and reticuloendothelial system. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time persistence of viral nucleic acid in specific cell types in the thymus, lymph nodes, testes and bladder, and the adrenal, parathyroid and salivary glands; the cell types infected were observed in several animals. In lymphoid tissue, viral nucleic acid was predominantly located in the T cell-dependent areas of the spleen and lymph nodes; it was also present in cells of the thymic medulla. This has important implications for the deficiency in T cell function observed in persistently infected mice. In the testes, viral nucleic acid was detected in spermatogonia but not differentiating spermatocytes and therefore, in this tissue at least, persistence is related to the state of differentiation of the cell. Endocrine and exocrine dysfunctions have been described in persistently infected mice and we report that the highest levels of viral nucleic acid were found in the adrenal gland. The infection of endocrine and exocrine tissue was not pantropic, specific cell types expressed viral nucleic acid in each tissue. In the adrenal cortex, cells of the zona reticularis and zona fasciculata but not the zona glomerulosa were positive, whereas in the adrenal medulla viral nucleic acid was predominantly localized to adrenalin-secreting cells. Infection of the renal tubules, transitional epithelium of the bladder and the ducts of the salivary gland indicates the likely sites of virus production for the dissemination of arenavirus infections.",Animal-other,5,1
Psychiatry research,Dissociating effects of spatial learning from locomotor activity for ouabain-induced bipolar disorder-like rats.,"Whether ouabain, a Na+ - and K+-activated adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor, mimics cognitive impairments that can be dissociated from motor effects in the bipolar disorder-like animal model remains unclear. Ouabain and the vehicle aCSF were microinjected into the left lateral ventricle immediately, after 4h, and after 24h. The results showed that (a) locomotion responses of the Immediate group were significantly decreased compared to those of the aCSF group, particularly the first five minutes. (b) The ouabain-treated rats have longer latency and total distance traveled in the water maze task; however, the velocity was not affected for the ouabain group. (c) The analysis of covariance showed that the latency time (but not the total distance traveled and velocity) of the ouabain group was more impaired than that of the aCSF group, regardless of omitting total distance traveled and cross movement in the open field test. The latency might be more sensitive than the distance traveled and the velocity for assessing spatial learning. Dissociating the spatial learning from the movement may allow testing drug treatments of cognitive deficits independent of locomotor effects associated with bipolar disorder.",Animal-other,5,1
Journal of neurosurgical sciences,Metabolic changes in the hippocampus after prolonged epileptic discharge.,"Sustained epileptic seizures were induced in cats by means of penicillin (PCN). After a three hour period tissue from the archicortex was removed, frozen, and extracted for metabolic studies. The concentration of ATP, ADP, AMP, phosphocreatine, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate, glutamate and aspartate were determined. There was a 50% decrease in phosphocreatine concentration, a slight decrease in the level of ATP and a slight increase in the levels of ADP and AMP. There was a decrease in the total adenine nucleotide and the ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios. The absence of a significant change in adenylate energy charge potential reflects the remarkable ability of the brain to stabilize its energy state even after intense seizure activity. A reflection of increased glycolysis is the presence of decreased glucose (nearly 50%), and increased lactate, concentrations. The metabolic changes observed in the archicortex are comparable to those observed by others in the neocortex, indicating perhaps the relative metabolic uniformity of these two types of cortex.",Animal-other,5,1
"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research","Effects of acute ethanol administration on polyphosphoinositide turnover and levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in mouse cerebrum and cerebellum.","Although ethanol is known for its central depressant action, its effect on the polyphosphoinositide (poly-PI) signal transduction activity in brain has not been examined in detail. In this study, C57Bl/6J mice were injected intracerebrally with [3H]inositol, and poly-PI turnover in brain was assessed by determining the levels of labeled inositol monophosphates (IP1) accumulated after intraperitoneal injection of LiCl (6 meq/kg body weight) 4 hr before killing. Using this experimental protocol, acute ethanol administration (by gavage) resulted in time- and dose-dependent decreases in the levels of labeled IP1 in both cerebrum and cerebellum as compared with controls. The ethanol-induced decrease in labeled IP1 correlated well with the decrease in levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (as measured by the radioreceptor assay) and the increase in blood ethanol concentration. Despite a 4-fold higher accumulation of labeled IP1 in the cerebrum compared with the cerebellum, there were no major differences in the steady-state levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (based on tissue weight) in either brain region. Intraperitoneal injection of atropine (50 mg/kg) (a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist) to the lithium-treated mice resulted in a 34% decrease in labeled IP1 as compared with controls. This result suggests that a substantial proportion of the signals transduced were due to activation of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor. Administration of ethanol (5 g/kg) to the atropine-treated mice resulted in a further decrease in labeled IP1 and longer sleep time as compared with those given ethanol alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Animal-other,5,1
Fa yi xue za zhi,[Dynamic observation of brainstem auditory evoked potential and pathological changes of the brain after closed brain injuries in rats].,"To investigate the dynamic experiences of pathological changes in brain and the injured role of brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) after closed Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) in rat.	A closed diffuse brain injury model was successfully produced in rat by hit the parietal bone with a spring-droved steel stick. The auditory brainstem response evoked by click at 50Hz stimulating frequency were recorded at pre-trauma, 15 min and 1, 3, 6, 12 h and 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 d after brain injury. The pathological changes of brain were observed under light microscope and the brain edema was detected by wet weight/dry weight rations.	The I-V, III-V of BAEP wave inter peak latency (IPL) in MTBI group increased immediately in 15 minutes after injury. The III, V wave peak latency (PL) and I-V, III-V wave IPL became longer than the pre-trauma level in 6, 12 h post-injury (P<0.05). The III, V wave PL and I - III, I - V, III - V wave IPL became longer than the pre-trauma level in 1, 2 d after injury (P < 0.001), the BAEP retuned to normal level in 14 d after brain injury. At 15 minutes after injury, the water content in brain increased and met its peak in 1 d, decreased gradually in 4 d, then decreased slowly and returned to normal level in 10 d after injury.	The regular changes of BAEP could be an objective tool for evaluating hearing dysfunction after closed mild diffuse traumatic brain injury.",Animal-other,5,1
"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",Transcriptional regulator Id2 is required for the CD4 T cell immune response in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,"An effective immune response to Ag challenge is critically dependent on the size of the effector cell population generated from clonal activation of Ag-specific T cells. The transcription network involved in regulating the size of the effector population, particularly for CD4 Th cells, is poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of Id2, an inhibitor of E protein transcription factors, in the generation of CD4 effectors. Using a T cell-specific conditional Id2 knockout mouse model, we show that inhibitor of DNA binding (Id)2 is essential for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Although Ag-specific and IL-17-producing CD4 T cells are produced in these mice, the activated CD4 T cells form a smaller pool of effector cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs, exhibit reduced proliferation and increased cell death, and are largely absent in the CNS. In the absence of Id2, E protein targets, including the proapoptotic protein Bim and SOCS3, are expressed at higher levels among activated CD4 T cells. This study reveals a critical role of Id2 in the control of effector CD4 T cell population size and the development of a Th17-mediated autoimmune disease.",Animal-other,5,1
Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,Kinematic and electromyographic tools for characterizing movement disorders in mice.,"Increasing interest in rodent models for movement disorders has led to an increasing need for more accurate and precise methods for both delineating the nature of abnormal movements and measuring their severity. These studies describe application of simultaneous high-speed video kinematics with multichannel electromyography (EMG) to characterize the movement disorder exhibited by tottering mutant mice. These mice provide a uniquely valuable model, because they exhibit paroxysmal dystonia superimposed on mild baseline ataxia, permitting the examination of these two different problems within the same animals. At baseline with mild ataxia, the mutants exhibited poorly coordinated movements with increased variation of stance and swing times, and slower spontaneous walking velocities. The corresponding EMG showed reduced mean amplitudes of biceps femoris and vastus lateralis, and poorly modulated EMG activities during the step cycle. Attacks of paroxysmal dystonia were preceded by trains of EMG bursts with doublets and triplets simultaneously in the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis followed by more sustained coactivation. These EMG characteristics are consistent with the clinical phenomenology of the motor phenotype of tottering mice as a baseline of mild ataxia with intermittent attacks of paroxysmal dystonia. The EMG characteristics of ataxia and dystonia in the tottering mice also are consistent with EMG studies of other ataxic or dystonic animals and humans. These studies provide insights into how these methods can be used for delineating movement disorders in mice and for how they may be compared with similar disorders of humans.",Animal-other,5,1
"Brain, behavior, and immunity",Differential binding of antibodies in PANDAS patients to cholinergic interneurons in the striatum.,"Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus, or PANDAS, is a syndrome of acute childhood onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in the aftermath of an infection with Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS). Its pathophysiology remains unclear. PANDAS has been proposed to result from cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against GABHS with brain antigens, but the targets of these antibodies are unclear and may be heterogeneous. We developed an in vivo assay in mice to characterize the cellular targets of antibodies in serum from individuals with PANDAS. We focus on striatal interneurons, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of tic disorders. Sera from children with well-characterized PANDAS (n = 5) from a previously described clinical trial (NCT01281969), and matched controls, were infused into the striatum of mice; antibody binding to interneurons was characterized using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Antibodies from children with PANDAS bound to ∼80% of cholinergic interneurons, significantly higher than the <50% binding seen with matched healthy controls. There was no elevated binding to two different populations of GABAergic interneurons (PV and nNOS-positive), confirming the specificity of this phenomenon. Elevated binding to cholinergic interneurons resolved in parallel with symptom improvement after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Antibody-mediated dysregulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons may be a locus of pathology in PANDAS. Future clarification of the functional consequences of this specific binding may identify new opportunities for intervention in children with this condition.",Animal-other,5,1
Acta neurologica Scandinavica,Somatosensory evoked potentials in cerebral ischemia of rabbits.,"Twenty-one rabbits were used in the ischemic group and six in the control group. Cerebral ischemia of variable degree was induced by Fe particle injection method. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were compared when the CBF levels decreased to their minimum. The latency of the SEPs increased along with the decrease of the CBF when it was lower than 20 ml/100 g/min (68% of the pre-ischemic control level). This may be related to the ischemic change of the white matter. The amplitude showed diphasic changes. When the CBF decreased below 20 ml/100 g/min, the amplitude increased; when the CBF was lower than 11 ml/100 g/min (38% of the pre-ischemic level), it decreased. These results indicate that the functions of the cerebral cortex might be excited in mild ischemia, and be suppressed in severe ischemia.",Animal-other,5,1

Brain stimulation,Long-lasting restoration of memory function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity by focused ultrasound in Alzheimer's disease.,"Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a medical technology that non-invasively stimulates the brain and has been applied in thermal ablation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, and neuromodulation. In recent years, numerous experiences and indications for the use of FUS in clinical and preclinical studies have rapidly expanded. Focused ultrasound-mediated BBB opening induces cognitive enhancement and neurogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated.	Here, we investigate the effects of FUS-mediated BBB opening on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive function in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We applied FUS with microbubble to the hippocampus and LTP was measured 6 weeks after BBB opening using FUS. Field recordings were made with a concentric bipolar electrode positioned in the CA1 region using an extracellular glass pipette filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Morris water maze and Y-maze was performed to test cognitive function.	Our results demonstrated that FUS-mediated BBB opening has a significant impact on increasing LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 synapses and rescues cognitive dysfunction and working memory. These effects persisted for up to 7 weeks post-treatment. Also, FUS-mediated BBB opening in the hippocampus increased PKA phosphorylation.	Therefore, it could be a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases as it remarkably increases LTP, thereby improving working memory.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
Neurosurgery,Predifferentiated brain-derived adult human progenitor cells migrate toward ischemia after transplantation to the adult rat brain.,"The adult human brain contains neural stem/progenitor cells (AHNPCs) that can survive transplantation into the adult rat brain, migrate toward a lesion, and display limited neuronal differentiation in vivo.	To investigate the effect of manipulating AHNPCs before grafting by predifferentiation, ie, initiating neuronal differentiation before transplantation, and to determine whether this cell priming would affect their ability to migrate in vivo.	AHNPCs were prepared from temporal lobe resections for epilepsy. Seven days after global brain ischemia, predifferentiated AHNPCs (exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor, heparin, and laminin) were transplanted to the left hippocampus. Four and 10 weeks after transplantation, brain sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.	Transplanted primed cells expressed committed neuronal markers at a much earlier stage compared with nonprimed AHNPCs and were found colabeled with human markers within the damaged CA1 region 4 weeks after grafting. Furthermore, predifferentiated AHNPCs migrated preferentially into an ischemic lesion, similar to their undifferentiated counterparts. The chemoattractant effect from the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) in ischemic CA1 on AHNPCs expressing CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) may explain this preference in migration in vivo.	The plasticity of neural progenitors derived from the adult human brain may be greater than previously assumed in that manipulation before grafting may influence the phenotypes seen in vivo. The SDF-1α-CXCR4 axis is involved in the targeted migration toward an ischemic lesion in the adult rat brain, similar to previous reports on endogenous progenitors in rats and grafted fetal human neural progenitors.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,An Enriched Environment Leads to Increased Synaptic Plasticity-Associated miRNA Levels after Experimental Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.,"In subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), impairments in motor and cognitive functions may occur and continue in later periods. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can directly or indirectly affect synaptic reconstruction. mir-132, mir-134, and mir-138 are the leading miRNAs that can be effective on some neurological functions through its effects on synaptic plasticity in the relevant brain areas. In our study, it was aimed to determine the levels of miRNAs in the hippocampus and frontal lobe of rats exposed to different environmental conditions after the experimental SAH.	SAH was created using the cisterna magna double blood-injection method. Brain tissues were collected at different times after the last blood injection. Rats were grouped according to the different environmental conditions in which they were kept. Expression levels of miRNAs were performed by qPCR and ultrastructural changes in samples were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).	After SAH, miR-132, miR-134, and miR-138 expressions in the frontal lobes of rats increased in impoverished environment on the 7th day and in the enriched environment on the 14th day. It was observed that the myelin and microtubule structures in the axons that were disrupted after SAH were more organized and stable in the enriched environment.	After SAH, different environmental conditions may affect the miRNA levels associated with synaptic plasticity and microtubule organization in the frontal lobe, and this might have some effects especially on cognitive and motor functions related to this brain area.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),Expanding substance use treatment options for HIV prevention with buprenorphine-naloxone: HIV Prevention Trials Network 058.,"Injection opioid use plays a significant role in the transmission of HIV infection in many communities and several regions of the world. Access to evidence-based treatments for opioid use disorders is extremely limited.	HIV Prevention Trials Network 058 (HPTN 058) was a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the impact of 2 medication-assisted treatment (MAT) strategies on HIV incidence or death among opioid-dependent people who inject drugs (PWID). HIV-negative opioid-dependent PWID were recruited from 4 communities in Thailand and China with historically high prevalence of HIV among PWID. A total of 1251 participants were randomly assigned to either (1) a 1-year intervention consisting of 2 opportunities for a 15-day detoxification with buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) combined with up to 21 sessions of behavioral drug and risk counseling [short-term medication-assisted treatment (ST-MAT)] or (2) thrice-weekly dosing for 48 weeks with BUP/NX and up to 21 counseling sessions [long-term medication-assisted treatment (LT-MAT)] followed by dose tapering. All participants were followed for 52 weeks after treatment completion to assess durability of impact.	Although the study was stopped early due to lower than expected occurrence of the primary end points, sufficient data were available to assess the impact of the interventions on drug use and injection-related risk behavior. At week 26, 22% of ST-MAT participants had negative urinalyses for opioids compared with 57% in the LT-MAT (P < 0.001). Differences disappeared in the year after treatment: at week 78, 35% in ST-MAT and 32% in the LT-MAT had negative urinalyses. Injection-related risk behaviors were significantly reduced in both groups after randomization.	Participants receiving BUP/NX 3 times weekly were more likely to reduce opioid injection while on active treatment. Both treatment strategies were considered safe and associated with reductions in injection-related risk behavior. These data support the use of thrice-weekly BUP/NX as a way to reduce exposure to HIV risk. Continued access to BUP/NX may be required to sustain reductions in opioid use.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

This was a 28-day open-label study (NCT02577523) in PD patients with ≥2.5 hours/day of OFF time despite optimized treatment. Patients were randomized to treatment with either a 24-hour infusion (levodopa/carbidopa dose of 720/90 mg) or a 14-hour 'waking-day' infusion (levodopa/carbidopa dose of 538/68 mg plus a morning oral dose of 150/15 mg). Supplemental oral doses of levodopa were permitted for patients in both groups if required. In-clinic assessments of OFF time (primary endpoint) and ON time with or without dyskinesia were determined by a blinded rater over 8 hours (normalized to 16 hours).	A total of 38 patients were randomized and 33 (87%) completed the study. Compared to baseline, OFF time for the overall population was reduced by a least squares (LS) mean[95% CI] of 2.0[- 3.3, - 0.7] hours (p = 0.003). ON time with no/mild dyskinesia (no troublesome dyskinesia) was increased from baseline by a LS mean of 3.3[2.0, 4.6] hours (p < 0.0001), and ON time with moderate/severe dyskinesia was reduced by a LS mean of 1.2[- 1.8, - 0.5] hours (p≤0.001). Reduction in OFF time was larger in the 24-hour group (- 2.8[- 4.6, - 0.9] hours; p = 0.004) than in the 14-hour group (- 1.3[- 3.1, 0.5] hours; p = 0.16). Complete resolution of OFF time was observed in 42% (n = 8) of patients in the 24-hour group. Infusion site reactions were the most common adverse event.

The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,Clomipramine and exposure for obsessive-compulsive rituals: i.,"Forty chronic obsessive-compulsive ritualizers were randomly assigned to treatment with oral clomipramine or placebo for 8 months. During weeks 4 to 7 these two groups were each randomly split into treatment by relaxation or by exposure in vivo, and during weeks 7 to 10 all patients had exposure in vivo. Double blind assessments were made at weeks 4, 7, 10, 18, 36, 62 and 114. Results are reported to one year. Clomipramine produced significant improvement in rituals, mood and social adjustment, but only in those patients who initially had depressed mood. The clomipramine effect was maximum from weeks 10 to 18 and diminished thereafter. On stopping clomipramine patients often relapsed and improved again on restarting the drug. Relaxation produced little change. Exposure produced significant lasting improvement in rituals, but less change in mood; improvement generalized to social adjustment at follow-up. Clomipramine plus exposure had a slight additive but not interactional effect. Clomipramine enhanced compliance both with exposure and with relaxation. Clomipramine is useful for compulsive ritualizers with depressed mood, but may need continuation for over a year and combination with exposure in vivo. Exposure in vivo remains the treatment of choice for rituals without depressed mood.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,Omega-3 Fatty Acid Plasma Levels Before and After Supplementation: Correlations with Mood and Clinical Outcomes in the Omega-3 and Therapy Studies.,"To examine fatty acid profiles, their response to omega-3 fatty acid (Ω3) supplementation, and associations with clinical status and treatment response in youth with mood disorders.	In a placebo-controlled 2X2 design, 7-14 year-olds (N = 95) in parallel pilot trials (depression N = 72; bipolar N = 23) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of Ω3 supplementation (1.4 g eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], 0.2 g docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], and 0.27 g other Ω3 per day); psychoeducational psychotherapy (PEP); their combination; or placebo (mainly oleic and linoleic acid) alone. Blood was drawn at baseline (N = 90) and endpoint (n = 65). Fatty acid levels were expressed as percent of total plasma fatty acids. Correlational and moderator/mediator analyses were done with SPSS Statistics 23.	At baseline: (1) DHA correlated negatively with alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (r = -0.23, p = 0.029); (2) Arachidonic acid (AA, Ω6) correlated negatively with global functioning (r = -0.24, p = 0.022); (3) Total Ω3 correlated negatively with age (r = -0.22, p = 0.036) and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.31, p = 0.006). Moderation: Baseline ALA moderated response to Ω3 supplementation: ALA levels above the sample mean (lower DHA) predicted significantly better placebo-controlled response (p = 0.04). Supplementation effects: Compared to placebo, 2 g Ω3 per day increased EPA blood levels sevenfold and DHA levels by half (both p < 0.001). Body weight correlated inversely with increased EPA (r = -0.52, p = 0.004) and DHA (r = -0.54, p = 0.003) and positively with clinical mood response. Mediation: EPA increase baseline-to-endpoint mediated placebo-controlled global function and depression improvement: the greater the EPA increase, the less the placebo-controlled Ω3 improvement.	Ω3 supplementation at 2 g/day increases blood levels substantially, more so in smaller children. A possible U-shaped response curve should be explored.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
The American journal of psychiatry,Laboratory response of patients with panic and obsessive-compulsive disorders to 35% CO2 challenges.,"The DSM-III-R anxiety disorders section includes both panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. To evaluate the relationship between these two disorders, subject responses to inhalation of a 35% CO2 and 65% O2 mixture were assessed.	Twenty-three patients with panic disorder, 23 with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 12 with both obsessive-compulsive and panic disorder, and 23 healthy comparison subjects were given a single vital capacity inhalation of 35% CO2 and 65% O2 or a placebo mixture of compressed air. A double-blind, random, crossover design was used.	Patients with panic disorder and patients with both panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder showed similar strong anxiogenic reactions to 35% CO2; while patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder alone did not differ from comparison subjects.	These results confirm that obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are two distinct syndromes and that patients with these disorders have different sensitivity to CO2 inhalation.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,12,0
