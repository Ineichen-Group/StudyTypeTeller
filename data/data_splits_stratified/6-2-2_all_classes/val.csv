1,23520737,Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),West Nile virus epidemiology and factors triggering change in its distribution in Europe.,"West Nile virus (WNV) has historically been considered among the least virulent members of the Japanese serogroup complex (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus). The WNV natural cycle involves birds as the main amplifying hosts and several species of mosquito as vectors. Many outbreaks occurred during the past decade, causing severe human encephalitis in the Old World, and the virus has become established in many European countries. Emergence of WNV is difficult to predict and even more difficult to prevent. In this review, the latest information on the epidemiology, transmission dynamics and clinical aspects of WNV is presented, with particular focus on specific factors likely to trigger changes in the distribution of the disease in Europe, such as climate changes and their consequences on the potential vectors of WNV or bird migration routes. The control of some anthropogenic and environmental factors could help prevent extension and re-emergence of WNV epidemics.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
2,12489625,"Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association (Washington, D.C. : 1996)",State syringe and drug possession laws potentially influencing safe syringe disposal by injection drug users.,"To review state laws and judicial decisions for potential barriers to proper syringe disposal by injection drug users (IDUs).	Using standard legal research methods, this study reviewed drug paraphernalia, syringe prescription, drug possession, and syringe exchange laws and relevant case decisions in 59 jurisdictions.	Drug paraphernalia, syringe prescription, and drug possession laws.	Drug paraphernalia laws prohibit all possession of syringes by IDUs in 31 jurisdictions. Syringe prescription laws prohibit possession in 7 jurisdictions. In 53 jurisdictions, IDUs may be subject to prosecution for the possession of drug residue in used syringes. Only two states (HI, RI) have no legal barriers to safe syringe disposal by IDUs. Sixteen jurisdictions that have tried to expand syringe access for IDUs by authorizing SEPs or by deregulating pharmacy sale of syringes continue to have criminal law provisions that could pose barriers to proper disposal.	IDUs are a significant source of syringes disposed of outside the health care system. Involving IDUs in safe community sharps disposal programs is an important public health goal, but may be frustrated by legal barriers. Although this study looked only at law on the books, and not law as actually applied, ethnographic and survey research indicates that criminal laws do influence the syringe possession behavior of IDUs. The findings of this study suggest that syringe and drug possession laws could deter IDUs from participating in safe syringe disposal programs.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
3,8749893,Schizophrenia bulletin,"Treatment outcomes in schizophrenia: implications for practice, policy, and research.","Outcomes research on treatments for schizophrenia has identified a number of efficacious interventions. The degree to which such scientific knowledge influences the care delivered in everyday practice depends on a large number of patient, practitioner, service system, and other social factors. The current atmosphere for change in the health care delivery system poses both risks and opportunities to improve care for persons with this disorder. Scientific knowledge about treatment outcomes must inform this rapid evolution of practice, policy, and research to ensure that effective treatments are preserved and available for all who need them and that new treatments continue to be developed, evaluated, and disseminated.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
4,26450593,"The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",Epigenetic Basis of Mental Illness.,"Psychiatric disorders are complex multifactorial illnesses involving chronic alterations in neural circuit structure and function as well as likely abnormalities in glial cells. While genetic factors are important in the etiology of most mental disorders, the relatively high rates of discordance among identical twins, particularly for depression and other stress-related syndromes, clearly indicate the importance of additional mechanisms. Environmental factors such as stress are known to play a role in the onset of these illnesses. Exposure to such environmental insults induces stable changes in gene expression, neural circuit function, and ultimately behavior, and these maladaptations appear distinct between developmental versus adult exposures. Increasing evidence indicates that these sustained abnormalities are maintained by epigenetic modifications in specific brain regions. Indeed, transcriptional dysregulation and the aberrant epigenetic regulation that underlies this dysregulation is a unifying theme in psychiatric disorders. Here, we provide a progress report of epigenetic studies of the three major psychiatric syndromes, depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We review the literature derived from animal models of these disorders as well as from studies of postmortem brain tissue from human patients. While epigenetic studies of mental illness remain at early stages, understanding how environmental factors recruit the epigenetic machinery within specific brain regions to cause lasting changes in disease susceptibility and pathophysiology is revealing new insight into the etiology and treatment of these conditions.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
5,24892819,International reviews of immunology,"Rheumatic fever, autoimmunity, and molecular mimicry: the streptococcal connection.","The group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and its link to autoimmune sequelae, has acquired a new level of understanding. Studies support the hypothesis that molecular mimicry between the group A streptococcus and heart or brain are important in directing immune responses in rheumatic fever. Rheumatic carditis, Sydenham chorea and a new group of behavioral disorders called pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections are reviewed with consideration of autoantibody and T cell responses and the role of molecular mimicry between the heart, brain and group A streptococcus as well as how immune responses contribute to pathogenic mechanisms in disease. In rheumatic carditis, studies have investigated human monoclonal autoantibodies and T cell clones for their crossreactivity and their mechanisms leading to valve damage in rheumatic heart disease. Although studies of human and animal sera from group A streptococcal diseases or immunization models have been crucial in providing clues to molecular mimicry and its role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever, study of human monoclonal autoantibodies have provided important insights into how antibodies against the valve may activate the valve endothelium and lead to T cell infiltration. Passive transfer of anti-streptococcal T cell lines in a rat model of rheumatic carditis illustrates effects of CD4+ T cells on the valve. Although Sydenham chorea has been known as the neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever for decades, the combination of autoimmunity and behavior is a relatively new concept linking brain, behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders with streptococcal infections. In Sydenham chorea, human mAbs and their expression in transgenic mice have linked autoimmunity to central dopamine pathways as well as dopamine receptors and dopaminergic neurons in basal ganglia. Taken together, the studies reviewed provide a basis for understanding streptococcal sequelae and how immune responses against group A streptococci influence autoimmunity and inflammatory responses in the heart and brain.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
6,21110824,Recent patents on anti-cancer drug discovery,Nanotechnology advances in brain tumors: the state of the art.,"Primary malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors only represent about 2% of all cancers. However, they are very often associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite current standard-of-care therapy, such as surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, neither cure nor any toxic therapy against malignant CNS tumors has been developed so far. Nanotechnology may alter this situation. It offers a new promise for cancer diagnosis and treatment. This emerging technology, by developing and manufacturing materials using atomic and molecular elements, can provide a platform for the combination of diagnostics, therapeutics and delivery to the tumor, with subsequent monitoring of the response. This review focuses on recent developments in cancer nanotechnology with particular attention to nanoparticle systems, important tools for the improvement of drug delivery in brain tumor. The latest advances in both the research sector and in recent patents for cancer imaging and therapy are discussed.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
7,16268859,Journal of advanced nursing,Agitation in dementia: concept clarification.,"The aim of this paper is to clarify the concept of agitation in dementia through analysing definitions, critical attributes, components, boundaries, antecedents and consequences of agitation.	The concept of agitation is not well defined. In addition, there exists much confusion about the characteristics and boundaries of agitation, as well as the distinction between agitation and related concepts. Recently developed theoretical models for agitation in dementia require new interpretation and conceptualization of agitation.	Morse's method of critical appraisal of the literature was used. In addition, some parts of Rodgers' evolutionary method were employed. Data were selected using six electronic databases and the key words 'agitation', 'agitated', 'dementia', 'demented' and 'Alzheimer'. The analysis included 86 empirical or theoretical papers and one book.	A transition from the observer's perspective to the patient's perspective in the interpretation of agitation was found. Five critical attributes of agitation in dementia were identified: excessive, inappropriate, repetitive, non-specific and observable. Patient factors, interpersonal factors, environmental factors and restraint were identified as precipitating antecedents. Mediating antecedents included discomfort, unmet need and misinterpretation. Consequences of agitation were identified at the levels of patient, caregiver and others.	This transition in perspectives has important implications as it can change health providers' attitudes and responses to agitation and lead to patient-focused and individualized care. Researchers and clinicians are encouraged to avoid labelling agitated behaviour as 'disturbing behaviour'.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
8,21523606,Pediatric radiology,Potential role of 3DUS in infants and children.,"The objective of this review is to discuss basic technical aspects as well as potential pediatric applications of three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS). Different 3DUS-techniques are already commercially available. Most commonly, a transducer-integrated motor drives a scan-head to acquire a volumetric dataset, which is then reconstructed and viewed using various post-processing techniques. It has been proved feasible to apply 3DUS with pediatric transducers in typical pediatric investigations. Based on our own experiences and on review of the literature, 3DUS can be successfully used in infants and children for brain, spine, cardiac, urinary tract (particularly assessment of hydronephrosis, and virtual cystoscopy), and female genital (e.g., for assessment of uterine malformations) US, and for various other applications, particularly in small parts. Power Doppler data can be integrated, allowing 3DUS-angiography. Thus, 3DUS promises to become a useful adjunct for imaging children, particularly as it enhances ultrasound by offering additional, previously inaccessible planes, rendering options and surface assessments. 3DUS should be increasingly exploited, thus hopefully helping reduce the need for more invasive or burdening (e.g., ionizing radiation) investigations in children.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
9,21510828,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Can small molecules provide truly effective enhancement of cognition? Current achievements and future directions.,"The prevalence of age-related diseases that implicate a deterioration of cognitive abilities is increasing. Moreover, cognitive decline occurs in numerous CNS disorders affecting patients at younger ages as well, resulting in reduced functional ability and quality of life. Despite the existence of few medications treating cognition, the need for efficacious treatment options to alleviate, halt or even prevent cognitive decline is generally unmet to date. Consequently, extensive research efforts are undertaken to identify medications that can effectively enhance cognition.	This review covers ongoing clinical trials for cognition and reflects on efforts undertaken to increase the success rates of procognitive drug treatment. The review discusses ways to optimize the drug development process for cognition enhancing agents at the preclinical to clinical interface and provides concrete examples.	The existing efficacy readouts addressing cognition in preclinical research offer little translational validity to the clinical situation. In order to identify truly efficacious drug candidates, biomarkers need to be developed that directly address conserved mechanisms underlying cognitive performances. To this end, technologies such as neuroimaging or electroencephalography constitute promising entry points for identifying both the cognitive domain and the patient population most responsive to drug treatment.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Abnormalities may arise within the pituitary itself, from vestigial embryologic remnants, or from surrounding tissues. Correct diagnosis rests on accurate assessment of lesion location, imaging appearance, and clinical presentation.

11,7401856,The Laryngoscope,The evaluation of dizziness in children.,"A child with symptoms that relate to the balance mechanism can be a complex diagnostic problem. Often an adequate history is difficult to obtain because of the child's age and limitation of expression. Psychosomatic illness can frequently present as dizziness in children; however, this should not preclude a thorough evaluation. It is the purpose of this paper to outline these possibilities and the characteristics unique to each. The differential diagnosis can be grouped into central (central nervous system) and peripheral (otologic) categories, with a few miscellaneous conditions. A basic evaluation should include a complete neurotologic examination, audiogram and electronystagmogram. An electroencephalogram is frequently a valuable diagnostic adjunct. Further testing should be decided on the basis of the patient's history, examination and prior results. The records of children admitted to Boston City Hospital over a one-year period were reviewed. Of 2,088 pediatric patients, 238 had discharge diagnoses pertinent to the balance mechanism. Of these, 14 had a presenting symptom of dizziness. These cases are analyzed.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
12,32045917,Neuro-degenerative diseases,Potential Mechanism of Venous System for Leukoaraiosis: From post-mortem to in vivo Research.,"Leukoaraiosis (LA), widely accepted as a feature of cerebral small vessel disease, significantly increases the incidence of stroke, dementia, and death. Cerebral small artery disease has been considered as one of the main causes of LA. However, since the term 'venous collagenosis' (VC) was proposed in an atrophy research in 1995, there have been pathological and neuroimaging studies proving the association between the venous system and LA in aging, Alz-heimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease.	Autopsy studies confirmed that thickening of the lumen wall in venules, which results from the deposition of collagen I and III, leading to vessel stenosis or occlusion, is closely associated with LA. Susceptibility-weighted imaging research revealed a controversial association of deep medullary veins and LA in vivo, regarding which there are no standard criteria currently. Nevertheless, retinal venous changes had been reported to increase the risk of LA development, providing a novel way for in vivo evaluation. As for the internal jugular vein, jugular venous reflux could double the LA score in aging and modulate circulation of cerebral spinal fluids. Key Messages: Disruption of the venous system was notably associated with LA in aging, AD, and Parkinson's disease post-mortem and in in vivo models. The venous pathological changes may induce cerebral hypoperfusion, drainage system disruption, and vasogenic oedema in the veins around the periventricular white matter. The clarification of VC in LA may provide an early prevention and early treatment strategy for LA patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
13,17284616,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,Cognitive functions in primary central nervous system lymphoma: literature review and assessment guidelines.,"Treatment-related neurotoxicity has been recognized as a significant problem in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) as effective treatment has increased survival rates. There is, however, a paucity of research on cognitive functions in this population.	In a review of the literature, a total of 17 articles that described cognitive outcome in adult PCNSL patients were identified.	The studies that assessed cognitive functions after whole-brain radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy reported cognitive impairment in most patients. Patients treated with chemotherapy alone had either stable or improved cognitive performance in most studies. Methodological problems, however, limited the ability to ascertain the specific contribution of disease and various treatment interventions to cognitive outcome. On the basis of the literature review, a battery of cognitive and quality-of-life (QoL) measures to be used in prospective clinical trials was proposed. The battery is composed of five standardized neuropsychological tests, covering four domains sensitive to disease and treatment effects (attention, executive functions, memory, psychomotor speed), and QoL questionnaires, and meets criteria for use in collaborative trials.	The incorporation of formal and systematic cognitive evaluations in PCNSL studies will improve our understanding of treatment-related neurotoxicity in this population.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
14,11199812,Journal of neurology,Parkinson's disease and sleep.,"There are many reasons for patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease to develop sleep disorders and subsequent daytime sleepiness. Important causes are reduction of total sleep duration and sleep efficiency, and an increase in respiratory and motor arousals. This daytime sleepiness at first glance seems different from the 'sleep attacks' which caused motot vehicle mishaps reported recently in persons taking pramipexole and ropinirole. There is, however, only little evidence that we deal with a new phenomenon in a new clinical situation, i. e. cataplexy-like attacks after high doses of new non-ergot dopamine-agonists. Until now there is no single case of a proven cataplexy on one hand, and older dopamine agonists like pergolide as well as L-Dopa + carbidopa have been reported to induce sudden onsets of sleep, too.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

18,21870315,Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,[Forensic-psychiatric assessment of pedophilia].,"The present paper illustrates the approach of a forensic psychiatric expert witness regarding the assessment of pedophilia. In a first step it is inevitable to differentiate if the defendant is suffering from pedophilia or if the alleged crime might have been committed because of other motivations (antisociality, sexual activity as redirection, impulsivity). A sound diagnostic assessment is indispendable for this task. In a second step the level of severity needs to be gauged in order to clarify whether the requirement of the entry criteria of §§ 20, 21 of the German penal code are fulfilled. In a third step, significant impairments of self-control mechanisms need to be elucidated. The present article reviews indicators of such impairments regarding pedophilia. With respect to a mandatory treatment order (§ 63 German penal code) or preventive detention (§ 66 German penal code) the legal prognosis of the defendant needs to be considered. The present paper gives an overview of the current state of risk assessment research and discusses the transfer to an individual prognosis critically.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
19,27311246,Revue medicale de Liege,[Controversies around the diagnosis of ADHD].,"Complaints about restlessness, difficulties to focus and impulsivity are amongst the most frequent reasons for child psychiatric consultations. Those complaints refer to the core symptoms of the ADHD. However, the diagnosis of ADHD is delicate to establish and subject to several controversies regarding its etiopathological origins and, therefore, its treatment. In practice, those situations include very different cases and it seems obvious that this is a polyfactorial disorder, no single factor alone being sufficient to account for all the difficulties experienced by the children. It would therefore be simplistic to consider the ADHD as issued only from a neurobiological disorder and to consider a drug treatment, only. We are rather in favor of an integrative approach and a global treatment on a case by case basis.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
20,12799786,Der Nervenarzt,[Evaluation of stent-protected angioplasty for theray of symptomatic stenoses of the carotid artery. SPACE and other randomized trials].,"During recent years, stent-protected angioplasty of the carotid artery (SPAC) has become an alternative to endartectomy (CEA) in many centers. Despite many case reports, case series, and open records, it has not been proven that these therapeutical regimens are comparable regarding complication rates and long-term outcome. Until now, only three randomized trials were published on this theme, two of them only as abstracts. This is not sufficient for answering the question of whether SPAC is a good alternative to CEA. At present, four major, randomized, multicenter trials are being run (EVA3S in France, CREST in the US, ICSS in Great Britain and several other countries, and SPACE in Germany and Austria). About 7,300 patients will be included in these trials. At present, 24 centers are participating in the SPACE trial, recruiting about 350 patients. It has been prospectively agreed that EVA-3S, ICSS, and SPACE will combine their results after completion of initial randomization and follow-up to conduct a combined European meta-analysis of the data. Three to 5 years are needed until these trials' final results will be published. Until then, stent-protected angioplasty should be done only under the consideration that it has not been scientifically evaluated.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
21,33027183,Current opinion in psychiatry,Functional neuroimaging biomarkers of resilience in major depressive disorder.,"In this review we provide an overview of definitions and determinants of resilience in the context of neuroimaging research in major depressive disorder (MDD). We summarize emerging literature on functional neuroimaging biomarkers of resilience in MDD and discuss their clinical relevance and implications for future research.	Resilience in MDD is characterized by dissociable profiles of activation and functional connectivity within brain networks involved in cognitive control, emotion regulation, and reward processing. Increased activation of frontal cortical brain regions implicated in cognitive appraisal and emotion regulation is a common characteristic of resilient individuals at high risk for MDD and of individuals with MDD with a favorable illness course. Furthermore, significant associations between fronto-striato-limbic functional connectivity and both positively interpreted stressful life events in resilient high-risk individuals and a favorable response to first-line treatments in depressed individuals suggest that neuro-compensatory changes and experience-dependent plasticity underlie resilience in MDD.	Emerging research has identified functional neuroimaging biomarkers of resilience in MDD. A continued focus on identifying neurobiological underpinnings of resilience, in the context of dynamic environmental and developmental influences, will advance our understanding of resilience and improve approaches to prevention and treatment of MDD.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

24,27314344,International journal of molecular sciences,Roles of PTEN with DNA Repair in Parkinson's Disease.,"Oxidative stress is considered to play key roles in aging and pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, which could bring DNA damage by cells. The DNA damage may lead to the cell apoptosis, which could contribute to the degeneration of neuronal tissues. Recent evidence suggests that PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) may be involved in the pathophysiology of the neurodegenerative disorders. Since PTEN expression appears to be one dominant determinant of the neuronal cell death, PTEN should be a potential molecular target of novel therapeutic strategies against Parkinson's disease. In addition, defects in DNA damage response and DNA repair are often associated with modulation of hormone signaling pathways. Especially, many observations imply a role for estrogen in a regulation of the DNA repair action. In the present review, we have attempted to summarize the function of DNA repair molecules at a viewpoint of the PTEN signaling pathway and the hormone related functional modulation of cells, providing a broad interpretation on the molecular mechanisms for treatment of Parkinson's disease. Particular attention will be paid to the mechanisms proposed to explain the health effects of food ingredients against Parkinson's disease related to reduce oxidative stress for an efficient therapeutic intervention.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
25,19542569,Psychiatria Hungarica : A Magyar Pszichiatriai Tarsasag tudomanyos folyoirata,[Associations between symptom severity and emotion recognition in depressed patients].,"In this study we tried to explore whether there are any associations between symptom severity and emotional facial expression recognition. Based on the literature and our earlier findings, we believe that the impairments of overall (not emotion specific) facial expression recognition is associated with a more general, non-specific psychiatric distress. Thus, first it was hypothesized that overall facial expression recognition would be correlated negatively with SCL-90 global severity index (GSI). Our second hypothesis was that the severity of the impairment in facial expression recognition would be correlated with symptom severity measured by the BECK Depression Inventory (BDI).	One hundred and six depressed subjects participated in the study. We used a 'Virtual Human' for presenting the 35 emotional and neutral facial expressions. Subjects filled in the BDI and SCL-90 questionnaires after the facial expression recognition task.	Significant negative association was found between the GSI of SCL-90 and the overall facial expression recognition. Furthermore, significant negative correlation was found between the recognition of happy facial expressions and the depression severity measured by the BDI questionnaire and the SCL-90 depression subscale.	The negative association found between overall facial expression recognition and the GSI score provide empirical support to our first hypothesis, which states that the impairment of not emotion specific, overall facial expression recognition may correlate with a general psychiatric distress. Our findings indicate that those depressed subjects who had higher scores on BDI could recognize happy facial expression at a significantly lower rate. Abnormalities in reward sensitivity may explain this association between happy face recognition difficulties and the severity of depressive symptoms among depressive patients. Consequently, we can conclude that the recognition of happy facial expressions can be a useful tool for monitoring the severity of depression.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
26,17563899,Mental retardation and developmental disabilities research reviews,Translating policy principles into practice to improve health care access for adults with intellectual disabilities: a research review of the past decade.,"This article extracts principles from two Surgeon General reports, Closing the Gap: A National Blueprint to Improve the Health of Persons with Mental Retardation (2002) and Call to Action to Improve the Health and Wellness of Persons with Disabilities (2005), and combines them with the Objectives from Chapter 6 of Healthy People 2010 to create a policy framework. This framework is used to review literature from the past decade on access to health care and health promotion for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Review of the literature indicates an emerging evidence base for health promotion programs for persons with IDD. Research in health care and health promotion access requires improvements in surveillance and measurement of quality of life, as well as increased participation of persons with IDD and their families in its implementation. While international guidelines for primary health care have been developed for people with IDD, US guidelines are specialty focused and address specific conditions. Despite its recognized importance, there is surprisingly little information on training programs for health care providers to improve care of persons with IDD. Financing of health care continues to threaten access to comprehensive care for persons with IDD, particularly regarding coordination of care and availability of providers who accept Medicaid patients. Community-based sources of health care have been slow to emerge, and there is clear need for assumption of responsibility for providing care to persons with IDD. Future US policy should include consideration of environmental factors in health care access.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
27,4053968,Drug and alcohol dependence,The psychological benefits of moderate alcohol consumption: a review of the literature.,"A review of the literature on the positive psychological benefits of light and moderate alcohol consumption suggests the following: (1) Alcohol in moderate amounts is effective in reducing stress. This has been found in both physiologic and self-report measures. (2) Low and moderate doses of alcohol have been reported to increase overall affective expression, happiness, euphoria, conviviality and pleasant and carefree feelings. Tension, depression and self-consciousness have been reported to decrease with equal doses. (3) Low alcohol doses have been found to improve certain types of cognitive performance. Included here are problem-solving and short-term memory. (4) Heavy drinkers and abstainers have higher rates of clinical depression than do regular moderate drinkers. (5) Alcohol in low and moderate doses has been effective in the treatment of geropsychiatric problems. As indicated in the text, results from many of the studies reviewed suggest that light or moderate drinking may be beneficial to psychological well-being. Liber (N. Engl. J. Med., 310(13) (1984) 846) has commented that the subject of control of alcohol intake evokes strong emotional responses, which can overshadow a logical assessment of whether or not to include 'healthy' drinking in a dietary plan. It is hoped that this review of data from available research can help provide a basis for making such an assessment.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
28,34360586,International journal of molecular sciences,"Copper, Iron, and Manganese Toxicity in Neuropsychiatric Conditions.","Copper, manganese, and iron are vital elements required for the appropriate development and the general preservation of good health. Additionally, these essential metals play key roles in ensuring proper brain development and function. They also play vital roles in the central nervous system as significant cofactors for several enzymes, including the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and other enzymes that take part in the creation and breakdown of neurotransmitters in the brain. An imbalance in the levels of these metals weakens the structural, regulatory, and catalytic roles of different enzymes, proteins, receptors, and transporters and is known to provoke the development of various neurological conditions through different mechanisms, such as via induction of oxidative stress, increased α-synuclein aggregation and fibril formation, and stimulation of microglial cells, thus resulting in inflammation and reduced production of metalloproteins. In the present review, the authors focus on neurological disorders with psychiatric signs associated with copper, iron, and manganese excess and the diagnosis and potential treatment of such disorders. In our review, we described diseases related to these metals, such as aceruloplasminaemia, neuroferritinopathy, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) and other very rare classical NBIA forms, manganism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ephedrone encephalopathy, HMNDYT1-SLC30A10 deficiency (HMNDYT1), HMNDYT2-SLC39A14 deficiency, CDG2N-SLC39A8 deficiency, hepatic encephalopathy, prion disease and 'prion-like disease', amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and depression.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
29,14713669,Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,The social course of drug injection and sexual activity among YMSM and other high-risk youth: an agenda for future research.,"The cumulative epidemiologic literature indicates that many injecting drug users (IDUs) initiate injection as a mode of drug administration during late adolescence or early adulthood. Recent studies have shown that IDUs are often exposed to viral infections relatively early in the course of injection, highlighting the importance of understanding this initiation process for both epidemiology and prevention. Epidemiologic evidence similarly suggests that at least some youth populations, most notably young men who have sex with men (YMSM), are at substantial risk for exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) from early sexual activity. Despite the importance of this issue for both epidemiology and prevention, however, surprisingly little information is available on the social course of injection initiation, including the individual, social, or ecological factors that might mitigate or exacerbate transmission risks within the critical phase of early injection drug use. Similarly, we know little about the ways that YMSM and other high-risk youth understand risk, the kinds of exchanges and relationships in which they participate in the context of initiating sexual activity, or how drug use is operant in these exchanges and early sexual experiences. In this article, we explore key dimensions of the early initiation of injection and sexual risk, and discuss how a social network approach might be instrumental in understanding the social course of drug injection and sexual activities among youth and young adult populations.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

We reviewed the social skills intervention literature over the past two years (2012-2014). Social skills intervention studies have increased by 35% over our previous review of 2010-2012. Nearly equal numbers of studies reported results using single subject research designs (n = 29) and group designs (n = 25). Consistent with our previous review, many studies focused on joint attention/joint engagement for young children and interventions addressing peer interactions for older children. Advancements in this review period included more replications of intervention models, longitudinal outcomes, and a focus on minimally verbal children. Notably absent are social interventions for adults, and interventions addressing school-based inclusion. In addition to these target areas, future studies should isolate active ingredients of social interventions, include broader participant representation, and further examine the relation between neural development and behavioral outcomes.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
32,10470554,Infectious disease clinics of North America,Pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis.,"Bacterial meningitis is fatal in 5% to 40% of patients and causes neurologic sequelae in up to 30% of survivors. Much has been learned recently about the mechanisms that lead to brain injury during meningitis. Once bacteria have gained access to the central nervous system, their multiplication triggers a complex host response consisting of humoral and cellular immune mediators, reactive oxygen intermediates, matrix-metalloproteinases, and other host-derived factors. Alterations of the cerebral vasculature, with disruption of the blood brain barrier and global and focal ischemia, ultimately lead to functional and structural brain damage. This article reviews current concepts of the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis and emphasizes possible therapeutic strategies to prevent its harmful consequences.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
33,29759891,Sleep medicine reviews,"The putative role of oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathophysiology of sleep dysfunction across neuropsychiatric disorders: Focus on chronic fatigue syndrome, bipolar disorder and multiple sclerosis.","Sleep and circadian abnormalities are prevalent and burdensome manifestations of diverse neuro-immune diseases, and may aggravate the course of several neuropsychiatric disorders. The underlying pathophysiology of sleep abnormalities across neuropsychiatric disorders remains unclear, and may involve the inter-play of several clinical variables and mechanistic pathways. In this review, we propose a heuristic framework in which reciprocal interactions of immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and mitochondrial pathways may drive sleep abnormalities across potentially neuroprogressive disorders. Specifically, it is proposed that systemic inflammation may activate microglial cells and astrocytes in brain regions involved in sleep and circadian regulation. Activated glial cells may secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (for example, interleukin-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha), nitric oxide and gliotransmitters, which may influence the expression of key circadian regulators (e.g., the Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) gene). Furthermore, sleep disruption may further aggravate oxidative and nitrosative, peripheral immune activation, and (neuro) inflammation across these disorders in a vicious pathophysiological loop. This review will focus on chronic fatigue syndrome, bipolar disorder, and multiple sclerosis as exemplars of neuro-immune disorders. We conclude that novel therapeutic targets exploring immune and oxidative & nitrosative pathways (p.e. melatonin and molecular hydrogen) hold promise in alleviating sleep and circadian dysfunction in these disorders.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

This study was completed in three parts: (1) a narrative review of the literature; (2) an open-ended survey sent to the first authors of the identified articles; and (3) a descriptive analysis of responses. Results revealed that 56.7% of the identified articles did not report enough information of assessment procedures, 18.9% followed the assessment manual, 16.9% provided accommodations on a needs basis, and 7.5% used a consistent modified protocol. Individual responses showed that extra demonstrations (n = 5) were the most frequent accommodation, followed by extra breaks (n = 3), picture cards (n = 2), and hand-over-hand assistance (n = 1); some respondents stated that they did not provide accommodations. The findings indicate that a clear set of accommodation for motor skill assessments does not exist, though some commonalities were reported. Further research is necessary to understand the impact of accommodations in the assessment process, as well as which accommodations are needed and/or effective.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
35,21375489,Current molecular medicine,The Role of immune and inflammatory mechanisms in ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe progressive neurodegenerative disease. The cause is unknown, but genetic abnormalities have been identified in subjects with familial ALS and also in subjects with sporadic ALS. Environmental factors such as occupational exposure have been shown to be risk factors for the development of ALS. Patients differ in their clinical features and differ in the clinical course of disease. Immune abnormalities have been found in the central nervous system by pathological studies and also in the blood and CSF of subjects with ALS. Inflammation and immune abnormalities are also found in animals with a model of ALS due to mutations in the SOD1 gene. Previously it has been considered that immune abnormalities might contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. However more recently it has become apparent that an immune response can occur as a response to damage to the nervous system and this can be protective.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

A review of research published since 1994 was carried out concerning depression and occupational disability in five diagnostic groups: Major depressive disorder (MDD), spinal cord injuries (SCI), traumatic brain injuries (TBI), chronic back pain (CP) and myocardial infarction/coronary artery bypass grafting (MI/CABG).	Prospective longitudinal designs were mostly undertaken in MDD studies. Diagnostic interview schedules were utilized in most MDD studies whereas self-report inventories that tend to confound somatic and depressive symptoms were mostly used in CP, SCI, TBI and MI/CABG studies. In longitudinal MDD studies both depression and occupational disability were related to access to enhanced primary care treatment. On the other hand, CP research reported different results concerning the strength of depressive symptoms, cognitive and psychosocial factors in predicting occupational disability. Different trends across diagnostic groups were evident in relation to depression, occupational disability, co-morbidity, socio-demographic factors and psychosocial resources.	Co-morbid, socio-demographic and psychosocial factors provide a framework from which to identify those at greater risk of depression and occupational disability. However, more CP, SCI, TBI and MI/CABG studies with diagnostic schedules, prospective designs and longer follow-up are required.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Thirty-nine journal articles met the inclusion criteria. Six types of interventions were identified that addressed depression, anxiety, or mental health-related quality of life: exercise or movement based, behavioral therapy and stroke education, behavioral therapy only, stroke education only, care support and coordination, and community-based interventions that included occupational therapy. Evidence from well-conducted research supports using problem-solving or motivational interviewing behavioral techniques to address depression. The evidence is inconclusive for using multicomponent exercise programs to combat depression after stroke and for the use of stroke education and care support and coordination interventions to address poststroke anxiety.

Psychiatrists continue to grapple with the full ramifications of the condition, even though interest specifically in pathological lying seems to have waned in recent times. The impact of pathological lying deserves critical attention from forensic psychiatrists because of the implications that untruths have in a legal context. In this article, the authors review the considerable vagueness and confusion that has surrounded this concept and examine the extent to which a person can control lying behavior and the related question of whether pathological liars have responsibility for their actions. While providing a structured framework for considering pathological lying in the forensic context, the authors conclude that further systematic research is needed to resolve the questions raised in this article.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

While the condition has been well described in patients with acute hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, post-transplantation and chemotherapy, RPLS has been increasingly identified in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Though experience in the diagnosis and management of RPLS in patients with SLE is likely accumulating, few have systematically worked out the strategy to distinguish RPLS from neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) and lupus-related complications of the central nervous system (CNS). Prompt recognition of, and differentiation between, these conditions is essential since their clinical presentations substantially overlap and yet their management strategy and subsequent outcomes can be entirely different. Indeed, inappropriate treatment such as augmentation of immunosuppression may be detrimental to patients with RPLS. A high index of suspicion of RPLS, prompt magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, including diffusion imaging, exclusion of CNS infection and metabolic derangement, a comprehensive medication review accompanied by timely and aggressive control of blood pressure and seizure are keys to successful management of RPLS. Such treatment strategy ensures a very high chance of total neurological recovery in lupus patients with RPLS.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques,Helping Families Cope with the Severe Stress of Dravet Syndrome.,"A child with Dravet syndrome shakes family life to the core. Dravet syndrome usually has three phases: (1) up to 1-1½ years: with episodes of febrile status epilepticus but normal development; (2) age 1½ to ~6-10 years: with frequent seizures of varying types, developmental stagnation, behavioural and sleep problems; (3) after ~10 years: improvement in seizures, deteriorating gait, intellectual disability but some developmental gains. Complete seizure control is rare-simply prescribing medication is inadequate to help families. Based on structured interviews with 24 families and confirmed by more informal discussions with other families, we suggest strategies for coping with this catastrophe. A child with Dravet syndrome usually means that one parent cannot work-financial pressures should be anticipated. In Stage 1, the approach to status should include a written protocol. An indwelling catheter for rapid venous access may be helpful. In Stage 2, assistance finding qualified babysitters is required, and the extended family needs encouragement to help. Appropriate equipment, rescue medication and protocols should travel with the child. Siblings may benefit from a system of one parent 'on call.' An internet support group provides an invaluable lifeline. In Stage 3, family isolation may be extreme-respite care and personal time for parents are important. Death from status, accidents and SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) occurs in 15%. Fear of SUDEP needs to be addressed. Moving from paediatric to adult care is frightening; an epilepsy transition clinic is useful.

Though more choice is a good thing, it does mandate knowing which drug is the most appropriate in a given clinical situation. Three novel OACs--dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban--are approved for use in atrial fibrillation in Canada. They have each been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials where they have been shown to be noninferior, or in some cases superior, to warfarin (Coumadin). Prescription coverage for these drugs is increasingly available through third party and government drug plans. The major enhancements of the novel OACs relate to their rapid, consistent anticoagulant effect at fixed dosing and the lack of need for monitoring of anticoagulant effect. Nonetheless, their use is not foolproof and practitioners must be familiar with their limitations. On balance, we favour the use of novel OACs over warfarin in patients who are anticoagulant-naive, given their increased ease of use.

The concepts of state and trait anxiety, and the most widely used measures of these, are reviewed. A measure of state anxiety is essential in some clinical and experimental research and it is often very useful in clinical practice. Whilst existing measures are satisfactory for some purposes, none adequately assesses the psychological, somatic and behavioural components of anxiety. The measurement of trait anxiety is also important in some clinical research and as part of the assessment of selected patients. In some circumstances, self report measures of trait anxiety should be used in conjunction with a measure of social desirability. Patients who score low both on trait anxiety and social desirability may respond differently to experimental stressors from those who score low on trait anxiety and high on social desirability. This may have a number of implications, for example in the area of psychoimmunology. Four scales are reviewed in more detail: the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Clinical Anxiety Scale and the Fear Questionnaire.

While the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) expresses AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8, the lack of SLC6A8 in astrocytes around the blood-brain barrier limits the brain capacity to import creatine from the periphery, and suggests that the CNS has to rely mainly on endogenous creatine synthesis through AGAT and GAMT expression. This seems contradictory with SLC6A8 deficiency, which, despite AGAT and GAMT expression, also leads to creatine deficiency in the CNS. We present novel data showing that in cortical grey matter, AGAT and GAMT are expressed in a dissociated way: e.g. only a few cells co-express both genes. This suggests that to allow synthesis of creatine within the CNS, at least for a significant part of it, guanidinoacetate must be transported from AGAT- to GAMT-expressing cells, possibly through SLC6A8. This would explain the creatine deficiency observed in SLC6A8-deficient patients. By bringing together creatine deficiency syndromes, AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8 distribution in CNS, as well as a synthetic view on creatine and guanidinoacetate levels in the brain, this review presents a comprehensive framework, including new hypotheses, on brain creatine metabolism and transport, both in normal conditions and in case of creatine deficiency.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

This trend is expected to worsen in the coming decades, with the number of cases possibly even tripling in the next 25 years. Therefore Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention is becoming a global health priority. Our knowledge of the pathophysiological process leading to the development of pathological brain lesions that characterize AD has increased exponentially in recent years. However, the phenotypic expression of AD not only depends on the development of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but other factors also play a role. Thus, over the last few decades, epidemiological studies have revealed several risk factors for developing AD, such as vascular or lifestyle related factors. Having the current knowledge on AD, two different strategies have been developed for the prevention of AD: one is based on primary prevention by acting on modifiable risk factors, the other is a pathophysiology-driven approach aimed to identify individuals in a preclinical stage of the disease and treating them with drugs purporting to act on molecular targets of the amyloid cascade. Several promising trials with these approaches are currently ongoing and results are expected in the next few years. The intrinsic limitations in the design of preventive trials should be overcome through a global effort involving healthy population, healthcare professionals, governments, industry, and scientific institutions. This exertion will be more than compensated if we can make AD a preventable disease.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

In a cluster randomized controlled trial (Netherlands National Trial Register NTR1967), healthcare professionals of intervention units received the stepwise training, while training of the control group focused on knowledge and skills without the stepwise component. Observed and estimated pain was assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Logistic generalized estimating equations were used to test treatment and time effects.	A total of 21 clusters (single nursing home units) in 12 Dutch nursing homes included 288 residents with advanced dementia (Global Deterioration Scale score 5, 6, or 7): 148 in the intervention and 140 in the control condition.	The multilevel modeling showed an overall effect of the intervention on observed pain but not on estimated pain; Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate-Dutch version, mean difference: -1.21 points (95% confidence interval: -2.35 to -0.06); Minimum Dataset of the Resident Assessment Instrument pain scale, mean difference: -0.01 points (95% confidence interval: -0.36 to 0.35). Opioid use increased (odds ratio = 3.08; 95% confidence interval: 1.08-8.74); paracetamol use did not (odds ratio = 1.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.71-2.68).	STA OP! was found to decrease 'observed' pain but not estimated pain. Observing pain-related behavior might help improve pain management in dementia.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

The intervention group performed exercises specifically designed to improve auditory processing speed and accuracy for 100 min/d, 5 d/wk for 6 weeks; the control group performed more passive computer activities (reading, listening, visuospatial game) for similar amounts of time. Subjects had a mean age of 74 years and 60% were men; 77% successfully completed training. On our primary outcome, Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status total scores improved 0.36 standard deviations (SD) in the intervention group (P=0.097) compared with 0.03 SD in the control group (P=0.88) for a nonsignificant difference between the groups of 0.33 SD (P=0.26). On 12 secondary outcome measures, most differences between the groups were not statistically significant. However, we observed a pattern in which effect sizes for verbal learning and memory measures tended to favor the intervention group whereas effect sizes for language and visuospatial function measures tended to favor the control group, which raises the possibility that these training programs may have domain-specific effects. We conclude that intensive, computer-based mental activity is feasible in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and that larger trials are warranted.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
67,26460571,Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,Mandated college students' response to sequentially administered alcohol interventions in a randomized clinical trial using stepped care.,"Students referred to school administration for alcohol policies violations currently receive a wide variety of interventions. This study examined predictors of response to 2 interventions delivered to mandated college students (N = 598) using a stepped care approach incorporating a peer-delivered 15-min brief advice (BA) session (Step 1) and a 60- to 90-min brief motivational intervention (BMI) delivered by trained interventionists (Step 2).	Analyses were completed in 2 stages. First, 3 types of variables (screening variables, alcohol-related cognitions, mandated student profile) were examined in a logistic regression model as putative predictors of lower risk drinking (defined as 3 or fewer heavy episodic drinking [HED] episodes and/or 4 or fewer alcohol-related consequences in the past month) 6 weeks following the BA session. Second, we used generalized estimating equations to examine putative moderators of BMI effects on HED and peak blood alcohol content compared with assessment only (AO) control over the 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups.	Participants reporting lower scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, more benefits to changing alcohol use, and those who fit the 'Bad Incident' profile at baseline were more likely to report lower risk drinking 6 weeks after the BA session. Moderation analyses revealed that Bad Incident students who received the BMI reported more HED at 9-month follow-up than those who received AO.	Current alcohol use as well as personal reaction to the referral event may have clinical utility in identifying which mandated students benefit from treatments of varying content and intensity.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Post-hoc analyses of randomized clinical trial data of 369 outpatients with primary PD/AG (DSM-IV-TR criteria) treated with a 12-session manualized CBT (n = 301) and a waitlist control group (n = 68). Patients with comorbid depression (DSM-IV-TR major depression, dysthymia, or both: 43.2% CBT, 42.7% controls) were compared to patients without depression regarding anxiety and depression outcomes (Clinical Global Impression Scale [CGI], Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A], number of panic attacks, Mobility Inventory [MI], Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, Beck Depression Inventory) at post-treatment and follow-up (categorical). Further, the role of severity of depressive symptoms on anxiety/depression outcome measures was examined (dimensional).	Comorbid depression did not have a significant overall effect on anxiety outcomes at post-treatment and follow-up, except for slightly diminished post-treatment effect sizes for clinician-rated CGI (p = 0.03) and HAM-A (p = 0.008) when adjusting for baseline anxiety severity. In the dimensional model, higher baseline depression scores were associated with lower effect sizes at post-treatment (except for MI), but not at follow-up (except for HAM-A). Depressive symptoms improved irrespective of the presence of depression.	Exposure-based CBT for primary PD/AG effectively reduces anxiety and depressive symptoms, irrespective of comorbid depression or depressive symptomatology.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

The widespread access to TAT makes it a potentially cost-effective and inventive option available for delivery in multiple settings. This study assessed acceptability of the web-based Therapeutic Education System (TES) in hospitalized dual diagnosis patients with SUDs and other psychiatric disorders. Methods: Eligible participants were nonpsychotic, voluntary patients with self-reported drug or alcohol use in the 30 days prior to admission. They were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU, n = 47) or TAU + TES (n = 48). Acceptability of this Internet-based intervention was assessed by observed utilization and self-report. Results: The TAU + TES group (# analyzed = 41) completed a mean total of 5.5 (SEM = 0.8) modules with about one module per day while hospitalized and rated TES highly on several constructs of acceptability, including novelty, usefulness and ease of understanding. Conclusions: These findings support further exploration of TAT for treatment expansion in a high acuity, dual diagnosis population and indicate the value of future research on efficacy.

Controversy exists about whether open microsurgical methods serve to reduce shunt dependency compared with endovascular techniques.	To determine predictors of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and functional outcomes after aneurysmal SAH.	A total of 471 patients who were part of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial from 2003 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. All variables including demographic data, medical history, treatment, imaging, and functional outcomes were included as part of the trial. No additional variables were retrospectively collected.	Ultimately, 147 patients (31.2%) required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) in our series. Age, dissecting aneurysm type, ruptured vertebrobasilar aneurysm, Fisher grade, Hunt and Hess grade, admission intraventricular hemorrhage, admission intraparenchymal hemorrhage, blood in the fourth ventricle on admission, perioperative ventriculostomy, and hemicraniectomy were significant risk factors (P < .05) associated with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, intraventricular hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage were independent risk factors for shunt dependency (P < .05). Clipping vs coiling treatment was not statistically associated with VPS after SAH on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients who did not receive a VPS at discharge had higher Glasgow Outcome Scale and Barthel Index scores and were more likely to be functionally independent and to return to work 72 months after surgery (P < .05).	There is no difference in shunt dependency after SAH among patients treated by endovascular or microsurgical means. Patients in whom shunt-dependent hydrocephalus does not develop after SAH tend to have improved long-term functional outcomes.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
71,22440072,Behavior therapy,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy improves emotional reactivity to social stress: results from a randomized controlled trial.,"The high likelihood of recurrence in depression is linked to a progressive increase in emotional reactivity to stress (stress sensitization). Mindfulness-based therapies teach mindfulness skills designed to decrease emotional reactivity in the face of negative affect-producing stressors. The primary aim of the current study was to assess whether Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is efficacious in reducing emotional reactivity to social evaluative threat in a clinical sample with recurrent depression. A secondary aim was to assess whether improvement in emotional reactivity mediates improvements in depressive symptoms. Fifty-two individuals with partially remitted depression were randomized into an 8-week MBCT course or a waitlist control condition. All participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) before and after the 8-week trial period. Emotional reactivity to stress was assessed with the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory at several time points before, during, and after the stressor. MBCT was associated with decreased emotional reactivity to social stress, specifically during the recovery (post-stressor) phase of the TSST. Waitlist controls showed an increase in anticipatory (pre-stressor) anxiety that was absent in the MBCT group. Improvements in emotional reactivity partially mediated improvements in depressive symptoms. Limitations include small sample size, lack of objective or treatment adherence measures, and non-generalizability to more severely depressed populations. Given that emotional reactivity to stress is an important psychopathological process underlying the chronic and recurrent nature of depression, these findings suggest that mindfulness skills are important in adaptive emotion regulation when coping with stress.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

We performed a systematic analysis of 12 autosomal-dominant PD (AD-PD) genes (SNCA, LRRK2, GIGYF2, VPS35, EIF4G1, DNAJC13, CHCHD2, HTRA2, NR4A2, RIC3, TMEM230, and UCHL1) using panel sequencing and database filtration in a case-control study of a cohort of 391 Chinese sporadic PD patients and unrelated controls. We evaluated the association between candidate variants and sporadic PD using gene-based analysis.	Overall, 18 rare variants were discovered in 18.8% (36/191) of the index patients. In addition to previously reported pathogenic mutations (LRRK2 p.Arg1441His and p.Ala419Val), another four unknown variants were found in LRRK2, which also contribute to PD risk (p = 0.002; odds ratio (OR) = 7.83, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.76-34.93). The cumulative frequency of undetermined rare variants was significantly higher in PD patients (14.1%) than in controls (3.5%) (p = 0.0002; OR=4.54, 95% CI = 1.93-10.69).	Our results confirm the strong impact of LRRK2 on the risk of sporadic PD, and also provide considerable evidence of the existence of additional undetermined rare variants in AD-PD genes that contribute to the genetic etiology of sporadic PD in a Chinese cohort.",Remaining,0,0

76,2125805,Acta neurochirurgica,Haemodynamic aspects of clinical cerebral angiography. Concurrent two vessel monitoring using transcranial Doppler ultrasound.,"To overcome the technical limitations which have precluded noninvasive Doppler ultrasound in investigation of rapid cerebral haemodynamic responses in two cerebrovascular beds at the same time, we have modified a commercial 2 MHz pulsed Doppler instrument with online spectrum analysis. Two probes are activated intermittently, recording eight averaged Doppler-shifted spectra from each probe sequentially. Concurrent recordings of blood velocity in both middle cerebral arteries were performed during 25 selective iohexol carotid angiography runs in 13 patients with near normal cerebral vasculature. The technique permitted the differentiation between the specific responses confined to the recipient vascular bed, and the general responses occurring in remote brain areas as well. The specific response to iohexol was biphasic; a significant decrease in blood velocity occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, probably due to the high viscocity of iohexol. Between 4 and 12 s. blood velocity was significantly increased, reflecting the cerebrovascular response to hypertonic solutions. The blood velocity on the opposite side increased from less than 4 s through 45 s after iohexol. This concurs with studies using electromagnetic flowmetry, and suggests that these general responses are elicited by anxiety, discomfort and pain. Thus, no general responses were seen during angiography under general anaesthesia. Eight patients investigated during catheter flushing with normal saline showed a biphasic specific response reciprocal to that due to iohexol. A significant blood velocity peak occurred less than 4 s after the bolus entry, followed by a decrease between 4 and 60 s. The saline injections produced no pain and evoked no significant general response.",Remaining,0,0

The abbreviated Early Social Communication Scales [Mundy et al. 1996, Early social communication scales (ESCS)] were used to test three types of nonverbal communicative skills, i.e., joint attention, requesting, and social interaction. Both frequency and proportion analyses were done in group comparisons.	(1) Two- to three-year-old children with autism displayed deficits in joint attention ability, especially high-level skills. (2) The deficit in terms of frequency of communication was marked even compared with typically developing infants with younger mental age. (3) Young children with autism had different nonverbal communication profile compared with all three comparison groups.	Early social-communicative difficulties in autism involve early triadic communications involving joint attention and possibly dyadic turn-taking skills, which has implications for both early screening and early intervention.",Remaining,0,0

The EncephalApp Stroop test is validated for its screening. The aim of the study was to define Tunisian norms for the test based on healthy controls norms and to estimate the prevalence of CHE in cirrhotic Tunisian patients. Methods: A prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted. Ambulatory or hospitalized cirrhotic patients aged 40 years and over were recruited at 11 centers. Healthy subjects aged 40 years and over were recruited at 8 centers. We used a translated Arabic version of the streamlined EncephalApp Stroop test. The task has two components: 'Off' and 'On' state depending on the discordance or concordance of the stimuli. Results: 142 patients were included. The mean age was 57.26 years [40-86]. 40 (28.17%) of cirrhotic patients who were included were diagnosed as having a minimal hepatic encephalopathy or CHE. Among the ineligible patients, 22 had overt hepatic encephalopathy. If we consider these patients, the overall prevalence rate of CHE was around 24.39% in cirrhotic patients. It was more frequent in women (34.21% vs 25.96%), and in patients whose level of school education is between 6 and 13 years. Its prevalence does not appear to be affected by gender, MELD score, etiology of cirrhosis and age group of patients, as these variables were independent with respective p according to the chi-square test 0.413; 0.736; 0.663 and 0.1. The stroop times (On / Off and On + Off) correlated significantly with each other, are associated significantly and positively with age (respective Pearson coefficients: 0.578; 0.567 and 0.6).

American journal of neuroradiology,Spinal cord pial metastases: MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine.,"The purpose of this investigation was to describe gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced MR findings in metastatic disease to the pial lining of the spinal cord. Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinoma (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one).

PD subjects show abnormal staining for Escherichia coli and α-synuclein in the colon.	We recruited 52 PD patients and 36 healthy cohabitants. We measured serum markers and quantified the numbers of 19 fecal bacterial groups/genera/species by quantitative RT-PCR of 16S or 23S rRNA. Although the six most predominant bacterial groups/genera/species covered on average 71.3% of total intestinal bacteria, our analysis was not comprehensive compared to metagenome analysis or 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.	In PD, the number of Lactobacillus was higher, while the sum of analyzed bacteria, Clostridium coccoides group, and Bacteroides fragilis group were lower than controls. Additionally, the sum of putative hydrogen-producing bacteria was lower in PD. A linear regression model to predict disease durations demonstrated that C. coccoides group and Lactobacillus gasseri subgroup had the largest negative and positive coefficients, respectively. As a linear regression model to predict stool frequencies showed that these bacteria were not associated with constipation, changes in these bacteria were unlikely to represent worsening of constipation in the course of progression of PD. In PD, the serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein levels were lower than controls, while the levels of serum diamine oxidase, a marker for intestinal mucosal integrity, remained unchanged in PD.	The permeability to LPS is likely to be increased without compromising the integrity of intestinal mucosa in PD. The increased intestinal permeability in PD may make the patients susceptible to intestinal dysbiosis. Conversely, intestinal dysbiosis may lead to the increased intestinal permeability. One or both of the two mechanisms may be operational in development and progression of PD.",Remaining,0,0

Clients referred from resettlement agencies via the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to a community clinic in the United States (N = 278) were interviewed with structured, translated questionnaires. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses determined the associations of sociodemographic, pre-, and post-migration risk factors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and global functioning.	Regression data indicate that length of time between arrival in US and clinical services was significantly associated with PTSD and depression; participants receiving services after 1 year of resettlement were more likely to experience PTSD (adjusted OR = 3.29) and depression (adjusted OR = 4.50) than participants receiving services within 1 year. Anxiety was predicted by female gender (adjusted OR = 3.43), age over 40 years (adjusted OR = 3.12), Muslim religion (adjusted OR = 2.64), and receiving medical services (AOR 3.1). Severely impaired global functioning was associated with female gender (adjusted OR = 2.75) and unstable housing status (adjusted OR = 2.21).	Findings highlight the importance of examining post-migration variables such as length of time in country prior to receiving services in addition to pre-migration torture history upon relocated torture survivors.

MetS was evaluated using the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III).	Of the 1,023 participants, 24.3% were identified with MetS, 13.5% were diagnosed with anxiety disorders, 7.5% with current depression, 3.9% with bipolar disorders and 10.1% were at risk of suicide. MetS was associated with ethnicity (p = 0.022), excess weight (p < 0.001), current anxiety disorders (p < 0.001), current mood disorders (bipolar disorder in mood episode and current depression) (p < 0.001), and suicide risk (p < 0.001).	MetS was associated with psychiatric disorders. Awareness of factors associated with MetS can help identify high-risk individuals and stimulate disease prevention and control programs, as well as lifestyle changes.",Remaining,0,0
89,2500373,Developmental medicine and child neurology,Effects of puberty on seizure frequency.,"Seizure frequency was documented before, during and in some cases after puberty for 12 patients with continuing generalised tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and for 14 with complex partial seizures (CPS) who were receiving anti-epileptic drugs. For the patients with GTCS there was a significant increase in seizure frequency during the pubertal growth-spurt, with a subsequent decrease after growth ceased. There appeared to be no relationship between puberty and the frequency of CPS. Both groups were more likely to have suboptimal plasma drug-levels during puberty, suggesting that medication was not the cause of the increased GTCS frequency. Further examination of hormonal levels in relation to frequency of GTCS during puberty could provide a better understanding of the influence of hormones.",Remaining,0,0
90,8483863,Preventive medicine,Predictors and reasons for relapse in smoking cessation with nicotine and placebo patches.,"The reasons for relapse to smoking are not fully understood but several factors are of importance. Addiction to nicotine seems to play a prominent role but there are several other contributing factors.	To determine predictors of outcome in smoking cessation, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses in a large smoking cessation trial comprising 289 subjects. Weight gain and withdrawal symptoms were analyzed separately as predictors. To determine self-perceived reasons for relapse we created a questionnaire, which was answered by 132 relapsers.	Previous attempts to quit smoking and a low saliva cotinine concentration were significantly associated with abstinence in the nicotine-treated group. A trend toward higher abstinence rates was found among males and among subjects with a low nicotine dependency score. Logistic regression analysis showed higher success rates in subjects with the largest weight gain during the first weeks of quitting in contrast to higher relapse rates in subjects who had the greatest weight gain after 3 months. A high score on withdrawal symptoms was not predictive of relapse. Subjects with 'slips' had a markedly increased relapse rate. Craving for cigarettes was the most often self-reported (48%) reason for relapse.	The relation between weight gain, withdrawal scoring, and outcome seems rather complex. Craving for cigarettes was the most reported reason for relapse.",Remaining,0,0

92,8969775,Stroke,Ultrasound densitometric analysis of carotid plaque composition. Pathoanatomic correlation.,"The components of a carotid artery plaque might affect the risk of ipsilateral stroke. The accuracy of carotid duplex scan in assessing stroke risk reflects the experience of the scan reader. Thus, methods that can enhance ultrasonic evaluation of plaque morphology might allow a more objective means of determining carotid-mediated stroke risk.	We performed densitometric analysis of B-mode images of carotid plaques in nine patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy. All patients had preoperative duplex color imaging and cerebral arteriography. The surgical specimen was analyzed histologically to determine the plaque components (soft plaque/organized thrombus, intraplaque hemorrhage/lipid deposition, fibrosis, and calcification). The specimen findings were correlated with the densitometric measurements to determine whether the density analysis would allow a reliable determination of the plaque substratum.	With 1.0 as a reference point for the moving column of blood, the mean acoustic densities (+/-SD) were as follows: organized thrombus, 1.8 +/- 0.5; intraplaque hemorrhage/lipid deposition, 5.15 +/- 0.9; fibrosis, 9.51 +/- 2.9; and calcification, 15.5 +/- 8.6.	We conclude that densitometric evaluation allows differentiation of the various possible components of carotid plaque. The determination of plaque composition, based on density measurement, may provide information about its potential for thromboembolization.",Remaining,0,0

We used Growth Curve Analysis to test whether movement patterns were predictable by expression type and participant group. Results show significant interactions between expression type and group, and little effect of emotion valence on ASD expressions. Together, results support perceptions that expressions of individuals with ASD are different from-and more ambiguous than-those of neurotypical individuals'.",Remaining,0,0

Twenty-seven patients affected by CM and 30 with MOH were enrolled. Control CSF specimens were obtained from 20 age-matched subjects who underwent lumbar puncture for diagnostic purposes, and in all of them CSF and blood tests excluded central nervous system or systemic diseases. Orexin-A and CRF were determined by radioimmunoassay methods. Significantly higher levels of orexin-A and CRF were found in the CSF of MOH and to a lesser extent in patients with CM compared with control subjects (orexin-A: P < 0.001 and P < 0.02; CRF: P < 0.002 and P < 0.0003). A significant positive correlation was also found between CSF orexin-A values and those of CRF (R = 0.71; P < 0.0008), monthly drug intake group (R = 0.39; P < 0.03) and scores of a self-completion 10-item instrument to measure dependence upon a variety of substances, the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ) in the MOH group (R = 0.68; P < 0.0003). The significantly higher orexin-A levels found in CM and MOH can be interpreted as a compensatory response to chronic head pain or, alternatively, as an expression of hypothalamic response to stress due to chronic pain. A potential role for orexin-A in driving drug seeking in MOH patients through activation of stress pathways in the brain can also be hypothesized.",Remaining,0,0

The recommendations also address brief alcohol screening, as alcohol accelerates progression of liver disease among HCV-infected individuals. These recommendations augment CDC's 1998 and 1999 recommendations based on risk and medical indications and are not meant to replace those recommendations.	These recommendations are based on systematic reviews of evidence published from 1995 through February 2012 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Sociological Abstracts, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. Selected studies included cross-sectional and cohort studies that addressed either prevalence of hepatitis C in the United States or clinical outcomes (for example, hepatocellular carcinoma and serious adverse events) among treated patients and systematic reviews of trials that assessed effectiveness of brief screening interventions for alcohol consumption. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework was used to assess quality of the evidence. RECOMMENDATION 1: Adults born during 1945-1965 should receive 1-time testing for HCV without prior ascertainment of HCV risk. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: All persons with identified HCV infection should receive a brief alcohol screening and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by referral to appropriate care and treatment services for HCV infection and related conditions (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).",Remaining,0,0

The purpose of this study was to examine whether the pathway from ADI to AUD symptoms by early adulthood is moderated by ethnicity and possessing an alcohol-metabolizing gene ALDH2*2 variant allele.	We used multigroup structural equation modeling, including 5 groups split by ethnicity and ALDH2*2, to examine the consistency of the path from ADI to AUD symptoms in 604 Chinese-, Korean-, and White-American college students. We further examined the effects of ALDH2*2, ethnicity, and their interaction in Asians to better understand their unique contributions to the moderation.	The association between ADI and AUD symptoms was moderated, with ADI negatively associated with AUD symptoms among Koreans without ALDH2*2 and Whites, but not among Koreans with ALDH2*2 or Chinese regardless of ALDH2*2. Both ALDH2*2 and ethnicity within Asians contributed unique variability in the effect.	Ethnicity and ALDH2*2 altered the relationship of ADI as a risk factor for AUD symptoms. Being Chinese and possessing an ALDH2*2 allele within Koreans both buffered against the risk for AUD symptoms associated with earlier ADI, indicating that this relationship can be attenuated by protective factors.",Remaining,0,0

The objectives were to provide a hands-on, student-led clinical experience; facilitate interprofessional collaborative learning through leadership partnerships and teach children with ASD to engage in appropriate social skill behaviors. Concurrently, faculty performed qualitative research to explore how the students worked together to provide intervention to the children. Data were collected via interview, direct observation of student planning sessions and student interprofessional interactions, and collection of posts from an online social network site used for session planning. There were six student participants and two faculty participants. Four themes emerged: learning who I am as a professional, learning to appreciate our professional differences, learning to communicate with each other and figuring it out, for the benefit of the kids.

99,29279071,Acta medica portuguesa,Portuguese Adaptation and Input for the Validation of the Views on Inpatient Care (VOICE) Outcome Measure to Assess Service Users'Perceptions of Inpatient Psychiatric Care.,"Patient satisfaction is an important measure of health care quality. Patients' views have seldom been considered in the construction of measures addressing satisfaction with inpatient facilities in psychiatry. The Views on Inpatient Care - VOICE - is a first service-user generated outcome measure relying solely on their perceptions of acute care, representing a valuable indicator of service users' perceived quality of care. The present study aimed to contribute to the validation of the Portuguese version of VOICE.	The questionnaire was translated into Portuguese and applied to a sample of eighty-five female inpatients of a psychiatric institution. Data analysis focused on assessing reliability and exploring the impact of demographic and clinical variables on participants' satisfaction.	Internal consistency of the questionnaire was high (α = 0.87). Participants' age and marital status were associated with differences in scores, with older patients and patients who were married or involved in a close relationship presenting higher satisfaction levels.	The questionnaire demonstrated good internal consistency and acceptability, as well as construct validity. Further studies should expand the analysis of the psychometric properties of this measure e.g., test-retest reliability.	The Portuguese version of VOICE is a promising tool to assess service users' perceptions of inpatient psychiatric care in Portugal.	Introdução: A satisfação com os serviços de saúde é uma medida importante da qualidade dos cuidados formais prestados.

O presente estudo visou contribuir para a validação da versão portuguesa desta medida. Material e Métodos: O questionário foi traduzido e adaptado para português, e aplicado a uma amostra de 85 mulheres admitidas num serviço de internamento psiquiátrico. A análise focou-se na consistência interna da medida e no impacto das variáveis demográficas e clínicas nos níveis de satisfação. Resultados: A consistência interna foi elevada (α = 0,87). Encontrámos associações entre a idade e o estado civil e as pontuações obtidas: doentes mais velhos e doentes casados, ou vivendo maritalmente, apresentaram níveis mais elevados de satisfação. Discussão: O questionário apresentou boa consistência interna e aceitabilidade entre os participantes, bem como validade de constructo.

Depressive symptoms and eating pathology were assessed at approximately ages 11, 14, and 17.	As expected, substantial continuity in both eating pathology and depressive symptoms occurred across time.

In this study, we aimed to provide a shared foundation for UKB neuroimaging research into mental health with a focus on anxiety and depression. We compared UKB self-report measures and revealed important timing effects between scan acquisition and separate online acquisition of some mental health measures. To overcome these timing effects, we introduced and validated the Recent Depressive Symptoms (RDS-4) score which we recommend for state-dependent and longitudinal research in the UKB. We furthermore tested univariate and multivariate associations between brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and mental health. Our results showed a significant multivariate relationship between IDPs and mental health, which was replicable. Conversely, effect sizes for individual IDPs were small. Test-retest reliability of IDPs was stronger for measures of brain structure than for measures of brain function. Taken together, these results provide benchmarks and guidelines for future UKB research into brain biomarkers of mental health.",Remaining,0,0

This article provides the first systematic evaluation on the medical comorbidity of ADHD in a nationally representative sample (National Comorbidity Replication Survey-Adolescent Supplement; N = 6483) using formal diagnostic criteria. Survey-weighted odds ratios adjusted for demographics, additional medical, and mental disorders were calculated for associations between ADHD and medical conditions. Models adjusted for demographics revealed significantly increased odds of allergy, asthma, enuresis, headache/migraine, and serious stomach or bowel problems. After adjusting for comorbidity, across the medical conditions, enuresis and serious stomach problems were the strongest correlates of ADHD. These findings confirm the pervasive medical comorbidity of ADHD reported in previous clinical and community-based studies. The intriguing salience of enuresis and serious stomach or bowel conditions may also provide an important clue to multisystem involvement in ADHD.",Remaining,0,0

However, recent case studies have shown the phenomenon also to occur in typically developing and even precocious talkers. This study examines longitudinal corpus data from two children, a typically developing girl, and a boy with Asperger's syndrome. Both were precocious talkers who reversed the majority of their personal pronouns for several months. A comparison of the children's behaviors revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in pronoun use: the girl showed 'semantic confusion', using second person pronouns for self-reference, whereas the boy showed a discourse-pragmatic deficit related to perspective-taking. The results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms underlying pronoun reversal and provide qualified support for both the Name/Person Hypothesis (Clark, 1978; Charney, 1980b) and the Plurifunctional Pronoun Hypothesis (Chiat, 1982).",Remaining,0,0
104,10211470,Annals of neurology,Hippocampal or neocortical lesions on magnetic resonance imaging do not necessarily indicate site of ictal onsets in partial epilepsy.,"Advances in neuroimaging techniques, particularly high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have proved invaluable in identifying structural brain lesions in patients with epilepsy. The assumption that such focal lesions invariably predict the site of seizure origin may not be correct, however. We report a series of 20 adults with medically intractable partial epilepsy, where high-resolution brain MRI disclosed a unilateral, focal, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion as the only abnormality in each case; nevertheless, based on electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, ictal onsets arose from a completely different location than that of the MRI lesion. All patients underwent epilepsy surgery, with the operations based on ictal EEG findings, and all were followed at least 2 years after the resection. After the most recent follow-up examination, 50% (10/20) of the patients were completely seizure-free, 35% (7/20) had at least a 75% reduction in the number of seizures, and 15% (3/20) had less than a 75% reduction in the number of seizures. We conclude that the identification of a focal, structural, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion on brain MRI is not always indicative of the site of seizure origin in partial epilepsy. Furthermore, in cases of discordance between MRI and EEG data, a good outcome after epilepsy surgery is possible if EEG ictal onsets are definitive.",Remaining,0,0

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) and habituation of the startle reflex are operational measures of early information processing. Impaired PPI in schizophrenia has been replicated in many studies and is regarded as an endophenotype for schizophrenia. However, reports on the stability of PPI over a longer period of time are lacking, both for patients with schizophrenia and for healthy subjects. The current study examined 25 initially drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients and 23 healthy matched controls. Three PPI measures [stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) 30, 60, 120 ms] and habituation were assessed at baseline, and again after 6 yr. Sixteen patients and 17 healthy controls completed the study, and 13 patients and 17 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. The schizophrenia patients had PPI deficits compared to controls at baseline. After 6 yr, no significant group differences were found. PPI had increased significantly in the patients and had decreased significantly in controls. In addition, patients showed significantly less habituation than controls while habituation did not change in patients or controls. The present results show that PPI in drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients can improve significantly over time. As PPI increased in patients over the same period that it decreased in controls, it is likely that the increase was caused by disease-related factors such as disease process, clinical state, or medication.",Remaining,0,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 159 patients included in the cluster analysis who were ≥60 years and who underwent four-month follow-up. The first cluster contained 50 patients, the second cluster contained 74 patients, and the third cluster contained 35 patients. Clinical parameters were identified from electronic health records and patient questionnaires. Laboratory tests, anthropometric measurements, the number of chronic diseases, the number of prescribed medications were recorded. Frailty was determined using the five criteria of Fried's phenotype -model. Levels of anxiety and depression were recorded using the Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score assessed cognitive impairment. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of frailty and pre-frailty. RESULTS Three overlapping clusters of phenotypes predicted frailty, and included obesity (n=50), multimorbidity with mental impairment (n=74), and decline in renal function with cognitive impairment (n=35). The predictors of outcome included increasing age, number of chronic diseases, inflammation, anemia, anxiety, and cognitive impairment, and reduced muscle mass.

The patients were selected from a group of epileptic subjects with seizure onset in infancy or early childhood. Inclusion criteria were the presence of photic-induced myoclonic seizures and a favorable outcome. Cases with less than 24 month follow up were excluded from the analysis.	Eight patients were identified (4 males, 4 females). Personal history was uneventful. All of them had familial antecedents of epilepsy. Psychomotor development was normal in 6 cases, both before and after seizure onset. One patient showed a mild mental retardation and a further patient showed some behavioral disturbances. Neuroradiological investigations, when performed (5 cases), gave normal results. The clinical manifestations were typical and could vary from upward movements of the eyes to myoclonic jerks of the head and shoulders, isolated or briefly repetitive, never causing a fall. Age of onset was between 11 months and 3 years and 2 months. Characteristically, the seizures were always triggered by photic stimulation. Non photo-induced spontaneous myoclonic attacks were reported in 2 cases during the follow-up. Other types of seizures were present at follow-up in 2 cases. The outcome was favorable, even if, usually, seizure control required high AED plasma levels. Since the clinical symptoms were not recognized early, some patients were treated only many years after the onset of symptoms.	Among BMEI patients, our cases constitute a subgroup in which myoclonic jerks were always triggered by photostimulation, in particular at onset of their epilepsy.",Remaining,0,0

Peri- and postmenopausal women participating in a prospective study of HIV-infected and at-risk midlife women (the Ms. Study) were interviewed to determine whether they experienced hot flashes and/or vaginal dryness and to what they attributed these symptoms.	Of 278 women, 70% were perimenopausal; 54% were HIV-infected; and 52% had used crack, cocaine, heroin, and/or methadone within the past 5 years. Hot flashes were reported by 189 women and vaginal dryness was reported by 101 women. Overall, 69.8% attributed hot flashes to menopause and 28.7% attributed vaginal dryness to menopause. In bivariate analyses, age 45 years and older was associated with attributing hot flashes and vaginal dryness to menopause, and postmenopausal status and at least 12 years of education were associated with attributing vaginal dryness to menopause, but HIV status was not associated with attribution to menopause. In multivariate analysis, significant interactions between age and menopause status were found for both attribution of hot flashes (P=0.019) and vaginal dryness (P=0.029).

We examined whether depressed veterans with comorbid anxiety had higher risks of suicide death.	Using VA administrative databases we identified 887,859 patients with depression. We then used univariate and multivariate logistic regression, controlling for demographics and substance use disorders, to determine the odds ratios of completed suicide associated with individual comorbid anxiety disorders, the presence of any comorbid anxiety disorder, the prescription of an antianxiety medication, or the prescription of a high dose of an antianxiety medication.	In multivariate analyses, the odds of completed suicide were significantly increased for patients with panic disorder (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.53), generalized anxiety disorder (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.47), and anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified (OR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12-1.38). The odds of completed suicide were also greater among patients who received any antianxiety medication (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.55-1.88), and were further increased among those who received high dose treatment (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.98-2.57). Odds of completed suicide were decreased among patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.97), and there was no statistically significant relationship between social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and all other anxiety disorders and suicide.	These findings emphasize the importance of comorbid anxiety disorders and symptoms in increasing suicide risk among depressed patients and may inform suicide prevention efforts among these patients.",Remaining,0,0
114,36085340,Pituitary,Historical and future trends in emergency pituitary referrals: a machine learning analysis.,"Acute pituitary referrals to neurosurgical services frequently necessitate emergency care. Yet, a detailed characterisation of pituitary emergency referral patterns, including how they may change prospectively is lacking. This study aims to evaluate historical and current pituitary referral patterns and utilise state-of-the-art machine learning tools to predict future service use.	A data-driven analysis was performed using all available electronic neurosurgical referrals (2014-2021) to the busiest U.K. pituitary centre. Pituitary referrals were characterised and volumes were predicted using an auto-regressive moving average model with a preceding seasonal and trend decomposition using Loess step (STL-ARIMA), compared against a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm, Prophet and two standard baseline forecasting models. Median absolute, and median percentage error scoring metrics with cross-validation were employed to evaluate algorithm performance.	462 of 36,224 emergency referrals were included (referring centres = 48; mean patient age = 56.7 years, female:male = 0.49:0.51). Emergency medicine and endocrinology accounted for the majority of referrals (67%). The most common presentations were headache (47%) and visual field deficits (32%). Lesions mainly comprised tumours or haemorrhage (85%) and involved the pituitary gland or fossa (70%). The STL-ARIMA pipeline outperformed CNN-LSTM, Prophet and baseline algorithms across scoring metrics, with standard accuracy being achieved for yearly predictions. Referral volumes significantly increased from the start of data collection with future projected increases (p < 0.001) and did not significantly reduce during the COVID-19 pandemic.	This work is the first to employ large-scale data and machine learning to describe and predict acute pituitary referral volumes, estimate future service demands, explore the impact of system stressors (e.g. COVID pandemic), and highlight areas for service improvement.",Remaining,0,0
115,8510058,Journal of psychosomatic research,Sleep disturbance in chronic fatigue syndrome.,"Sleep and fatigue characteristics were evaluated in 72 patients who met major criteria for the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), 57 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients preselected for fatigue complaints, and 40 healthy controls. Using previously validated rating scales, CFS patients had significant elevations in fatigue and sleep disturbance compared to the MS and healthy control groups. To confirm these subjective measures, polysomnography was carried out in a subgroup of CFS patients who included sleep disturbance as one of their symptoms on initial clinical interview. In 10 of 16 (62.5%) polysomnography revealed clinically significant and potentially treatable sleep abnormalities. Their sleep disorders included periodic movement disorder (4), excessive daytime sleepiness (3), apnea (2), and narcolepsy (1). We conclude that subjective sleep disturbance is common in CFS and some CFS patients may have objective sleep disorders.",Remaining,0,0
116,19308881,Pharmacopsychiatry,Drug prescription patterns in schizophrenia outpatients: analysis of data from a German health insurance fund.,"The aim of this study was to investigate routine administrative data from a major German health insurance fund, Techniker Krankenkasse, which covers 5.4 million insured individuals. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study analysed data collected from patients with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia in 2003 (index hospitalisation) in order to evaluate prescription patterns of antipsychotic drugs.	Patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia, at least one year prior membership with the insurance fund and a follow-up period of one year were identified. Results were standardised by age and stratified by the severity of their illness, defined by the number of hospital bed days during the three years preceding the index hospitalisation.	A total of 3,121 patients with schizophrenia (male 56.4%, female 43.6%) received 56 692 single prescriptions of antipsychotics. Of these, 35.4% of the prescriptions were for typical and 64.6% for atypical antipsychotics; 55% were for high-potency, 45% for low-potency typical antipsychotics. The most frequently prescribed drugs were olanzapine (26.6%), clozapine (21.3%) and risperidone (19%). There were no relevant gender differences concerning prescription patterns. During a 12-month follow-up period after the first hospitalisation, 1 372 patients (43.9%) were treated exclusively with an atypical antipsychotic, another 499 patients (16%) had a combination of an atypical plus a low-potency typical antipsychotic. Thus, basal therapy with an atypical was observed in 59.9% of our study population. Only 327 patients (10.5%) were treated exclusively with a typical antipsychotic. A total of 645 patients (20.7%) were treated with a combination of atypical plus typical antipsychotic. Changes of medication within one substance group occurred more often with typical antipsychotics (50%) as compared to atypical antipsychotics (25%).	At 60%, the proportion of patients in this study treated with atypical antipsychotics was surprisingly high. Of significant interest is the frequent prescription of clozapine (14%). The results are discussed in comparison to comparable studies from other countries.",Remaining,0,0

A cross sectional, qualitative study.	Community.	Fourteen spinal cord injury survivors.	Subjects participated in a semi-structured interview about 'when', 'where' 'by whom' and 'how' they received and 'would' prefer to receive bad news.	Answers to 'how' questions were coded according to SPIKES protocol (Setting, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Empathizing, Summary).	Eight participants (57%) reported that they received bad news from a physician, mostly during rehabilitation. All would prefer to be informed by a physician and majority preferred to be gradually informed during rehabilitation. Half were not satisfied with the content of information. Only half felt that his/her physiatrist understood his/her emotional distress. Majority of participants who received bad news from physicians reported that the setting was private and their family members accompanied them.	Most spinal cord injury survivors were unsatisfied with knowledge and emotional support provided by rehabilitation physicians. Participants would prefer to receive bad news by a senior physiatrist in a planned meeting during rehabilitation.",Remaining,0,0
118,26106544,NeuroImage. Clinical,Brain activation during self- and other-reflection in bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis: Comparison to schizophrenia.,"Reflecting on the self and on others activates specific brain areas and contributes to metacognition and social cognition. The aim of the current study is to investigate brain activation during self- and other-reflection in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In addition, we examined whether potential abnormal brain activation in BD patients could distinguish BD from patients with schizophrenia (SZ).	During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 17 BD patients, 17 SZ patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs) performed a self-reflection task. The task consisted of sentences divided into three conditions: self-reflection, other-reflection and semantic control.	BD patients showed less activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) extending to the precuneus during other-reflection compared to HCs (p = 0.028 FWE corrected on cluster-level within the regions of interest). In SZ patients, the level of activation in this area was in between BD patients and HCs, with no significant differences between patients with SZ and BD. There were no group differences in brain activation during self-reflection. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the PCC/precuneus activation during other-reflection and cognitive insight in SZ patients, but not in BD patients.	BD patients showed less activation in the PCC/precuneus during other-reflection. This may support an account of impaired integration of emotion and memory (evaluation of past and current other-related information) in BD patients. Correlation differences of the PCC/precuneus activation with the cognitive insight in patients with BD and SZ might reflect an important difference between these disorders, which may help to further explore potentially distinguishing markers.",Remaining,0,0
119,28131932,Addictive behaviors,Common and differential brain abnormalities in gambling disorder subtypes based on risk attitude.,"Studying brain abnormalities in behavioral addiction including GD enables us to exclude possible confounding effects of exposure to neurotoxic substances, which should provide important insight that can lead to a better understanding of addiction per se. There have been a few brain structural magnetic resonance imaging studies for GD, although the results have been inconsistent. On the other hand, GD was suggested to be a heterogeneous disorder in terms of risk attitude. We aimed to examine the heterogeneity of GD by combining a behavioral economics task and voxel-based morphometry. Thirty-six male GD patients and 36 healthy male control subjects underwent a task for estimation of loss aversion, which can assess risk attitude in real-life decision-making. The GD patients were divided into two groups based on their level of loss aversion, low and high. While both groups showed common gray matter volume reduction in the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral posterior cerebellum, high loss-aversion GD showed pronounced reduction in the left posterior cerebellum and additional reduction in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex. Our study suggests that the heterogeneity of GD is underpinned at the brain structural level. This result might be useful for understanding neurobiological mechanisms and for the establishment of precise treatment strategies for GD.",Remaining,0,0
120,21954106,Human brain mapping,Functional connectivity changes in multiple sclerosis patients: a graph analytical study of MEG resting state data.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by extensive damage in the central nervous system. Within this field, there is a strong need for more advanced, functional imaging measures, as abnormalities measured with structural imaging insufficiently explain clinicocognitive decline in MS. In this study we investigated functional connectivity changes in MS using resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Data from 34 MS patients and 28 age and gender-matched controls was assessed using synchronization likelihood (SL) as a measure of functional interaction strength between brain regions, and graph analysis to characterize topological patterns of connectivity changes. Cognition was assessed using extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Structural measures included brain and lesion volumes, using MRI. Results show SL increases in MS patients in theta, lower alpha and beta bands, with decreases in the upper alpha band. Graph analysis revealed a more regular topology in the lower alpha band in patients, indicated by an increased path length (λ) and clustering coefficient (γ). Attention and working memory domains were impaired, with decreased brain volumes. A stepwise linear regression model using clinical, MRI and MEG parameters as predictors revealed that only increases in lower alpha band γ predicted impaired cognition. Cognitive impairments and related altered connectivity patterns were found to be especially predominant in male patients. These results show specific functional changes in MS as measured with MEG. Only changes in network topology were related to poorer cognitive outcome. This indicates the value of graph analysis beyond traditional structural and functional measures, with possible implications for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes in MS.",Remaining,0,0
121,30732635,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,Disease progression in women with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is slow.,"Over 80% of women with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) develop spinal cord disease in adulthood for which treatment is supportive only. For future clinical trials quantitative data on disease progression rates are essential. Moreover, diagnosis can be challenging in ALD women, as the most important diagnostic biomarker is normal in 15-20%. Better biomarkers are needed. The purpose of this single centre cross-sectional follow-up study in women with ALD was to assess whether Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), AMC Linear Disability Scale (ALDS) and Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) can detect disease progression and to model the effect of age and duration of symptoms on the rate of progression. Moreover, we performed a pilot study to assess if a semi-targeted lipidomics approach can identify possible new diagnostic biomarkers.	In this study 46 women (baseline clinical data published by our group previously) were invited for a follow-up visit. Newly identified women at our center were also recruited. We analysed 65 baseline and 34 follow-up assessments. Median time between baseline and follow-up was 7.8 years (range 6.4-8.7). Mean age at baseline was 49.2 ± 14.2 years, at follow-up 55.4 ± 10.1. EDSS increased significantly (+ 0.08 points/year), but the other outcome measures did not. Increasing age and duration of symptoms were associated with more disability. For the pilot study we analysed plasma of 20 ALD women and 10 controls with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, which identified 100 potential biomarker ratios with strong differentiating properties and non-overlapping data distributions between ALD women and controls.	Progression of spinal cord disease can be detected with EDSS, but not with ALDS or SF-36 after a follow-up period of almost 8 years. Moreover, age and the duration of symptoms seem positively associated with the rate of progression. Although a significant progression was measurable, it was below the rate generally conceived as clinically relevant. Therefore, EDSS, ALDS and SF-36 are not suitable as primary outcome measures in clinical trials for spinal cord disease in ALD women. In addition, a semi-targeted lipidomics approach can identify possible new diagnostic biomarkers for women with ALD.",Remaining,0,0

A pilot study.,"The Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) estimates the cognitive aptitudes and other skills of severely impaired dementia patients. The main objective of this pilot study was to clearly identify the number of factors present in the SIB and to analyze the relationships between the different cognitive domains explored by the SIB and loss of autonomy. We administered the SIB, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and two scales of dependency to 48 patients with Alzheimer's disease in its late stages. A factorial analysis (Principal Components Analysis) showed a 4-factor solution for the SIB: a cognitive factor, a praxis and visuospatial functions factor, the reactivity to external stimuli factor and the social aptitudes factor. A factorial analysis involving the dependency scales showed a cognitive factor, a dependency and constructional praxis factor, the reactivity to external stimuli factor and the social aptitudes factor. Reactivity to external stimuli and social aptitudes were not significantly correlated to cognitive aspects nor to dependency. The finding of dependency as a factor different from cognitive deterioration suggests that, in setting a treatment strategy for demented patients, attempts should be made to treat dependency in its own right. In addition, since reactivity to external stimuli and social aptitudes are not related to cognitive aspects nor to dependency, these functions should also be encouraged and stimulated.",Remaining,0,0
123,37905374,Cognitive science,Repeat After Me? Both Children With and Without Autism Commonly Align Their Language With That of Their Caregivers.,"Linguistic repetitions in children are conceptualized as negative in children with autism - echolalia, without communicative purpose - and positive in typically developing (TD) children - linguistic alignment involved in shared engagement, common ground and language acquisition. To investigate this apparent contradiction we analyzed spontaneous speech in 67 parent-child dyads from a longitudinal corpus (30 minutes of play activities at 6 visits over 2 years). We included 32 children with autism and 35 linguistically matched TD children (mean age at recruitment 32.76 and 20.27 months). We found a small number of exact repetitions in both groups (roughly 1% of utterances across visits), which increased over time in children with autism and decreased in the TD group. Partial repetitions were much more frequent: children reused caregivers' words at high rates regardless of diagnostic group (24% of utterances at first visit), and this increased in frequency (but not level) over time, faster for TD children (at final visit: 33% for autism, 40% for TD). The same happened for partial repetition of syntax and semantic alignment. However, chance alignment (as measured by surrogate pairs) also increased and findings for developmental changes were reliable only for syntactic and semantic alignment. Children with richer linguistic abilities also displayed a higher tendency to partially re-use their caregivers' language (alignment rates and semantic alignment). This highlights that all children commonly re-used the words, syntax, and topics of their caregivers, albeit with some quantitative differences, and that most repetition was at least potentially productive, with repeated language being re-contextualized and integrated with non-repeated language. The salience of echolalia in ASD might be partially explained by slight differences in frequency, amplified by lower semantic alignment, persistence over time, and expectations of echolalia. More in-depth qualitative and quantitative analyses of how repetitions are used and received in context are needed.",Remaining,0,0

A cross-sectional study.	All of the Japanese centenarians in the Okinawa Prefecture (266 men and 1,378 women).	Okinawa Prefectural Government conducted health surveys among all of the centenarians in Okinawa. The variables used for analysis were sex, history of stroke, age at the first diagnosis of stroke, history of hypertension, cigarette smoking and alcohol intake.

Hypertension was independently associated with an increased lifetime prevalence of stroke (adjusted odds ratio = 2.97 and 95% confidence interval: 2.16-4.08). There was no material relationship between sex, cigarette smoking, oralcohol intake and the prevalence of stroke. When the lifetime prevalence of stroke was divided according to whether stroke had been diagnosed for the first time at the age of 90 years or less or over the age of 90, a significant positive association between hypertension and stroke was more pronounced in centenarians with a diagnosis of stroke at the age of 90 years or less than in those over the age of 90.

In the present study the activity of plasmatic histaminase was analysed, with histamine and with cadaverine as substrates, in a group of 23 schizophrenic patients and compared with that of healthy controls (n = 32). Plasma histaminase activity was determined using Gordon and Peters spectrophotometric method, and the results were expressed in mumoles of H2O2 transformed/hour/litre of plasma at 25 degrees C. Plasmatic histaminase, using histamine as substrate, was significantly increased in schizophrenic patients as a whole compared with the healthy controls. On the other hand, when cadaverine was used as substrate plasma histaminase was significantly reduced in female schizophrenics but not in males. When patients were divided according to 17 clinical characteristics it was found that the following subgroups were significantly associated to high levels of plasma histaminase (using histamine as substrate): the non mentally deteriorated schizophrenic patients compared with mentally deteriorated schizophrenic patients and those with thymic symptoms as opposed to those without thymic symptoms.

Therefore, we examined the association of different APOE alleles with common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), carotid plaques, incident myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. We analyzed data from 3327 participants aged 20-79 years of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) from Northeast Germany with a median follow-up time of 14.5 years. Linear, logistic, and Cox-regression models were used to assess the associations of the APOE polymorphism with CCA-IMT, carotid plaques, incident MI and stroke, respectively. In our study, the APOE E2 allele was associated with lower CCA-IMT at baseline compared to E3 homozygotes (β: - 0.02 [95% CI - 0.04, - 0.004]). Over the follow-up, 244 MI events and 218 stroke events were observed. APOE E2 and E4 allele were not associated with incident MI (E2 HR: 1.06 [95% CI 0.68, 1.66]; E4 HR: 1.03 [95% CI 0.73, 1.45]) and incident stroke (E2 HR: 0.79 [95% CI 0.48, 1.30]; E4 HR: 0.96 [95% CI 0.66, 1.38]) in any of the models adjusting for potential confounders. However, the positive association between CCA-IMT and incident MI was more pronounced in E2 carriers than E3 homozygotes. Thus, our study suggests that while APOE E2 allele may predispose individuals to lower CCA-IMT, E2 carriers may be more prone to MI than E3 homozygotes as the CCA-IMT increases. APOE E4 allele had no effect on CCA-IMT, plaques, MI or stroke.",Remaining,0,0

Health outcomes examined were serious injury and psychosomatic symptoms. Models developed from cross-sectional data were confirmed longitudinally.	Adolescents who reported negative home and school environments reported higher levels of substance use, psychosomatic symptoms and serious injuries (the latter identified in longitudinal analysis only). Engagement in health risk behaviour partially mediated the link between these two environments and the sentinel health outcomes. Positive school environments were protective in that they moderated associations between negative home environments and engagement in health risk behaviours. The effects observed in longitudinal analyses were generally consistent with those observed cross-sectionally.	Negative home environments clearly place adolescents at risk for engagement in health risk behaviours and associated physical health outcomes. Positive school environments can in part moderate these relationships. Optimisation of school social environments therefore remains warranted as a population health strategy.",Remaining,0,0
137,30700595,Neurology,Histopathology of diffusion imaging abnormalities in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.,"We sought to determine the underlying mechanism for altered white matter diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures at the histopathologic level in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).	Formalin-fixed intact hemispheres from 9 CAA cases and 2 elderly controls were scanned at 3-tesla MRI, including a diffusion-weighted sequence. DTI measures (i.e., fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) and histopathology measures were obtained from 2 tracts: the anterior thalamic radiation and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.	FA was reduced in both tracts and MD was increased in cases with CAA compared to controls. Regional FA was significantly correlated with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, axonal density, and white matter microinfarcts. MD correlated significantly with tissue rarefaction, myelin density, and white matter microinfarcts, but not axonal density. FA and MD did not correlate with oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or gliosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that tissue rarefaction (β = -0.32 ± 0.12, p = 0.009) and axonal density (β = 0.25 ± 0.12, p = 0.04) were both independently associated with FA, whereas myelin density was independently associated with MD (β = -0.32 ± 0.12, p = 0.013). Finally, we found an association between increased MD in the frontal white matter and CAA severity in the frontal cortex (p = 0.035).	These results suggest that overall tissue loss, and in particular axonal and myelin loss, are major components underlying CAA-related alterations in DTI properties observed in living patients. The findings allow for a more mechanistic interpretation of DTI parameters in small vessel disease and for mechanism-based selection of candidate treatments to prevent vascular cognitive impairment.",Remaining,0,0
138,34131185,Scientific reports,Association of age-related cognitive and obstacle avoidance performances.,"An association between cognitive impairment and tripping over obstacles during locomotion in older adults has been suggested. However, owing to its memory-guided movement, whether this is more pronounced in the trailing limb is poorly known. We examined age-related changes in stepping over, focusing on trailing limb movements, and their association with cognitive performance. Age-related changes in obstacle avoidance were examined by comparing the foot kinematics of 105 older and 103 younger adults when stepping over an obstacle. The difference in the clearance between the leading and trailing limbs (Δ clearance) was calculated to determine the degree of decrement in the clearance of the trailing limb. A cognitive test battery was used to evaluate cognitive function among older adults to assess their association with Δ clearance. Older adults showed a significantly lower clearance of the trailing limb than young adults, resulting in greater Δ clearance. Significant correlations were observed between greater Δ clearance and scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and immediate recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory test. Therefore, memory functions may contribute to the control of trailing limb movements, which can secure a safety margin to avoid stumbling over an obstacle during obstacle avoidance locomotion.",Remaining,0,0

A total of 1,421 measurements in 15 epileptic patients (age: 28 ± 10) using a radiofrequency generator (50 kHz current injection) were analyzed. Each contact pair was classified as being from healthy (gray matter, n = 696; white matter, n = 530) or pathological (epileptogenic zone, n = 195) tissue using neuroimaging analysis of the local tissue environment and intracerebral EEG recordings. Brain tissue conductivities were obtained using numerical simulations based on conductivity estimates that accounted for the current flow in the local brain volume around the contact pairs (a cube with a side length of 13 mm). Conductivity values were 0.26 S/m for gray matter and 0.17 S/m for white matter. Healthy gray and white matter had statistically different median impedances (P < 0.0001). White matter conductivity was found to be homogeneous as normality tests did not find evidence of multiple subgroups. Gray matter had lower conductivity in healthy tissue than in the epileptogenic zone (0.26 vs. 0.29 S/m; P = 0.012), even when the epileptogenic zone was not visible in the magnetic resonance image (MRI) (P = 0.005). The present in-vivo conductivity values could serve to create more accurate volume conduction models and could help to refine the identification of relevant intracerebral contacts, especially when located within the epileptogenic zone of an MRI-invisible lesion.

Utilization data from three Dane County, Wisconsin hospitals and four primary care clinics from 2003 to 2011.	We used a retrospective, quasi-experimental, controlled, pre-post study design. Starting in 2007, two clinics began integrating behavioral health into their primary care practices with a third starting in 2010. A fourth, nonimplementing, community clinic served as control. Change in emergency department and primary care utilization (number of visits) for patients diagnosed with mood and anxiety disorders was the outcomes of interest.	Retrospective data were obtained from electronic patient records from the three main area hospitals along with primary care data from participating clinics.	Following the introduction of the PCBH model, one clinic experienced a statistically significant (p < .01, 95 percent CI 6.3-16.3 percent), 11.3 percent decrease in the ratio of ED visits to primary care encounters, relative to a control site, but two other intervention clinics did not.

143,12570354,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,Prodromal frontal/executive dysfunction predicts incident dementia in Parkinson's disease.,"To identify the cognitive characteristics predictive of incident dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD), we examined the baseline neuropsychological profiles of 18 initially non-demented patients with PD who met diagnostic criteria for dementia (PDD) at one-year follow-up. PDD participants' baseline neuropsychological test scores were compared to the baseline performance of 18 patients with PD who did not meet criteria for dementia at one-year follow-up (PDND) and 18 normal controls (NC). The three groups were matched on baseline demographic and disease variables. Relative to the PDND group, the incident PDD participants demonstrated significantly poorer performance on digits backward (Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised), word list learning and recognition (California Verbal Learning Test), and perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Each of these baseline neuropsychological variables exhibited adequate diagnostic classification accuracy in predicting PDD and PDND group membership at follow-up. These results suggest that subtle frontal/executive dysfunction is evident during the immediate PDD prodrome and may be of prognostic value in identifying PD patients at risk for dementia. Accordingly, neuropsychological evaluation may facilitate early identification of PDD and thereby inform appropriate dispositional planning.",Remaining,0,0
144,23629739,Family practice,Home blood pressure monitoring in hypertensive stroke patients: a prospective cohort study following a randomized controlled trial.,"We found little data on long-term home blood pressure monitoring in stroke patients.	After completing a 12-month trial of home monitoring in hypertensive stroke patients, we investigated the following: 1. The proportion of 118 control patients offered a monitor at the end of the trial without nurse support who used it at least monthly after 6 months. 2. The proportion of 119 intervention patients continuing to use their monitor monthly after 18 months. 3. Possible predictors of monitoring weekly in the first month after receiving a monitor: age, gender, ethnicity, cognition, anxiety, disability, ability to monitor blood pressure unaided and smoking.	Participants (mean age 71, 34% with disability and 21% from ethnic minorities) were surveyed 1 and/or 6 months after the trial ended by postal and/or telephone questionnaire.	Of 237 potential participants, 53 (22%) declined, 16 (6%) were lost and 9 (4%) died during follow-up. Overall, reported monthly use of the monitor without nurse support was 47% [54/114, 95% confidence interval (CI) 38.2-56.5] at 6 months and 50% (57/114, 95% CI 40.8-59.2) at 18 months. Participants who monitored weekly after 1 month were more likely than the remainder to have no disability [Rankin score ≤ 1; relative risk (RR) 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5] and low anxiety levels (FEAR score = 0; RR 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.0).

145,11337212,Journal of clinical epidemiology,Intra-individual postural blood pressure variability and stroke in elderly nursing home residents.,"Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a potential risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, but OH is highly variable and may not be detected on a single occasion. To assess the relation between intra-individual variability of systolic orthostatic blood pressure change (DeltaSBP) and cardiovascular outcomes, an algorithm was developed to identify DeltaSBP instability using repeated supine and standing BP measurements. A cohort of 673 nursing home residents underwent baseline postural BP measurements (supine to 1 minute of standing, four times in a single day) and were followed for up to 2 years. Two groups (stable vs. unstable) were identified based on an analysis of DeltaSBP variance components. Differences in outcomes were compared via Cox survival analysis. At baseline 12.6% were unstable, defined as a one standard deviation difference of at least 20.2 mmHg between DeltaSBP readings. Unstable subjects were more likely to have OH on at least one measurement (systolic BP drop of 20 mmHg or more; 85% vs. 36%, respectively) and to be on psychotropic medication at baseline (47% vs 35%) (P-values <0.001). Other characteristics (including previous stroke) did not differ. During a mean follow-up of 10.3 months, stroke incidence was higher in unstable subjects (13.1% vs. 4.9%; P = 0.012), but ischemic heart disease and mortality rates were not significantly different (respectively, 13.5% vs. 7.4%, P = 0.115; 14.8% vs. 10.7%, P = 0.178). Survival analyses (adjusted for age, sex, psychotropic medications, body mass index, ischemic heart disease, and supine systolic pressure) confirmed a higher risk of stroke in unstable subjects (relative risk = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.6-8.4). Highly variable orthostatic BP measures may reflect impaired BP regulatory mechanisms in elders with occult cerebrovascular disease, or may directly affect cerebral blood flow. Orthostatic BP variability may be a better indicator of future stroke than a single supine or orthostatic change measure.",Remaining,0,0

This study attempted to screen mutations and to investigate the mutation distribution and related phenotypes including epilepsy of Chinese TSC patients.	We performed the genotypic analysis of TSC1 and TSC2 genes in 77 unrelated Chinese TSC patients using direct Sanger sequencing and Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).	Mutations were identified in a total of 63 (81.8%) cases, including 18 TSC1 mutations (8 nonsense mutations, 6 frameshift, 1 in-frame shift, 1 missense and 2 splice-site) and 45 TSC2 mutations (13 missense, 3 nonsense, 6 splicing, 6 in-frame shift,12 frameshift mutations and 5 large deletions). Large deletions were presented exclusively in TSC2 gene, accounting for 7.9% of all mutations in this study. Fourteen novel mutations were identified in this study.	Epilepsy occurs in approximately 75.3% (58/77) of patients. Hypomelanotic macules occurred significantly more often in patients with TSC2 mutations and cases with TSC1/TSC2 mutations had a significantly higher frequency of cortical nodule than patients with no mutations identified. Overall, our data expands the spectrum of mutations associated with the TSC loci and will be of value to the genetic counseling in patients with the disease.",Remaining,0,0
147,16955437,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,Abnormal neurotransmitter metabolite levels in Alzheimer patients with a delirium.,"Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome with an acute onset and fluctuating course. Several studies have suggested the presence of disturbed cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways in delirium as well as in Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal concentrations of amino acids and of neurotransmitter metabolites have been found in plasma, platelets and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, and in plasma and CSF of patients with a delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolite levels in plasma of AD patients with a concurrent delirium.	In a case-control study of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) with concurrent delirium, we investigated the contribution of delirium to some biochemical parameters in blood. We compared plasma amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolite levels of 17 delirious AD patients with those of 17 age- and gender-matched non-delirious AD patients and 29 age- and gender-matched controls.	Homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were higher in delirious AD patients than in controls, but only HVA concentrations were higher in delirious AD patients than in non-delirious AD patients.	Our findings suggest that central dopaminergic and serotonergic turnover are increased in AD patients with delirium and that the high dopaminergic turnover might reflect the consequences of delirium.",Remaining,0,0

A new enzyme immunoassay test (Pharmacia Meningitis EIA-Test) was evaluated as a potential rapid diagnostic method for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae (HI) type b, Neisseria meningitidis (MC) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNC). The test was found to have good sensitivity (0.86) and specificity (0.95) in the inter-epidemic period; and to be adaptable to the field work in The Sudan during the 1988 MC epidemic. During inter-epidemic (endemic) situations in The Sudan, greater than 90% of childhood ABM was caused by one of the three organisms, HI type b, MC and PNC. HI accounted for 57% of the cases. The peak incidence (76%) of HI cases was in infants (less than 12 months) similar to the situation in other African countries. The overall case fatality ratio was 18.6%. Prospective follow-up of survivors for 3-4 years revealed that an additional 43% either died or had permanent neurological complications, the most prevalent and persistent of which was sensorineural hearing loss recorded in 22% of long term survivors. Post-meningitic children were found to have significantly lower intelligence quotients (92.3 +/- 13.9) than their sibling controls (100.7 +/- 10.2, P = 0.029). Features of the large serogroup A sulphonamide resistant MC epidemic (February-August 1988) in Khartoum are described. An estimated annual incidence of 1,679/100,000 was recorded at the peak of the epidemic. The highest attack rate was in young children less than 5 years, as in many other African countries; nevertheless, a high morbidity was observed in adults (31% of the cases greater than or equal to 20 years). The clinical features, mortality (6.3%) and short term sequelae in Sudanese children were generally within the framework described for MC disease elsewhere. Detailed analysis of MC isolates from Sudan and Sweden by characterizing their electrophoretic enzyme types, DNA restriction endonuclease pattern and outer membrane proteins, revealed that serogroup A MC clone III-1 was responsible of The Sudan epidemic in 1988 and has been the dominant serogroup A organism in Sweden since 1973.

Does this suggest some potential correlation between the two diseases? Low bone mass and change of bone biomarker are associated with a higher risk of carotid and cardiac calcification plaques.	Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism marker may contribute to the progression of carotid and cardiac arterial calcifications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether low bone mass and the change of bone biomarker are associated with the prevalence of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in elderly Chinese.	We conducted a five-year prospective study. BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning. Carotid and cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) was conducted using a 64-multidetector row scanner to assess carotid and cardiac arterial plaque at baseline and during follow-up.	Of 1571 community residents over 60 years of age, 184 (11.7%) subjects developed carotid calcified plaque, 510 (32.5%) subjects developed cardiac calcified plaque and 97 (6.2%) subjects developed co-existence calcified plaques in carotid and cardiac arteries. After adjustment for age and all relevant confounders, Q1, Q2 quartile of BMD, and osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin (OC), and C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) were associated with increased risk of calcified plaques.

151,19219502,Lung,Chronic sleep complaints in premenopausal women and their association with sleep-disordered breathing.,"In clinical practice, we have found that premenopausal women have delayed diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).	During a 4-year period, we systematically collected the clinical and polysomnographic variables for all women referred for sleep complaints using preestablished questionnaires, scales, clinical grid, polygraphic montage, and scoring criteria. The variables collected on premenopausal SDB women were analyzed and compared to those of postmenopausal women within 5 years of menopause.	Of 977 women, 316 were premenopausal with SDB. Complaints of chronic insomnia and sleepwalking were the most common reasons for referral, had been present for a mean of 6.4 +/- 5.4 years, and had lead to unsuccessful symptomatic treatment. The normal-weight premenopausal SDB group had anatomically small upper airways, while those with body mass index (BMI) >/= 25 kg/m(2) complained more frequently of snoring and daytime sleepiness and their clinical presentation was closer to those of the postmenopausal SDB comparison group. Premenopausal women often had a low apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), but there was a discrepancy between the low AHI and the amount of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) needed to control the SDB, and there was a need for higher pressures in overweight premenopausal SDB women (mean 9.1 +/- 1.9 and 10.1 +/- 2.6 cmH(2)O).	Normal-weight premenopausal SDB women often present with atypical sleep complaints of chronic insomnia and parasomnias. Clinical attention paid to craniofacial features and use of specific scales such as Mallampati help with the suspicion of the presence of SDB, and a low AHI is unrelated to the positive clinical impact of nasal CPAP treatment.",Remaining,0,0
152,15907750,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Differentiating anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with partial epilepsy.,"Anxiety and depression are separate psychiatric conditions that are often interrelated. This study examines whether they exist independently in this population of patients with partial epilepsy and if they affect all quality-of-life domains. Adult epilepsy patients taking two or more antiepileptic drugs completed a health status survey including demographic items, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-10 (QOLIE-10). The questionnaire was completed by 201 epilepsy patients. Symptom prevalences of anxiety (52% none, 25% mild, 16% moderate, 7% severe) and depression (62% none, 20% mild, 14% moderate, 4% severe) were high. All health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) domains worsened significantly with increasing levels of anxiety and depression: Total QOLIE-10 scores decreased from 72+/-18 in patients with no anxiety to 54+/-13 in those with mild, 48+/-18 in those with moderate, and 40+/-23 in those with severe anxiety (P<0.0001). Total QOLIE-10 scores decreased from 70+/-16 in patients with no depression to 50+/-16 in those with mild, 45+/-16 in those with moderate, and 24+/-21 in those with severe depression (P<0.0001). No significant difference in anxiety scores was observed controlling for seizure frequency or epilepsy duration. Regression analyses showed that anxiety and depression account for different proportions of variance as predictors of HRQOL (R2=0.337 (anxiety) and 0.511 (depression)). The data suggest that patients may benefit from increased attention to the role of anxiety separately from depression.",Remaining,0,0
153,10652033,Kidney international,Genetic polymorphism of the renin-angiotensin system and organ damage in essential hypertension.,"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a significant role in the development of hypertensive cardiac and vascular remodeling. Recently, several genetic variants of its key components, which may be clinically relevant and thus prove to be useful in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, have been described. We therefore investigated the association between ACE I/D, AGT M235T, and AT1 A1266C gene polymorphisms and early signs of target organ damage in 215 untreated patients with essential hypertension (EH).	Genotyping was based on the polymerase chain reaction technique, with further restriction analysis when required. Albuminuria was measured as the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed by echocardiography (LVH = LVMI > or = 125 g/m2), carotid wall thickness (IMT) by an ultrasonographic (US) scan, and retinal vascular changes by direct ophthalmoscopy (Keith-Wagener classification).	The prevalence of microalbuminuria (Mi), LVH, and retinal vascular changes was 14, 46, and 74%, respectively. ACE, AGT, and AT1 genotype distribution was in agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no difference in age, duration of disease, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipid profile when data were analyzed on the basis of genotype. Serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were related to the ACE genotype (10.2 +/- 0.5, DD; 8.2 +/- 0.3, ID; 6.5 +/- 0.4 IU/mL, II; P < 0. 0001 by analysis of variance). The ACE genotype independently influences serum ACE levels and accounts for approximately 14% of its variations (F = 26.7, r2 = 0.1393, df 1 to 214, P < 0.0001). Patients with DD and ID genotypes showed higher levels of ACR (1.59 +/- 0.2, DD + ID; 0.8 +/- 0.2 mg/mmol, II; P < 0.006 by ANOVA) and bigger LVMI (124.1 +/- 2.3, DD + ID vs. 117.8 +/- 3.6 g/m2, II; P < 0.01 by ANOVA). No differences in the prevalence and degree of target organ damage (TOD) were found when data were analyzed on the basis of the AGT and AT1 genotypes, respectively. Potentially unfavorable combinations of genotypes were also investigated by K-means cluster analysis. Two subgroups of patients were identified (cluster 1, N = 70; cluster 2, N = 57), and each differed significantly with regards to the presence and degree of TOD and patterns of RAAS gene polymorphisms (F, 15.97 for ACR; F, 7.19 for IMT; F, 217.03 for LVMI; F, 3.91 for ACE; F, 4.06 for AGT; and F, 5. 22 for AT1; df 1 to 214, P < 0.02, for each one of the variables examined).	The D allele of the ACE gene may be an independent risk factor for the development of target organ damage, and evaluating it could be useful for assessing cardiovascular risk in EH. Unfavorable patterns of RAAS genotypes seem to predispose patients to subclinical cardiovascular disease in EH.",Remaining,0,0

Secondly, to investigate whether the HRQoL of spouses was correlated with the assessment of their partner's depression, their own depression and the self-perceived level of care burden experienced by the caregiver partner.	Assessment of patients was based on the clinical diagnosis of a major depressive disorder as established by the criteria of the DSM-IV-TR, the geriatric depression scale GDS-15 and the LEIPAD questionnaire specific to subjects aged 65 or over living at home. Spouses were assessed by GDS-15, the Zarit scale for assessing caregiver burden and the LEIPAD questionnaire. The HRQoL of controls, who were matched for age, sex and educational level, was assessed by LEIPAD.	The study sample (n=38) was made up of 19 patients (mean age of 76.6 years, standard deviation 8.1) and their spouses (mean age of 75.3 years, standard deviation 8.2). The HRQoL score of the spouses was significantly poorer for the scale 'Sexual functioning' (P=0.0007) than that of controls and was negatively affected by their partner's depression (P=0.02). The HRQoL scores of the spouses for 'Physical function', 'Depression and anxiety' and 'Sexual functioning' were negatively affected by their own depression (correlation coefficients r=0.50, 0.53 and 0.54, respectively). The HRQoL scores for 'Self-care', 'Sexual functioning' and 'Life satisfaction' were also negatively affected in spouses by the self-perceived burden of care (correlation coefficients r=0.59, 0.57 and 0.51, respectively).	The sexual quality of life of spouses of elderly patients suffering from a major depressive disorder was significantly impaired. The patients' and spouses' depression and the caregivers' burden also had a negative impact on several aspects of the HRQoL of the spouses. It seems to be important, therefore, to assess the mental state, care burden and HRQoL of spouses caring for elderly patients suffering from depression so as to offer help when required to partners in difficulty.",Remaining,0,0

Major depression is a frequent diagnosis in every gerontopsychiatric clinic that sees patients with both cognitive and affective disorders. Many depressed patients, in fact, are clinically characterized by cognitive impairments. Thus, an assay that excludes - or confirms - probable AD in cognitively impaired patients is desirable. Such assays may use protein markers that are derived from such histopathologically relevant molecules as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its derivatives including the amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta). To evaluate the differential diagnostic properties of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta and secreted soluble ectodomain (APPs), we quantitated CSF levels of these measures in AD patients and compared them to age-matched control patients with major depression. CSF levels of APPs and Abeta were similar in patients with AD or major depression, and the apolipoprotein E genotype had no influence on CSF levels of Abeta in AD patients. Measurement of Abeta peptide using a novel zinc/copper capture ELISA that detects aggregated Abeta peptides as well demonstrated similar levels in AD and major depression. In AD patients, CSF levels of total Abeta (Abeta1-40 plus Abeta1-42) were inversely correlated with a functional measure of dementia severity (NOSGER), suggesting that CSF levels of Abeta decrease with advancing severity of AD. Thus, CSF levels of Abeta are not useful for the differentiation of AD from major depression. However, CSF levels of Abeta reflect the severity of dementia and may be useful as biological markers of the stage of the disease.",Remaining,0,0
158,35322402,Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,Influence of mental health professionals' attitudes and personality traits on decision-making around coercion: Results from an experimental quantitative survey using case vignettes.,"Research on coercion in mental healthcare has recently shifted to the investigation of subjective aspects, both on the side of the people with mental disorders affected and the staff members involved. In this context, the role of personality traits and attitudes of staff members in decision-making around coercion is increasingly being assessed. This study aimed to examine the role of staff attitudes towards coercion and staff members' personality traits in decision-making around coercion in an experimental setting.	We assessed the attitudes towards coercion and (general) personality traits of mental health professionals in psychiatric hospitals with a quantitative survey. Furthermore, we developed case vignettes representing cases in a 'grey zone' and included them in the survey to assess staff members' decisions about coercion in specific situations.	A general approving attitude towards coercion significantly influenced decisions around coercion in individual cases-resulting in a more likely approval of applying coercion in the cases described in the vignettes. Personality traits did not seem to be relevant in this regard.	Strategies to reduce coercion in mental healthcare institutions should focus more on the role of staff attitudes and encourage staff members to reflect on them critically.",Remaining,0,0
159,21410485,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",The Hispanic Americans Baseline Alcohol Survey (HABLAS): is the 'prevention paradox' applicable to alcohol problems across Hispanic national groups?,"The 'prevention paradox,' a notion that most alcohol-related problems are generated by nonheavy drinkers, has significant relevance to public health policy and prevention efforts. The extent of the paradox has driven debate over the type of balance that should be struck between alcohol policies targeting a select group of high-risk drinkers versus more global approaches that target the population at-large. This paper examines the notion that most alcohol problems among 4 Hispanic national groups in the United States are attributable to moderate drinkers.	A general population survey employing a multistage cluster sample design, with face-to-face interviews in respondents' homes was conducted in 5 metropolitan areas of the United States. Study participants included a total of 2,773 current drinkers 18 years and older. Alcohol consumed in the past year (bottom 90% vs. top 10%), binge drinking (binge vs. no binge), and a 4-way grouping defined by volume and binge criteria were used. Alcohol-related harms included 14 social and dependence problems.	Drinkers at the bottom 90% of the distribution are responsible for 56 to 73% of all social problems, and for 55 to 73% of all dependence-related problems reported, depending on Hispanic national group. Binge drinkers are responsible for the majority of the social problems (53 to 75%) and dependence-related problems (59 to 73%), also depending on Hispanic national group. Binge drinkers at the bottom 90% of the distribution are responsible for a larger proportion of all social and dependence-related problems reported than those at the top 10% of the volume distribution. Cuban Americans are an exception.	The prevention paradox holds when using volume-based risk groupings and disappears when using a binge-drinking risk grouping. Binge drinkers who drink moderately on an average account for more harms than those who drink heavily across all groups, with exception of Cuban Americans.",Remaining,0,0

This study determines the utility of outcome measures obtained from an instrumented wrist rig for future rehabilitation trials. The tests undertaken were evaluated in terms of sensitivity to detect differences between normal and impaired participants, test-retest repeatability (repeatability coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]), and interrater agreement (Bland and Altman limits of agreement).	Twelve participants with chronic poststroke hemiparesis (mean 5.6 years); and 12 unimpaired volunteers performed a series of tasks in the rig. The hemiparetic arm (impaired group) and dominant arm (unimpaired group) were tested in 3 sessions on the same day by 2 assessors. Signals were analyzed to derive a tracking index (motor control), stretch index (spasticity), flexor modulation index (FMI) (muscle activation), force angle index (FAI) (stiffness), range of movement, and isometric force.	The means of all tests differed between impaired and unimpaired participants except for range of movement into flexion, the FAI, and the FMI. Repeatability coefficients for each test are presented as benchmark values for use in future trials in which the wrist rig tests may be used to detect change. Test-retest reliability was excellent in the impaired group (ICC = 0.88-0.98) and poor to excellent in the unimpaired group (ICC = 0.06-0.89). The Bland-Altman ranges showed no bias between assessors, and that the interassessor variability was similar to that between repeats by the same assessor for most tests.",Remaining,0,0

The purpose of this study is to evaluate a comprehensive educational stroke protocol in improving stroke response times.	Two urban communities in Beijing (population ≍50 000), matched in economic status and geography, were enrolled in this study. A comprehensive educational protocol, which included public lectures and distribution of instructive material for the community and its medical staff, was implemented from August 2008 to December 2010. Surveillance of new onset stroke in both communities was carried out during the same period. Pre-hospital delay time and percentage of patients using emergency medical services (EMS) were compared between the two communities.	After comprehensive educational protocol, we found that: (i) pre-hospital delay (time from stroke symptom onset to hospital arrival) decreased from 180 to 79 minutes, (ii) the proportion of patients arriving within three hours of stroke onset increased from 55·8% to 80·4%, (iii) pre-hospital delay of stroke patients with symptoms of paralysis, numbness, and speech impediments was decreased, and (iv) the proportion of stroke patients calling for EMS increased from 50·4% to 60·7%.

163,33497988,Forensic science international,Isotonitazene: Fatal intoxication in three cases involving this unreported novel psychoactive substance in Switzerland.,"The paper describes the first three deaths reported in Europe involved in isotonitazene consumption, a potent benzimidazole derivate opioid consumed in the recreational drug scene. Isotonitazene powder and purity determination was performed on the sample collected in the first death scene by NMR, HRMS, GC-FTIR, ATR-FTIR and GC-MS. Isotonitazene purity was determined by GC-MS analysis and proton NMR, and was defined to be above 95 % and 98 %, respectively. Quantification of isotonitazene in biological samples was performed using a targeted analysis based on SPE extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The isotonitazene median concentration in femoral whole blood was 1.20ng/mL. Isotonitazene concentration in hair was similar or even lower compared to that seen in fentanyl abusers. Isotonitazene distribution in tissues converges in the brain, lungs and heart, respectively. Surprisingly, isotonitazene concentration in liver is the lowest measured for all tissues and fluids analyzed. Based on circumstantial evidence, autopsy findings and the results of the toxicological analysis, the medical examiner concluded that the cause of all three deaths was an acute intoxication with isotonitazene. Since isotonitazene toxic concentration levels are very low, the consumption of this new psychoactive drug is a real hazard for human health.",Remaining,0,0
164,1283445,Neurobiology of aging,Reduced GAP-43 message levels are associated with increased neurofibrillary tangle density in the frontal association cortex (area 9) in Alzheimer's disease.,"We previously suggested the hypothesis that defective neuronal plasticity is a major neurobiological deficit causing the dementia of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used message levels of the growth-associated protein, GAP-43, as a marker of axonal plasticity to examine the hypothesis of defective neuronal plasticity in AD. When all AD cases are combined, the average level of GAP-43 message in area 9 of the AD frontal association cortex was not significantly different from the level in the comparably aged control cortex. Differentiation of AD cases on the basis of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) density revealed that in AD cases with high tangle density average GAP-43 message level was reduced fivefold relative to levels in AD cases with low NFT density. AD cases with low neurofibrillary tangle density had levels of GAP-43 message that were not significantly different from the levels of normal controls. Differentiation of AD cases on the basis of neuritic plaque density did not indicate as strong a relationship to GAP-43 message level. The association between neurofibrillary tangle density and GAP-43 message level suggests the hypothesis that neurofibrillary tangles may reduce GAP-43 expression. Data of others show a relationship between high NFT density and reduced levels of synaptophysin-like immunoreactivity and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism. These data combine to suggest a set of AD cases with high NFT density, reduced axonal plasticity, reduced synaptic density, and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism--all variables that may be directly related to the functioning of the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Remaining,0,0

166,32668441,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Leveraging large genomic datasets to illuminate the pathobiology of autism spectrum disorders.,"Big data approaches in the form of large-scale human genomic studies have led to striking advances in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) genetics. Similar to many other psychiatric syndromes, advances in genotyping technology, allowing for inexpensive genome-wide assays, has confirmed the contribution of polygenic inheritance involving common alleles of small effect, a handful of which have now been definitively identified. However, the past decade of gene discovery in ASD has been most notable for the application, in large family-based cohorts, of high-density microarray studies of submicroscopic chromosomal structure as well as high-throughput DNA sequencing-leading to the identification of an increasingly long list of risk regions and genes disrupted by rare, de novo germline mutations of large effect. This genomic architecture offers particular advantages for the illumination of biological mechanisms but also presents distinctive challenges. While the tremendous locus heterogeneity and functional pleiotropy associated with the more than 100 identified ASD-risk genes and regions is daunting, a growing armamentarium of comprehensive, large, foundational -omics databases, across species and capturing developmental trajectories, are increasingly contributing to a deeper understanding of ASD pathology.",Remaining,0,0

The study group comprised 19 patients with NPH who showed a favorable outcome after ventricular shunting, 15 normal volunteers (NV), and 15 patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD). A 3D-fast asymmetric spin echo MR imaging sequence and the region-growing method were used to extract the CSF space from MR images. Ventricular volume (VV) and intracranial CSF volume (ICV) were measured and the VV/ICV ratio was calculated in each case. In NPH patients, the CSF volume was measured again after shunting.	The mean VV and VV/ICV ratio in the NPH group (91.1 mL and 45.2%, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those in the NV group (26.5 mL and 13.7%) and in the CVD group (44.5 mL and 17.8%). On the other hand, mean ICV values were not significantly different among the three groups. The VV was markedly decreased postoperatively (mean -40.7%), whereas the ICV was unchanged, resulting in a marked reduction in the VV/ICV ratio (mean -39.3%).	These results suggest that patients with NPH have a unique intracranial CSF distribution, with an enlarged VV and a slightly increased ICV, resulting in a high VV/ICV ratio. Shunting led to dramatic improvement in our patients. It is likely that CSF measurement can provide valuable information in the management of patients with NPH.",Remaining,0,0
168,27469020,International journal of methods in psychiatric research,Pathways from maternal depression to young adult offspring depression: an exploratory longitudinal mediation analysis.,"Maternal depression in the peri-natal period is associated with increased risk for young adult depression in offspring. This study explored mediation of these links via trajectories of child conduct and emotional problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) from ages 4-16 years old in data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort (n = 13373). Through gender-specific structural equation models, a composite measure of exposure to early maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), predicted young adult depression at age 18 (Revised Clinical Interview Schedule - distal outcome). Mediational effects were then estimated by testing which parts of joint piecewise latent trajectory models for child/adolescent conduct and emotional problems were associated with both exposure and distal outcome. For girls, only conduct problems in early childhood were consistently indicated to mediate effects of early maternal depression on risk of young adulthood depression. Some evidence for a pathway via changing levels of childhood and adolescent emotional difficulties was also suggested. For boys, by contrast, the differing models gave less consistent findings providing some evidence for a small time-specific indirect effect via early childhood conduct problems. In addition to its practice implications the current methodological application offers considerable potential in exploratory longitudinal developmental mediation studies. © 2016 The Authors International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Remaining,0,0

170,23176747,European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Dysregulated 5-HT(2A) receptor binding in postmortem frontal cortex of schizophrenic subjects.,"Previous postmortem and neuroimaging studies have repeatedly suggested alterations in serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor (5-HT(2A)R) binding associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. These studies were performed with ligands, such as ketanserin, altanserin and LSD, that may bind with high-affinity to different structural or functional conformations of the 5-HT(2A)R. Interpretation of results may also be confounded by chronic antipsychotic treatment and suicidal behavior in the schizophrenia group. We quantified 5-HT(2A)R density by radioligand binding assays in postmortem prefrontal cortex of antipsychotic-free (n=29) and antipsychotic-treated (n=16) schizophrenics, suicide victims with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=13), and individually matched controls. [[3]H]Ketanserin binding, and its displacement by altanserin or the LSD-like agonist DOI, was assayed. Results indicate that the number of [[3]H]ketanserin binding sites to the 5-HT(2A)R was increased in antipsychotic-free (128 ± 11%), but not in antipsychotic-treated (92 ± 12%), schizophrenic subjects. In suicide victims, [[3]H]ketanserin binding did not differ as compared to controls. Aging correlated negatively with [[3]H]ketanserin binding in schizophrenia, suicide victims and controls. The fraction of high-affinity sites of DOI displacing [[3]H]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT(2A)R was increased in antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects. Functional uncoupling of heterotrimeric G proteins led to increased fraction of high-affinity sites of altanserin displacing [[3]H]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT(2A)R in schizophrenic subjects, but not in controls. Together, these results suggest that the active conformation of the 5-HT(2A)R is up-regulated in prefrontal cortex of antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects, and may provide a pharmacological explanation for discordant findings previously obtained.",Remaining,0,0

Older adults were recruited from the waiting rooms of 2 geriatrics outpatient clinics for face-to-face interviews regarding their interest in being screened for MCI. A short description of MCI adapted from The Alzheimer's Association's 'Fact Sheet' was presented before asking about MCI testing. Multivariable ordinal regression was used to account for heavily skewed outcome data showing very high levels of interest in screening for MCI. The strongest, most consistent correlate across all of the intention measures was the desire to know as early as possible if one has Alzheimer disease. Another robust correlate was having had normal memory testing in the past. Older adults appear to have psychologically connected MCI to Alzheimer disease, but how well they understand this connection is not known and requires further study.",Remaining,0,0

Since CARP is induced by pressure overload to the heart, it is proposed to be a genetic marker for cardiac hypertrophy. We recently identified a novel protein, ankyrin repeat protein with PEST and proline-rich region (ARPP), which is homologous to CARP and is preferentially expressed in type 1 skeletal muscle fibers (cf. slow fibers). We also found that both ARPP and CARP expression is induced in experimentally denervated skeletal muscles in mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that their expression may be induced in skeletal muscles in neurodegenerating disease. This work aimed to determine the expression pattern of ARPP and CARP in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).	In this study, we immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of ARPP and CARP in skeletal muscles of 9 ALS cases.	We found that CARP was aberrantly expressed in atrophic skeletal muscle fibers in ALS. Although ARPP-positive fibers were randomly scattered in a checkerboard-like pattern in normal skeletal muscle, this pattern was absent in ALS muscles. Furthermore, we also found that ARPP was expressed in fast myosin heavy chain-positive fibers (cf. type 2 fiber).	These findings suggest that type-specific expression patterns of ARPP and CARP are altered in skeletal muscles of ALS.",Remaining,0,0

Our aim was to contribute to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by mapping auditory evoked potentials (AEP). Evoked potentials represent the electric response of the CNS to an external stimulus and can be represented as a sequence of waves. Brain mapping allows a chromotopogram to be compiled showing chromatic maps.	A group of 12 patients were studied aged between 68 and 84 years old who were referred to our attention at the Department of Geriatrics and Gerontology at Catania University and the A.O. Cannizzaro, Geriatrics Unit. All patients completed an assessment form (MM-SE, ADAS) and underwent brain NMR and AEP.	These tests enabled us to identify two types of patients (Group A and Group B) based on the responses shown. The overall evaluation of results revealed that patients with Alzheimer-type dementia present an anomalous cortical neurogenic response to mapped AEP, and that patients in Group A showed anomalous wave morphology, latency and localisation and asymmetric impregnation. The data gathered in this study did not confirm any specific characteristics of AEP given that similar anomalies are found in metabolic dysfunction syndromes and demyelination pathologies.

174,17967187,BMC cardiovascular disorders,Aminotransferases are associated with insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis.,"Serum aminotransferase concentrations are reportedly strongly associated with insulin resistance, an established cardiovascular risk factor that is not routinely assessed in clinical practice. We therefore explored the possibility that serum aminotransferase concentrations are as closely related to large artery disease as insulin resistance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	Carotid artery plaque (ultrasonography), insulin resistance and liver enzymes (prior to methotrexate (MTX) were determined in 77 consecutive patients with RA (43 with and 34 without MTX).	Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were associated with insulin resistance in univariate analysis (R = 0.54, p < 0.0001 and R = 0.36, p = 0.001, respectively) and after adjustment for age, gender and waist circumference (partial R = 0.43, p = 0.0001 and partial R = 0.37, p = 0.001, respectively). ALT and AST concentrations were higher in patients with plaque as compared to in those without plaque (ALT (u/l): 27 2223242526272829303132 versus 20 181920212223, p = 0.02; AST (u/l): 25 2122232425262728 versus 20 19202122, p = 0.02). The odds ratios [95% CI] for plaque were 1.92 [1.14-3.24] (p = 0.01), 1.93 [1.17-3.16] (p = 0.009) and 1.82 [1.13-2.93] (p = 0.01) for 1 SD increase in ALT (~10 u/l) and AST (approximately 6 u/l) concentrations and in logarithmically transformed homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (~0.2 uU.mmol/ml.l), respectively. After adjustment for the potentially confounding characteristics of age, sex, hypertension and hypothyroidism in logistic regression models, ALT (p = 0.049) and AST concentrations (p = 0.027) remained associated with plaque whereas the HOMA-IR did not (p = 0.08). AST concentrations (p = 0.049) were associated with plaque independent of insulin resistance whereas the HOMA-IR (p = 0.1) was not associated with plaque independent of AST concentrations.	Within currently recommended reference ranges, serum aminotransferase concentrations may be strongly associated with insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in patients with RA.

177,23520058,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,High-resolution tracking of motor disorders in Parkinson's disease during unconstrained activity.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) can present with a variety of motor disorders that fluctuate throughout the day, making assessment a challenging task. Paper-based measurement tools can be burdensome to the patient and clinician and lack the temporal resolution needed to accurately and objectively track changes in motor symptom severity throughout the day. Wearable sensor-based systems that continuously monitor PD motor disorders may help to solve this problem, although critical shortcomings persist in identifying multiple disorders at high temporal resolution during unconstrained activity. The purpose of this study was to advance the current state of the art by (1) introducing hybrid sensor technology to concurrently acquire surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer data during unconstrained activity and (2) analyzing the data using dynamic neural network algorithms to capture the evolving temporal characteristics of the sensor data and improve motor disorder recognition of tremor and dyskinesia. Algorithms were trained (n=11 patients) and tested (n=8 patients; n=4 controls) to recognize tremor and dyskinesia at 1-second resolution based on sensor data features and expert annotation of video recording during 4-hour monitoring periods of unconstrained daily activity. The algorithms were able to make accurate distinctions between tremor, dyskinesia, and normal movement despite the presence of diverse voluntary activity. Motor disorder severity classifications averaged 94.9% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity based on 1 sensor per symptomatic limb. These initial findings indicate that new sensor technology and software algorithms can be effective in enhancing wearable sensor-based system performance for monitoring PD motor disorders during unconstrained activities.",Remaining,0,0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the support of the phase-contrast MR imaging (PC-MR imaging) technique (sensitive to CSF flows) for the diagnosis of AS.	We retrospectively considered 17 patients who underwent PC-MR imaging to explore hydrocephalus, with the absence of CSF flow at the aqueductal level. We analyzed their clinical and morphologic MR imaging data.	None of the usually reported direct or indirect signs of aqueductal obstruction were seen in 7 patients in whom the clinical suggestion of AS was confirmed by PC-MR imaging results. Seven patients in this population had a third ventriculostomy, and 5 of them were among those in whom conventional MR imaging failed to reveal signs of aqueductal obstruction. All of these 7 patients had a positive postsurgical outcomes. The analysis of CSF and vascular dynamic data in this population was compared with an aged-matched population, and these data were found similar except for the fourth ventricular CSF flush flow latency.	PC-MR imaging supports the diagnosis of CSF flow blockage at the aqueductal level in a reliable, reproducible, and rapid way, which aids in the diagnosis of AS in patients with clinical and/or radiologic suggestion of obstructive hydrocephalus.

Pediatrics,Toward a better understanding of the cellular basis for cerebrospinal fluid shunt obstruction: report on the construction of a bank of explanted hydrocephalus devices.,"OBJECTIVE Shunt obstruction by cells and/or tissue is the most common cause of shunt failure. Ventricular catheter obstruction alone accounts for more than 50% of shunt failures in pediatric patients. The authors sought to systematically collect explanted ventricular catheters from the Seattle Children's Hospital with a focus on elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying obstruction. METHODS In the operating room, explanted hardware was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Weekly, samples were transferred to buffer solution and stored at 4°C. After consent was obtained for their use, catheters were labeled using cell-specific markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1), and choroid plexus (transthyretin) in conjunction with a nuclear stain (Hoechst). Catheters were mounted in custom polycarbonate imaging chambers. Three-dimensional, multispectral, spinning-disk confocal microscopy was used to image catheter cerebrospinal fluid-intake holes (10× objective, 499.2-μm-thick z-stack, 2.4-μm step size, Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with motorized stage and charge-coupled device camera). Values are reported as the mean ± standard error of the mean and were compared using a 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. Significance was defined at p < 0.05. RESULTS Thirty-six ventricular catheters have been imaged to date, resulting in the following observations: 1) Astrocytes and microglia are the dominant cell types bound directly to catheter surfaces; 2) cellular binding to catheters is ubiquitous even if no grossly visible tissue is apparent; and 3) immunohistochemical techniques are of limited utility when a catheter has been exposed to Bugbee wire electrocautery. Statistical analysis of 24 catheters was performed, after excluding 7 catheters exposed to Bugbee wire cautery, 3 that were poorly fixed, and 2 that demonstrated pronounced autofluorescence. This analysis revealed that catheters with a microglia-dominant cellular response tended to be implanted for shorter durations (24.7 ± 6.7 days) than those with an astrocyte-dominant response (1183 ± 642 days; p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Ventricular catheter occlusion remains a significant source of shunt morbidity in the pediatric population, and given their ability to intimately associate with catheter surfaces, astrocytes and microglia appear to be critical to this pathophysiology. Microglia tend to be the dominant cell type on catheters implanted for less than 2 months, while astrocytes tend to be the most prevalent cell type on catheters implanted for longer time courses and are noted to serve as an interface for the secondary attachment of ependymal cells and choroid plexus.",Remaining,0,0

Forty-five patients with peripheral nervous disorders aged 13-19 were studied. Hereditary polyneuropathy of different types was diagnosed in 28 patients (62%); nine showed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and two showed vasculitic neuropathy. In two more cases polyneuropathy was attributed to toxic agents, while among the rest, one was diagnosed as metachromatic leucodystrophy (juvenile type), one as adrenoleucodystrophy, one as porphyric neuropathy and one as Fabry disease. The high incidence of hereditary neuropathies in teenagers differs from that in adults, but is similar to that encountered in children. In our study, CIDP appears to be a frequent cause of neuropathy in teenagers, while the other causes are broadly similar to those found in studies concerning children rather than adults.",Remaining,0,0

Participants' (N = 12) narratives were initially analyzed utilizing a grounded theory framework as 68 violent incidents were coded for perceived threat and coping levels. Coping strategies were examined from a Transactional Model of Stress and Coping perspective taking into account the context and severity of each violent exposure itself. A comprehensive assessment map was developed to plot and visually reveal participants (N = 12) overall contextualized coping responses. Overall 'coping zone' scores were generated to index perceived threat and coping responses associated with each violent incident described. These scores were then correlated with indicators of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Results indicated that urban children with less optimal coping zone scores across context have a greater likelihood of PTSD than do children who do not.,Remaining,0,0

Paper-based screening tools previously reported in this group require assessment by clinicians and subsequent collation of data. We describe our experience of a new system - IMPARTS (Integrating mental and physical: research training and services), which uses validated tools to identify and to monitor the progress of patients who may benefit from psychological intervention. At outpatient clinics, patients used an electronic tablet to complete the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Inclusion of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Data were linked directly to their electronic record to allow the results, with suggestions for treatment, to be reviewed immediately during the consultation. A total of 162 patients were included. Screening showed that referral was required in 28 (17%) with a probable major depressive disorder and 32 (20%) with a general anxiety disorder. Two (1%), who were identified as being at high risk of suicide or self-harm, were referred for immediate psychological assessment. Use of the system can aid the holistic treatment of patients with TMD through appropriate referral. Early identification of mental health problems and concurrent management are most beneficial in those who have had symptoms of TMD for up to two years, and are therefore essential.",Remaining,0,0

In this study the effect of high-dose, long-term alcohol exposure on the pancreas was investigated in 32 consecutive alcoholics admitted to a unit to treat the problems of withdrawal after a long period of heavy drinking. None of the alcoholics complained of abdominal symptoms. The signs of clinical acute pancreatitis (pain, increased serum C-reactive protein concentration or blood white cell count) were not observed in any of the alcoholics. A significant increase in serum total amylase, pancreatic isoamylase and lipase activities developed by the second day after termination of alcohol intake. These enzyme activities remained significantly increased for one week after cessation of drinking. Seven alcoholics had signs of chronic pancreatitis at ultrasonography (pancreatic calcification, pseudocyst). These results suggest that heavy alcohol intake over the long term may frequently induce subclinical pancreatic injury.",Remaining,0,0

Here we report the analysis of 16 ChG by whole-exome and RNA-sequencing. We found that 15 ChG harbor the same PRKCA [D463H] mutation. PRKCA encodes the Protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme alpha (PKCα) and is mutated in a wide range of human cancers. However the hot spot PRKCA [D463H] mutation was not described in other tumors. PRKCA [D463H] is strongly associated with the activation of protein translation initiation (EIF2) pathway. PKCα[D463H] mRNA levels are more abundant than wild-type PKCα transcripts, while PKCα[D463H] is less stable than the PCKα[WT] protein. Compared to PCKα[WT], the PKCα[D463H] protein is depleted from the cell membrane. The PKCα[D463H] mutant enhances proliferation of astrocytes and tanycytes, the cells of origin of ChG. In conclusion, our study identifies the hallmark mutation for chordoid gliomas and provides mechanistic insights on ChG oncogenesis.",Remaining,0,0
188,1622299,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,Quantifying handicap: a new measure of long-term rehabilitation outcomes.,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), handicaps exist when individuals are unable to fulfill expected social roles. Although ameliorating handicaps is one of the prime goals of rehabilitation, its effectiveness in this area is poorly measured and has not been documented empirically. Therefore, the Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART) was designed to quantify the extent of handicap in individuals. Using dimensions of handicap identified and described by the WHO, CHART uses measurable, behavioral terms to compare such individuals with the norms of able-bodied members of society. Test-retest, proxies, and independent raters have established the validity and reliability of CHART. Rasch analysis has verified the CHART scaling and scoring procedures. In addition, an initial application of CHART, with a group of 342 spinal cord injured individuals, is described. Beyond demonstrating the instrument's effectiveness in assessing the extent of handicap or social disadvantage, this application, by documenting rehabilitation outcomes, demonstrates the potential usefulness of CHART for program evaluation.",Remaining,0,0
189,37294375,Research on child and adolescent psychopathology,"Adolescents and Social Media: Longitudinal Links Between Types of Use, Problematic Use and Internalizing Symptoms.","Studies examining the associations between adolescent social media use and depression/anxiety symptoms show inconsistent results and do not elucidate the direction of associations. Differences in how studies operationalize social media use and consider potential moderating effects of sex and extraversion could contribute to inconsistencies. A distinction has been made between three types of social media use: passive, active and problematic. This study examined longitudinal associations between these types of adolescents' social media use and depression/anxiety symptoms and moderation effects of sex or extraversion. At ages 13 (T1) and 14 (T2), 257 adolescents completed an online questionnaire regarding their depression and anxiety symptoms and problematic social media use as well as three social media use diaries. Cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) revealed a positive association between problematic use and later anxiety symptoms (β = .16, p = .010). Extraversion moderated the association between active use and anxiety (β = -.14, p = .032). Specifically, active use predicted higher subsequent anxiety symptoms only in adolescents with low to moderate levels of extraversion. No sex moderation was found. While social media use (active or problematic) predicted later anxiety symptoms (but not depression), the reverse was not the case. However, highly extraverted individuals seem to be less vulnerable to potential negative effects of social media use.",Remaining,0,0

However, it is unclear whether co-use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and/or cannabis is associated with higher levels of nicotine dependence than cigarette-only use. We investigated the relationship between cigarette/nicotine dependence and co-use of tobacco and cannabis among 4 groups of cigarette smokers aged 18-35: cigarette-only smokers, cigarette-e-cigarette (CIG-ECIG) co-users, cigarette-cannabis (CIG-CAN) co-users, and cigarette-e-cigarette-cannabis (CIG-ECIG-CAN) co-users.	Data were from a 2018 cross-sectional survey based on a national convenience sample of smokers aged 18-35 (n = 315). Cigarette/nicotine dependence was measured by the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and e-cigarette dependence was measured by the Penn State E-cigarette Dependence Index. Bivariate analyses examined sociodemographic and tobacco/other substance use characteristics by co-use status and multivariable linear regression assessed the relationship between co-use and nicotine dependence.	In the sample, 27.6% were cigarette-only smokers, 24.8% were CIG-ECIG, 27.6% were CIG-CAN, and 20.0% were CIG-ECIG-CAN co-users. Significant differences were observed in sociodemographic and tobacco/other substance use characteristics by co-use status. E-cigarette co-users had low e-cigarette dependence, but moderate FTND scores. In adjusted analyses, only CIG-ECIG co-use was associated with higher FTND scores compared to cigarette-only smoking. However, CIG-ECIG and CIG-ECIG-CAN co-use were associated with higher FTND scores compared to CIG-CAN co-use.	Co-use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes was associated with greater nicotine dependence among smokers aged 18-35. Additional research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of these relationships and inform prevention efforts.",Remaining,0,0
191,25330102,PloS one,Modeling the dynamics of disease states in depression.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and costly disorder associated with considerable morbidity, disability, and risk for suicide. The disorder is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous. Despite intense research efforts, the response rates of antidepressant treatments are relatively low and the etiology and progression of MDD remain poorly understood. Here we use computational modeling to advance our understanding of MDD. First, we propose a systematic and comprehensive definition of disease states, which is based on a type of mathematical model called a finite-state machine. Second, we propose a dynamical systems model for the progression, or dynamics, of MDD. The model is abstract and combines several major factors (mechanisms) that influence the dynamics of MDD. We study under what conditions the model can account for the occurrence and recurrence of depressive episodes and how we can model the effects of antidepressant treatments and cognitive behavioral therapy within the same dynamical systems model through changing a small subset of parameters. Our computational modeling suggests several predictions about MDD. Patients who suffer from depression can be divided into two sub-populations: a high-risk sub-population that has a high risk of developing chronic depression and a low-risk sub-population, in which patients develop depression stochastically with low probability. The success of antidepressant treatment is stochastic, leading to widely different times-to-remission in otherwise identical patients. While the specific details of our model might be subjected to criticism and revisions, our approach shows the potential power of computationally modeling depression and the need for different type of quantitative data for understanding depression.",Remaining,0,0

We studied patients with Af, retrospectively, as to the factors related to cerebral embolism. We examined 82 cases with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) as well as ambulatory (Holter) ECG and 12 leads ECG. Thirty-three patients had cerebral ischemic attack (CIA), including 14 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) and 19 patients with other heart disease or lone Af (NonMS). The CIA group of NonMS were older than other groups. Both the CIA and NonCIA groups had the same frequency of paroxysmal and chronic Af. In the CIA group, there was a tendency of small amplitude of f wave and longer RR interval than the NonCIA group with ambulatory ECG. The CIA group also had larger left atrial cavity size and aortic diameter with TTE. TEE revealed thrombus formation in 29 cases, and the CIA group had a higher occurrence rate of thrombus than NonCIA group. TEE also detected a fuzzy echo in the left atrium in 88% of the CIA group and 42% of the NonCIA group. The risk factors of cerebral embolism could not be made clear in this study, but a fuzzy echo and thrombus in the left atrium with TEE are specific findings of cerebral embolism. Therefore, older patients with paroxysmal Af, large LAD, AOD, small f wave or long RR interval need to be examined by TEE to detect LA thrombus or a fuzzy echo, which are probably major risk factors of cerebral embolism.",Remaining,0,0

195,28784338,Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology,Evaluation of neuromuscular tone phenotypes in children with autism spectrum disorder: An exploratory study.,"Motor disorders are known in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but muscle tone assessments are rarely performed. Muscle tone underpins movement. We investigated muscle tone in 34 ASD children using a standardized neuro-developmental battery, which uses the French norms for muscular tone in children.	Dangling and extensibility were used to examine passive muscle tone in the upper and lower limbs and the body axis. A comparison between muscles of the right and left sides enabled the determination of tonic laterality.	We found a disharmonious tonic typology, with a tonic component for the muscles of the trunk and the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and a laxity component for the ankles and the proximal and distal muscles of the upper limbs (wrists and shoulders). No establishment of tonic laterality was found in the upper limbs in 61% of ASD children (P<0.001).	The disturbed tonic organization influenced by subcortical structures, such as the cerebellum, may partially explain the motor disorders, and indefinite tonic laterality may also be linked to low hemispheric brain dominance described in autism. This preliminary examination is necessary before any gross motor assessments to understand the nature of movement disorders, explore typologies and highlight possible soft neuro-motor signs.",Remaining,0,0

Specifically, we assayed glioma-associated stem cells (GASC) that are patient-derived and representative of the glioma microenvironment.	By next-generation sequencing, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of GASC derived from patients who underwent anaplastic transformation either within 48 months (GASC-BAD) or ≥7 years (GASC-GOOD) after surgery. Gene set enrichment and pathway enrichment analyses were applied. The prognostic role of a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signature derived from GASC-BAD was tested in 530 newly diagnosed diffuse LGG patients comprised within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The prognostic value of the GASC upstream regulator p65 NF-κB was assessed, by univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, in a single center case study, including 146 grade II LGGs.	The key elements differentiating the transcriptome of GASC isolated from LGG with different prognoses were mostly related to hallmarks of cancer (eg, inflammatory/immune process, NF-κB activation). Consistently, the NF-κB signature extrapolated from the GASC study was prognostic in the dataset of TCGA. Finally, the nuclear expression of the NF-kB-p65 protein, assessed using an inexpensive immunohistochemical method, was an independent predictor of both overall survival and malignant progression-free survival in 146 grade II LGGs.	This study demonstrates for the first time the independent prognostic role of NF-kB activation in LGG and outlines the role of patient-based stem cell models as a tool for precision medicine approaches.",Remaining,0,0

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography were used to examine asymmetries in language-related gray- and white-matter and their relationships to language ability in a sample of 20 children with ASD, aged 4-7 years, and a reference sample of 20 typically developing (TD) children, aged 6-11 years. Children with ASD did not differ significantly from TD children in gray matter asymmetries, but were significantly less left-lateralized than TD children in the volume and radial diffusivity (RD) of the arcuate fasciculus (AF). They did not differ in the fractional anisotropy (FA) or the mean or axial diffusivity of the AF. Within the ASD group, exploratory analyses revealed that decreased leftward/increased rightward asymmetry of pars opercularis was associated with higher language ability and bilaterally increased FA and decreased RD of the AF. In conclusion, children with ASD exhibited atypical asymmetry in language-related white-matter structure as well as an atypical pattern of brain-language relationships that suggest that they may meet language milestones and acquire normal language via a different neurodevelopmental trajectory from TD children.",Remaining,0,0

Treatment is hampered by GBM's unique biology, including differential cell response to therapy. Although several mitochondrial abnormalities have been identified, how mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations contribute to GBM biology and therapeutic response remains poorly described. We sought to determine the spectrum of functional complex III and IV mtDNA mutations in GBM.	The complete mitochondrial genomes of 10 GBM cell lines were obtained using next-generation sequencing and combined with another set obtained from 32 GBM tissues. Three-dimensional structural mapping and analysis of all the nonsynonymous mutations identified in complex III and IV proteins was then performed to investigate functional importance.	Over 200 mutations were identified in the mtDNAs, including a significant proportion with very low mutational loads. Twenty-five were nonsynonymous mutations in complex III and IV, 9 of which were predicted to be functional and affect mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. Most of the functional candidates were GBM specific and not found in the general population, and 2 were present in the germ-line. Patient-specific maps reveal that 43% of tumors carry at least one functional candidate.	We reveal that the spectrum of GBM-associated mtDNA mutations is wider than previously thought, as well as novel structural-functional links between specific mtDNA mutations, abnormal mitochondria, and the biology of GBM. These results could provide tangible new prognostic indicators as well as targets with which to guide the development of patient-specific mitochondrially mediated chemotherapeutic approaches.",Remaining,0,0

Research was undertaken on behalf of the Smarter than Smoking (STS) project to probe young people's reasons for smoking uptake, their attitudes towards the social acceptability of smoking, predictors of continued smoking after trial and understandings and perceptions of addiction.	twenty focus groups were conducted to collect qualitative data from young people (n=92) aged 13 to 15 years from metropolitan and regional areas of Western Australia (WA), from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds, including young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.	of the young people spoken to, 20% smoked regularly, 40% had tried smoking and 40% had never tried. Acceptability and normalcy of trialling smoking was a recurring theme, with little perceived risk of trial leading to regular smoking or becoming addicted. Even non-smokers accepted 'just having a try' in the context of curiosity, life experiences and 'informed choice'.	preventing continuation after trial of smoking among young people needs to increase in importance, given the prevailing norms around 'trying it' and individual choice.",Remaining,0,0
206,33180841,PloS one,The incidence of malignant brain tumors is increased in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: A national health insurance survey.,"The association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and malignant brain tumors has yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of OSA on brain tumor incidence based on the Korea National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) dataset. The KNHIS data between 2007 and 2014 were analyzed, and the primary endpoint was newly diagnosed malignant brain tumor. A total of 198,574 subjects aged ≥ 20 years with newly diagnosed OSA were enrolled in the study, and 992,870 individuals were selected as a control group based on propensity score matching (PSM) by gender and age. The average follow-up duration was 4.8 ± 2.3 years. The hazard ratios (HRs) for brain tumor for patients with OSA were 1.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42-2.21) in Model 1 (not adjusted with any covariate) and 1.67 (95% CI: 1.34-2.09) in Model 2 (adjusted for income level, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and COPD). In subgroup analysis by gender, the odds ratios (OR) of OSA were 1.82 (95% CI: 1.41-2.33) in men and 1.26 (95% CI: 0.74-2.03) in women. The ORs were 1.97 (95% CI: 1.15-3.24) in the older (age ≥ 65 years) group, 1.66 (95% CI: 1.25-2.17) in the middle-aged (40 ≤ age < 65 years) group, and 1.41 (0.78-2.44) in the young (20 ≤ age < 40 years) group. In conclusion, OSA may increase the incidence of brain tumors.",Remaining,0,0
207,21112701,Drug and alcohol dependence,Psychopathic heroin addicts are not uniformly impaired across neurocognitive domains of impulsivity.,"Impulsivity is a hallmark characteristic of drug addiction and a prominent feature of externalizing disorders such as psychopathy that are commonly comorbid with drug addiction. In a previous study (Vassileva et al., 2007) we have shown that psychopathic heroin addicts evidence more impulsive decision-making on the Iowa Gambling Task relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether the observed impulse-control deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts would generalize to other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity, such as delay discounting and behavioral inhibition among a group of relatively 'pure' heroin addicts in Bulgaria who participated in our previous study.	We tested 92 currently abstinent male heroin addicts, classified as psychopathic or non-psychopathic based on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R). We administered two neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity: (1) Delayed Rewards Discounting Task, a measure of temporal discounting of rewards; and (2) Passive Avoidance Learning Task, a measure of behavioral inhibition.	Psychopathic heroin addicts were not impaired relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts on the Delayed Rewards Discounting Task and the Passive Avoidance Learning Task, on the latter of which they showed better attentional capacity.	These results indicate that psychopathic heroin users are not uniformly impaired across neurocognitive domains of impulsivity. Combined with our previous findings, results suggest that the presence of psychopathy may exacerbate decision-making deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts, but it may not have significant effect on other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity in this population.",Remaining,0,0

Thus, visual testing could be used as an aid to the clinical diagnosis of dementia. In the present study, exploratory eye movement was measured to evaluate visual cognitive function in elderly subjects, including those with dementia.	We analyzed responsive search scores (RSS) from exploratory eye movements of 300 subjects who were examined with an eye mark recorder while viewing S shaped figures. Subjects were divided into three groups (dementia, intermediate, healthy) from the values of the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating. We further divided the intermediate groups into two subgroups, the high score and low score groups, based on RSS. In 202 subjects, Z-scores of voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	RSS of the dementia group were significantly lower than those in the intermediate and healthy groups, in order: dementia < intermediate < healthy groups. RSS of the low score intermediate group was significantly lower than that of the high score intermediate group. There was no significant difference between the low score intermediate and dementia groups, or between the high score intermediate and healthy groups. No significant differences of either HSD-R or MMSE were observed between the low score and the high score intermediate groups. The Z-score of VSRAD using MRI in the low score intermediate group was significantly higher than that in the high score intermediate group.	These findings suggest that RSS using an eye mark recorder is a useful psychophysiological marker to evaluate the early stage of dementia as well as at-risk elderly people.",Remaining,0,0

Clinicians may also question service users' ability to make considered decisions about their treatment when in crisis. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to investigate crisis treatment preferences of a sample of community-dwelling adults with borderline personality disorder.	Participants were 41 adults with borderline personality disorder who had created joint crisis plans during a randomized controlled trial. Data from all 41 joint crisis plans were analyzed iteratively via a thematic analysis framework.	Participants gave clear statements in their crisis plans relating to the desire to recover from the crisis and to improve their social functioning. Key themes included the desire to be treated with dignity and respect and to receive emotional and practical support from clinicians. Many participants spoke of the importance of connecting with others during periods of crisis, but several reported a clear desire to be left alone during a future crisis. Other themes concerned preferences for specific treatment refusals during crises, including particular types of psychotropic medication and involuntary treatment.	The variation of participants' preferences underscores the importance of developing individually tailored crisis plans for people with borderline personality disorder. The need to be treated with dignity and respect and to be given autonomy in decision making--also identified in global surveys of people with severe mental illness--is important to people with borderline personality disorder. Key messages for clinicians, service users, and policy makers, in addition to staff training issues, are discussed.",Remaining,0,0

Six of 12 PCP users, five of 12 polydrug users, and none of the controls showed neuropsychological impairments. The deficits in PCP users occurred despite negative medical-neurological history, and even though the PCP group abused other drugs previously associated with neuropsychological impairment less than the polydrug group. Deficiencies in abstracting and in perceptual-motor integrative abilities were noted. The results suggest the possibility that PCP abuse might be associated with neuropsychological disturbance which persists for considerable time after PCP use ceases.",Remaining,0,0

Our aim was to perform an expanded extensive assessment of motor and nonmotor manifestations in PD to identify whether RBD was associated with differences in the nature and severity of these manifestations. PD patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) to diagnose the presence of RBD. Participants then underwent an extensive evaluation by a movement disorders specialist blinded to PSG results. Measures of disease severity, quantitative motor indices, motor subtypes, therapy complications, and autonomic, psychiatric, visual, and olfactory dysfunction were assessed and compared using regression analysis, adjusting for disease duration, age, and sex. Of 98 included patients, 54 had RBD and 44 did not. PD patients with RBD were older (P = 0.034) and were more likely to be male (P < 0.001). On regression analysis, the most consistent links between RBD and PD were a higher systolic blood pressure (BP) change while standing (-23.9 ± 13.9 versus -3.5 ± 10.9; P < 0.001), a higher orthostatic symptom score (0.89 ± 0.82 versus 0.44 ± 0.66; P = 0.003), and a higher frequency of freezing (43% versus 14%; P = 0.011). A systolic BP drop >10 could identify PD patients with RBD with 81% sensitivity and 86% specificity. In addition, there was a probable relationship between RBD and nontremor predominant subtype of PD (P = 0.04), increased frequency of falls (P = 0.009), and depression (P = 0.009). Our results support previous findings that RBD is a multifaceted phenomenon in PD.

We examined measures of self-report, as well as behavioral, physiological, and facial responses to errors during a Stop-Change Task. 25 participants with HD and 32 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Participants reported on number of errors committed and pre/post emotional response to errors. Skin conductance response (SCR) during correct and error commission trials was examined. Facial expression during task performance was coded for self-conscious and negative emotions. HD and HC participants had significantly different error rates but comparable error correction and post-error slowing. SCR was significantly lower for HD during error commission than for HC. During error trials, HD participants showed a significant deficit in displays of self-conscious emotions compared to HC. Self-reported emotions were increased in HD, with more negative and self-conscious emotion reported than was reported for HC participants. These findings suggest that hypoactive emotional responding at a physiological level may play a role in how errors are processed in individuals with HD.",Remaining,0,0
218,29155708,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,Enrichment of Detergent-insoluble Protein Aggregates from Human Postmortem Brain.,"In this study, we describe an abbreviated single-step fractionation protocol for the enrichment of detergent-insoluble protein aggregates from human postmortem brain. The ionic detergent N-lauryl-sarcosine (sarkosyl) effectively solubilizes natively folded proteins in brain tissue allowing the enrichment of detergent-insoluble protein aggregates from a wide range of neurodegenerative proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases. Human control and AD postmortem brain tissues were homogenized and sedimented by ultracentrifugation in the presence of sarkosyl to enrich detergent-insoluble protein aggregates including pathologic phosphorylated tau, the core component of neurofibrillary tangles in AD. Western blotting demonstrated the differential solubility of aggregated phosphorylated-tau and the detergent-soluble protein, Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA1) in control and AD brain. Proteomic analysis also revealed enrichment of β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, snRNP70 (U1-70K), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of AD brain compared to those of control, consistent with previous tissue fractionation strategies. Thus, this simple enrichment protocol is ideal for a wide range of experimental applications ranging from Western blotting and functional protein co-aggregation assays to mass spectrometry-based proteomics.",Remaining,0,0

Method Data were collected by self-report from 1098 adolescents (mean age 13.6 years; 60.9% boys) at five separate time points, equally separated by 6 months, across a 24-month period. General growth mixture modelling identified three distinct trajectories of adolescents reporting psychotic experiences: elevated, increasing and low.	Controlling for cannabis use, bullying by peers significantly predicted change in psychotic experiences between Time 2 and Time 5 in adolescents belonging to the increasing group. No effect was found for the elevated or low groups. Controlling for bullying, an earlier age of cannabis use and cannabis use more than twice significantly predicted change in psychotic experiences in adolescents belonging to the increasing group. Cannabis use at any age was significantly associated with subsequent change in psychotic experiences in the low group. Reverse causal associations were examined and there was no evidence for psychotic experiences at Time 1 predicting a subsequent change in cannabis use between Times 2 and 5 in any trajectory group.	Bullying by peers and cannabis use are associated with adolescents' reports of increasing psychotic experiences over time. Further research into the longitudinal development of psychosis in adolescence and the associated risk factors would allow for early intervention programmes to be targeted more precisely.",Remaining,0,0

Clinical,White matter microstructural abnormalities in children with severe congenital hypothyroidism.,"This study assessed white matter microstructural integrity and behavioral correlates for children with severe congenital hypothyroidism (CH) who were identified and treated early following newborn screening. Eighteen children with severe CH and 21 healthy controls underwent a battery of behavioral measures of hearing, language and communication, along with diffusion MR imaging. Tract-based spatial statistics were performed on standard diffusion parameters of fractional anisotropy and diffusivity metrics. Microscopic diffusion anisotropy mapping based on the Spherical Mean Technique was also used to evaluate biologically specific metrics. Compared with age-matched controls, children with severe CH had poorer hearing and communication skills, albeit generally within normal limits. Children with severe CH had fractional anisotropy that was significantly lower in the cerebellum, bilateral thalami and right temporal lobe, and radial diffusivity that was significantly higher in the cerebellum and bilateral thalami. Microscopic fractional anisotropy and intra-neurite volume fraction were also significantly decreased, and transverse microscopic diffusivity was significantly increased, in the CH group in areas including the cerebellum, thalamus, occipital lobe, and corpus callosum, and in the white matter adjacent to sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the left hemisphere. Significant and widespread correlations were observed between behavioral measures and measures of white matter microstructural integrity in children with CH. The results indicate that children with severe CH who are identified through newborn screening may have significant brain white matter microstructural abnormalities despite early treatment.",Remaining,0,0

Median age during follow-up was 15 years (range 5-23). The most common malignancies were brain tumors, lymphoma, retinoblastoma and Wilm's tumor. The 174 late side-effects included endocrine disorders (19%), cognitive impairment (14%), orthopedic dysfunction (12%), alopecia (12%), dental damage (11%), psychological (8%) and neurological (8%) disturbances, and azoospermia or amenorrhea (5%). There was no cardiac or renal damage and no second malignancy. 29% of side-effects were severe. There was significant reduction in quality of life in 54 (49%), in 27 of whom it was severe enough to require psychological intervention. Treatment of brain tumor caused 98 late side-effects in 28 patients (sequelae-to-patient ratio [SPR] 3.3). Most cognitive, endocrine and neurological disorders, and most cases of alopecia, dental and psychological difficulties were in these patients. There were frequent late complications in those treated for retinoblastoma (SPR 1.8), and bone or soft tissue sarcomas (SPR 0.8). Those treated for Wilm's tumor had few side-effects (SPR 0.4). Late side effects were most frequent after radiation, reaching as high as SPR 2.4. It averaged only 0.5 in those treated with chemotherapy alone or in combination with surgery. Reduction of late side-effects in these patients requires using less toxic modalities, as long as cure rate is not compromised. When considering secondary strategies, screening for early detection of late complications would enable immediate solutions, such as hormonal replacement or providing compensating skills for post-treatment disability.",Remaining,0,0

It also investigated the effect of child maltreatment and maternal mental illness on children's psychosocial functioning in terms of the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM) including unresolved trauma and the DMM Depressed modifier.	The attachment strategies of 30 sibling pairs, aged 5-14 years, were assessed using the School-age Assessment of Attachment (SAA). Unlike most previous studies, this study included siblings from large families of two to six children.	The main finding was that as environmental risk increases, the diversity of sibling attachment strategies decreases with greater recourse to the DMM Type A3-6 and A/C strategies. Unlike previous studies, the highest level of concordance was found in sibling pairs with the opposite gender. Boys whose mothers had a history of mental illness were significantly more likely than girls to be assessed with the DMM-depression modifier.	As danger increases, children in the same family experience more of the same childhood. Further research should focus on single case, intra-familial studies to build a systemic model of the shared environment. Research should also evaluate the effects of environmental risk compared with size of the sibling group on children's attachment strategies. The clinical implications point to the importance of assessing all children in the family using a model built around functional formulation rather than diagnosing the symptoms of a particular child.",Remaining,0,0

226,15221931,The Journal of pathology,Prevalence of lymphoreticular prion protein accumulation in UK tissue samples.,"This study aims to provide an estimate of the number of individuals in the UK who may be incubating variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and at risk of causing iatrogenic spread of the disease. Lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein is a consistent feature of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob at autopsy and has also been demonstrated in the pre-clinical phase. Immunohistochemical accumulation of prion protein in the lymphoreticular system remains the only technique that has been shown to predict neurological disease reliably in animal prion disorders. In this study, immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate the presence of prion protein, with monoclonal antibodies KG9 and 3F4, in surgically removed tonsillectomy and appendicectomy specimens. The samples were collected from histopathology departments across the UK and anonymised prior to testing. Samples were tested from 16 703 patients (14 964 appendectomies, 1739 tonsillectomies), approximately 60% of whom were from the age group 20-29 years at operation. Twenty-five per cent of the samples were excluded from the final analyses because they contained inadequate amounts of lymphoid tissue. Three appendicectomy samples showed lymphoreticular accumulation of prion protein, giving an estimated prevalence of 3/12 674 or 237 per million (95% CI 49-692 per million). The pattern of lymphoreticular accumulation in two of these samples was dissimilar from that seen in known cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Although it is uncertain whether immunohistochemical accumulation of prion protein in the lymphoreticular system is specific for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, it has not been described in any other disease, including other forms of human prion disease or a range of inflammatory and infective conditions. These findings reinforce the importance of measures taken by the UK Department of Health to reduce the risk of spread of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob via blood products and surgical instruments, and of the urgency to proceed with large-scale screening of fresh tonsil specimens for the presence of prion protein.",Remaining,0,0

Teachers working full time reported more effort than teachers working part time, but the reward mean values of both groups were similar. This results in a somewhat unfavourable effort-reward ratio of teachers working full time. Moreover, teachers working full time reported more mental health problems. The results support the appropriateness of the effort-reward conception, applied to the profession of teachers. The higher degree of effort-reward imbalance and the level of mental health problems warrant preventive measures. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Remaining,0,0

233,21824113,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,Expression of hepatocyte growth factor in the skin of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent survival-promoting factors for motor neurons. Overexpression of neuronal HGF has been shown to result in the attenuation of neuronal cell death and progression of disease in a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) transgenic mouse model. HGF might be beneficial for motor neuron survival and is a good candidate agent for the treatment of ALS. So far, studies of the skin of ALS have shown unique pathological and biochemical abnormalities. However, there has been no study of HGF in ALS skin.	We made a quantitative immunohistochemical study of the expression of HGF in the skin from 19 patients with sporadic ALS and 16 controls.	Hepatocyte growth factor immunoreactivity was positive in the epidermis, some dermal blood vessels, and glands in patients with ALS. These findings became more conspicuous as ALS progressed. The optical density for HGF immunoreactivity of the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the epidermis in ALS was significantly higher (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) than in controls. There was a significant positive relation (r = 0.53, P < 0.02 and r = 0.73, P < 0.001) between HGF immunoreactivity and duration of illness in the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the epidermis in patients with ALS.	These findings suggest that changes in HGF in ALS skin are related to the disease process and that metabolic alterations of HGF may take place in the skin of patients with ALS.",Remaining,0,0

Hundred ischemic stroke patients admitted to the hospital within the first 24 h of stroke onset were consecutively recruited and followed up for 14 days. The 17-item HDRS and MADRS were used to assess the severity of major depressive symptoms on day 3, day 7, and day 14 after admission. The diagnoses of depression were made in accordance with DSM-IV criteria for post-stroke depression (PSD). Serum BDNF and tPA of all the patients were determined by ELISA both on day 1 and day 7 after admission. Meanwhile, 50 healthy control subjects were also recruited and underwent measurement of serum BDNF and tPA once.	We found that 37 patients (37.0%) were diagnosed of major depression at the end of the follow-up. Serum BDNF on day 1 was significantly higher in non-PSD stroke patients than in normal controls, while PSD patients had significantly lower BDNF than non-PSD patients. There was a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF and tPA on day 1 only in PSD patients (r = -0.440, p = 0.006). Serum BDNF < 5.86 ng/ml on day 1 was independently associated with incident PSD at the acute stage of stroke (OR = 28.992; 95% CI, 8.014-104.891; p < 0.001 after adjustment).	There was a significant elevation of BDNF early after ischemic stroke. Serum BDNF on day 1 after admission may predict the risk of subsequent PSD. Moreover, tPA may be involved in the change of BDNF.",Remaining,0,0

The awards were held in 2009, aiming to share clinical experience and best practice in headache-related disease management. 56 unusual and challenging cases of headache from 5 European countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain) were judged by a Scientific Committee including expert representatives from participating countries, acting as reviewers. Three cases were selected from each country. The 15 resulting cases were presented to the Scientific Committee in Madrid, Spain in November 2009 and awards were given to the top 5 presentations. This article presents details of these cases, including the award winning entries. They have been categorized into four main groups: (a) headaches in rare syndromes; (b) secondary headaches to infectious/autoimmune causes or post-trauma/mass occupation; (c) headache in unresolved cases; and (d) other relevant cases. First prize was awarded to a case involving a 55-year-old male with familial thrombocytopenia and a unilateral neuralgiform headache secondary to trigeminal vascular contact, and which was successfully treated with carbamazepine. Conclusions from the meeting include: rare syndromes do occur and require appropriate treatment to improve outcomes; concomitant diseases may impair adequate diagnosis and should be investigated; physicians should be cautious and treat possible serious underlying disease, whilst accurately clarifying the correct diagnosis; neurological examination and complementary tests may be required; consideration should be given to possible rare medication events; and some cases may remain without a clear cause or diagnosis and symptoms should be treated whilst investigations continue.",Remaining,0,0

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded temporal arteries that were pathologically negative for GCA and normal temporal arteries were analyzed immunohistochemically for VZV and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) antigen.	Five (21%) of 24 temporal arteries from patients who were clinically suspect but biopsy negative for GCA revealed VZV but not HSV-1 by immunohistochemical analysis. Thirteen normal temporal arteries did not contain VZV or HSV-1 antigen.

238,28805936,NMR in biomedicine,Characterizing hypoxia in human glioma: A simultaneous multimodal MRI and PET study.,"Hypoxia plays an important role for the prognosis and therapy response of cancer. Thus, hypoxia imaging would be a valuable tool for pre-therapeutic assessment of tumor malignancy. However, there is no standard validated technique for clinical application available yet. Therefore, we performed a study in 12 patients with high-grade glioma, where we directly compared the two currently most promising techniques, namely the MR-based relative oxygen extraction fraction (MR-rOEF) and the PET hypoxia marker H-1-(3-[[18] F]-fluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)-2-nitroimidazole ([[18] F]-FMISO). MR-rOEF was determined from separate measurements of T2 , T2 * and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) employing a multi-parametric approach for quantification of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect. With respect to [[18] F]-FMISO-PET, besides the commonly used late uptake between 120 and 130 min ([[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min), we also analyzed the hypoxia specific uptake rate [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , as obtained by pharmacokinetic modeling of dynamic uptake data. Since pharmacokinetic modeling of partially acquired dynamic [[18] F]-FMISO data was sensitive to a low signal-to-noise-ratio, analysis was restricted to high-uptake tumor regions. Individual spatial analyses of deoxygenation and hypoxia-related parameter maps revealed that high MR-rOEF values clustered in (edematous) peritumoral tissue, while areas with high [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min concentrated in and around active tumor with disrupted blood-brain barrier, i.e. contrast enhancement in T1 -weighted MRI. Volume-of-interest-based correlations between MR-rOEF and [[18] F]-FMISO120-130 min as well as [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 , and voxel-wise analyses in individual patients, yielded limited correlations, supporting the notion that [[18] F]-FMISO uptake, even after 2 h, might still be influenced by perfusion while [[18] F]-FMISO-k3 was severely hampered by noise. According to these results, vascular deoxygenation, as measured by MR-rOEF, and severe tissue hypoxia, as measured by [[18] F]-FMISO, show a poor spatial correspondence. Overall, the two methods appear to rather provide complementary than redundant information about high-grade glioma biology.",Remaining,0,0
239,18194524,BMC psychiatry,Factor analysis of the Zung self-rating depression scale in a large sample of patients with major depressive disorder in primary care.,"The aim of this study was to examine the symptomatic dimensions of depression in a large sample of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in the primary care (PC) setting by means of a factor analysis of the Zung self-rating depression scale (ZSDS).	A factor analysis was performed, based on the polychoric correlations matrix, between ZSDS items using promax oblique rotation in 1049 PC patients with a diagnosis of MDD (DSM-IV).	A clinical interpretable four-factor solution consisting of a core depressive factor (I); a cognitive factor (II); an anxiety factor (III) and a somatic factor (IV) was extracted. These factors accounted for 36.9% of the variance on the ZSDS. The 4-factor structure was validated and high coefficients of congruence were obtained (0.98, 0.95, 0.92 and 0.87 for factors I, II, III and IV, respectively). The model seemed to fit the data well with fit indexes within recommended ranges (GFI = 0.9330, AGFI = 0.9112 and RMR = 0.0843).	Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms in patients with MDD in the PC setting cluster into four dimensions: core depressive, cognitive, anxiety and somatic, by means of a factor analysis of the ZSDS. Further research is needed to identify possible diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic implications of the different depressive symptomatic profiles.",Remaining,0,0

242,7957408,European journal of pediatrics,X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in patients with idiopathic Addison disease.,"The two main causes of primary adrenal disease are tuberculosis and auto-immune adrenal destruction. The latter is responsible for about 70% of the cases of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). Commonly referred to as a rare cause of adrenal failure is X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a demyelinating peroxisomal disorder affecting 1: 20,000 Caucasian males. Albeit primary adrenal insufficiency is a rare entity per se, we decided to study patients with idiopathic Addison disease and establish the frequency of ALD as a cause of adrenal insufficiency. The biochemical defect of ALD was found in 5 out of 24 patients. The small number of cases in our series led us to include in our analysis the published results of two other groups of investigators. This analysis indicates that the proportion of cases in which Addison disease is attributable to ALD is age dependent. It is highest when the adrenal insufficiency manifests before 15 years. This study clearly demonstrates that the proportion of ALD in patients presenting primary adrenal insufficiency has been under-estimated.	Addison disease manifesting during the first decade of life has a high likelihood of being the first sign of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.",Remaining,0,0

Among our 200 subjects, 103 had migraine-type headache and 97 had tension-type headache.	Headache triggered by computer use was more common in the migraine-type headache group. There was no difference between the Internet addiction scale score of the two groups. The Internet addiction scale scores of the patients were found to differ depending on the aim and duration of computer use. Internet addiction was found in six (6%) patients. Internet addiction prevalence was 3.7% and 8.5% in the two groups, respectively.	The prevalence of Internet addiction in children with recurrent headache was lower than that found in their peers in Turkey, possibly due to avoidance of computer use as a headache trigger. This finding raises the question of whether migraine- or tension-type headaches actually prevent Internet addiction.",Remaining,0,0
244,32929643,European radiology,Uncontrolled hypertension associates with subclinical cerebrovascular health globally: a multimodal imaging study.,"The study aimed to analyze the association between hypertension control and subclinical cerebrovascular health using a comprehensive multimodal imaging approach.	The study included 200 hypertensive older males without previous cardiovascular diseases. Clinic blood pressure (BP) was measured using a standard approach. Cerebrovascular health was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging in the following four aspects: Intracranial atherosclerosis as determined by vessel wall imaging; Vascular rarefaction (defined as less discernible vessels on angiography) was evaluated using a custom-developed technique. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) were assessed using arterial spin-labeling imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, respectively.	A total of 189 subjects had MRI scans. The mean age was 64.9 (± 7.2) years. For intracranial atherosclerosis, there was a significant association between uncontrolled hypertension and presence of intracranial plaque. When systolic and diastolic BP were analyzed separately, the association remained significant for both. For vascular rarefaction, uncontrolled hypertension was associated with less discernible vessel branches or shorter vessel length on angiography. Further analysis revealed that this is due to uncontrolled diastolic BP, but not uncontrolled systolic BP. There was an association between uncontrolled hypertension and reduced CBF, which was also mainly driven by uncontrolled diastolic BP. We also found that uncontrolled diastolic BP, but not uncontrolled systolic BP, was associated with increased WMH volume.	Uncontrolled hypertension was associated with subclinical cerebrovascular injury globally, with both small and medium-to-large arteries being affected.	• In this study, we leveraged the advantage of a series of cutting-edge MR imaging and analysis techniques and found uncontrolled hypertension is associated with subclinical globally compromised cerebrovascular health. • The detrimental consequences of uncontrolled BP affect not only the small vessels but also the medium-to-large arteries, and uncontrolled systolic and diastolic BP are both independently associated with certain types of cerebrovascular injury. • Our data suggest that cerebrovascular health is impaired globally in uncontrolled hypertension before the onset of stroke.",Remaining,0,0

The experiments were carried out on hippocampal slices of guinea pigs. EFP were elicited by omission of Mg2+ from the perfusate and recorded from stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum in the CA1 subfield. Single electrical stimuli were applied to the Schaffer collateral pathway. Verapamil was added to the bath solution in concentrations of 40 and 60 mumol verapamil/l at normal (4 mmol/l) and elevated (8 mmol/l) K+ levels. After omission of Mg2+ from the perfusate, spontaneously occurring EFP appeared in all trials. These spontaneously occurring EFP were suppressed dose-dependently upon addition of verapamil to the perfusate. At elevated K+ levels, the latencies to suppression were significantly reduced and the dose dependency was abolished for the two doses of verapamil used. Triggered EFP reappeared upon stimulation after spontaneously occurring EFP had been suppressed, except for trials with 60 mumol verapamil/l bath solution with elevated K+ levels. The stimulus-evoked EFP were abolished with continuing perfusion of verapamil except for trials with 40 mumol/l at normal extracellular K+ concentrations. This effect was again dose dependent and enhanced by elevating the K+ level. In all experiments, stimulus-evoked EFP reappeared upon wash-out of verapamil. A primary action of verapamil on pacemaker functions in epileptogenic tissue is assumed.",In-vitro-study,8,0
246,31852295,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",Fyn gene silencing reduces oligodendrocytes apoptosis through inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation in epilepsy.,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of Fyn gene silencing on the apoptosis of oligodendrocytes (OLs) in epileptic model in vitro and the involved mechanism. Primary oligodendrocyte pro-genitor cells (OPCs) were separated from rats and differentiated to OLs. Immunofluorescent labeling showed positive expression of A2B5 in OPCs and Olig2 in OLs, suggesting the successful separation of OPCs and OLs. Three Fyn siRNAs (si-Fyn) and Fyn siRNA negative control (NC) were transfected into OLs. Western blot showed that among three si-Fyn groups, si-Fyn3 caused the lowest Fyn expression, so si-Fyn3 was chosen for following experiment. Cells were divided into four groups: Control, Model, NC and si-Fyn. In the Model group, cells were cultured in Mg-free extracellular fluid for 3 h. The morphology of control cells was normal. However, the migration of neurons, the aggregation of cell bodies and the 'grid-like' changes of neural networks were observed in the model cells. OLs apoptosis in various groups was assessed by flow cytometry. Expression of Fyn, ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in OLs of various groups was evaluated by western blot. Compared with the Control group, the apoptotic rates, the Fyn expression and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 ratio in the Model and NC groups increased significantly (p < .05). However, the apoptotic rate, the Fyn expression and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 ratio in the si-Fyn group were remarkably smaller than those in the Model group (p < .05). In conclusion, Fyn gene silencing reduced the apoptosis of OLs through inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in epileptic model.",In-vitro-study,8,0
247,6472419,The New England journal of medicine,Inhibition of terminal axonal sprouting by serum from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"To investigate the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we compared the effect of serum from patients with this disease on the regenerative sprouting of terminal axons in botulinum-treated mouse gluteus muscle with the effects of serum from controls and from patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Serum from 9 of 19 patients with the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and from 2 of 6 patients with the familial form caused a reduction in the proportion of sprouting terminal axons, as compared with that found in muscles treated with serum from controls or diabetic patients. Immunoglobulin from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, when tested on immunoblots, recognized a 56-kilodalton protein secreted by denervated rat diaphragm muscle; rabbit antiserum raised against this protein also suppressed terminal axonal sprouting. Thus, we have detected an antibody in the serum of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that inhibits sprouting of neurons and subsequent reinnervation of skeletal muscle. Whether this antibody is of primary pathogenic importance or represents a secondary response to neuromuscular destruction is not known. In either case, serum from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may provide reagents for studies of the trophic communications between muscle and motor neurons.",In-vitro-study,8,0
248,30423818,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",miR-103/miR-195/miR-15b Regulate SALL4 and Inhibit Proliferation and Migration in Glioma.,"Glioma is the common highly malignant primary brain tumor. However, the molecular pathways that result in the pathogenesis of glioma remain elusive. In this study, we found that microRNA-103 (miR-103), microRNA-195 (miR-195), or microRNA-15b (miR-15b), which all have the same 5' 'seed' miRNA portion and share common binding sites in the SALL4 3'-untranslated region (UTR), were downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. These miRNAs suppressed glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, induced cell apoptosis, and decreased the level of the SALL4 protein, but not that of SALL4 mRNA, which was identified as a direct target of all three miRNAs. The caspase-3/7 activity expression in U251 cells overexpressing these miRNAs was rescued during SALL4 upregulation. An obvious inverse correlation was observed between SALL4 and miR-103 or miR-195 expression levels in clinical glioma samples. Moreover, enforced expression of SALL4 stimulated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, these data suggest that miR-103, miR-195, and miR-15b post-transcriptionally downregulated the expression of SALL4 and suppressed glioma cell growth, migration, and invasion, and increased cell apoptosis. These results provide a potential therapeutic target that may downregulate SALL4 in glioma.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Recently a tissue-specific and selective upregulation of the multidrug efflux transporter ABCB1 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the spinal cord of both patients and the mutant SOD1-G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that prevalently kills motor neurons has been reported. Here, we extended the analysis of P-gp expression in the SOD1-G93A ALS mouse model and found that P-gp upregulation was restricted to endothelial cells of the capillaries, while P-gp expression was not detected in other cells of the spinal cord parenchyma such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Using both in vitro human and mouse models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we found that mutant SOD1 astrocytes were driving P-gp upregulation in endothelial cells. In addition, a significant increase in reactive oxygen species production, Nrf2 and NFκB activation in endothelial cells exposed to mutant SOD1 astrocytes in both human and murine BBB models were observed. Most interestingly, astrocytes expressing FUS-H517Q, a different familial ALS-linked mutated gene, also drove NFκB-dependent upregulation of P-gp. However, the pathway was not dependent on oxidative stress but rather involved TNF-α release. Overall, these findings indicated that nuclear translocation of NFκB was a converging mechanism used by endothelial cells of the BBB to upregulate P-gp expression in mutant SOD1-linked ALS and possibly other forms of familial ALS.

Consequently, clinically applicable c-MET inhibitors have been developed. The purpose of this study was to investigate the not-well-known molecular determinants that predict responsiveness to c-MET inhibitors and to explore new strategies for improving inhibitor efficacy in brain tumors.	We investigated the molecular factors and pathway activation signatures that determine sensitivity to c-MET inhibitors in a panel of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells, glioblastoma stem cells, and established cell line-derived xenografts using functional assays, reverse protein microarrays, and in vivo tumor volume measurements, but validation with animal survival analyses remains to be done. We also explored new approaches for improving the efficacy of the inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.	We found that HGF coexpression is a key predictor of response to c-MET inhibition among the examined factors and identified an ERK/JAK/p53 pathway activation signature that differentiates c-MET inhibition in responsive and nonresponsive cells. Surprisingly, we also found that short pretreatment of cells and tumors with exogenous HGF moderately but statistically significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of c-MET inhibition. We observed a similar ligand-induced sensitization effect to an EGF receptor small-molecule kinase inhibitor.	These findings allow the identification of a subset of patients that will be responsive to c-MET inhibition and propose ligand pretreatment as a potential new strategy for improving the anticancer efficacy of RTK inhibitors.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Three of these cultures (from a 52-year-old man with vascular dementia, a 75-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease, and an 80-year-old normal woman) have been propagated to passage 12-14 and studied in detail. Cellular morphology was pleomorphic and consistent with a relatively low level of differentiation, by both light microscopic and ultrastructural examination. Immunocytochemical reactivity in a characteristic filamentous pattern was observed with monoclonal antibodies to nonphosphorylated epitopes of NF-H and NF-M as well as with redundant antibody probes specific for NF-H and NF-M. Immunoblotting studies confirmed the presence of NF-H and NF-M. Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting also demonstrated the presence of NSE, but not of glial fibrillary acidic protein or other glial markers. Immunocytochemical studies also indicated the presence of proline hydroxylase, an enzyme found in fibroblasts but not neurons.

252,7526192,Mutation research,Post-irradiation DNA synthesis inhibition and G2 phase delay in radiosensitive body cells from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients: an indication of cell cycle defects.,"In the present study, both post-irradiation DNA synthesis and G2 phase accumulation were analyzed in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and fibroblast cell strains derived from (Saudi) patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), ataxia telangiectasia (AT), AT heterozygotes and normal subjects. A comparison of the percent DNA synthesis inhibition (assayed by 3H-thymidine uptake 30 min after irradiation), and a 24 h post-irradiation G2 phase accumulation determined by flow cytometry placed the AT heterozygotes and the NHL patients in an intermediate position between the normal subjects (with maximum DNA synthesis inhibition and minimum G2 phase accumulation) and the AT homozygotes (with minimum DNA synthesis inhibition and maximum G2 accumulation). The similarity between AT heterozygotes and the NHL patients with respect to the two parameters studied after irradiation was statistically significant. The data indicating a moderate abnormality in the control of cell cycle progression after irradiation in the LCLs and fibroblasts from NHL patients may explain the enhanced cellular and chromosomal radiosensitivity in these patients reported by us earlier. In addition to demonstrating a link between cell cycle abnormality and radiosensitivity as a possible basis for cancer susceptibility, particularly in the NHL patients, the present studies emphasized the usefulness of the assay for 24 h post-irradiation G2 phase accumulation developed by Lavin et al.

We prepared monovalent, divalent, and trivalent 6-sulfo-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (6S-GlcNAc) immobilized substrates. The morphology and secondary structure of Abeta (1-42) aggregates on the substrates were investigated by dynamic-mode AFM and FTIR-RAS. Abeta (1-42) interactions with multivalent sugars were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance, and the cytotoxicity of Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Morphological images showed, interestingly, that Abeta (1-42) aggregates had a tendency to form globules rather than fibrils as the valency of 6S-GlcNAc on the substrate was increased. The SPR measurements indicated that this morphological change of Abeta (1-42) was related to the change of binding mode, and the binding mode was dependent on the multivalency of the sugar. Globular Abeta (1-42) was more toxic than fibrillar Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells.

254,23926278,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",Sera from patients with multifocal motor neuropathy disrupt the blood-nerve barrier.,"In multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), the destruction of the blood-nerve barrier (BNB) has been considered to be the key step in the disease process. The purpose of the present study was to ascertain whether sera from patients with MMN can open the BNB, and which component of patient sera is the most important for this disruption.	We evaluated the effects of sera from patients with MMN, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and control subjects on the expression of tight junction proteins and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and on the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) in human peripheral nerve microvascular endothelial cells (PnMECs).	The sera from patients with MMN decreased the claudin-5 protein expression and the TEER in PnMECs. However, this effect was reversed after application of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) neutralising antibody. The VEGF secreted by PnMECs was significantly increased after exposure to the sera from patients with MMN. The sera from patients with MMN also increased the VCAM-1 protein expression by upregulating the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signalling. The immunoglobulin G purified from MMN sera decreased the expression of claudin-5 and increased the VCAM-1 expression in PnMECs.	The sera from MMN patients may disrupt the BNB function via the autocrine secretion of VEGF in PnMECs, or the exposure to autoantibodies against PnMECs that are contained in the MMN sera. Autoantibodies against PnMECs in MMN sera may activate the BNB by upregulating the VCAM-1 expression, thereby allowing for the entry of a large number of circulating inflammatory cells into the peripheral nervous system.",In-vitro-study,8,0
255,18084303,Nature structural & molecular biology,Structural basis for synaptic adhesion mediated by neuroligin-neurexin interactions.,"The heterophilic synaptic adhesion molecules neuroligins and neurexins are essential for establishing and maintaining neuronal circuits by modulating the formation and maturation of synapses. The neuroligin-neurexin adhesion is Ca2+-dependent and regulated by alternative splicing. We report a structure of the complex at a resolution of 2.4 A between the mouse neuroligin-1 (NL1) cholinesterase-like domain and the mouse neurexin-1beta (NX1beta) LNS (laminin, neurexin and sex hormone-binding globulin-like) domain. The structure revealed a delicate neuroligin-neurexin assembly mediated by a hydrophilic, Ca2+-mediated and solvent-supplemented interface, rendering it capable of being modulated by alternative splicing and other regulatory factors. Thermodynamic data supported a mechanism wherein splicing site B of NL1 acts by modulating a salt bridge at the edge of the NL1-NX1beta interface. Mapping neuroligin mutations implicated in autism indicated that most such mutations are structurally destabilizing, supporting deficient neuroligin biosynthesis and processing as a common cause for this brain disorder.",In-vitro-study,8,0
256,37564014,The International journal of eating disorders,An intervention mapping adaptation framework to develop a self-help intervention for athletes with eating disorder symptoms.,"This research forum describes the use of the intervention mapping for adaptation (IMA) framework to develop and evaluate a novel intervention for athletes with mild eating disorder (ED) symptoms.	The six IMA steps were followed. In step 1 (needs assessment), we conducted a systematic review of athlete ED interventions and held interviews/focus groups with athletes and sports professionals to inform intervention format and delivery. In step 2 (intervention search), needs assessment information guided the search for an evidence-based intervention suitable for adaptation to athletes. In steps 3 and 4 (intervention development), the identified intervention was adapted and feedback sought from athletes and sport professionals. In steps 5 and 6 (implementation and evaluation), a feasibility study was conducted with athletes (n = 35; females: n = 27; Mage  = 27.1).	The review highlighted poor evidence for the acceptability and relative efficacy of existing interventions, which were all delivered face-to-face in groups. Interview/focus group data suggested a need for more accessible intervention formats (e.g., self-help). One non-athlete self-help intervention was determined suitable for adaptation to athletes, and adaptations were made. Initial feedback suggested the adapted intervention was relevant within sport settings. The feasibility study revealed that the intervention (MOPED-A: Motivational and Psycho-Educational Self-Help Programme for Athletes with Mild Eating Disorder Symptoms) can be feasibly implemented, is acceptable to athletes and shows potential for reducing ED symptoms.	IMA is a useful framework for developing participant-centered and evidence-based interventions. The findings and approach taken provide a framework for other researchers and clinicians in developing similar interventions in the ED domain.	The novel self-help intervention described in this article was developed using intervention mapping and provides promise as a tool for reducing eating disorder symptoms in athletes. We describe how adopting and systematically following a health intervention development approach, such as intervention mapping, can ensure that eating disorder interventions are participant-centered, contextually relevant, and evidence-based, which in turn could help to maximize their reach and effectiveness.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
257,23609463,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,Mind-body practices for posttraumatic stress disorder.,"Mind-body practices are increasingly used to provide stress reduction for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mind-body practice encompasses activities with the intent to use the mind to impact physical functioning and improve health.	This is a literature review using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress to identify the effects of mind-body intervention modalities, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, mindfulness-based stress reduction, meditation, and deep breathing, as interventions for PTSD.	The literature search identified 92 articles, only 16 of which were suitable for inclusion in this review. We reviewed only original, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies have small sample size, but findings from the 16 publications reviewed here suggest that mind-body practices are associated with positive impacts on PTSD symptoms. Mind-body practices incorporate numerous therapeutic effects on stress responses, including reductions in anxiety, depression, and anger, and increases in pain tolerance, self-esteem, energy levels, ability to relax, and ability to cope with stressful situations. In general, mind-body practices were found to be a viable intervention to improve the constellation of PTSD symptoms such as intrusive memories, avoidance, and increased emotional arousal.	Mind-body practices are increasingly used in the treatment of PTSD and are associated with positive impacts on stress-induced illnesses such as depression and PTSD in most existing studies. Knowledge about the diverse modalities of mind-body practices may provide clinicians and patients with the opportunity to explore an individualized and effective treatment plan enhanced by mind-body interventions as part of ongoing self-care.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

People with bulimia nervosa may be of normal weight, making it difficult to diagnose. After ten years, about half of people with bulimia nervosa will have recovered fully, a third will have made a partial recovery, and 10-20% will still have symptoms.	We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for bulimia nervosa in adults? What are the effects of discontinuing treatment in people with bulimia nervosa in remission? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to June 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).	We found 26 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.	In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy (alone or plus exposure response prevention enhancement); cognitive orientation therapy; dialectical behavioural therapy; discontinuing fluoxetine in people with remission; guided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy; hypnobehavioural therapy; interpersonal psychotherapy; mirtazapine; monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs); motivational enhancement therapy; pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy; pure or unguided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); reboxetine; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); topiramate; tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); and venlafaxine.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

We first compared the risks of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (IS/SE) and major bleeding associated with DOACs compared with warfarin, in NVAF Asians undergoing dialysis using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (Aim 1). Next, we searched PubMed and Medline from January 1, 2010 until January 31, 2020, to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational real-world studies comparing DOACs with warfarin specifically focused on NVAF patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis (Aim 2). Finally, we tested the hypothesis whether AF patients undergoing dialysis treated with OACs (warfarin and DOACs) would be associated with lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes as compared to those without OACs using the Taiwan NHIRD (Aim 3).	From June 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, a total of 3237 and 9263 NVAF patients comorbid with ESRD receiving oral anticoagulant (OACs) (490 on DOAC, 2747 on warfarin) or no OACs, respectively, were enrolled. Propensity score matching was used to balance covariates across the study groups. For the comparison of DOAC vs. warfarin (Aim 1), DOACs had comparable risks of IS/SE and major bleeding to warfarin in our present cohort. From the original 85 results retrieved, nine studies (including our study) with a total of 6490 and 22,494 patients treated with DOACs and warfarin were included in the meta-analysis, respectively. There were 5343 (82%) and 20,337 (90%) patients treated with DOACs and warfarin undergoing dialysis, respectively. The pooled meta-analysis also indicated no difference of the effectiveness (HR:0.90; [95%CI:0.74-1.10]; P = 0.32) and safety outcomes (HR:0.75; [95%CI:0.54-1.05]; P = 0.09) between DOACs and warfarin (Aim 2). For the comparison of OAC (+) vs. OAC (-) (Aim 3), OAC-treatment was associated with a higher risk of IS/SE (hazard ratio (HR):1.54; [95% confidential interval (CI):1.29-1.84];P < 0.0001) and comparable risk of major bleeding compared to those without OAC treatment.	DOACs did not provide benefit over warfarin regarding effectiveness and safety in AF patients undergoing dialysis. The use of OAC was not associated with a lower risk of IS/SE in ESRD AF patients when compared to those without OAC use.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

There is uncertainty about the prognostic value of EEG background activity after hypothermia was introduced.	Searches were made on Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to March 1, 2018. Pooled sensitivities and specificities were calculated to assess the diagnostic power of burst suppression, low voltage, and flat trace background activities in the prediction of an adverse neurological outcome in the follow-up period in hypothermia-treated neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. I[2] was used to assess heterogeneity, and meta-regression was done to explore the source of heterogeneity.	Eighteen studies with 940 neonates were included. Pooled sensitivities and specificities in predicting the combination of death and neurodevelopmental impairment were burst suppression (sensitivity 0.87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 0.93], specificity 0.60 [95% CI 0.44 to 0.74]), low voltage (sensitivity 0.84 [0.75 to 0.90], specificity 0.80 [0.58 to 0.92]), and flat trace (sensitivity 0.85 [0.75 to 0.92], specificity 0.94 [0.77 to 0.99]). Subgroup analysis revealed the sensitivities of background patterns obtained after 24 hours of life were higher than those within age 24 hours, whereas the specificities were just the reverse. Flat trace performed best on sensitivity 0.93 (0.60 to 0.99) and specificity 0.90 (0.64 to 0.98) in predicting death. Burst suppression demonstrated the highest sensitivity 0.87 (0.58 to 0.97) and flat trace performed best on specificity 0.85 (0.60 to 0.96) in predicting neurodevelopmental impairment.	EEG background activity is predictive of long-term neurological outcome in hypothermia-treated neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Burst suppression, low voltage, and flat trace are potential predictors of death or neurodevelopmental impairment.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

The search date ended in February 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by taking acupuncture as the main treatment for VMCI (nonvascular dementia) were collected. Results were measured using at least one internationally recognized evaluation cognitive scale. Two analysts selected the data independently. The assessment of methodological quality was based on the Cochrane Handbook and the data were analyzed by using RevMan 5.1.0 Software. The mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) were taken and graphed with 95% confidence interval (CI).	Recruited 12 RCTs included a total of 691 cases meeting the inclusion criteria (all of the methodological quality was of B level). Acupuncture combined other therapies was involved in 9 RCTs, with effect compared with that of other therapies. Results of meta-analysis showed, compared with the cognitive function training alone, electroacupuncture (MD 1.59, 95% CI 0.69-2.48, P = 0.0005, 3 studies) or body acupuncture (MD 3.26, 95% CI 1.69-4.83, P < 0.01, 1 study) combined with the cognitive function training could significantly increase the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of patients. In comparison to Western medicine, acupuncture could elevate ADAS-Cog score (MD 2.16, 95% CI 1.36-2.95, P < 0.01, 3 studies). In all the studies, adverse event had not been reported.	Acupuncture in combination with other therapies could significantly improve cognitive functions.

262,34389509,Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry,Remote Collaborative Care With Off-Site Behavioral Health Care Managers: A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials.,"In the United States, most patients who require behavioral health care do not receive it owing to an overall shortage of behavioral health specialists. The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is a team-based, highly-coordinated approach to treating common mental health conditions in primary care that has a robust evidence base. Several recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams. As telehealth technology advances and uptake expands, understanding the evidence for remote CoCM becomes increasingly crucial to inform CoCM practice and implementation.	The objective of this study was to systematically review randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams in treating common psychiatric conditions in primary care and medical settings.	Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to structure our review. Our search strategy and development of search terms was informed by knowledge and review of the CoCM literature. Articles were reviewed by 3 authors, and once selected, they were sent to 2 authors for further data extraction to describe various study characteristics and process measures relating to remote CoCM.	The literature search identified 13,211 articles, 9 of which met inclusion criteria. The 9 studies collectively demonstrate effectiveness of remote CoCM in treating a range of behavioral health conditions (depression [n = 7], anxiety [n = 2], and PTSD [n = 1]), across various populations and settings. Sample sizes ranged from 191 patients to 704 patients, publication dates from 2004 to 2018, and studies were conducted from 2000 to 2014. Various process measures were also reported.	As the 9 studies included in our systematic review demonstrate, remote CoCM can be effective in treating a range of behavioral health conditions in various primary care and specialty medical settings. These findings suggest organizations may have more flexibility in building their CoCM team and drawing upon wider workforces than previously recognized. As recent shifts in telehealth policy and practice continue to motivate telehealth approaches, further research that can inform best practices for remote CoCM will be useful and valuable to those making organizational decisions when implementing integrated care models.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
263,28797850,Journal of pain and symptom management,Advance Care Planning in Palliative Care for People With Intellectual Disabilities: A Systematic Review.,"Advance care planning (ACP) is defined as a person-centered, ongoing process of communication that facilitates patients' understanding, reflection, and discussion of goals, values, and preferences for future care. There is evidence for the general palliative care population that ACP increases compliance with patients' end-of-life preferences and improves quality of care near the end of life.	To gain insight into what is known about the use and effects of ACP in palliative care for people with intellectual disabilities (IDs).	Four databases were searched systematically: PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and CINAHL. A stepwise procedure was used to identify relevant studies based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement. The review included empirical quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies concerning people with ID who receive palliative care or who died non-acutely, and describing ACP. Methodological quality was graded using a critical appraisal tool.	A total of 14 studies were included. Most studies examined the perspective of professionals and/or relatives. None of the studies focused on the perspective of patients with ID. The studies concerned different elements of ACP, mainly decision-making and organizational policies. No effect studies were found. Obstructing factors were difficulties in recognizing palliative needs and uncertainties among relatives and professionals about their roles and tasks in ACP. Conducive factors were good working relationships between professionals and relatives.	There are some indications that ACP could be useful for people with ID, but more knowledge is needed about whether and how ACP should be used.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
264,17054228,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Massage and touch for dementia.,"Massage and touch have been suggested as a non-pharmacological alternative or supplement to other treatments offered in order to reduce or manage a range of conditions associated with dementia such as anxiety, agitated behaviour and depression. It has also been suggested that massage and touch may counteract cognitive decline.	To assess the effects of a range of massage and touch therapies on conditions associated with dementia, such as anxiety, agitated behaviour and depression, identify any adverse effects, and provide recommendations about future trials.	We identified trials from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 12 July 2005 using the terms massage, reflexology, touch and shiatsu. This Register contains records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. In addition, general and specific literature databases were searched and patient and therapist organizations contacted.	Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which a massage or touch intervention was given to persons suffering from dementia of any type, compared with other treatments or no treatment, and in which effect parameters included measures of behavioural problems, caregiver burden, emotional distress or cognitive abilities, were eligible for inclusion. Furthermore, we employed a set of minimal methodological quality criteria as a selection filter.	We identified 34 references in the initial searches. Of these, seven were actual or possible RCTs, but only two were found to meet the requirements of the set of minimal methodological criteria.	The very limited amount of reliable evidence available is in favour of massage and touch interventions for problems associated with dementia. However, this evidence addresses only two specific applications: hand massage for the immediate or short-term reduction of agitated behaviour, and the addition of touch to verbal encouragement to eat for the normalization of nutritional intake. The existing evidence does not support general conclusions about the effect or possible side effects of such interventions. No severe side effects were identified.	Massage and touch may serve as alternatives or complements to other therapies for the management of behavioural, emotional and perhaps other conditions associated with dementia. More research is needed, however, to provide definitive evidence about the benefits of these interventions.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
265,24746530,Comprehensive psychiatry,The Hypomania Checklist (HCL) - systematic review of its properties to screen for bipolar disorders.,"Bipolar disorders (BDs) are often not recognised with potentially drastic consequences for the individuals and their families. In clinical practice self-reports can be used to screen to enhance recognition. We therefore present a systematic review of the screening properties for the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32).	A systematic literature search was conducted to identify all relevant studies looking at the screening properties of the HCL-32 in adults.	Out of 196 papers 21 papers reported data on 22 independent samples. We narratively reviewed these studies. Weighted estimated Sensitivity was 80% regardless of whether a BD diagnosis was compared to unipolar depression or any other non-bipolar diagnosis. Specificity indicated that the HCL-32 was better when comparing BD to unipolar depression (65.3%) than to any other diagnostic category (57.3%). Fewer studies provided estimates for predictive powers, leading to less reliable overall estimates for these indicators.	Despite some limitations, using the HCL-32 as a first screening in patients seeking help for depression can be recommended, but should never be used on its own for diagnosing. Future research should examine whether screening properties can be improved by developing an algorithm incorporating the negative consequences reported for different areas in the HCL-32.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

We examined seven major journals in psychiatry from 1980 through 1990, inclusive, and selected those investigations of imipramine, trazodone, bupropion, and fluoxetine that met our minimal criteria for interpretability. These criteria included: (1) the presence of a placebo control, (2) double-blind status, (3) the use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression as a dependent variable measure, (4) the use of nongeriatric adults with a diagnosis of major depression by DSM or RDC standards, and (5) the presence of reported means and standard deviations in the investigation, or sufficient data that allowed such to be computed. Each study of four antidepressants was analyzed for an effect size of the drug investigated. The effect size allows for a determination of the efficacy of a particular drug as compared with placebo, measured in standard deviation units.	The data indicated that all four agents are effective as compared with placebo. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the newer heterocyclic agents are less effective than imipramine, as an ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference between the effect sizes of the four antidepressants.	These data are discussed in terms of characteristics of the various investigations and the need for further research comparing the efficacy of psychopharmacologic agents.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

If this is the case, one would expect that there is a relationship between the pattern of neuropsychological and magnetic resonance imaging deficits and that both may indicate cerebellar abnormalities.	To investigate the profiles of neuropsychological functions and the morphologic features of the cerebellum, using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging planimetry in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with radiation and chemotherapy.	Thirteen survivors of childhood ALL with onset at age 2 to 5 years and a uniform protocol of treatment involving cranial radiation of 24 Gy and five doses of intrathecal methotrexate sodium participated in the study. Ten controls matched the patients in age and socioeconomic status. Each child was assessed with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests and with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.	The neuropsychological scores were transformed into z scores and clustered into right and left hemisphere measures. Planimetric measures of the cerebellar vermis and pons were collected in the midsagittal plane.	Consistently observed in survivors of ALL were the following: (1) significant cognitive deficits in visual-spatial-motor coordination and figural memory, functions commonly related to the right side of the brain; and (2) hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, lobuli I through V and particularly VI to VII. Lateralization of the neurobehavioral deficits was not reflected in structural brain abnormalities.	Coexistence of the cerebellar hypoplasia and visual-motor coordination and memory deficits supports the neurodevelopmental approach to brain sequelae in survivors of ALL; it also suggests significance of the cerebellum for both motor and complex nonmotor cognitive processing.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

A Qualitative Study.,"The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the health service is increasing. In spite of limitations, such as lack of time and experience, the deployment of ICTs in the healthcare system has advantages which include patient satisfaction with secure messaging, and time saving benefits and utility for patients and health professionals. ICTs may be helpful as either interventions on their own or as complementary tools to help patients stop smoking.	To gather opinions from both medical professionals and smokers about an email-based application that had been designed by our research group to help smoking cessation, and identify the advantages and disadvantages associated with interventions based on the utilization of ICTs for this purpose.	A qualitative, descriptive-interpretative study with a phenomenological perspective was performed to identify and interpret the discourses of the participating smokers and primary healthcare professionals. Data were obtained through two techniques: semi-structured individual interviews and discussion groups, which were recorded and later systematically and literally transcribed together with the interviewer's notes. Data were analyzed with the ATLAS TI 6.0 programme.	Seven individual interviews and four focal groups were conducted. The advantages of the application based on the email intervention designed by our research group were said to be the saving of time in consultations and ease of access for patients who found work timetables and following a programme for smoking cessation incompatible. The disadvantages were thought to be a lack of personal contact with the healthcare professional, and the possibility of cheating/ self-deception, and a greater probability of relapse on the part of the smokers.	Both patients and healthcare professionals viewed the email-based application to help patients stop smoking as a complementary aid to face-to-face consultations.

In recent years, with the continuous improvement of the neural intervention technology, fractionated transcatheter arterial embolization (fTAE) may be used to treat the fAVM instead of surgical treatment. However, its effectiveness for treating fAVM has never been explored. The authors hypothesized that fTAE can be effective in the treatment of fTAE.	A retrospective study was conducted in 229 cases of large fAVM in multicenter hospitals. Among them, 103 cases were performed fTAE and the other 126 cases were carried on minimally invasive craniotomy (MIC). Clinically relevant symptomatic improvement and complications were compared between 2 groups.	Complete resection rate of arteriovenous malformation in MIC group (100%) was significantly higher than that of complete embolization rate in fTAE group (77.7%) (P = 0.000). However, the incidence of postoperative complications includes decreased limb muscle strength (P = 0.001), sensory loss of extremities (P = 0.003), visual field defect (P = 0.025) that were lower in fTAE group and remission rate of headache (P = 0.012) but not epilepsy (P = 0.952) was higher in fTAE group compared with that in MIC group. After 1 year follow-up, the rebleeding rate in the fTAE treatment group was 4.85%, higher than that in MIC group (0%) (P = 0.000).

Both case 1 (41-year-old man) and case 2 (34-year-old man) showed no abnormal findings in head and cervical X-ray, CT-scan and MRI. Only radionuclide cisternography (RNC) showed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak into epidural space at thoracolumbar level. Three months (case 1) and four years (case 2) had passed after each accident. Two patients underwent epidural blood patch (EBP) for total of three times. The average volumes of the blood used for EBP were 30 ml (case 1) and 24 ml (case 2). The procedure improved various symptoms except for neck stiffness and dizziness. EBP had led to low back pain, which disappeared within three days. CSF leak vanished in RNC after EBP. Severe complication, for example epidural infection or neurological disorders due to hematoma, was not noticed. While neural blockade did not relieve pain before EBP, we could get good effect from neural blockade for remaining symptoms after EBP. We consider that Barrè-Lièou syndrome is due to CSF leak and EBP may be one of the useful treatments.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

CG received routine nursing, while EG received the comfortable intervention-based nursing mode under the quality nursing intervention combined with Internet mobile health to compare the clinical indexes between the two groups.	Compared with CG, EG after intervention achieved obviously higher SS-QOL, ESCA, and GCQ scores (P < 0.001), and lower MSSNS and NIHSS scores (P < 0.001).	The application of the comfortable intervention-based nursing mode under the quality nursing intervention combined with Internet mobile health effectively improves QOL and alleviates the negative emotions of patients. Compared with routine nursing, this model has higher application value, and further research of the joint intervention will help build better a solution for patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

This study investigates whether IMRS can be an adequate dosimetric alternative to DCARS for cranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).	Forty-five SRS procedures for solitary brain metastasis (range: 0.44-29.18 cm 3) performed at our institution were selected for this study. Two plans were generated per patient: One IMRS plan using a multileaf collimation (MLC) of 5 mm, and one DCARS plan designed with a 3 mm micro-MLC. Dosimetric comparison metrics include the target coverage (Cov), conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gradient index (GI), and volume of the normal brain tissue receiving ≥12 Gy (V12). In addition, maximum doses to organs at risk (OAR) (brainstem, optic apparatus and cochlea) were compared for both techniques.	Compared to DCARS, IMRS improved mean CI (IMRS: 0.81 vs.	0.63, P < 0.001), with no significant difference in target Cov (IMRS: 0.99 vs.	0.99, P > 0.05), HI (IMRS: 1.22 vs.	1.24, P > 0.05), GI (IMRS: 5.44 vs.	5.44, P > 0.05). A weak significant difference in V12 (IMRS: 4.6 cm 3 vs. 5.2 cm 3, P = 0.033) was obtained. Subgroup analysis per target volume (small: <1 cm 3, intermediate: ≤1 cm 3 and <5 cm 3 and large: ≥5 cm 3) only revealed the statistically difference for CI metric (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found for maximum dose to the OAR.	We have shown that IMRS provides the dosimetric advantages compared with DCARS. Based on the dosimetric findings in this study, fixed gantry IMRS technique can be adopted as a standard procedure for cranial SRS when micro-MLC technology is not available on the linear accelerator.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
276,37199161,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology","Life's Essential 8, Genetic Susceptibility, and Incident Cardiovascular Disease: A Prospective Study.","The American Heart Association recently released a new cardiovascular health (CVH) metric, Life's Essential 8 (LE8), for health promotion. However, the association between levels of LE8 and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes is not known from a large prospective cohort. We aim to analyze the relationship between CVH, indicated by LE8, and risks of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD. Moreover, we sought to test whether the genetic susceptibility to CHD or stroke could be modified by LE8.	A total of 137 794 participants free of CVD from the UK Biobank were included. CVH was scored using LE8 and categorized as low, moderate, and high.	During a median of 10 years, 8595 CVD cases (6968 CHDs and 1948 strokes) were documented. A higher LE8 score was associated with remarkably lower risks of CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). Comparing the high CVH to the low CVH, the hazard ratios (95% CI) were 0.34 (0.30-0.38) for CHD, 0.45 (0.37-0.54) for stroke, and 0.36 (0.33-0.40) for CVD. Moreover, the model with LE8 achieved higher accuracy and outperformed the model with Life's Simple 7 for CHD, stroke, and CVD (P<0.001 for all). The protective associations of the LE8 score with CVD outcomes were more pronounced among women (P interaction, <0.001 for CHD and 0.0013 for CVD, respectively) and among younger adults (P interaction, <0.001, 0.007, and <0.001 for CHD, stroke, and CVD, respectively). In addition, a significant interaction was found between the genetic risk of CHD and the LE8 score (P interaction, <0.001). The inverse association was stronger among those with a lower genetic risk of CHD.	High level of CVH, defined by LE8, was associated with significantly lower risks of CHD, stroke, and CVD.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

279,24714669,PloS one,Disturbed small-world networks and neurocognitive function in frontal lobe low-grade glioma patients.,"Brain tumor patients often associated with losses of the small-world configuration and neurocognitive functions before operations. However, few studies were performed on the impairments of frontal lobe low-grade gliomas (LGG) after tumor resection using small-world network features.	To detect differences in the whole brain topology among LGG patients before and after operation, a combined study of neurocognitive assessment and graph theoretical network analysis of fMRI data was performed. We collected resting-state fMRI data of 12 carefully selected frontal lobe LGG patients before and after operation. We calculated the topological properties of brain functional networks in the 12 LGG, and compared with 12 healthy controls (HCs). We also applied Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a subset of patients (n = 12, including before and after operation groups) and HCs (n = 12). The resulting functional connectivity matrices were constructed for all 12 patients, and binary network analysis was performed. In the range of 0.05 ≤ Kcos t ≤ 0.35, the functional networks in preoperative LGG and postoperative one both fitted the definition of small-worldness. We proposed Knet = 0.20 as small-world network interval, and the results showed that the topological properties were found to be disrupted in the two LGG groups, meanwhile the global efficiency increased and the local efficiency decreased. Lnet in the two LGG groups both were longer than HCs. Cnet in the LGG groups were smaller than HCs. Compared with the Hcs, MoCA in the two LGG groups were lower than HCs with significant difference, and the disturbed networks in the LGG were negatively related to worse MoCA scores.	Disturbed small-worldness preperty in the two LGG groups was found and widely spread in the strength and spatial organization of brain networks, and the alterated small-world network may be responsible for cognitive dysfunction in frontal lobe LGG patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
280,25069902,Disability and rehabilitation. Assistive technology,Evaluation of the performance of paraplegic subjects during walking with a new design of reciprocal gait orthosis.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) influences a person's ability to stand and walk. Various orthoses have been developed to solve these standing and walking problems, however, patients still experience high energy consumption during walking and high forces on the upper limbs. A new reciprocal gait orthosis (RGO) was designed to address these problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the new orthosis design with paraplegic subjects.	Three paraplegic subjects with the lesion at level T12 and three able-bodied subjects were included in this study. Hip and pelvis range of motion and vertical ground reaction force were evaluated using the Qualysis motion analyzer system and a Kistler force plate. Energy consumption was measured with the Polar heart rate monitoring system. The differences between SCI individuals when walking with a Knee Ankle Foot Orthosis (KAFO) and the new RGO, and the differences between able-bodied and paraplegic subjects were evaluated by the use of paired sample and two sample t test, respectively.	The results showed that energy consumption and gait analysis outcomes with new RGO orthosis were better than the KAFO. However, there was a large difference between paraplegic and able-bodied subjects while walking with the new orthosis.	The new RGO design performed better than a KAFO in terms of energy consumption, walking style and vertical ground reaction force. Therefore, it appears that RGO may be a useful orthosis for patients with paraplegia. Implications for Rehabilitation Walking and standing of the subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI) improve their physiological and physiological health. This study introduces a new type of orthosis design in order to improve the abilities of SCI subjects during walking and standing. It seems that the new design works better than available orthoses (KAFO).",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Five patients were given the regular hospital diet and low calcium diet (300 mg calcium/day diet) on a randomized cross-over design. The other five patients were given four treatment modalities: a. regular diet, b. low calcium diet, c. low sodium diet (2 gm sodium/day diet), d. low calcium diet plus hydrochlorthiazide 25 mg twice a day according to a cross-over randomized block design. Each treatment regimen lasted two weeks and 24-hour urinary calcium concentrations were determined weekly. The result indicated that low calcium diet, low sodium diet or low calcium diet plus hydrochlorthiazide reduced hypercalciuria significantly (P less than 0.01). Low calcium diet combined with hydrochlorthiazide was the most effective treatment for hypercalciuria. In retrospective studies, we found that recently injured patients developed hypercalciuria, however, there was no significant difference in the incidence of bladder stone formation in patients with hypercalciuria compared with those with normal urinary calcium excretion.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
282,30539767,Schizophrenia research,Hippocampal volume and vasculature before and after exercise in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is associated with poor cognitive function and elevated cardiometabolic disease risk. These health concerns may exacerbate neurocognitive dysfunction associated with hippocampal abnormalities, particularly hippocampal volume reductions. Regular exercise is thought to improve symptom severity, reduce depression, and improve cognition in schizophrenia, and may trigger exercise-mediated hippocampal growth. The potential for the benefits of exercise for treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients has not been clearly assessed. This study aims to assess the effect of exercise on hippocampal plasticity and clinical outcomes in chronic schizophrenia.	Seventeen DSM-IV criteria schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients completed a customized moderate intensity 12-week aerobic or weight-bearing exercise program. Adherence rates were 83% ± 9.4%) with 70% of participants completing the entire exercise program. Concomitant neuroimaging, clinical and cognitive assessments were obtained at baseline and 12-weeks.	At follow-up, symptom severity scores (t(16) = -16.8, p. ≤ 0.0001) and social functioning (t(16) = 4.4, p. = 0.0004) improved. A trend for improved depression scores (t(16) = -2.0, p. = 0.06) with no change in anxiety, or extrapyramidal symptoms were seen. Hippocampal volume increased (t(16) = -2.54, p. = 0.02), specifically in the left CA-1 field (F(16) = -2.33, p. = 0.03). Hippocampal vascular volume was unchanged. Change in hippocampal volume and vascular volume was not significantly correlated with change in symptom severity or affect scores.	Adjunct exercise may accelerate symptom improvement in treatment-resistant psychosis patients. While the underlying mechanism remains unclear, these results indicate that chronic schizophrenia patients experience hippocampal plasticity in response to exercise.

283,31230602,Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy,Patterns and temporal precedence of symptom change during cognitive processing therapy for military sexual trauma-related posttraumatic stress disorder.,"Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including for veterans with military sexual trauma (MST)-related PTSD. Most CPT research to date has focused on pre- to post-treatment change in total PTSD symptoms; however, PTSD symptom criteria may not change equivalently over the course of treatment. For example, changes in re-experiencing symptoms have been shown to precede changes in other PTSD criteria during other PTSD treatments (i.e. virtual reality exposure therapy, venlafaxine ER). An improved understanding of the mechanism of change in PTSD symptoms during CPT may assist in optimizing treatment.	The purpose of this study was to identify the pattern and temporal precedence of change in PTSD symptom criteria during and after CPT using cross-lagged panel analyses.	Data from veterans (n = 32) enrolled in a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of CPT for MST-related PTSD were utilized for this secondary analysis. Using hierarchical linear modelling, each symptom criterion was entered as a predictor of subsequent change in the other PTSD symptom criteria.	All symptom criteria followed a logarithmic pattern of change. Hyperarousal symptoms were found to both predict and temporally precede change in avoidance symptoms, but not re-experiencing symptoms. Re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms did not predict change in other PTSD symptom criteria.	These findings provide initial support that targeting and reducing hyperarousal symptoms may be a key component of PTSD intervention with CPT. Additional research is needed to identify factors that predict change in PTSD-related re-experiencing symptoms.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a reasonable alternative for inoperable or high-risk lesions requiring treatment. Few series evaluate overall results that include data from both modalities as they more often focus on their treatment method of choice. In this study, we evaluated our AVM database of 129 patients seen over the past eight years at our institution: 73 were treated with microsurgery (57%) while 37 (29%) were treated with SRS. We reviewed angiographic obliteration rates, complication rates, and outcome data, excluding seven patients treated with SRS as they did not have at least two years of angiographic follow-up. Patients undergoing microsurgery had smaller AVM (mean 2.2 cm compared to 3.5 cm for SRS), a smaller proportion of eloquent AVM (53% compared to 83% for SRS), a greater proportion of AVM with superficial drainage only (75% compared to 40% for SRS), and more grade 1 and 2 AVM (78% compared to 17% for SRS). The overall obliteration rate was 80%: 92% for microsurgery and 50% for SRS. The latter increased to 92% for AVM <3 cm, but the obliteration rate was 18% for those AVM >3 cm. Transient complications, including post-SRS hemorrhage, were seen in 11% of patients overall (8% after microsurgery, 17% after SRS). At follow-up, 53% of patients had improved, 37% remained the same, 7% had become worse and 3% had died. As a result of post-SRS hemorrhage, a greater proportion of patients was worse or had died after SRS (20%) compared to those who had been treated with microsurgery (5%).",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Between 1988 and 2006, 133 subjects underwent modified superficial vestibulectomies. At 4 time intervals, portions of the expanding cohort were queried with a mailed questionnaire. Results were compared to the clinical findings. Questionnaires had closed questions, ranked and non-ranked, as well as open questions and visual analogue scales. Percentages were calculated by SPSS statistical software.	A total of 119 women (89%) returned questionnaires, allowing a mean follow-up interval of 2.8 years; 68% reported that dyspareunia was cured completely, and for 24% it was lessened. Twenty-two percent said they perceived a different pain after surgery, many identifying it as muscular. Eighty-seven percent said they would have the procedure again. Qualitative responses revealed the importance of physical therapy, the complexities of pain issues, the toll on emotions and relationships and suggestions for more education of health practitioners and women generally about this entity.	A large majority of women who underwent superficial vestibule surgery for vestibulodynia found it quite acceptable and instrumental in treating dyspareunia. Many wished they had had it sooner. Individualized, superficial surgery is very effective and should not be withheld if short-term medical and physical therapy have proven to be incomplete therapies.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The overall survival rate was 71% (17/24). Temporary neurological dysfunction was found in 3 (12.5%), and permanent neurological dysfunction in 9 (37.5%), leading to death in 3. Comparison of mortality rates and neurological outcome showed a marked tendency towards better outcome in patients who had hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. Surgery for aortic dissections in the elderly can be performed with acceptable mortality, but there is a high rate of neurological complications.

The authors analyzed data obtained from the McGill Rhizotomy Database to determine the long-term impact of lumbosacral dorsal rhizotomy on fine motor skills. The study population comprised children with debilitating spasticity who underwent SPR and were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team preoperatively, at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Quantitative standardized assessments of upper extremity function were obtained using the fine motor skills section of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDMS) test. Of 70 patients who met the entry criteria for the study, 45 and 25 completed the 3- and 5-year assessments, respectively. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant improvements in grasping, hand use, eye-hand coordination, and manual dexterity at 1 year after SPR. More importantly, all improvements were maintained at 3 and 5 years following SPR. This study supports that significant improvements in upper extremity fine motor function using the PDMS evaluative measure are present after SPR and that these suprasegmental benefits are durable.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

This pilot study is aimed at obtaining preliminary data of the effects of two different exercise programs on gait parameters in people with PD by means of a biomechanical three-dimensional motion analysis. Twenty-five individuals with idiopathic PD participated either in a land-based (LB) or in a LB plus water-based (LWB) exercise program for 16 weeks. The efficacy of both exercise programs was quantified by means of a biomechanical gait analysis from which spatiotemporal and sagittal plane kinetic (gait speed, stride length, cadence, stride time, simple support time, double support time) and kinematic (angles of the hip, knee, and ankle joints) variables were recorded. Once the intervention ended, significant changes were observed in stride length and single/double support time variables in all the patients. The intergroup analysis revealed the existence of significant differences only in the gait Speed and hip Angle parameters. Few significant improvements in the amplitude of lower limb joints were found. These results suggest that land-based and land-plus-water-based exercise programs can be considered as a useful physical rehabilitation alternative, both equally capable of improving gait impairment on Parkinson's disease.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
292,28707407,Psychology and psychotherapy,"Symptom fluctuations, self-esteem, and cohesion during group cognitive behaviour therapy for early psychosis.","Group cohesion has been linked to positive changes in self-esteem and in symptoms during group psychotherapy in people with psychosis. These changes may be linked to changes in symptoms as fluctuations in self-esteem have been linked to symptom fluctuations.	We aimed to determine the relationship between these three factors - group cohesion, self-esteem, and symptoms - during group cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (GCBTp). We hypothesized that group cohesion would precede changes in symptoms and self-esteem and that improvements in self-esteem would precede improvements in symptoms.	This is an uncontrolled longitudinal study recruiting from a convenience sample within two early psychosis clinics.	Sixty-six individuals from first episode of psychosis treatment programmes participated in this study and received 24 sessions of a validated GCBTp protocol. Participants answered a brief questionnaire at the end of each session, measuring their group cohesion, self-esteem, and perception of their symptoms as worse, same, or better than usual.	Orthogonal polynomial contrasts for time effects were estimated with a mixed model for repeated measures with a random cluster effect and revealed a quartic trend regarding changes in symptoms over the 24 sessions. Self-esteem, symptoms, and group cohesion were strongly linked during a given session. Also, self-esteem changes predicted changes in symptoms up to two sessions later, and symptoms changes predicted self-esteem changes at the next session. Group cohesion preceded improvements in both self-esteem and symptoms; self-esteem also predicted improvements in group cohesion.	These results suggest that self-esteem and symptoms influence each other during therapy, with improvements in one leading to improvements in the other. Group cohesion also appears to be an essential prerequisite to positive changes in self-esteem and symptoms during GCBTp.	This study emphasizes the interrelation between self-esteem improvements and symptom improvements, with improvements in one leading to improvements in the other, during group CBT for psychosis. Group cohesion, in this study, is a predictor of self-esteem and symptom improvements, suggesting that a special attention should be given to developing a strong alliance and group cohesion early on during CBT for psychosis.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
293,8361572,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,[Two cases of metastatic brain tumor treated by interstitial brachytherapy].,"The prognosis of patients with metastatic brain tumor is very poor. Median survival of these patients has ranged from 1 month with no therapy, to 2 months with steroid, and from 3 to 6 months with brain radiation therapy of the whole brain. A more recent study comparing radiation therapy alone with surgery plus radiation, has shown good results in the combined surgery and radiation therapy group. But surgical excision is usually limited to patients with a surgically accessible solitary metastasis. And therapeutic options are limited once the tumor recurs locally after whole brain irradiation. Interstitial irradiation allows the delivery of a high dose of localized irradiation in the area of tumor recurrence with minimal risk of radiation damage to the surrounding brain tissue. But brachytherapy for brain metastasis has been performed in few cases. We reported two patients with unresectable metastatic brain tumors who were successfully treated with iridium-192 interstitial brachytherapy, and we discuss the strategy of the treatment. Case 1: A 78 year-old-man underwent a total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Five months after surgery, he developed right hemiparesis. CT scan revealed a left occipital tumor with massive brain edema and a tiny nodule of tumor in the left thalamic region. The primary site was well-controlled and no systemic disease was seen during subsequent whole body examination. The occipital lesion was surgically excised and he received a postoperative radiation therapy of 50 Gy to the whole brain. The thalamic tumor had not responded to the irradiation and the size of tumor rapidly increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Treatment with stents may be an effective method to treat VADA involving the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and dissection of the dominant vertebral artery (VA). In this article, our personal experience of the treatment of VADAs by using stents and coils is reported.	Since 1998, 26 cases of VADA have been treated by endovascular surgery by the first author. Of these cases, 6 cases were treated using stents, 3 of which were treated using stent and coils, 2 patients were treated using double overlapping stents, and the remaining one patient was treated using a single stent.	In all patients, dissection aneurysms were successfully covered by stents. There was one complication: an intraprocedural rupture during additional coil insertion without neurological deterioration. Follow-up angiography was performed in all 5 surviving patients except for one patient who died due to the severity of his original subarachnoid hemorrhage (mean duration of follow-up angiography 22.8 months, range 15-57 months). Total or subtotal disappearance of the VADA was achieved in all 5 cases. At one year after the treatment, all 5 surviving patients remained clinically stable without any neurological deficit.

295,32810378,Brain and behavior,Efficacy and safety profile of neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation combined with intraventricular lavage in severe intraventricular hemorrhage patients.,"The present study was conducted to explore the effect of neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation in severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).	Totally 81 patients with severe IVH in our hospital from November 2017 to March 2019 were divided into the intervention group (38 cases who received neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation combined with intraventricular lavage) and the control group (40 cases who received trepanation drainage). The perioperative condition, hematoma clearance rate, Glasgow coma score (GCS), hematoma recurrence rate, and prognosis were observed and compared between the two groups after treatment.	The operative time, time of cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and intracranial infection rate in the intervention group elicited superior results to those in the control group (p < .05). The clearance rate of hematoma in the intervention group was higher than that in the control group at 6 hr, 1, 3, and 7 days postoperatively (p < .05). The postoperative 3- and 7-day GCS scores in the intervention group were higher than those in the control group, and the recurrence rate of hematoma in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < .05), and the good/excellent rate of ADL in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p < .05).	Neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation combined with intraventricular lavage showed evident beneficial outcomes in patients with severe IVH. It can effectively improve the perioperative condition and improve the hematoma clearance rate and is beneficial to the prognosis of patients with severe IVH.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
296,28783147,Bone marrow transplantation,Marrow-ablative chemotherapy followed by tandem autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in pediatric patients with malignant brain tumors.,"To improve survival in young children with malignant brain tumors, irradiation-avoiding or -minimizing marrow-ablative chemotherapy (HDCx) with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AuHCT) has been investigated. We evaluated the outcome of 44 children with malignant brain tumors treated with HDCx and tandem AuHCT at Children's Hospital Los Angeles between June 1999 and July 2012. Forty-four children with malignant brain tumors were studied. Twenty-one had medulloblastoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor, eight atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), five high-grade glioma, four malignant germ cell tumor, three ependymoma and three choroid plexus carcinoma. Twenty-nine patients received three tandem transplants and 15 received two tandem transplants, respectively. The 5-year PFS and overall survivals (OS) for all patients were 46.3±8.2% and 51.7±8.5%, respectively. The PFS and OS for 27 newly diagnosed patients were 68.9±9.9% and 73.5±9.3%, respectively, compared with 17 transplanted at relapse 11.8±9.8% (P<0.001) and 15.1±12.3% (P=0.0231), respectively. The 5-year PFS and OS in 13 previously unirradiated patients were 74±13% and 74±13% versus 33.2±9.8% and 40.2±10.6% in 31 irradiated patients (P=0.11 and P=0.239), respectively. One patient died of transplant-related toxicity. HDCx with tandem AuHCT is feasible and safe in children with malignant brain tumors with encouraging irradiation-free survival in newly diagnosed children.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
297,21107143,Journal of psychiatric practice,Light therapy for seasonal affective disorder in a clinical office setting.,"To determine predictors of response to light therapy (LT) for seasonal affective disorder, winter version, in a clinical office setting for patients with a spectrum of seasonality defined by the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ).	A retrospective review was done of charts of 51 patients who had been treated with a 1-week light therapy intervention. Patient self-rated scales applied in a standard manner were used to measure clinical progress. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) with added atypical features was used as the primary outcome variable. Sleep patterns were analyzed and the effect of psychotropic medications on outcome was determined. Seven point scales were used to assess expected response and global response. The importance of having LT set up and available in an office setting was evaluated. Retrospective degree of disability was measured based on the SPAQ degree of problem. The severity of the depressive episode was determined based on BDI score at entry.	Seasonality (how a patient's symptoms vary as a function of the season of the year), degree of disability based on the SPAQ, and severity of depressive episode at entry based on the BDI predicted response to LT. Greater severity at baseline based on BDI score predicted less chance of attaining full remission within 7 days of treatment compared with patients with lower severity scores at entry on the BDI. Sleep patterns relative to a fixed treatment time of 7 AM did not predict LT response. Light therapy was effective on its own, and the results were mixed as to whether adding LT to an existing antidepressant medication produced superior results.	Degree of seasonality can be used as a predictor of response to LT and may be clinically useful when suggesting that patients consider a trial of LT.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The present series included 39 children (3-17 years of age) who underwent GKS for cerebral AVMs between January 2002 and February 2008. Twenty-five patients presented with hemorrhages. The median AVM volume was 1.5 cm³, and the median marginal dose was 20 Gy. All patients continued to have follow-up for more than 24 months with serial magnetic resonance images (MRIs)/angiograms. Current school performance has been evaluated using a telephone survey answered by the patients' parents.	Follow-up angiograms, available in 34 patients, confirmed complete obliteration in 16 patients. Serial MRIs indicated obliteration of the nidus in one of five patients without angiography. The diffuse nidus structure and low marginal dose were significantly associated with incomplete obliteration. Twelve patients underwent a second GKS, and subsequent angiographies, available in six patients, demonstrated complete obliteration in two of them. Complications included new-onset seizures (n = 1), apraxia (n = 1), and temporal horn entrapment requiring a shunt operation (n = 1). School performance declined in 14 out of 32 patients. Both the AVM volume and modified AVM score were found to be reliable predictors of school performance.	The results of the present study substantiate the diffuse and other atypical features of pediatric AVMs as major determinants of treatment failure following GKS. Considering the apparent declination of school performance, future prospective studies would be required to investigate the possible late-effects of GKS on neuropsychological function.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
299,20074673,International immunopharmacology,The anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects of NF-kappaB inhibitory guanidine derivative ME10092.,"The guanidine compound ME10092 (1-(3,4-dimethoxy-2-chlorobenzylideneamino)-guanidine) is known to possess anti-radical and anti-ischemic activity but its molecular targets have not been identified. This study investigated whether ME10092 regulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)-mediated signal transduction in vivo. The effect of ME10092 treatment (1-100 pmol/mouse) on nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, activation of expression of inflammatory mediators and production of nitric oxide were measured in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced brain inflammation model in mice in vivo. The antinociceptive activity of ME10092 was tested in the formalin-induced paw licking test. ME10092 dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, transcription of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements showed that ME10092 inhibited the LPS-induced increase in nitric oxide content in mouse brain tissue in a dose-dependent manner. In the formalin-induced paw licking test, ME10092 (at the dose of 3mg/kg, p.o. twice daily for eight days) significantly reduced nociceptive response. In conclusion, above results indicate that ME10092 inhibits NF-kappaB activation and suppresses the up-regulation of inflammatory mediators in experimental models in vivo.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
300,32093571,Nutritional neuroscience,Piperine mitigates behavioral impairments and provides neuroprotection against 3-nitropropinoic acid-induced Huntington disease-like symptoms.,"Background: Piperine (PIP) is a powerful anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory alkaloid which has been widely used in the treatment of various pathological conditions. However, few studies have clearly discussed the protective effects and potential mechanism of PIP in different neurological diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of PIP against 3-nitropropioninc acid (3-NP) induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in animals.Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered control group, received normal saline (p.o.). Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg.b.wt., i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received PIP (10 mg/kg.b.wt., p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP injection. Upon termination of treatment schedule, behavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes. The brain striatal tissue was used for the estimation of monoamine oxidase activity and serotonin level. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by GFAP immunostaining.Results: Our results showed that 3-NP induced behavioral impairments are attenuated by PIP co-treatment. Next, the extent of neuronal loss and astrocytes activation was reduced in the striatal brain region in PIP treated rats. Finally, it was observed that PIP alleviated the behavioral, biochemical, immunohistochemical and histological alterations.Conclusion: The results of the current study reveal the neuroprotective competency of PIP against Huntington disease like symptoms in rats.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The VEEV-neutralizing, protective murine mAb 3B4C-4 was humanized using combinatorial antibody libraries and phage-display technology. Humanized VEEV-binding Fabs were evaluated for virus-neutralizing capacity, then selected Fabs were converted to whole immunoglobulin (Ig) G1, and stable cell lines were generated. The humanized mAb Hy4-26C, designated Hy4 IgG, had virus-neutralizing capacity similar to that of 3B4C-4. Passive antibody protection studies with purified Hy4 IgG were performed in adult Swiss Webster mice. As little as 100 ng Hy4 IgG protected 90 % of mice challenged with 100 intraperitoneal (i.p.) mean morbidity (MD(50)) doses of virulent VEEV (Trinidad donkey) 24 h after antibody transfer; also, 500 mug Hy4 IgG protected 80 % of mice inoculated with 100 intranasal MD(50) doses of VEEV. Moreover, 10 mug passive Hy4 IgG protected 70 % of mice from a VEEV challenge dose as great as 10(7) i.p. MD(50). Hy4 IgG also protected mice from challenge with another epizootic VEEV variety, 1C (P676). Importantly, therapeutic administration of the humanized mAb to mice already infected with VEEV cured 90 % of mice treated with Hy4 IgG within 1 h of VEEV inoculation and 75 % of mice treated 24 h after virus infection.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

303,20598917,Seizure,Baccoside A suppresses epileptic-like seizure/convulsion in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"The 1 mm long Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the prime research tools to study different human neurodegenerative diseases. We have considered the case in which increase in the surrounding temperature of this multicellular model leads to abnormal bursts of neuronal cells that can be linked to seizure or convulsion. The induction of such seizure/convulsion mechanism was done by gradually increasing the temperature with 1x buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl(2)) in adult C. elegans. In the present experiment it is demonstrated that Baccoside A can significantly reduce the seizure/convulsion in C. elegans at higher temperatures (26-28+/-1 degrees C). Furthermore, in T-type Ca(2+) channel cca-1 mutant worms, no convulsion was recorded. Our experimental results suggest that plant molecules from Bacopa monnieri may be useful in suppressing the seizure/convulsion in worms.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
304,34207317,Biomolecules,Pharmacokinetics and Molecular Modeling Indicate nAChRα4-Derived Peptide HAEE Goes through the Blood-Brain Barrier.,"One of the treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on the use of pharmacological agents capable of binding to beta-amyloid (Aβ) and blocking its aggregation in the brain. Previously, we found that intravenous administration of the synthetic tetrapeptide Acetyl-His-Ala-Glu-Glu-Amide (HAEE), which is an analogue of the 35-38 region of the α4 subunit of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and specifically binds to the 11-14 site of Aβ, reduced the development of cerebral amyloidogenesis in a mouse model of AD. In the current study on three types of laboratory animals, we determined the biodistribution and tissue localization patterns of HAEE peptide after single intravenous bolus administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters of HAEE were established using uniformly tritium-labeled HAEE. Pharmacokinetic data provided evidence that HAEE goes through the blood-brain barrier. Based on molecular modeling, a role of LRP1 in receptor-mediated transcytosis of HAEE was proposed. Altogether, the results obtained indicate that the anti-amyloid effect of HAEE, previously found in a mouse model of AD, most likely occurs due to its interaction with Aβ species directly in the brain.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Activated macrophages have been shown to induce vascular proliferation and play an important role in ischemic stroke. In this study, we examined the therapeutic effect of GM-CSF on the ischemic brain by activating microglia/macrophages. Rats were subjected to 1-h intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and received an intracarotid injection of GM-CSF (5 ng) or saline immediately after reperfusion. Infarct volume, neurological function and histological findings were assessed 48 h later. An intracarotid injection of GM-CSF reduced the infarct volume and improved neurological function at 48 h after reperfusion. Histological analysis revealed that the number of activated microglia/macrophages to be increased and the number of apoptotic cells to be decreased in the area of the penumbra. These results suggest that intracarotid injection of GM-CSF may have a therapeutic effect on brain ischemia via activation of microglia/macrophages.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
306,24619358,Human molecular genetics,"Overexpression of the calpain-specific inhibitor calpastatin reduces human alpha-Synuclein processing, aggregation and synaptic impairment in [A30P]αSyn transgenic mice.","Lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), contain aggregated alpha-synuclein (αSyn), which is found in several modified forms and can be discovered phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and truncated. Aggregation-prone truncated species of αSyn caused by aberrant cleavage of this fibrillogenic protein are hypothesized to participate in its sequestration into inclusions subsequently leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Here, we investigated the role of calpain cleavage of αSyn in vivo by generating two opposing mouse models. We crossed into human [A30P]αSyn transgenic (i) mice deficient for calpastatin, a calpain-specific inhibitor, thus enhancing calpain activity (SynCAST(-)) and (ii) mice overexpressing human calpastatin leading to reduced calpain activity (SynCAST(+)). As anticipated, a reduced calpain activity led to a decreased number of αSyn-positive aggregates, whereas loss of calpastatin led to increased truncation of αSyn in SynCAST(-). Furthermore, overexpression of calpastatin decreased astrogliosis and the calpain-dependent degradation of synaptic proteins, potentially ameliorating the observed neuropathology in [A30P]αSyn and SynCAST(+) mice. Overall, our data further support a crucial role of calpains, particularly of calpain 1, in the pathogenesis of PD and in disease-associated aggregation of αSyn, indicating a therapeutic potential of calpain inhibition in PD.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
307,20801087,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Antiepileptic action of exogenous dehydroepiandrosterone in iron-induced epilepsy in rat brain.,"In the study described here, the antiepileptic effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatment on iron-induced focal epileptiform activity in the rat brain was investigated. DHEA is a neuroactive corticosteroid hormone synthesized both in the adrenal cortex and in the brain. Its antioxidant properties are well known. As oxidative stress seems to play a major role in epileptogenesis in the iron-induced model of posttraumatic epilepsy, it was of interest to examine whether DHEA would exert antiepileptic activity. DHEA at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day administered intraperitoneally for 7, 14, and 21 days to iron-induced epileptic rats prevented epileptiform electrophysiological activity. Morris water maze and open-field tests on iron-induced epileptic rats revealed that DHEA also prevented behavioral alterations related to epileptiform activity. Thus, DHEA attenuated the cognitive defects produced by epileptic activity. Moreover, alterations in epileptogenesis-related biochemical parameters-lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase (sodium pump) activity--were also countered by DHEA.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

DNA methylation may be a possible mechanism for persistence of such memory. Here we injected the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza) into hippocampus CA1 area and prelimbic cortex during the stages of acquisition and expression of cocaine-induced place preference in C57BL/6 mice. Results showed that in CA1 DNA methylation inhibitors could restrain acquisition but had no impact on expression of the cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). On the contrary, in prelimbic cortex, 5-aza had no effect on acquisition but blocked expression. Our results indicated that DNA methylation in hippocampus is required for learning; while DNA methylation in prelimbic cortex is necessary for memory retrieval. The present finding is consistent with the role of the hippocampus as a structure contributing to cocaine-induced memory acquisition, and prelimbic cortex, a part of prefrontal cortex as an area responsible for cocaine-induced memory retrieval. In conclusion, DNA methylation does play an important role in drug-induced learning and memory although the detailed effect still calls for further research.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether fluoxetine attenuates early brain injury (EBI) after SAH. We demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg per day) significantly attenuated brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, microglial activation, and neuronal apoptosis in EBI after experimental SAH, as evidenced by the reduction of brain water content and Evans blue dye extravasation, prevention of disruption of the tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1, claudin-5, and occludin, a decrease of cells staining positive for Iba-1, ED-1, and TUNEL and a decline in IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, 3-nitrotyrosine, and 8-OHDG levels. Moreover, fluoxetine significantly improved the neurological deficits of EBI and long-term sensorimotor behavioral deficits following SAH in a rat model.

Recently, we reported that peucedanocoumarin III (PCiii) is a promising therapeutic compound with the ability to disaggregate α-synuclein inclusion and protect dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we found that trans-4'-acetyl-3'-tigloylkhellactone (racemic peucedanocoumarin IV [PCiv]), a structural isomer of PCiii with a higher synthetic yield presented a strong anti-aggregate activity to a degree comparable to that of PCiii. PCiv retained effective inhibitory function against β-sheet aggregate-mimic β23 cytotoxicities and potently prevented α-synucleinopathy in α-synuclein preformed fibril (PFF)-treated mice cortical neurons. In detailed pharmacokinetic profiling of PCiv, oral administration of PCiv in rats exhibited an approximately 97-min half-life and 10% bioavailability. Moreover, tissue distribution analysis revealed favorable profiles of brain penetration with a 6.4 brain-to-plasma concentration ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of PCiv was further evaluated in a sporadic PD mouse model with a combinatorial co-injection of α-synuclein preformed fibril and recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing α-synuclein. Motor dysfunctions induced in this combinatorial α-synucleinopathy PD mouse model was almost completely rescued by PCiv diet administration, and this therapeutic effect is consistent with the marked prevention of dopaminergic neuron loss and suppression of α-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our translational study suggests that PCiv is advantageous as a therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases, especially with its good synthetic yield, high brain distribution, and anti-aggregate activity. PCiv may be useful in the management of α-synuclein inclusion formation and propagation at different stages of PD.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
311,30462117,Food & function,Resveratrol alleviates motor and cognitive deficits and neuropathology in the A53T α-synuclein mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Lewy pathology and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Lewy pathology mainly consists of abnormal aggregates of α-synuclein, which play a pivotal role in PD pathophysiology. However, the complexity of PD leads to clinical challenges, and there are still no treatments to halt or slow the neurodegenerative process. Resveratrol (RV) is a natural polyphenol compound with multiple biological activities, which has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects on several neurological diseases. Here we first provided evidence that RV treatment alleviated motor and cognitive deficits in the A53T α-synuclein mouse model of PD in a dose-dependent manner. The beneficial effects of RV against PD resulted from inhibiting α-synuclein aggregation and cytotoxicity, lowering the levels of total α-synuclein and oligomers, reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that RV has promising therapeutic potential for PD and other synucleinopathies.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
312,31434803,JCI insight,Transcription factor EB overexpression prevents neurodegeneration in experimental synucleinopathies.,"The synucleinopathies Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple system atrophy (MSA) - characterized by α-synuclein intracytoplasmic inclusions into, respectively, neurons and oligodendrocytes - are associated with impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathways (ALP). Increased expression of the master regulator of ALP, transcription factor EB (TFEB), is hypothesized to promote the clearance of WT α-synuclein and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we explore the efficacy of targeted TFEB overexpression either in neurons or oligodendrocytes to reduce the pathological burden of α-synuclein in a PD rat model and a MSA mouse model. While TFEB neuronal expression was sufficient to prevent neurodegeneration in the PD model, we show that only TFEB oligodendroglial overexpression leads to neuroprotective effects in the MSA model. These beneficial effects were associated with a decreased accumulation of α-synuclein into oligodendrocytes through recovery of the ALP machinery. Our study demonstrates that the cell type where α-synuclein aggregates dictates the target of TFEB overexpression in order to be protective, paving the way for adapted therapies.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
313,7512580,Journal of neuroimmunology,Transforming growth factor-beta 1 inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha/lymphotoxin production and adoptive transfer of disease by effector cells of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,"We previously reported that the CD4+ suppressor cells (Ts) that regulate recovery of Lewis rats from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) produce transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We also reported that TGF-beta downregulates interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, by the CD4+ effector T cells (Te) that mediate EAE. We now report that TGF-beta also inhibits the production of tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin (TNF/LT) by EAE effector cells. When activated in vitro with myelin basic protein (MBP), Te produced TNF/LT, as measured using a WEHI 164 cytotoxicity assay. The specificity of cytokine action was demonstrated using neutralizing antibodies to TNF/LT. When added to the Te+MBP cultures, TGF-beta inhibited TNF/LT production in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibodies augmented TNF/LT production in the Te+MBP cultures. We also confirm that TGF-beta inhibits adoptive transfer of EAE. In contrast, murine IL-10 only partially inhibited TNF/LT and IFN-gamma production by Te. We conclude that TGF-beta production by Ts plays a major role in recovery from EAE in the Lewis rat by inhibiting TNF/LT and IFN-gamma production by the effector cells that mediate EAE.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
314,32750380,Neuroscience,Genetic Inactivation of Cholinergic C Bouton Output Improves Motor Performance but not Survival in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons and leads to death a few years after symptom onset. Despite its high morbidity and mortality, its underlying pathogenic mechanisms still remain poorly understood. Although there is increasing evidence for significant changes in the structure and function of synapses on motor neurons, there is a need for a systematic investigation of the role of each synapse subtype in the course of the disease. Here, we focus on large cholinergic synapses on motor neurons, known as C boutons, and investigate their role during ALS progression. We implement a genetic strategy for inactivation of the cholinergic output of C boutons in the SOD1[G93A] transgenic mouse model of ALS. We demonstrate that although C bouton cholinergic inactivation does not alter mouse survival, it exerts a beneficial effect on motor performance in the rotarod motor task, as evidenced by an increased latency to fall in SOD1[G93A] mice lacking C bouton cholinergic output. Our results suggest that C bouton cholinergic transmission exerts a negative effect on motor neuron function in ALS, possibly via aberrant excitation, and render C boutons a potential target for future pharmacological intervention.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
315,18501411,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",Neuropeptide Y in the central nucleus of the amygdala suppresses dependence-induced increases in alcohol drinking.,"The anxiolytic effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) are mediated in part by the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a brain region involved in the regulation of alcohol-drinking behaviors. Centrally administered NPY suppresses alcohol drinking in subpopulations of rats vulnerable to the development of high alcohol-drinking behavior. The purpose of the current study was to determine the role of NPY in the CeA on elevated alcohol drinking produced by alcohol dependence. Adult male Wistar rats were trained to respond for 10% w/v alcohol in an operant situation with the use of a supersaccharin fading procedure. Following stabilization of responding, rats were divided into two groups matched for intake and given daily access to either alcohol-containing (9.2% v/v) liquid diet or an isocaloric control diet. Following extended access to the diet and reliable separation of operant responding between dependent and non-dependent rats during 6-h withdrawal tests, all rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae aimed at the CeA. Rats were then infused with 4 NPY doses (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 microg/0.5 microl aCSF) in a within-subjects Latin-square design during acute withdrawal and tested for operant alcohol responding 30 min later. Alcohol-dependent rats exhibited higher operant alcohol responding than non-dependent rats when infused with vehicle, but responding was similar in the two groups following infusion of all doses of NPY. These results indicate that NPY abolishes dependence-induced elevations in alcohol drinking and implicate the recruitment of limbic NPY systems in the motivational drive to consume alcohol following the transition to dependence.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

A 3-fold or greater rise of specific antibody titres was observed after a single immunization of intact BALB/c mice. In experiments in chronically infected animals a single inoculation of HV resulted in a 3-fold rise of specific antibody titres at 6 days postimmunization but not in later periods (20, 30 days). Administration of larifan, an interferon inducer, but not the immunostimulator myelopide, induced a synergic effect in these experiments.

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of ACE in this model and to compare the treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat with that with the angiotensin II antagonist HR 720. The endothelial layer of the left carotid artery was removed using an inflated balloon catheter. Injured and control vessels were both submitted to histomorphological analysis and DNA content quantification at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 days after injury. Evaluation of neointima thickening demonstrated a slow but steady increase of neointima that was significant after day 6 and reached 30% of the lumen in 2 weeks. This was paralleled by an increase in DNA content, which was significant 4 days after injury. ACE mRNA levels were quantified by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. Measurement of ACE mRNA levels revealed a significant upregulation 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. ACE activity was also significantly enhanced at 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. In addition, the treatment with ramiprilat was more efficient in reducing neointima formation than that with HR 720. These data underlie the role of ACE in this model of restenosis. The early induction of ACE expression after endothelial injury but before significant changes in the vessel structure suggests that ACE activity might be one of the mechanisms that trigger neointima formation in the rat.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
318,3608285,Clinical neuropathology,Long survival after cardiac arrest: case report and neuropathological findings.,"A 14-year-old male survived for nearly 3 years following a cardiac arrest. During this period he remained unconscious and electroencephalogram recordings indicated a virtual absence of neocortical activity. Clinically there was some retention of brainstem function evidenced by spontaneous respiration, eye movements, cough and swallow reflex. He was in a persistent vegetative state until his death. We believe this to be one of the longest surviving cases to be recorded. Neuropathological findings correlated with the clinical picture, and demonstrated the selective vulnerability of various areas within the brain. The brain was reduced in weight to 880 g. There was extensive necrosis affecting the cortex and basal ganglia and the cerebellum showed severe loss of Purkinje and granule cells. In certain nuclei of the thalamus there was neuronal loss and gliosis. There was relative sparing of the brain stem. The superimposed effects of retrograde degeneration is demonstrated in various sites.",Human-case-report,4,0

Research indicates that people with AvPD also show disturbances in narrative identity, which is an internal and evolving story created about the personal past, present, and presumed future. Here, the novel Guide for Narrative Repair (GNaR) recently developed by (Thomsen et al., 2020) is introduced as a potentially useful tool to help people with AvPD in crafting more adaptive narrative identities. The guide is brought to life via a case study analysis of Adam, a male outpatient suffering from AvPD. Consistent with the GNaR, disturbances in Adam's storied self are brought to light and ways to facilitate his narrative repair are proposed. We conclude with implications related to the case as well as the potential narrative turn in AvPD treatment.",Human-case-report,4,0

HHE syndrome usually occurs in children younger than 4 years of age. Although most HHE syndrome patients live into adult life, only a few cases of the syndrome have been reported in the elderly. In our case, cerebral hemiatrophy, left mesial temporal sclerosis and crossed cerebellar atrophy were observed. Because this is the oldest case ever reported, we further investigated age-related neuropathological changes and found an interhemispheric difference in amyloid-β-related neuropathologic changes. There were almost no senile plaques or amyloid-laden vessels in the left hemisphere.

We employed FISH and array CGH techniques for a better definition and refinement of a double chromosome aberration associating a 17p microdeletion with partial monosomy 21q due to 1:3 meiotic segregation of a maternal reciprocal translocation t(17;21)(p13.3;q21.2) revealed after banding analysis. Brain MRI depicted partial callosal and mild diffuse cerebral atrophies, but without expected signs of lissencephaly. The patient's karyotype formula was: 45,XY,der(17)t(17;21)(p13.3;q21.2)mat,-21. FISH study confirmed these rearrangements and array CGH analysis estimated the loss sizes to at least 635 kb on chromosome 17 and to 15.6 Mb on chromosome 21. The absence of lissencephaly and major brain malformations often associated with 17p terminal deletions could be attributed to the retention of PAFAH1B1, YWHAE and CRK genes. Dysmorphic features, moderate mental impairment and minor brain malformations could result from the 21q monosomy and particularly the partial deletion of the APP-SOD1 region. Azoospermia should result from gamete apoptosis induced by a control mechanism triggered in response to chromosome imbalances. Our study provides an additional case for better understanding and delineating both 17p and 21q deletions.",Human-case-report,4,0

We report the case of a patient receiving dabrafenib and trametinib for metastatic melanoma who developed intracranial hemorrhage while on therapy. Combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib improves progression-free survival of patients with BRAF V600-positive metastatic melanoma. Nevertheless, it is associated with an increased incidence and severity of any hemorrhagic event. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of intracranial hemorrhage with pathological confirmation.	We present the case of a 48-year-old man with metastatic melanoma of unknown primary site. He had metastases to the right clavicle, brain, liver, adrenal gland, and the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. He progressed on treatment with alpha-interferon. He was found to have a 4.5-cm mass in the left frontotemporal lobe and underwent gross total resection followed by adjuvant CyberKnife stereotactic irradiation. He was subsequently started on ipilimumab. Treatment was stopped due to kidney injury. He was then placed on dabrafenib and trametinib. He returned for follow-up complaining of severe headache and developed an episode of seizure. MRI showed a large area of edema at the left frontal lobe with midline shift. Emergency craniotomy was performed. Intracranial hemorrhage was found intra-operatively. Pathology from surgery did not find tumor cells, reported as organizing hemorrhage and necrosis with surrounding gliosis; immunohistochemistry for S100 and HMB45 were negative.	This case demonstrates the life-threatening adverse effects that can be seen with the newer targeted biological therapies. It is therefore crucial to maintain a high index of suspicion when patients on this combination therapy present with new neurologic symptoms.",Human-case-report,4,0

Neurological examination showed severe truncal ataxia, incoordination and decreased deep sensations in the bilateral lower extremities. A CSF study revealed a moderately elevated total protein (125 mg/dl) without any elevation of the cell count. A nerve conduction study supported the diagnosis of polyneuropathy. Lumbar MRI revealed spinal canal stenosis at the L3/L4-L5/S1 intervertebral levels due to disk herniations and ossification of the yellow ligaments. We examined cerebellar stimulation in order to determine whether the ataxia was due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or peripheral nervous system. Conditioning electrical stimulation over the cerebellum did not change the size of motor potentials evoked by magnetic cortical stimulation in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Her clinical course was good, and the limb and truncal ataxia became very mild about 4 months after the onset, although there was little change in the decreased deep sensations. The cerebellar stimulation in the second study was normal. We diagnosed her as having acute cerebellar ataxia and thought that the decreased deep sensations were due to diabetic polyneuropathy and lumbosacral radiculopathies.

A thyroid storm occurred 6 h after the start of DKA management. Her Burch and Wartofsky score was 65 points. Right hemiplegia developed during the thyroid storm, and brain magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted images revealed multiple acute infarcts in both hemispheres. MR angiography showed stenosis of both distal internal carotid arteries and both M1 portions of the middle cerebral arteries, consistent with Moyamoya disease. After acute management for the thyroid storm with methimazole, Lugol solution and hydrocortisone, the patient's neurological symptoms completely resolved within 1 month, and free T4 level normalized within 2 months. Thyroid storm may trigger cerebral ischemia in Moyamoya disease and lead to rapid progression of cerebrovascular occlusive disease.

She was diagnosed as having NIDDM one year ago and was treated with diet and glibenclamide (1.25 mg/day) for 6 months. However, she stopped her medical treatment one month ago and then polydipsia and general fatigue were manifested. She was admitted to a hospital five days ago at which time hyperglycemia (405 mg/dl) and anemia (Hb8.0g/dl) were detected. She was transferred to our hospital for control of blood glucose and further examination of bitemporal hemianopsia. She showed typical acromegalic features including enlargement of the nose, lips and tongue, increased heel pad and acral growth. Conscious disturbance was cured by the infusion of saline and the administration of insulin. Endoscopy revealed an active gastric ulcer (A1). Endocrine data disclosed increased GH levels in plasma and urine, whereas plasma IGF-1 levels were low. Plasma GH paradoxically increased following the administration of TRH. A water deprivation test showed an impaired increase in urinary osmolarity, indicating partial central diabetes insipidus (DI). MRI with Gd-contrast revealed a macroadenoma which progressed toward suprasella. She was diagnosed as having acromegaly, partial DI and probable hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic diabetic pre-coma. Polyuria (5-101/day) due to partial DI was controlled by the administration of DDAVP (10 micrograms/day). The constant subcutaneous administration of octreotide (240 micrograms/day) resulted in normal plasma GH levels and a marked shrinkage of the pituitary tumor. The pituitary tumor was finally removed by the transsphenoidal approach following treatment with octreotide for 4 months. HE staining of the pituitary tumor showed atrophic and acidophilic cells surrounded by hyaloid connective tissue. After the surgery, plasma GH levels were normalized and complications were cured. In conclusion, this is a very rare case of acromegaly associated with diabetic pre-coma and partial DI, and effectively treated with constant subcutaneous infusion of octreotide.",Human-case-report,4,0

We report a follow-up study of a patient with a parieto-occipital lesion who is affected by severe peripheral agraphia for letters, but not for Arabic digits. While letters in writing to dictation are frequently illegible, distorted, or consist in meaningless strokes, Arabic digits are well-formed and fluently produced. In a series of tasks, including copying of letters with tachistoscopic presentation and handwriting on a digitizing tablet, several processing levels are assessed in order to localize JS' functional writing impairment and to determine different processing routes for letters and for numbers. Overall, the results of the experimental investigation suggest a notation specific deficit in the activation of graphomotor patterns for letters, but not for digits. The study thus adds evidence to the so far reported dissociations between Arabic and alphabetical scripts.",Human-case-report,4,0

The pretreatment molar ratio of amino acids was less in patients than in controls (p less than 0.001) and was lower in those with cirrhosis (p less than 0.02). Branched-chain amino acid levels were elevated in patients without cirrhosis (p less than 0.02) but not in those with cirrhosis; aromatic amino acid concentrations were increased in all (p less than 0.01). The ratio improved with remission and predicted behavior after discontinuation of treatment. Patients who deteriorated failed to improve the ratio and those whose ratio improved incompletely relapsed. The ratio correlated with histologic severity and serum concentrations of albumin, bilirubin, and gamma-globulin and not with clinical manifestations of encephalopathy.

Data from two multicenter, placebo-controlled studies with 536 patients were reexamined to assess: 1) the pervasiveness of these symptoms in samples of adults with ADHD; 2) the response of these symptoms to atomoxetine; and 3) their association with depressive/anxiety symptoms.	The Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (WRAADDS) was used to assess temper, affective lability, and emotional overreactivity, thus identifying patients exhibiting 'emotional dysregulation.' Other DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses were exclusionary. Outcome measures were the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) and the WRAADDS.	Thirty-two percent of the sample met post hoc criteria for emotional dysregulation and had higher baseline scores on ADHD measures, a lower response to placebo, and greater response to atomoxetine (p = .048). Symptoms of emotional dysregulation had a treatment effect (p < .001) at least as large as the CAARS (p = .002) and the total WRAADDS (p = .001).

Knowledge of the identity and trajectory of symptom clusters (SCs) would enhance measurement and management.	We aimed to identify SCs and their change over time from baseline to completion of breast cancer CTX.	SCs were identified and assessed for change in 219 women from Nebraska at four times: baseline, during cycles #3 and #4 of CTX, and one month after finishing CTX.

Exploratory factor analysis was conducted at each time point, then changes in SCs were evaluated at different times.	Two SCs were identified before and after initiating CTX: gastrointestinal and treatment-related. The number and type of symptoms in each cluster differed over time. Clusters were dynamic during CTX with changes in the number and type of symptoms. Only one treatment-related SC, which consisted of fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance, was identified after CTX completion.

Patient survey-based analysis.	One hundred seventy-one patients (age range 34-86 yrs) who self-reported memory or other cognitive problems associated with statin therapy while participating in a previous statin effects study.	Patients completed a survey assessing statin-associated, cognitive-specific adverse drug reaction (ADR) characteristics, relation of the ADR to specific statin and dose (or potency), and time course of symptom onset and recovery. Visual analog scales were used to assess the effect of the cognitive ADRs on seven quality-of-life domains. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. To target cognitive ADRs with a probable or definite causal relationship to statins, the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale was used: 128 patients (75%) experienced cognitive ADRs determined to be probably or definitely related to statin therapy. Of 143 patients (84%) who reported stopping statin therapy, 128 (90%) reported improvement in cognitive problems, sometimes within days of statin discontinuation (median time to first-noted recovery 2.5 wks). Of interest, in some patients, a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's disease reportedly was reversed. Nineteen patients whose symptoms improved or resolved after they discontinued statin therapy and who underwent rechallenge with a statin exhibited cognitive problems again (multiple times in some). Within this vulnerable group, a powerful relationship was observed between potency of the statin and fraction of trials with that agent resulting in cognitive ADRs (p<0.00001). Quality of life was significantly adversely affected for each of the seven assessed domains (all p<0.00000001).	Findings from the survey suggest that cognitive problems associated with statin therapy have variable onset and recovery courses, a clear relation to statin potency, and significant negative impact on quality-of-life. Administration of a patient-targeted questionnaire is a feasible approach that provides a useful complement to other ADR surveillance approaches.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

We conducted a prospective observational study in 507 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke to analyze the effect of ACE inhibitor treatment at the time of stroke onset on CRP levels within the first 24 hours and the relationship to outcome. Risk estimates were calculated according to Cox regression analysis controlled for blood pressure (BP) levels, clinical and neuroradiological confounding variables, and log-normalized CRP levels at entry.	ACE inhibitor treatment was associated with lower (2.6-fold; P<0.0001) median CRP levels and with a reduced 2-year cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.53; P<0.0001) compared with a different BP-lowering regimen. The relationship between ACE inhibitor status and log-normalized CRP levels remained significant (P<0.0001) after we controlled for important confounding variables and concomitant treatments. The reduced risk was also evident in multivariable analysis when ACE inhibitor treatment was controlled for BP, associated risk factors, neuroradiological findings, and concomitant treatments (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.62; P<0.0001). This risk reduction was greatly attenuated and not more significant when log-normalized CRP levels were included (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.04; P=0.0721) in the model.	Concomitant treatment with ACE inhibitor at the time of an acute stroke is associated with lower inflammatory response and better long-term outcomes, apparently apart from the effects on BP.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
350,24145687,Spinal cord,The effect of steroids on the incidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage after spinal cord injury: a case-controlled study.,"Retrospective case-controlled study.	To understand the incidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH) and subsequent mortality rate associated with steroid use after acute spinal cord injury (SCI).	Miami, Florida, USA.	This case-controlled study investigates two sequential study groups with SCI treated by a single surgeon in a level I trauma center. The first study cohort (1997-2005) received steroids according to the NASCIS II protocol and the second (2005-2012) received no steroid treatment. The groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, severity and level of injury (43 vs 45 years old/3:1 male-female/AIS scale %-43.5 vs 41.7 A, 10.6 vs 11.1 B, 20.3 vs 13.4 C, 25.4 vs 33.5 D/64.3 vs 73.8% cervical, 35.6 vs 25.7% thoracic and lumbar). The incidence and mortality from GIH were the primary outcome measures.	A total of 350 patients were evaluated during the study period. The incidence of GIH in the SCI group receiving steroids was 6/216 (2.77%) with 2 mortalities (33.3%). No gastrointestinal (GI) complications were noted in the 134 patients that did not receive any steroids (P=0.086). All GIH cases in the steroid group were in cervical SCI patients-6/139 (4.32%; P=0.043). Average time to onset of GIH was 16 days.	The use of steroids in acute SCI appears to be a key risk factor in increasing the incidence of clinically overt GI complications with a subsequent high mortality rate, particularly in patients with cervical SCI.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
351,35164524,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,Lithium plus antipsychotics or anticonvulsants for bipolar disorder: Comparing clinical response and metabolic changes.,"Patients with bipolar disorder treated with lithium often require additional antipsychotics or anticonvulsants. However, the comparative effectiveness and safety of these agents as add-on to lithium has not been studied.	This secondary analysis combined two similar 24-week trials on outpatients with bipolar disorder randomized to lithium (target serum level 0.4-0.6 mEq/L). Guideline-based adjunctive antipsychotics (Li+AP) and anticonvulsants (Li+AC) could be used if clinically indicated and was assessed at every study visit. Response was measured on the Clinical Global Impression scale and we performed adjusted mixed effects linear regression analyses. Analysis of variance tests compared metabolic measures including a binary diagnosis of metabolic syndrome before and after 24 weeks of treatment.	Among 379 outpatients (57% female, mean age 38 years, mean Clinical Global Impression 4.4), users of Li+AP (N = 50, primarily quetiapine and aripiprazole) improved to a similar degree (mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.6, standard deviation = 1.5) as those using lithium-only (i.e. without adjunctive antipsychotics or anticonvulsants, N = 149, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.7, standard deviation = 1.4) (p = 0.59). Users of Li+AC (N = 107, primarily lamotrigine and valproate, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.2, standard deviation = 1.3) and users of Li+AP+AC (N = 73, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.1, standard deviation = 1.3) showed worse response compared to lithium-only users (all p < 0.01). When comparing Li+AP to Li+AC, users of Li+AP improved slightly better on general (p = 0.05) and manic symptoms (p = 0.01), but showed a worse development of glucose, triglycerides, and metabolic syndrome.	Despite treatment-by-indication confounding, these findings are relevant for real-world treatment settings and emphasize the need for randomized trials on this clinically important topic.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, and triiodothyronine were evaluated in 61 children with epilepsy who received VPA monotherapy for more than 6 months and in 144 controls. We analyzed the effect of age, seizure type, duration of VPA treatment, dose of VPA, and serum level of VPA on thyroid function. The incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly higher in patients with VPA therapy than in controls (52.4 vs. 16.7%; p < 0.001). In addition, of the 61 patients, 5 (8.1%) exhibited TSH levels that were >10 μIU/mL. However, none of the patients and controls showed overt hypothyroidism. Serum VPA level and daily dose of VPA were correlated with TSH level.

To explore factors associated with (a) intravenous OMT misuse, (b) repeated misuse, (c) emergency room (ER) admission, (d) misuse of different OMT types and (e) concurrent benzodiazepine misuse.	We recruited 3,620 patients in 27 addiction units in Italy and collected data on the self-reported rate of intravenous injection of methadone (MET), buprenorphine (BUP), BUP-naloxone (NLX), OMT dosage and type, experience of and reason for misuse, concurrent intravenous benzodiazepine misuse, pattern of -misuse in relation to admission to the addiction unit and ER -admissions because of misuse. According to inclusion/exclusion criteria, 2,585 patients were included.	Intravenous misuse of OMT substances was found in 28% of patients with no difference between OMT types and was associated with gender, age, type of previous opioid abuse and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. Repeated OMT misuse was reported by 20% (i.e., 71% of misusers) of patients and was associated with positive OMT misuse experience and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. Admission to the ER because of misuse complications was reported by 34% of patients, this outcome being associated with gender, employment, type of previous opioid abuse and intravenous benzodiazepine misuse. OMT dosage was lower than the recommended maintenance dosage.	We offered new information on factors associated with intravenous OMT misuse, repeated misuse and ER admission in Italian patients under OMT. Our data indicate that BUP-NLX misuse is not different from that of BUP or MET. Choosing the more expensive BUP-NLX over MET will likely not lead to the expected reduction of the risk of injection misuse of the OMT. Instead of prescribing new and expensive OMT formulations, addiction unit physicians and medical personnel should better focus on patient's features that are associated with a higher likelihood of misuse. Care should be paid to concurrent benzodiazepine and OMT misuse.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

However, clinical studies are conducted with specific populations that differ from the real world. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of alectinib in real-world settings. Patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EML4-ALK fusion were enrolled from two medical centers between June 2018 and June 2020. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) to alectinib. The secondary endpoint was response of brain metastases. The risk factors for disease progression were also investigated. In total, 127 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled into this study. Of them, 54.3% received first-line alectinib. The 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 77.4% and 68.3%, respectively. ORR and disease control rate (DCR) were 53.5% and 91.3%, respectively. Among patients with brain metastases, intracranial ORR and DCR were 63.6% and 88.6%, respectively. In addition, we found that 'crizotinib pretreatment', 'liver metastasis' and 'TP53 co-mutation' were individually associated with shorter PFS in alectinib treatment. In conclusion, this study confirms the salient clinical outcomes of alectinib for ALK-fusion-driven NSCLC patients with or without brain metastases, adding real-world evidence to the priority of alectinib in clinical practice.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
355,23063133,European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Genetics of emergent suicidality during antidepressive treatment--data from a naturalistic study on a large sample of inpatients with a major depressive episode.,"Factors contributing to treatment-emergent suicidal ideation (TESI) using antidepressants have been in the focus of recent research strategies. We investigated previously established clinical predictors of TESI and combined these with several polymorphisms of candidate genes in patients with major depressive disorder. Common polymorphisms involved in the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) and 2 (TPH2), serotonin transporter, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated in a naturalistic inpatient study of the German research network on depression. We compared patients showing TESI with non-TESI suicidal patients and with non-suicidal patients using univariate tests to detect relevant factors, which were further tested in logistic regression and CART (Classification and Regression Trees) analyses. Of the 269 patients, TESI occurred in 22 patients (17 female), 117 patients were defined as non-TESI suicidal patients, and 130 patients were classified as non-suicidal. When comparing cases with both control groups we found the TPH2 rs1386494 (C/T) polymorphism to be moderately associated with TESI (Univariate tests: TESI vs. non-suicidality: p=0.005; adjusted: p=0.09; TESI vs. non-TESI suicidal patients: p=0.0024; adjusted: p=0.086). This polymorphism remained the only significant genetic factor in addition to clinical predictors in logistic regression and CART analyses. CART analyses suggested interactions with several clinical predictors. Haplotype analyses further supported a contribution of this polymorphism in TESI. The TPH2 rs1386494 (C/T) polymorphism might contribute to the genetic background of TESI. This polymorphism has been previously associated with committed suicide and major depressive disorder. The small number of cases warrants replication in larger patient samples. Lack of a placebo control group hampers definite conclusions on an association with antidepressive treatment.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
356,22939118,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts among former users of finasteride with persistent sexual side effects.,"Finasteride, a commonly prescribed medication for male pattern hair loss, has recently been associated with persistent sexual side effects. In addition, depression has recently been added to the product labeling of Propecia (finasteride 1 mg). Finasteride reduces the levels of several neuroactive steroids linked to sexual function and depression. This study assesses depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts in former users of finasteride who developed persistent sexual side effects despite the discontinuation of finasteride.	In 2010-2011, former users of finasteride (n = 61) with persistent sexual side effects for ≥ 3 months were administered standardized interviews that gathered demographic information, medical and psychiatric histories, and information on medication use, sexual function, and alcohol consumption. All former users were otherwise healthy men with no baseline sexual dysfunction, chronic medical conditions, current or past psychiatric conditions, or use of oral prescription medications before or during finasteride use. A control group of men (n = 29), recruited from the community, had male pattern hair loss but had never used finasteride and denied any history of psychiatric conditions or use of psychiatric medications. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of depressive symptoms and the prevalence of suicidal thoughts as determined by the Beck depression inventory II (BDI-II); all subjects self-administered this questionnaire at the time of the interview or up to 10 months later.	Rates of depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥ 14) were significantly higher in the former finasteride users (75%; 46/61) as compared to the controls (10%; 3/29) (P < .0001). Moderate or severe depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥ 20) were present in 64% (39/61) of the finasteride group and 0% of the controls. Suicidal thoughts were present in 44% (27/61) of the former finasteride users and in 3% (1/29) of the controls (P < .0001).	Clinicians and potential users of finasteride should be aware of the potential risk of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts. The preliminary findings of this study warrant further research with controlled studies.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

A total of 44 patients were included in the study, with 33 patients in the control group and 11 patients in the interventional group who received intravenous infusions of 30 mL Cerebrolysin. Both groups received standard rehabilitation therapy following the rehabilitation protocol for patients with TBI at Hospital Clínico Mutual de Seguridad. Functional and cognitive scales were evaluated at baseline, at four months, and at the endpoint of the intervention therapy at seven months (on average). The results revealed a significant improvement in the Cerebrolysin-treated group compared to the control group. Specifically, patients who received Cerebrolysin showed a moderate residual disability and a significant reduction in the need for care. Concerning the promising results and considering the limitations of the retrospective study design, we suggest that randomized controlled studies be initiated to corroborate the positive findings for Cerebrolysin in patients with moderate to severe brain trauma.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Both thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation were within normal ranges in all subjects. The luteinizing hormone response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, was slightly weaker in non-responders. There were no differences in the insulin tolerance test between responders and non-responders.

359,34309908,Journal of pineal research,Treatment of isolated REM sleep behavior disorder using melatonin as a chronobiotic.,"Melatonin is recommended as a first-line treatment in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), although no large patient group has been reported. To assess effects, time course and confounding factors in the treatment of patients with iRBD using melatonin, 209 consecutive patients were included in this single-center, observational cohort study. A total of 171 patients had taken melatonin according to our chronobiotic protocol (2 mg, ≥6 months, always-at-the-same-clock time, 10-11pm, corrected for chronotype), 13 had applied melatonin for about 1-3 months, and 25 underwent mixed treatments. In total, 1529 clinical evaluations were performed, including Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and a newly developed RBD symptom severity scale (Ikelos-RS), analyzed using linear mixed models. Validation of Ikelos-RS showed excellent inter-rater reliability (ρ = 0.9, P < .001), test-retest reliability (ρ = 0.9, P < .001) and convergent validity (ρ = 0.9, P < .001). With melatonin, RBD symptom severity gradually improved over the first 4 weeks of treatment (Ikelos-RS: 6.1 vs. 2.5; CGI Severity: 5.7 vs. 3.2) and remained stably improved (mean follow-up 4.2 ± 3.1years; range: 0.6-21.7years). Initial response was slowed to up to 3 months with melatonin-suppressing (betablockers) or REM sleep spoiling co-medication (antidepressants) and failed with inadequately timed melatonin intake. When melatonin was discontinued after 6 months, symptoms remained stably improved (mean follow-up after discontinuation of 4.9 ± 2.5years; range: 0.6-9.2). When administered only 1-3 months, RBD symptoms gradually returned. Without any melatonin, RBD symptoms persisted and did not wear off over time. Clock-timed, low-dose, long-term melatonin treatment in patients with iRBD appears to be associated with the improvement of symptoms. The outlasting improvement over years questions a pure symptomatic effect. Clock-time dependency challenges existing prescription guidelines for melatonin.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Twelve normoprolactinemic postmenopausal women were administered 40 micrograms/day of ethinyl estradiol (EE2) orally throughout the study. On the 4th week of the study, daily doses of 200 micrograms EE2 were also given to each subject for 4 days. Twelve postmenopausal women were given sulpiride orally in a daily dose of 150 mg throughout the study. Serum levels of prolactin were raised in all 12 subjects given sulpiride. In the 12 sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemic postmenopausal women, EE2 was given in the same manner as in normal postmenopausal women. The negative feedback effect of estrogen with low doses of EE2 (40 micrograms/day for 4 weeks) and the positive feedback effect of estrogen after the subsequent administration of EE2 (200 micrograms/day for 4 days) were demonstrated in both normoprolactinemic and hyperprolactinemic groups.

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics",Identification of pharmacogenetic markers in smoking cessation therapy.,"Pharmacogenetic clinical trials seek to identify genetic modifiers of treatment effects. When a trial has collected data on many potential genetic markers, a first step in analysis is to screen for evidence of pharmacogenetic effects by testing for treatment-by-marker interactions in a statistical model for the outcome of interest. This approach is potentially problematic because (i) individual significance tests can be overly sensitive, particularly when sample sizes are large; and (ii) standard significance tests fail to distinguish between markers that are likely, on biological grounds, to have an effect, and those that are not. One way to address these concerns is to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests [Berger (1985) Statistical decision theory and Bayesian analysis. New York: Springer; Kass and Raftery (1995) J Am Stat Assoc 90:773-795], which are typically more conservative than standard uncorrected frequentist tests, less conservative than multiplicity-corrected tests, and make explicit use of relevant biological information through specification of the prior distribution. In this article we use a Bayesian testing approach to screen a panel of genetic markers recorded in a randomized clinical trial of bupropion versus placebo for smoking cessation. From a panel of 59 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on 11 candidate genes, we identify four SNPs (one each on CHRNA5 and CHRNA2 and two on CHAT) that appear to have pharmacogenetic relevance. Of these, the SNP on CHRNA5 is most robust to specification of the prior. An unadjusted frequentist test identifies seven SNPs, including these four, none of which remains significant upon correction for multiplicity. In a panel of 43 randomly selected control SNPs, none is significant by either the Bayesian or the corrected frequentist test.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Based on our real-world experience in an academic medical center, we performed an economic analysis of a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients taking SSRIs on a course of acute and continuation treatment recommended by the American Psychiatric Association. We used standard costing of antidepressants, sildenafil, and unit costs for physician visits within a managed care environment and cost-of-illness methodology to calculate the annualized cost of depression for different treatment outcomes. After 6 months of SSRI treatment, the sildenafil add-on group had the lowest cost estimates compared with groups that discontinued SSRIs, substituted another SSRI (switching), or added a non-SSRI to the existing SSRI (augmentation). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the physician visit was the single most important cost component in this hypothetical population and relapse/remission the most costly outcome. Sildenafil can be a cost-effective add-on therapy to control SSRI-induced erectile dysfunction.

In addition to the substantial decline in IPD, increased disease due to nonvaccine serotypes and a changing clinical presentation emerged. The objective of this study is to describe these trends in IPD in the late PCV7-era.	We report on continued, prospective, population-based surveillance of childhood IPD in Massachusetts children during the period 2007 to 2009 and make comparisons with the earlier 2001 to 2006 PCV7-era. Demographic and clinical data were collected for all cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from normally sterile sites were serotyped and further evaluated using antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus sequence typing and eBURST analysis. IPD incidence rates are calculated by age, year and serotype.	There were 326 cases of IPD between 2007 and 2009 in children < 18 years of age. Overall IPD incidence rate was 7.5 cases per 100,000 population and was not statistically different from the observed incidence in 2001 to 2006 (P > 0.05). As compared with the earlier period, the proportion of bacteremic pneumonia among all IPD cases was almost 3-fold greater in 2009 to 2010 (P < 0.01). PCV7 serotypes accounted for 7%, whereas the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes accounted for 77% of all cases between 2007 and 2009. IPD due to serotypes 19A and 7F increased, and 19A and 7F were isolated in 41% and 20% of all IPD cases in the same period, respectively. Serotype 19A also comprised a majority of the penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant isolates. Analysis of multilocus sequence typing data showed a significant increase in ST191, ST695 and ST320 and a significant decrease in ST199 and ST180.	The reduction in IPD after introduction of PCV7 persists in Massachusetts children; however, serotypes causing IPD have changed significantly in the last decade. Continued surveillance is necessary to determine the impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, as well as track potential changes in disease incidence and character due to non-13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

368,34134000,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Super-enhancer-driven Sorting Nexin 5 expression promotes dopaminergic neuronal ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease models.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Recent studies revealed that the ferroptosis pathway is involved in the death process of dopaminergic neurons in PD. The aberrant endosomal sorting pathway, which results in aberrant iron level in eukaryotic cells, may serve a role in the ferroptosis pathway in PD condition. However, its specific molecular mechanisms remained unclear. In the present study, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, the rank ordering of super-enhancers (ROSE) algorithm, and RNA interference (RNAi) to explore the regulatory mechanism of PD-specific super-enhancer (SE) in the endosomal sorting pathway and ferroptosis pathway of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats and cells. The ChIP assay and ROSE algorithm results showed that there are specific SEs expression in 6-OHDA-lesioned SNc of PD rats, and the most significant expression gene is Sorting Nexin 5 (SNX5). SNX5 silencing by RNAi experiments significantly decreased the level of ferroptosis in 6-OHDA-lesioned PC12 cells, suggesting the correlation between the SNX5, ferroptosis, and PD. In conclusion, this study investigated the mechanism by which PD-specific SE driven SNX5 promoted the ferroptosis level in PD models. This study further improved the understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis during PD injury and provided potential therapeutic targets and clinical diagnostic markers in PD condition.",Animal-other,5,1
369,1649899,The Journal of general virology,High resolution in situ hybridization to determine the cellular distribution of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus RNA in the tissues of persistently infected mice: relevance to arenavirus disease and mechanisms of viral persistence.,"By the application of in situ hybridization to thin sections of paraffin-embedded tissues we have been able to determine with high resolution the cell types containing lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleic acid in the tissues of persistently infected mice. We confirm and extend previous observations of virus persistence in the brain, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, thyroid and reticuloendothelial system. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time persistence of viral nucleic acid in specific cell types in the thymus, lymph nodes, testes and bladder, and the adrenal, parathyroid and salivary glands; the cell types infected were observed in several animals. In lymphoid tissue, viral nucleic acid was predominantly located in the T cell-dependent areas of the spleen and lymph nodes; it was also present in cells of the thymic medulla. This has important implications for the deficiency in T cell function observed in persistently infected mice. In the testes, viral nucleic acid was detected in spermatogonia but not differentiating spermatocytes and therefore, in this tissue at least, persistence is related to the state of differentiation of the cell. Endocrine and exocrine dysfunctions have been described in persistently infected mice and we report that the highest levels of viral nucleic acid were found in the adrenal gland. The infection of endocrine and exocrine tissue was not pantropic, specific cell types expressed viral nucleic acid in each tissue. In the adrenal cortex, cells of the zona reticularis and zona fasciculata but not the zona glomerulosa were positive, whereas in the adrenal medulla viral nucleic acid was predominantly localized to adrenalin-secreting cells. Infection of the renal tubules, transitional epithelium of the bladder and the ducts of the salivary gland indicates the likely sites of virus production for the dissemination of arenavirus infections.",Animal-other,5,1
370,20513660,Brain : a journal of neurology,Bone morphogenetic protein-7 release from endogenous neural precursor cells suppresses the tumourigenicity of stem-like glioblastoma cells.,"Glioblastoma cells with stem-like properties control brain tumour growth and recurrence. Here, we show that endogenous neural precursor cells perform an anti-tumour response by specifically targeting stem-like brain tumour cells. In vitro, neural precursor cells predominantly express bone morphogenetic protein-7; bone morphogenetic protein-7 is constitutively released from neurospheres and induces canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells. Exposure of human and murine stem-like brain tumour cells to neurosphere-derived bone morphogenetic protein-7 induces tumour stem cell differentiation, attenuates stem-like marker expression and reduces self-renewal and the ability for tumour initiation. Neurosphere-derived or recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-7 reduces glioblastoma expansion from stem-like cells by down-regulating the transcription factor Olig2. In vivo, large numbers of bone morphogenetic protein-7-expressing neural precursors encircle brain tumours in young mice, induce canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells and can thereby attenuate tumour formation. This anti-tumour response is strongly reduced in older mice. Our results indicate that endogenous neural precursor cells protect the young brain from glioblastoma by releasing bone morphogenetic protein-7, which acts as a paracrine tumour suppressor that represses proliferation, self-renewal and tumour-initiation of stem-like glioblastoma cells.",Animal-other,5,1
371,2803826,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,[Morphological studies on estrogen-induced PRL cell hyperplasia in rat pituitary gland--immunocytochemical and scanning electron microscopic studies].,"It is well known that the tumorous lesion in rat anterior pituitary gland occurs after continuous administration of estrogen, which is mainly composed of PRL secreting cells. In this study the changes in rat PRL cells by estrogen treatment were studied histologically and immunocytochemically. Furthermore, intracellular structures in PRL cells were observed by high resolution scanning electron microscopy using the aldehyde prefix osmium-DMSO-osmium method. These rat pituitary tumors were established in Fischer-344 female rats by weekly injections of 2.5 mg estradiol valerate. The estrogen-induced, autonomous and transplantable rat pituitary tumors (MtT/F84) were also studied in the same manner and the findings were compared with estrogen-induced tumors. The increase of weight of pituitary gland and of serum PRL level correlated significantly with the number of estrogen administration. On the basis of histological findings, estrogen-induced pituitary tumors can be classified into two different stages, that is, hypertrophic hyperplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The former corresponds to the period until 6 weeks after the beginning of estrogen treatment and the latter to the period thereafter. In the former, PRL cells were significantly increased in number and volume, and were diffusely immunoreactive for PRL in the cytoplasm. Cell atypism was rarely found. The extent of acidophil staining was well preserved in hematoxylin-eosin staining. Ultrastructurally, organelles were well developed, especially rough endoplasmic reticulum showed whorl formation. Immature, irregularly shaped secretory granules were frequently observed within the Golgi area. Mature granules were richly stored at the periphery of the cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Animal-other,5,1
372,30342963,Experimental neurology,Key determinants for morphine withdrawal conditioned context-induced increase in Arc expression in anterior cingulate cortex and withdrawal memory retrieval.,"Addiction memory is subjected to time-dependent shifts toward neocortex in remote period to promote long-term addiction memory storage, which plays an important role in drug relapse. However, how the activity and neuroplasticity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) change after contextual morphine withdrawal conditioning and what factors determine this change remain to be determined. In this paper, using immunohistochemical and single-cell microinjection techniques, combining behavioral assay, we found that (1) contextual withdrawal conditioning increases the expression of c-Fos, but not Arc, in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (2) at the first day after conditioning, conditioned context has no influence on the expression of c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (3) at the 14th day after conditioning, conditioned context increases the expression of both c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (4) the inhibition of dendritic spines of the ACC or projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC attenuates the conditioned context-induced increase of Arc expression in the ACC and abolishes the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning. These results suggest that the ACC may exhibit a change in neuroplasticity at the 14th day after conditioning, and the dendritic spines of the ACC and the projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC are key determinants for conditioned context induced-increase in Arc expression in the ACC and the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning.",Animal-other,5,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of using a reduced dose of contrast agent, necessary for clinical trials. Experiments were performed on rats at three doses of AMI-227 and clearly show higher VSI values at lower doses, whatever the region of interest (contralateral, peritumoral and intratumoral tissue).

374,27191407,Appetite,Running induces nausea in rats: Kaolin intake generated by voluntary and forced wheel running.,"Three experiments were conducted showing rats' pica behavior (kaolin clay intake) due to running in activity wheels. The amount of kaolin consumed was a positive function of the available time of voluntary running (20, 40, or 60 min), although this relationship was blunted by a descending (i.e., 60 → 40 → 20 min) test series of execution (Experiment 1). Pica was also generated by forced running in a motorized wheel for 60 min as a positive function of the speed of wheel rotations at 98, 185, or 365 m/h, independent of the order of execution (Experiment 2). Voluntary running generated more pica than did forced running at 80 m/h, although the distance travelled in the former condition was 27% lesser than that in the latter condition (Experiment 3). Because kaolin intake is regarded as a reliable measure of nausea in rats, these results show that wheel running, either voluntary or forced, induces nausea in rats.",Animal-other,5,1
375,3095713,Neuroscience letters,Two types of electrocortical paroxysms in an inbred strain of rats.,"In 10 subjects of a particular inbred strain of rats (WAG/Rij), two types of spike-wave complexes were detected in the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) during the two recording hours. The first type, already well-known, occurred in 8 of the 10 rats. This type was seen both during sleep and wakefulness and was accompanied by behavioural concomitants, reminiscent of human petit-mal epilepsy. A mean of 18 discharges/h was found. The second type, a novel one with a differential shape, occurred in 7 rats with a mean number of 14 discharges/h. In contrast to the first one, this spike-wave complex was not accompanied by behavioural correlates and was almost exclusively present during wakefulness. Four reasons make this strain of rats attractive as an additional animal model for epileptogenic activity: the occurrence of two types of spike-wave complexes, the high percentage of animals showing these phenomena, the genetic constitution of these rats and the fact that they are commercially available.",Animal-other,5,1
376,11771945,Experimental neurology,Changes in dopaminergic and glutamatergic excitatory mechanisms of micturition reflex after middle cerebral artery occlusion in conscious rats.,"Previous reports have shown that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic and D2 dopaminergic mechanisms have independent excitatory effects on bladder activity in normal and cerebral infarcted (CI) rats under urethane anesthesia. The study presented here was undertaken to investigate the interaction between these two mechanisms on bladder activity in conscious Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without cerebral infarction. Occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery or a sham operation (SO) was performed under halothane anesthesia. After recovery from the anesthesia, bladder activity was monitored continuously by means of infusion cystometrography in awake rats. The effects of cumulative intravenous doses of quinpirole (0.001-1 mg/kg), a D2 dopamine receptor agonist, were studied in awake SO and CI rats with or without dizocilpine (10 mg/kg) pretreatment. The effects of dizocilpine (1 or 10 mg/kg) were also examined in other SO or CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole. Bladder capacity in CI rats was significantly smaller (0.18 ml) than that in SO rats (0.48 ml). Quinpirole (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) further reduced bladder capacity in both types of rats, an effect blocked by sulpiride (20 mg/kg), a D2 dopamine receptor antagonist. The effect of quinpirole was also antagonized by dizocilpine (1 mg/kg) to a significantly (P < 0.01) greater degree in CI than in SO rats. In SO rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, dizocilpine significantly increased bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. After the maximum dose (10 mg/kg) of dizocilpine, sulpiride did not produce any changes in bladder activity. In CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, 1 mg/kg of dizocilpine increased bladder capacity. After administration of the maximum dose of dizocilpine (10 mg/kg), which did not produce an additional effect, sulpiride (20 mg/kg) increased bladder capacity by 58.3%. These results indicate that in awake rats D2 dopaminergic excitatory effects on the urinary bladder are mediated in part by NMDA glutamatergic mechanisms and in part by non-NMDA mechanisms. The latter type was more prominent in CI rats, indicating that the bladder hyperactivity induced by cerebral infarction may be mediated by an alteration in dopaminergic-glutamatergic interactions in the brain.",Animal-other,5,1
377,6619955,Journal of neurosurgical sciences,Metabolic changes in the hippocampus after prolonged epileptic discharge.,"Sustained epileptic seizures were induced in cats by means of penicillin (PCN). After a three hour period tissue from the archicortex was removed, frozen, and extracted for metabolic studies. The concentration of ATP, ADP, AMP, phosphocreatine, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate, glutamate and aspartate were determined. There was a 50% decrease in phosphocreatine concentration, a slight decrease in the level of ATP and a slight increase in the levels of ADP and AMP. There was a decrease in the total adenine nucleotide and the ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios. The absence of a significant change in adenylate energy charge potential reflects the remarkable ability of the brain to stabilize its energy state even after intense seizure activity. A reflection of increased glycolysis is the presence of decreased glucose (nearly 50%), and increased lactate, concentrations. The metabolic changes observed in the archicortex are comparable to those observed by others in the neocortex, indicating perhaps the relative metabolic uniformity of these two types of cortex.",Animal-other,5,1
378,12614343,Journal of neurochemistry,In vivo nicotine treatment regulates mesocorticolimbic CREB and ERK signaling in C57Bl/6J mice.,"The extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway was studied to determine its role in neuronal plasticity related to the development of nicotine dependence. Levels and phosphorylation state of ERK, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and proline-rich/Ca2+-activated tyrosine kinase (PYK2), and levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), were determined using western blotting. C57Bl/6J mice received acute or chronic nicotine (200 microg/mL) in their drinking water or were withdrawn from nicotine for 24 h following chronic exposure. CREB phosphorylation was reduced in the nucleus accumbens following chronic nicotine, consistent with previous reports that decreased accumbens CREB activity increases drug reinforcement. In contrast, CREB phosphorylation was increased in the prefrontal cortex following chronic nicotine exposure and in the ventral tegmental area during nicotine withdrawal. In addition, total and phosphorylated ERK decreased in the amygdala following chronic nicotine exposure, but ERK phosphorylation increased in the prefrontal cortex. TH levels increased in both the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, supporting the hypothesis that increased catecholaminergic tone contributes to nicotine reinforcement. Overall, these results support a role for ERK and CREB activity in neural plasticity associated with nicotine dependence.",Animal-other,5,1
379,6891758,Neurotoxicology,Neurotoxicity of methylmercury in the pigeon.,"Pigeons repeatedly exposed to sublethal doses of methylmercury (5-10 mg Hg/kg/wk, po, for 34-77 days) exhibited marked behavioral changes that were accompanied by only minor evidence of neuropathologic changes at the light microscopic level. Accuracy and rate of pecking for grain declined while food intake remained unchanged. Methylmercury produced permanent changes in posture and in motor coordination. The regional distribution of methylmercury within the nervous system was poorly correlated with the distribution of pathologic changes. Overt behavioral signs appeared after the brain accumulated more than about 12 to 16 ppm Hg. Data with pigeons support earlier evidence that the dose-response function for methylmercury is modulated by dose rate and duration of exposure, since the pattern of blood and tissue distribution of Hg is established in advance of the appearance of signs. The pigeon is more sensitive to methylmercury than are mice and rats, but less sensitive than primates.",Animal-other,5,1
380,8102036,The American journal of physiology,Autonomic control of pancreatic polypeptide and glucagon secretion during neuroglucopenia and hypoglycemia in mice.,"Neural control of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release has not been previously investigated in the mouse. In addition, it is not known to what extent increased glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia in mice is neurally mediated vs. an effect of hypoglycemia to directly stimulate glucagon secretion at the level of the islet. Feeding or the cholinergic agonist carbachol increased plasma PP levels in conscious mice (+74 +/- 18 pg/ml vs. fasted mice and +141 +/- 17 pg/ml vs. control, respectively). Neuroglucopenia induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose or insulin-induced hypoglycemia also increased plasma PP (+79 +/- 18 and +89 +/- 11 pg/ml vs. control, respectively). These increases were abolished by hexamethonium and reduced by atropine methylnitrate (atropine). Hypoglycemia-induced hyperglucagonemia (+1,243 +/- 275 pg/ml) was reduced to 31 +/- 7% of control by atropine (+382 +/- 85 pg/ml), to 48 +/- 9% of control by combined adrenergic blockade (+601 +/- 112 pg/ml), and nearly abolished by atropine plus combined blockade (+143 +/- 41 pg/ml; 11 +/- 3% of control) or hexamethonium (+151 +/- 38 pg/ml; 12 +/- 3% of control). We conclude the following in the mouse. 1) Feeding or cholinergic agonists increase plasma PP. 2) During neuroglucopenia or hypoglycemia, plasma PP is increased via nicotinic and muscarinic mechanisms. 3) The glucagon response to hypoglycemia is predominantly the result of autonomic activation and is mediated by both muscarinic and adrenergic mechanisms.",Animal-other,5,1
381,32514154,Scientific reports,A heritable profile of six miRNAs in autistic patients and mouse models.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of developmental pathologies that impair social communication and cause repetitive behaviors. The suggested roles of noncoding RNAs in pathology led us to perform a comparative analysis of the microRNAs expressed in the serum of human ASD patients. The analysis of a cohort of 45 children with ASD revealed that six microRNAs (miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-3613-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-499a-5p) were expressed at low to very low levels compared to those in healthy controls. A similar but less pronounced decrease was registered in the clinically unaffected parents of the sick children and in their siblings but never in any genetically unrelated control. Results consistent with these observations were obtained in the blood, hypothalamus and sperm of two of the established mouse models of ASD: valproic acid-treated animals and Cc2d1a[+/-] heterozygotes. In both instances, the same characteristic miRNA profile was evidenced in the affected individuals and inherited together with disease symptoms in the progeny of crosses with healthy animals. The consistent association of these genetic regulatory changes with the disease provides a starting point for evaluating the changes in the activity of the target genes and, thus, the underlying mechanism(s). From the applied societal and medical perspectives, once properly confirmed in large cohorts, these observations provide tools for the very early identification of affected children and progenitors.",Animal-other,5,1

Ouabain and the vehicle aCSF were microinjected into the left lateral ventricle immediately, after 4h, and after 24h. The results showed that (a) locomotion responses of the Immediate group were significantly decreased compared to those of the aCSF group, particularly the first five minutes. (b) The ouabain-treated rats have longer latency and total distance traveled in the water maze task; however, the velocity was not affected for the ouabain group. (c) The analysis of covariance showed that the latency time (but not the total distance traveled and velocity) of the ouabain group was more impaired than that of the aCSF group, regardless of omitting total distance traveled and cross movement in the open field test. The latency might be more sensitive than the distance traveled and the velocity for assessing spatial learning. Dissociating the spatial learning from the movement may allow testing drug treatments of cognitive deficits independent of locomotor effects associated with bipolar disorder.",Animal-other,5,1
383,10678495,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,Time-dependent striatal dopamine depletion after injection of 6-hydroxydopamine in the rat. Comparison of single bilateral and double bilateral lesions.,"For future investigation of possible perturbation of circadian rhythm in animal models of Parkinson's disease we needed an animal model providing lasting 80-100% striatal dopaminergic depletion in rats, but without induced mortality. We have thus compared the effects of a single hydroxydopamine bilateral striatal lesion (SB-hydroxydopamine) with those of a double hydroxydopamine bilateral lesion (DB-hydroxydopamine) at the same dose (16 microg/striatum) by HPLC determination of dopamine and 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (dopac) levels in the striatum. Two weeks after neurosurgery, SB-hydroxydopamine and DB-hydroxydopamine induced dopaminergic depletion of at least 81% compared with control groups. After eight weeks striatal dopaminergic depletion was only 60.97% in SB-hydroxydopamine rats, suggesting a compensatory phenomenon, whereas in DB-hydroxydopamine rats dopaminergic loss was stable at 88%. For the DB-hydroxydopamine group the dopac/dopamine ratio was significantly increased at week 2 only, whereas no significant change was observed for other groups. This increase might be explained by increased dopamine turnover. We have demonstrated that striatal DB-hydroxydopamine injection induces lasting 80-100% neuronal loss, close to that observed in the disease in man, without induced mortality, and provides a tool which meets our experimental requirements.",Animal-other,5,1

The number of naloxone-sensitive 3H-DHM binding sites was increased 38-57% in the pyramidal cell layer of ventral hippocampal CA3 and Ca1 of GEPR-3 and GEPR-9 rats compared to non-epileptic controls. No significant differences in 3H-DHM binding were observed in dorsal hippocampal formation, lateral entorhinal cortex, lateral geniculate or cerebellum. The results suggest that an increase in the number of opioid receptors in ventral hippocampus of GEPR rats may be one factor contributing to the enhanced sensitivity of GEPR-9 rats to the proconvulsant effects of morphine.",Animal-other,5,1
385,31272300,Veterinary pathology,Spontaneous Incidental Brain Lesions in C57BL/6J Mice.,"Genetically engineered mouse lines on a C57BL/6J background are widely employed as preclinical models to study neurodegenerative human disorders and brain tumors. However, because of the lack of comprehensive data on the spontaneous background neuropathology of the C57BL/6J strain, discriminating between naturally occurring changes and lesions caused by experimental mutations can be challenging. In this context, this study aims at defining the spectrum and frequency of spontaneous brain changes in a large cohort of C57BL/6J mice and their association with specific biological variables, including age and sex. Brains from 203 experimentally naive and clinically unremarkable C57BL/6J mice were collected and analyzed by means of histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Mice ranged in age from 3 to 110 weeks with 89 females, 111 males, and 3 unknowns. Sixteen different spontaneous lesion categories were described in this cohort. Age-related neurodegenerative and/or neuroinflammatory findings represented the most common pathologic changes and included (1) Hirano-like inclusions in the thalamic neurons, (2) neuroaxonal dystrophy in the medulla oblongata, (3) periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular deposits in the neuropil of the hippocampus, and (4) progressive neuroinflammation characterized by microgliosis and astrogliosis. Neoplastic conditions, developmental abnormalities, and circulatory disorders were rarely observed incidental findings. In conclusion, this study describes spontaneous age-related brain lesions of the C57BL/6J mouse and provides a reference for evaluating and interpreting the neuropathological phenotype in genetically engineered mouse models developed and maintained on this congenic background.",Animal-other,5,1
386,7732774,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,Somatosensory evoked potentials in cerebral ischemia of rabbits.,"Twenty-one rabbits were used in the ischemic group and six in the control group. Cerebral ischemia of variable degree was induced by Fe particle injection method. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were compared when the CBF levels decreased to their minimum. The latency of the SEPs increased along with the decrease of the CBF when it was lower than 20 ml/100 g/min (68% of the pre-ischemic control level). This may be related to the ischemic change of the white matter. The amplitude showed diphasic changes. When the CBF decreased below 20 ml/100 g/min, the amplitude increased; when the CBF was lower than 11 ml/100 g/min (38% of the pre-ischemic level), it decreased. These results indicate that the functions of the cerebral cortex might be excited in mild ischemia, and be suppressed in severe ischemia.",Animal-other,5,1
387,20451518,Experimental neurology,Analysis of combinatorial variability reveals selective accumulation of the fibronectin type III domains B and D of tenascin-C in injured brain.,"Tenascin-C (Tnc) is a multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is markedly upregulated in CNS injuries where it is primarily secreted by reactive astrocytes. Different Tnc isoforms can be generated by the insertion of variable combinations of one to seven (in rats) alternatively spliced distinct fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains to the smallest variant. Each spliced FnIII repeat mediates specific actions on neurite outgrowth, neuron migration or adhesion. Hence, different Tnc isoforms might differentially influence CNS repair. We explored the expression pattern of Tnc variants after cortical lesions and after treatment of astrocytes with various cytokines. Using RT-PCR, we observed a strong upregulation of Tnc transcripts containing the spliced FnIII domains B or D in injured tissue at 2-4 days post-lesion (dpl). Looking at specific combinations, we showed a dramatic increase of Tnc isoforms harboring the neurite outgrowth-promoting BD repeat with both the B and D domains being adjacent to each other. Isoforms containing only the axon growth-stimulating spliced domain D were also dramatically enhanced after injury. Injury-induced increase of Tnc proteins comprising the domain D was confirmed by Western Blotting and immunostaining of cortical lesions. In contrast, the FnIII modules C and AD1 were weakly modulated after injury. The growth cone repulsive A1A2A4 domains were poorly expressed in normal and injured tissue but the smallest isoform, which is also repellant, was highly expressed after injury. Expression of the shortest Tnc isoform and of variants containing B, D or BD, was strongly upregulated in cultured astrocytes after TGFbeta1 treatment, suggesting that TGFbeta1 could mediate, at least in part, the injury-induced upregulation of these isoforms. We identified complex injury-induced differential regulations of Tnc isoforms that may well influence axonal regeneration and repair processes in the damaged CNS.",Animal-other,5,1
388,25402009,Developmental neuroscience,Spontaneous pre-existing hypoxia does not affect brain damage after global cerebral ischaemia in late-gestation fetal sheep.,"There is considerable evidence that a mild, non-injurious insult can protect (precondition) against a subsequent injurious insult. Typically, protection is seen when the gap between insults is several days to a week. However, the effect of mild but persistent hypoxia is unknown. In this study we examined the hypothesis that mild pre-existing hypoxia (PaO2<17 mm Hg) would reduce neural injury in chronically instrumented late-gestation (0.85 gestation) fetal sheep exposed to 30 min of global cerebral ischaemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion (normoxia: n=9 vs. pre-existing hypoxia: n=9) or normoxia plus sham ischaemia (sham controls: n=9). Histopathology was assessed after 7 days of recovery. Fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia had lower PaO2 values (16.1±0.6 vs. 26.0±1.1 mm Hg) and were lighter at post-mortem (4,033±412 vs. 5,261±238 g) compared to normoxic fetuses. Cerebral ischaemia was associated with secondary cortical oedema and seizures, reduced final EEG power, loss of sleep state cycling, and significant loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, with no significant effect of pre-existing hypoxia. Pre-existing hypoxia was associated with a significantly attenuated rise in mean arterial pressure between 18 and 36 h and slower resolution of cortical oedema between 96 and 150 h after ischaemia. These data suggest that chronic hypoxia is not associated with a significant preconditioning effect.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

A prospective, controlled study was performed in ten eyes of five rabbits with anatomically normal eyes. These eyes were divided into two groups according to the amount of slanted recession. In right eyes, slanted superior recti (SR) muscle recession was performed with 6 mm of nasal margin and 2 mm of temporal margin (4-mm slanting group), and in fellow eyes, slanted SR muscle recession was performed with 6 mm and 4 mm, respectively (2-mm slanting group). We measured both margins of superior recti from insertion, and calculated the amount of anterior creeping movement of both margins at 30, 60, and 90 postoperative days, and also compared the change of slanting degree of the SR muscle between the two groups.	Slanting degrees showed a gradual decrease in all rabbit eyes. In the 4-mm slanting group, each margin of anterior movement was 2.4.mm (nasal) and 0.9 mm (temporal) and slanting degrees decreased in 50 -7 5%. In the 2-mm slanting group, the margins of anterior movement were 2.9 mm and 1.8 mm respectively, and slanting degrees decreased in 25 ∼ 50%. The amount of slanting degree showed a greater decrease in the 4-mm group than in the 2-mm group at postoperative 3 months (p = 0.045).	Both margins of extraocular muscle in slanted recession showed anterior movement at postoperative 3 months; therefore, the effectiveness of slanted recession might be decreased postoperatively.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
391,19469685,Journal of neurotrauma,Axonal outgrowth and Erk1/2 activation by training after spinal cord injury in rats.,"Abstract Physical training in experimental animals can improve locomotor activity via the regulation of spinal neural circuitry or peripheral nerve regeneration. Here we investigated the effects of treadmill training (TMT) on regenerative responses of the corticospinal tract (CST) after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI). One week after injury of the low thoracic spinal cord, rats were given TMT or sedentary treatment for 1-4 weeks. Anterograde tracing of descending CST axons revealed that TMT enhanced collateral arborization of CST axons surrounding the injury cavity and promoted extension into the caudal spinal cord. The number of oligodendrocytes in the vicinity of the injury cavity was significantly increased at 2 or 4 weeks after TMT compared to sedentary controls. The data further showed that TMT increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in the motor cortex as well as the spinal cord injury area, and inhibition of Erk1/2 activity by administration of the MEK1 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 reduced collateral outgrowth of descending CST axons in TMT animals. TMT for 2-4 weeks significantly improved behavioral scores as assessed by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale, as well as on motor function and gridwalk testing. Our data imply that Erk1/2 may be an important mediator for transmitting signals from the injury site to the cell body, and further suggest that activation of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway may be involved in enhanced outgrowth of CST axons after TMT.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Recently, cell-based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been explored as an effective treatment for CNS diseases. Among the various tissue-derived MSCs, we have isolated human cranial bone-derived MSCs (cMSCs) in our laboratory. In addition, we have focused on simulated microgravity (MG) as a valuable culture environment of MSCs. However, detailed mechanisms underlying functional recovery from transplantation of MSCs cultured under MG conditions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice. Human cMSCs were cultured under 1G and MG conditions, and cMSCs cultured under MG conditions expressed significantly higher messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). In TBI model mice, the transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions (group MG) showed greater motor functional improvement compared with only phosphate-buffered saline administration (group PBS). Moreover, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/b cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) ratio were significantly lower at brain injury sites in mice of group MG than those of group PBS. In addition, an in vitro study showed that the conditioned medium of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions significantly suppressed the cell death of NG108-15 cells exposed to oxidative or inflammatory stress through anti-inflammatory and antiapoptosis effects. These findings demonstrate that culturing cMSCs under simulated MG increases the neuroprotective effects, suggesting that simulated MG cultures may be a useful method for cell-based therapy strategies for CNS diseases.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

They were asked to chew the gum for 1 month and then to undergo a 4-day nicotine gum deprivation period. The results showed a number of significant changes occurring after deprivation from 4 mg gum, one change from 2 mg gum, and no changes from 0 mg gum. There were no significant differences in severity of withdrawal among the various doses of nicotine gum. There were more severe symptoms of withdrawal from cigarette as opposed to 4 mg nicotine gum deprivation.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
394,28817491,Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,Speed of Improvement in Symptoms of Depression With Desvenlafaxine 50 mg and 100 mg Compared With Placebo in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder.,"This post hoc analysis examined the time point at which clinically significant improvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms occurs with desvenlafaxine versus placebo.	Data were pooled from 9 short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD randomly assigned to desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d, 100 mg/d, or placebo. A mixed-effects model for repeated-measures analysis of change from baseline score was used to determine the time point at which desvenlafaxine treatment groups separated from placebo on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and psychosocial outcomes. The association between early improvement and week 8 outcomes was examined using logistic regression analyses. Time to remission for patients with early improvement versus without early improvement was assessed using Kaplan-Meier techniques. Comparisons between groups were performed with log-rank tests.	In the intent-to-treat population (N = 4279 patients: desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d, n = 1714; desvenlafaxine 100 mg/d, n = 870; placebo, n = 1695), a statistically significant improvement on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was observed with desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d at week 1 (P = 0.0129) and with desvenlafaxine 100 mg/d at week 2 (P = 0.0002) versus placebo. Early improvement was a significant predictor of later remission. Treatment assignment, baseline depression scale scores, and race were significantly associated with probability of early improvement. On several measures of depressive symptoms and function, desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d and 100 mg/d separated from placebo as early as week 1 and no later than week 4 in patients with MDD.	These findings suggest that clinicians may be able to use depression rating scale scores early in treatment as a guide to inform treatment optimization.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
395,27465265,Diabetes care,Pioglitazone Prevents Diabetes in Patients With Insulin Resistance and Cerebrovascular Disease.,"The Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke (IRIS) trial recently found that pioglitazone reduced risk for stroke and myocardial infarction in patients with insulin resistance but without diabetes who had had a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). This report provides detailed results on the metabolic effects of pioglitazone and the trial's prespecified secondary aim of diabetes prevention.	A total of 3,876 patients with recent ischemic stroke or TIA, no history of diabetes, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <126 mg/dL, and insulin resistance by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score >3.0 were randomly assigned to pioglitazone or placebo. Surveillance for diabetes onset during the trial was accomplished by periodic interviews and annual FPG testing.	At baseline, the mean FPG, HbA1c, insulin, and HOMA-IR were 98.2 mg/dL (5.46 mmol/L), 5.8% (40 mmol/mol), 22.4 μIU/mL, and 5.4, respectively. After 1 year, mean HOMA-IR and FPG decreased to 4.1 and 95.1 mg/dL (5.28 mmol/L) in the pioglitazone group and rose to 5.7 and 99.7 mg/dL (5.54 mmol/L), in the placebo group (all P < 0.0001). Over a median follow-up of 4.8 years, diabetes developed in 73 (3.8%) participants assigned to pioglitazone compared with 149 (7.7%) assigned to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48 [95% CI 0.33-0.69]; P < 0.0001). This effect was predominately driven by those with initial impaired fasting glucose (FPG >100 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L]; HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.30-0.57]) or elevated HbA1c (>5.7% [39 mmol/mol]; HR 0.46 [0.34-0.62]).	Among patients with insulin resistance but without diabetes who had had a recent ischemic stroke or TIA, pioglitazone decreased the risk of diabetes while also reducing the risk of subsequent ischemic events. Pioglitazone is the first medication shown to prevent both progression to diabetes and major cardiovascular events as prespecified outcomes in a single trial.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
396,31944580,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,Polysomnographic assessment of suvorexant in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease dementia and insomnia: a randomized trial.,"We evaluated the clinical profile of the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant for treating insomnia in patients with mild-to-moderate probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia.	Randomized, double-blind, 4-week trial of suvorexant 10 mg (could be increased to 20 mg based on clinical response) or placebo in patients who met clinical diagnostic criteria for both probable AD dementia and insomnia. Sleep was assessed by overnight polysomnography in a sleep laboratory. The primary endpoint was change-from-baseline in polysomnography-derived total sleep time (TST) at week 4.	Of 285 participants randomized (suvorexant, N = 142; placebo, N = 143), 277 (97%) completed the trial (suvorexant, N = 136; placebo, N = 141). At week 4, the model-based least squares mean improvement-from-baseline in TST was 73 minutes for suvorexant and 45 minutes for placebo; (difference = 28 minutes [95% confidence interval 11-45], p < 0.01). Somnolence was reported in 4.2% of suvorexant-treated patients and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients.	Suvorexant improved TST in patients with probable AD dementia and insomnia.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

This was a 28-day open-label study (NCT02577523) in PD patients with ≥2.5 hours/day of OFF time despite optimized treatment. Patients were randomized to treatment with either a 24-hour infusion (levodopa/carbidopa dose of 720/90 mg) or a 14-hour 'waking-day' infusion (levodopa/carbidopa dose of 538/68 mg plus a morning oral dose of 150/15 mg). Supplemental oral doses of levodopa were permitted for patients in both groups if required. In-clinic assessments of OFF time (primary endpoint) and ON time with or without dyskinesia were determined by a blinded rater over 8 hours (normalized to 16 hours).	A total of 38 patients were randomized and 33 (87%) completed the study. Compared to baseline, OFF time for the overall population was reduced by a least squares (LS) mean[95% CI] of 2.0[- 3.3, - 0.7] hours (p = 0.003). ON time with no/mild dyskinesia (no troublesome dyskinesia) was increased from baseline by a LS mean of 3.3[2.0, 4.6] hours (p < 0.0001), and ON time with moderate/severe dyskinesia was reduced by a LS mean of 1.2[- 1.8, - 0.5] hours (p≤0.001). Reduction in OFF time was larger in the 24-hour group (- 2.8[- 4.6, - 0.9] hours; p = 0.004) than in the 14-hour group (- 1.3[- 3.1, 0.5] hours; p = 0.16). Complete resolution of OFF time was observed in 42% (n = 8) of patients in the 24-hour group. Infusion site reactions were the most common adverse event.	This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of continuous subcutaneous delivery of levodopa as a treatment for PD and provides preliminary evidence of efficacy.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

However, studies are inadequate on the utility of prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy in patients with hemorrhagic stroke, and the results remains controversial.	This study aims to determine if short-duration sodium valproate prevents seizure onset or improves the survival and neurological outcome in adults after acute spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage.	In this randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 258 patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital. In addition to standard care, patients will be randomly assigned to receive seven-day prophylaxis of sodium valproate 500 mg daily (alternatively 400 mg daily by intravenous infusion in 250 ml 0·9% normal saline) or matching placebo. Patients will be followed up at seven-days, 3, 6, and 12 months.	The primary outcomes are early (≤7 days) and late onset seizures (>7 days). Secondary outcomes include midline shift, enlargement of hematoma, death (all cause), adverse effects, and functional outcome assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale and modified Rankin Scale.	Given the lack of evidence for seizure prophylaxis in patients with acute supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage, randomized controlled trials are desperately needed. The results from our study are believed to directly influence future prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy of intracerebral hemorrhage.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
399,36451226,Addiction science & clinical practice,Tobacco cessation among smokers under substance use treatment for alcohol and/or cannabis: study protocol and pilot study.,"Approximately 80% of people with a substance use disorder (SUD) are smokers. Starting SUD treatment offers the opportunity to also quit smoking. The ACT-ATAC project aims to identify the predictors associated with smoking cessation among persons treated for alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder in Barcelona. This manuscript reports its methodology and the experience of carrying it out during the COVID-19 pandemic.	Mixed methods project with three substudies. Substudy 1 (S1) comprises heterogeneous discussion groups among clinicians. S2 has two prospective cohorts composed of smokers under treatment for alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder and the clinicians in charge of these patients. Participating smokers will be followed for 12 months and interviewed about their substance use and the tobacco cessation services received using the Spanish version of the users' Knowledge, Attitudes, and Services (S-KAS) scale. The clinicians will be asked about their self-reported practices in smoking cessation using the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (S-KAP) scale. S3 comprises heterogeneous discussion groups with smokers. Data will be triangulated using qualitative and quantitative analyses. To facilitate the recruitment process, the researchers have introduced several strategies (design clear protocols, set monthly online meetings, extend the project, provide gift cards, etc.).	The results of S1 were used to develop the questionnaires. S2 required some adjustments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the follow-up interviews being conducted by phone instead of face-to-face, and the recruitment rhythm was lower than expected. Recruitment will last until reaching at least 200-250 users. The fieldwork could not have been possible without the collaboration of the ACT-ATAC team and the introduction of several strategies. Trial registration The ACT-ATAC project has been successfully registered at Clinicaltrials.gov [NCT04841655].",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
400,31023125,Scandinavian journal of urology,The rate of deterioration of erectile function increases with age: results from a longitudinal population based survey.,"Background: Increasing age as a risk factor for erectile dysfunction (ED) is in most studies assumed to be a linear function. If this is not the case the assumption could lead to bias, e.g. when men of different ages are compared in interventional studies on ED. Objective: To explore the risk of developing ED over time for men from different age groups. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was sent to a number of male residents in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1992 (n = 10,458). Men were randomly selected according to year of birth to obtain several cohorts at 5-year intervals of ages 45, 50, 55 years, etc., up to the age of 85 or older. In 2003 an analogous, slightly expanded, questionnaire was sent to a random sample of men from the age cohorts 46, 51 years, etc. (n = 10,845). A total of 4072 men received both surveys, thereby constituting a group of men followed longitudinally for 11 years. The future risk of developing ED in the different age cohorts, adjusted for a number of ED risk factors, was then assessed. Results: A total of 3257 men responded to both questionnaires (response rate = 80%, age range = 56-103 years). The risk of having ED increased substantially with increasing age, both within each survey and longitudinally between the surveys. The adjusted risk of developing ED within the next 11 years increased with a factor of 10, from 1.8% at the age of 45 years at baseline to as much as 11.4% at the age of 65 years. Conclusion: Age as a risk-factor for ED is a non-linear function and should be adjusted as such to avoid bias when including men of different ages in interventional studies on ED.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
