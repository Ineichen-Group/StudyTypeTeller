1,10174515,Health services management research,Programme budgeting revisited: special reference to people with learning disabilities.,"The recent reorganization of community care in the UK removed many of the perverse incentives identified in the previous system. However, the organization of care for many people is still divided across several agencies in the public and independent sectors. As purchasing and providing agencies in both the National Health Service and local authority personal social services attempt to coordinate policy objectives and the means to achieve them, the total resources available and their allocation across different care groups and among people in the same care groups from a consistent focus of attention. The principles and practice of programme budgeting provide important lessons for planning and monitoring expenditure. This paper rehearses such principles in the specialized area of policies for people with learning disabilities and draws on the experience of mapping expenditure on relevant services in a survey over 10 local authorities in England.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
2,1308085,African journal of medicine and medical sciences,Alzheimer's disease in Nigeria.,"The age-related dementias of the elderly (those aged 65 years or more) are of major public health importance in developed countries. Developing countries, most of which are undergoing epidemiological transition and greying of population, currently contain more than half of the world's population of elderly, a proportion that would reach 75% by 2020. Apart from reports from China, there is little or no information on the dementias of the elderly in developing countries. Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for two-thirds of dementia of the elderly in Caucasian population, is under-documented and believed to be rare in black Africans. But black Americans who are of black African lineage commonly suffer from Alzheimer's disease. A recent autopsy survey of the brains of elderly Nigerians showed absence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the pathognomonic histologic lesions of Alzheimer's disease and ageing found in 25% to 80% of normal undemented elderly Caucasians and Japanese. In a community-based door-to-door survey of a population of 9000, including 932 elderly Nigerians, no subject with dementia as defined by DSM-IIIR was found, although there was significant decline of cognition with age, female sex and less than 6 years of formal education. The distribution of cognitive scores is a highly skewed unimodal curve. We emphasize the potential value of cross-cultural epidemiological studies of ethnic groups in different environments and with different prevalence ratios of Alzheimer's disease, in identifying putative environmental factors for this disease.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
3,2664852,"Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",[The patient with psychogenic and psychosomatic pain. Outline of psychoanalytically oriented nosology].,"Starting with the contribution of G. L. Engel (1959) a systematization of the psychodynamic conceptions of pain and pain disorder is given. Four different explanations for the genesis and maintenance of pain states are worked out: (1) The narcissistic mechanism (substitution), (2) the conversion mechanism (symbolization), introduced by S. Freud himself, (3) the psychovegative mechanism (resomatization), and (4) learning principles. These four conceptions are presented. Finally concern is expressed as the conceptual range of three of these explanatory principles is thought to cover a relevant range by far not reached by other pain theories more en vogue.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
4,12697002,CNS drugs,The triptan formulations : how to match patients and products.,"The 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists (the 'triptans') are migraine-specific agents that have revolutionised the treatment of migraine. They are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available in various strengths and formulations, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the triptans exist, as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including half-life, time to peak plasma concentrations, peak plasma concentrations, area under the concentration-time curve, metabolism and drug-drug interaction profiles. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability advantages for one agent over another is not well differentiated. However, delivery systems may play an important role in onset of action. Given that the clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle, identification of the most appropriate triptan for an individual patient requires consideration of the specific characteristics of the patient and knowledge of patient preference, an accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute-care medications and individual features of the drug being considered. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug also depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. Individual patient response to the triptans seems to be idiosyncratic and possibly genetically determined. Therefore, a set of specific questions can be used to determine whether a currently used triptan is optimally effective, whether the dose needs to be increased or whether another triptan should be tried. The clinician has in his/her armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of triptans, available in multiple formulations and dosages, which have good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimise therapeutic benefit. Use of the methods outlined in this review in choosing a triptan for an individual patient is probably more likely to lead to migraine relief than making an educated guess as to which triptan is most appropriate.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

6,3489155,Medicine,Renal disease from habitual antipyretic analgesic consumption: an assessment of the epidemiologic evidence.,"The quantitative evidence relating habitual antipyretic analgesic consumption to the development of renal disease is reviewed. For purposes of analysis, 'abuse' of analgesics is defined as regular, usually daily consumption. The prevalence of habitual consumption demonstrates marked geographic variation for poorly defined reasons. Prevalence tended to be highest in those populations in which phenacetin was available and popular. The prevalence of nephropathy among habitual consumers also shows marked interpopulation variability. A highly significant linear relationship exists between the prevalence of habitual analgesic consumption in a given population and the prevalence of nephropathy in the subset of that population that habitually consumes analgesics. This relationship may represent a dose-response curve relating amount of analgesic intake to prevalence of nephropathy. Four cross-sectional studies, 1 longitudinal, and 1 case-control study have shown significant differences in prevalence of nephropathy between habitual users of phenacetin-containing analgesics and control populations. Conversely, 2 cross-sectional studies and 1 case control study showed no difference between habitual users of analgesics and control populations. However, those studies showing no difference were performed in populations with low prevalence of habitual consumption of compound analgesics and a lower prevalence of nephropathy than was found in those populations where differences were observed. The relative risk for developing various manifestations of analgesic nephropathy has been estimated in 4 studies and varies depending on which abnormality is considered. Data are available only for subjects consuming phenacetin-containing compound analgesics. The relative risk for elevated serum creatinine is in the range of 8 to 11, about twice that for an abnormal renal concentrating test (approximately 4). The relative risk for clinical papillary necrosis is approximately 18, and for cause-specific death (and by inference for end-stage renal disease) about 4. The difference in risk between most clinical manifestations of analgesic nephropathy and death (or end-stage renal disease) may be due to the fact that most patients with nephropathy do not progress to terminal renal failure. Rheumatology clinic studies indicate that the prevalence of nephropathy in habitual consumers of phenacetin-containing compounds is higher than that for habitual consumers of aspirin alone. Removal of phenacetin from compound analgesics in Scandinavian countries appears to have reduced the prevalence of papillary necrosis and death from interstitial nephritis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Non-systematic-review,1,0
7,14604504,Current pain and headache reports,"Diagnosis, epidemiology, and impact of tension-type headache.","Although tension-type headache is the most prevalent headache and affects 78% of the general population, the substantial societal and individual burden associated with this primary headache has been overlooked. In contrast to migraine headache, there has been limited focus on tension-type headache. Most patients with the chronic form of tension-type headache, which affects 3% of the population, are left virtually without any specific treatment. Chronic tension-type headache differs from the episodic form in frequency, lack of effect to most treatment strategies, more medication overuse, and more loss of quality of life. Daily or near daily headaches also constitute a major diagnostic and therapeutic problem and distinguishing chronic tension-type headache from migraine headache and from medication-induced headache is a substantial diagnostic challenge because management strategies are completely different. Considerable benefits for the society can be gained by specific strategies leading to reductions in the amount of sickness absence and impaired working abilities. The burden on the affected patients' and their families' quality of life also may be improved by a general acceptance of the disorder and by the development of a specific treatment strategy.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Probing inflammation, a critical secondary cell death mechanism in stroke, has been largely relegated to the brain. To this end, peripheral inflammation has emerged as an equally potent contributor to the onset and progression of stroke secondary cell death. Here, we review novel concepts on peripheral organs displaying robust inflammatory response to stroke. These inflammation-plagued organs include the spleen, cervical lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, gastrointestinal system, and adrenal glands, likely converging their inflammatory effects through B and T-cells. Recognizing the significant impact of this systemic inflammation, we also discuss innovative stroke therapeutics directed at sequestration of peripheral inflammation. This review paper challenges the paradigm of a brain-centered disease pathology and treatment and offers a peripheral approach to our stroke understanding.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Using the harmful dysfunction analysis of the concept of disorder (Wakefield, 1992a, American Psychologist, 47, 373-388) as a framework, I argue that DSM-IV criteria for many diagnostic categories fail to satisfy the analysis' dysfunction' requirement, that is, the criteria do not distinguish harmful conditions due to internal dysfunctions from harmful conditions that are nondisordered 'problems in living'. The overinclusiveness problem, I suggest, can be partly dealt with by giving up purely symptomatic criteria and contextualizing diagnosis to take into account the relationship between triggering causes and resulting symptoms.

15,29063964,Psychopharmacology,Phytocannabinoids modulate emotional memory processing through interactions with the ventral hippocampus and mesolimbic dopamine system: implications for neuropsychiatric pathology.,"Growing clinical and preclinical evidence suggests a potential role for the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) as a pharmacotherapy for various neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, is associated with acute and neurodevelopmental propsychotic side effects through its interaction with central cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs). CB1R stimulation in the ventral hippocampus (VHipp) potentiates affective memory formation through inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, thereby altering emotional salience attribution. These changes in DA activity and salience attribution, evoked by dysfunctional VHipp regulatory actions and THC exposure, could predispose susceptible individuals to psychotic symptoms. Although THC can accelerate the onset of schizophrenia, CBD displays antipsychotic properties, can prevent the acquisition of emotionally irrelevant memories, and reverses amphetamine-induced neuronal sensitization through selective phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) molecular signaling pathway. This review summarizes clinical and preclinical evidence demonstrating that distinct phytocannabinoids act within the VHipp and associated corticolimbic structures to modulate emotional memory processing through changes in mesolimbic DA activity states, salience attribution, and signal transduction pathways associated with schizophrenia-related pathology.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

18,18514148,L'Encephale,[Folie à deux: update of an old concept regarding two cases].,"Folie à deux or induced delusional disorder is a rare mental disorder. It was initially described by the French Lasègue and Falret in 1877. Two subjects, who live in a close relationship, in isolation, share delusional ideas based on the same themes. Various classifications exist. Its epidemiology remains unclear, because most of the data have been extrapolated from case reports.	In this paper, we describe and comment two cases of shared paranoid disorder: in the first case report, a husband shares the paranoiac delusion of his wife; the second case report describes a shared paranoid disorder between a schizophrenic daughter and her mother.	A review of the existing literature is also presented. Some clinical characteristics arise, such as frequent mother-daughter associations and diagnosis of schizophrenia in inducing subject. Particular social and psychopathological conditions for the occurrence of a shared delusional disorder are described, such as personality traits and genetic influences. This article also reviews some forensic issues, which may be of importance, since this disorder is underdiagnosed. Data concerning the principles of its treatment are sparse, but most authors consider that the separation of the two subjects has to be the basis of any intervention. The inducing subject has to be treated with specific medical interventions, including the prescription of antipsychotics. Sometimes, the separation is enough to eliminate the delusional ideas from the induced subject, who, according to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, is the only one to meet the criteria for shared delusional disorder. The case reports are discussed in light of the review, and some propositions for their treatment are made.	As shared delusional disorder is a rare disease, only few data exist on its pathophysiology and mechanisms, and controlled studies are needed in order to understand its specific implications better and to define recommendations for its management.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

21,21180303,Indian heart journal,Safety and tolerability of beta-blockers: prejudices & reality.,"Beta-blockers (BB) substantially improve survival in chronic heart failure and after myocardial infarction. However, concern about side-effects may deter clinicians from prescribing these life-saving drugs. In reality, absolute contraindications are rare. Only 3-5% of patients are intolerant because of hypotension or bradycardia. Data from randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies show that most patients eligible to receive BB tolerate them well. BB are not contraindicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); in fact, these patients also benefit because of their high cardiovascular risk. In patients with COPD, as in the elderly, BB should be started at a low dose and uptitrated slowly. Monitoring of lung function during initiation is important, as undiagnosed coexistent asthma could be revealed. When patients are unaware of the drug in use, erectile dysfunction (ED) is reported no more often with BB than with any other drug prescribed for heart failure or hypertension. However, when patients are aware of the potential side-effects of BB, the resultant anxiety may cause ED. Patients should be reassured that BB prolong life and in the great majority are not the cause of ED, which may rather be related to the underlying disease (diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis).",Non-systematic-review,1,0
22,22082429,Headache,Insights into the mechanism of onabotulinumtoxinA in chronic migraine.,"OnabotulinumtoxinA has recently been approved by regulatory agencies in the UK and United States for treatment of chronic migraine based on data generated from the PREEMPT studies. As such, onabotulinumtoxinA is the only prophylactic therapy specifically approved for chronic migraine. Most headache clinicians would agree that acute episodic migraine and chronic migraine differ in their pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and response to pharmacological as well as nonpharmacological therapies. Of the 7 botulinum neurotoxin serotypes, botulinum neurotoxin type A (onabotulinumtoxinA) has been the most thoroughly investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. Based on preclinical studies, onabotulinumtoxinA is known to inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from both motor and sensory neurons by preventing vesicle fusion to the cell membrane. In addition to the well-documented myorelaxant effects of this neurotoxin, onabotulinumtoxinA can exert a direct analgesic effect that likely involves inhibition of primary and secondary nociceptive neurons. The inhibitory effects of onabotulinumtoxinA are also likely to involve suppressing the activity of myogenic trigger points and decreasing the persistent nociceptive barrage that promotes and maintains central sensitization. This article describes possible mechanisms to explain how onabotulinumtoxinA functions as a therapy for chronic migraine and considers why treatment with the neurotoxin is not effective in some chronic migraineurs.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Outcomes showed that both EA preconditioning and regular intervention could relieve CI by reducing toxicity of excitatory amino acids (glutamate, aspartate) and TLR4/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascade reaction to relieve inflammatory injury. Moreover, EA preconditioning also could suppress the expression of pro-apoptosis genes and proteins to relieve apoptosis, regulate activation of microglia, and down-regulate the expression of blood brain barrier integrity-related matrix metalloprotein 9. Regular EA intervention also could promote angiogenesis to increase supply of blood and oxygen, facilitate regeneration, proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells via triggering activation of Notch and Shh signaling pathways, and promote the secretion of neurotrophin by up-regulating the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor /Trk A receptor, and promote expression of axon growth and synaptic remodeling-related factor (Ephrin B2/Eph B2) and sr-GTPase activating protein 1 and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42, axon growth and orientated down-stream molecules).

24,30059733,NeuroImage,Neonatal brain injury and aberrant connectivity.,"Brain injury sustained during the neonatal period may disrupt development of critical structural and functional connectivity networks leading to subsequent neurodevelopmental impairment in affected children. These networks can be characterized using structural (via diffusion MRI) and functional (via resting state-functional MRI) neuroimaging techniques. Advances in neuroimaging have led to expanded application of these approaches to study term- and prematurely-born infants, providing improved understanding of cerebral development and the deleterious effects of early brain injury. Across both modalities, neuroimaging data are conducive to analyses ranging from characterization of individual white matter tracts and/or resting state networks through advanced 'connectome-style' approaches capable of identifying highly connected network hubs and investigating metrics of network topology such as modularity and small-worldness. We begin this review by summarizing the literature detailing structural and functional connectivity findings in healthy term and preterm infants without brain injury during the postnatal period, including discussion of early connectome development. We then detail common forms of brain injury in term- and prematurely-born infants. In this context, we next review the emerging body of literature detailing studies employing diffusion MRI, resting state-functional MRI and other complementary neuroimaging modalities to characterize structural and functional connectivity development in infants with brain injury. We conclude by reviewing technical challenges associated with neonatal neuroimaging, highlighting those most relevant to studying infants with brain injury and emphasizing the need for further targeted study in this high-risk population.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

However, both share as major genetic risk factor a C9orf72 locus intronic hexanucleotide expansion. The pathogenic pathways associated with the expansion-dependent neuronal toxicity are still poorly understood. Recent efforts to identify common threads of neuronal dysfunction have pointed towards deficits of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis and loss of nucleolar integrity, a condition known as nucleolar stress that is an emerging shared feature among neurodegenerative diseases. Intriguingly, the C9orf72 mutation in ALS-FTD interferes with the function of the nucleolus by transcripts and dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced by the hexanucleotide expansion. Experimental discrepancies have given rise to different hypotheses with regard to the connection of C9orf72 and nucleolar activity. In this review, we present and discuss emerging concepts concerning the impact of C9orf72 expansion on nucleolar biology. Moreover, we discuss the 'nucleolar stress hypothesis,' according to which nucleolar malfunction accompanies, exacerbates, or potentially triggers a degenerative phenotype. Upcoming awareness of the involvement of nucleolar stress in C9orf72 ALS-FTD could shed light into its pathogenesis, enabling potential treatment options aimed at shielding an 'Achilles' heel' of neurons.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
26,30658131,Brain research bulletin,Cerebral malaria.,"Malaria remains of significant public health concern under the tropics, causing millions of deaths annually. The disease is caused by protozoans of the Plasmodium genus, of which harbors several distinct species. Human infection occurs during the blood meal of an infected female mosquito belonging to the Anopheles genus. It is estimated that around 1% of children infected with Plasmodium falciparum develops a more severe form of malaria, which may eventually lead to cerebral complications including cerebral malaria (CM). CM can be positively diagnosed in patients unable to localize a painful stimulus, with peripheral asexual P. falciparum parasitemia and no other identifiable causes of an encephalopathy. Unarousable comas along with the presence of asexual forms of the parasite on a peripheral blood smear are hallmarks of the disease. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CM have yet be fully elucidated, the pathology in itself indicates a clear disease of the vascular endothelium. It is characterized by parasite sequestration, inflammatory cytokine production and vascular leakage, eventually resulting in brain hypoxia. The condition requires systemic health management consisting of focused nursing practices, supportive care, and anti-malarial drugs. The continued understanding of pathogenic mechanisms leading to the onset of CM is fundamental and key for the expansion and development of appropriate neuroprotective interventions. Future research perspectives may also include the development of field-based and rapid diagnostic tests for CM, understanding of host-pathogen interactions to advance development of prevention tools and therapies, and antimalarial drug trials.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway is a major innate immune pathway activated acutely and chronically after stroke. Hence, understanding the intricacies of the temporal profile, specific control points, and cellular specificity of TLR4 activation is crucial for the development of any novel therapeutics targeting the endogenous innate immune response after focal cerebral ischemia. The goal of this review is to summarize the current findings related to TLR4 signaling after stroke with a specific focus on the components of the neurovascular unit such as astrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, and pericytes.

28,16146330,The AAPS journal,New questions regarding bioequivalence of levothyroxine preparations: a clinician's response.,"A recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to declare various brands of levothyroxine bioequivalent has provoked objections from several physicians' organizations. These organizations assert that the method of testing bioequivalence is flawed, and that indiscriminate switching among preparations could lead to serious instances of undertreatment and overtreatment of hypothyroid patients. In this review we first list common indications for thyroid hormone administration, distinguishing its use as replacement therapy in hypothyroidism from its use to suppress thyrotropin (TSH) secretion in cases of thyroid cancer, nodules, and goiter. The dangers associated with changing to a preparation with different bioavailability are summarized, noting the particular danger of giving a more active preparation to a patient receiving TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine. However, these dangers are part of a larger problem: there are data showing that large numbers of patients are already receiving an improper dosage of levothyroxine, as judged from measurements of serum TSH. The recent history of FDA actions concerning levothyroxine bioequivalence and the arguments of those in disagreement are summarized. The immediate response to these problems should be better education of both patients and physicians. It is also recommended that there be further discussion of the problems in determining bioequivalence, and that consideration be given to more accurate and clinically relevant methods. Such methods should include assessment of the changes in TSH induced by each preparation in athyrotic patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Key concepts in the searches included hysterectomy, sleep disturbance and pain, hysterectomy and fatigue, hysterectomy, depression, and depressed mood.	Articles and comprehensive works relevant to key concepts and published after 1970, with an emphasis on new findings from 1990 to 2000. Sixty-four citations were identified as useful to this review.	Data were organized under the following headings: women and hysterectomy, biopsychosocial perspectives, common symptoms after hysterectomy (pain, disturbed sleep, fatigue, depressed mood, anxiety), and significance of review (implications).	Literature suggests that after a hysterectomy, women experience complications during the postoperative recovery period that may vary with the type of surgical procedure. During this period, the quantity and quality of sleep as well as other symptoms (pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression) are influenced by various physiologic, psychologic, and social factors. Despite limited evidence that sleep problems may occur frequently during the recovery period, only a few researchers have systematically examined sleep patterns in women after hysterectomy. None of these studies, however, used objective sleep measures or examined multiple dimensions of these women's lives.	This review conceptualized the women's symptom experience as the experience of specific symptoms (pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, depressed mood, and anxiety) that were influenced by biopsychosocial factors.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
31,8988463,Journal of neural transmission. Supplementum,Deprenyl in the treatment of Parkinson's disease: clinical effects and speculations on mechanism of action.,"Selegiline is a relatively selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B that has been used in Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa and as putative neuroprotective therapy. Clinical trials demonstrate that selegiline slows the rate of disease progression and delays the appearance of disability necessitating levodopa. However, confounding symptomatic effects have made it difficult to ascertain the presence of any direct neuroprotective effect. Laboratory studies demonstrate that selegiline protects dopaminergic neurons through a mechanism that does not involve MAO-B inhibition. Recent studies suggest that neuroprotection in laboratory models may be related to the capacity of selegiline to up-regulate a series of anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic molecules which promote cell survival. Further delineation of the precise mechanism whereby selegiline induces this effect may permit for the development of enhanced neuroprotective benefits in PD patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

33,26867166,Current opinion in pediatrics,"Environmental exposure to metals, neurodevelopment, and psychosis.","This article presents a new hypothesis about the possible relation between early life exposure to metals and psychosis. We review limitations of available research, and discuss novel approaches to overcome previous methodological barriers.	Mechanistic studies suggest a possible association between excess lead, manganese, cadmium, arsenic, or copper, and zinc deficiency, and several biochemical disturbances related to psychosis, such as altered neurotransmitters levels, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Furthermore, studies suggest that some metals (lead, manganese, cadmium excess, and zinc deficiency) are associated with schizophrenia or psychosis-related phenotype. However, previous studies had multiple methodological limitations. Importantly, metal exposure was often measured after disease development and seldom determined during critical developmental periods. Most studies fell short of depicting the exact timing of exposure and the change in exposure over time. Here, we propose several methods to overcome these methodological limitations.	There is a plausible role of early life exposure to metals in the cause of psychosis. Owing to methodological limitations in exposure measurement, this has not been well characterized. Considering the wide exposure to metals and the high cost of psychosis to society, this hypothesis should be rigorously examined.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
34,1968717,The American journal of medicine,Sleep disorders and their management. Special considerations in the elderly.,"Complaints of insomnia and disordered sleep are pervasive among the elderly, and reduced total sleep time and changes in sleep architecture are considered to be normal in the aging process. Additionally, numerous medical and psychiatric disorders that are highly prevalent in the geriatric population are known to affect sleep adversely. Epidemiologic data indicate that at least 5 million older adults suffer severe disorders of sleep and that most people with severe insomnia receive no treatment for this troubling symptom. However, although the elderly comprise only about 12 percent of the American population, between 35 and 40 percent of all prescriptions for sedative hypnotics are written for people over the age of 60. Moreover, approximately 23 percent of Americans over age 85 reside in long-term care facilities, and institutionalization is an important risk factor for disordered sleep and for sedative hypnotic prescription. Consequently, the evaluation of any sedative hypnotic agent must include substantial assessment of efficacy, safety, and tolerance in geriatric patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Methamphetamine, an amphetamine derivative, has even stronger and longer lasting effect. The study presents characteristics of a popular, among teenagers, addictive substance - amphetamine and its derivative- methamphetamine and its influence on teeth after using it in a smoking form. The condition of oral cavity of a 17-year-old patient, who has been using methamphetamine in a smoking form for about 3 years, was described. In the oral cavity of the patient numerous and extensive caries lesions were noticed, placed mainly in the labial cervical area of teeth as well as, a considerable damage of teeth's crowns and teeth loss. The patient needed complex dental treatment: conservative, endodontic, surgical and prosthetic.

36,16044216,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al],Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.,"To evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) on target volume delineation for radiation treatment planning.	The data of the literature concerning the use of PET in target volume delineation are summarized. The following points are discussed for each tumor entity: biological background for the PET investigation, sensitivity and specificity of PET (with different tracers) in comparison to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and impact of PET on target volume definition. New PET tracers, which could visualize biological pathways, such as hypoxia, proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression patterns, will also be discussed.	The results of clinical studies on the integration of PET in target volume definition for lung, head-and-neck, genitourinary and brain tumors were analyzed. Fluorodeoxyglucose-(FDG-)PET has a significant impact on GTV (gross tumor volume) and PTV (planning target volume) delineation in lung cancer and can detect lymph node involvement and differentiate malignant tissue from atelectasis. In head-and-neck cancer, the value of FDG-PET for radiation treatment planning is still under investigation. For example, FDG-PET could be superior to CT and MRI in the detection of lymph node metastases and unknown primary cancer and in the differentiation of viable tumor tissue after treatment. Therefore, it might play an important role in GTV definition and sparing of normal tissue. Choline PET and acetate PET are promising tracers in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but their validity in local tumor demarcation, lymph node diagnosis and detection of recurrence has to be defined in future clinical trials. FDG-PET seems to be particularly valuable in lymph node status definition in cervical cancer. In high-grade gliomas and meningiomas, methionine PET helps to define the GTV and differentiate tumor from normal tissue. For other entities like gastrointestinal cancer, lymphomas, sarcomas, etc., the data of the literature are yet insufficient. The imaging of hypoxia, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression leads to the identification of different areas of a biologically heterogeneous tumor mass that can individually be targeted using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In addition, a biological dose distribution can be generated, the socalled dose painting. However, systematic experimental and clinical trials are necessary to validate this hypothesis.	Regarding treatment planning in radiotherapy, PET offers advantages in terms of tumor delineation and the description of biological processes. To define the real impact of this investigation in radiation treatment planning, subsequent experimental, clinical and cost-benefit analyses are required.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The value of simultaneous participation in these two modalities has been recognized; 12-step work supports abstinence necessary for the focus on emotional growth in psychotherapy. However, mere simultaneous participation in the two modalities fails to incorporate the benefits of a collaborative relationship where both modalities are used to support both abstinence and emotional growth. The conjoint approach to group and individual treatment is used to (a) argue for the possibility of a collaborative relationship between psychotherapy and a patient's 12-step work, (b) understand the benefits and challenges to collaboration, and (c) provide guidelines for how to work collaboratively with a 12-step program.

We review the data investigating hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM.	Investigators have explored alternative radiotherapy strategies that shorten treatment duration with the goal of similar or improved survival while minimizing toxicity. HFRT over 1-3 weeks is already a standard of care for patients with advanced age or poor performance status.

41,20012471,Journal of gambling studies,The impacts of gaming expansion on economic growth: a theoretical reconsideration.,"This paper employs a general equilibrium framework to analyze the effects on economic growth of global expansions in casino gaming, which exports gambling services largely to non-residents. Both domestic and foreign investments in the gaming sector bring in not only substantial revenues but also positive spillover effects on related sectors and even on the entire local economy. However, an over-expansion of commercial gambling may lead to deterioration in the terms of trade with an adverse impact on real income. If this situation persists, it would not be impossible for immiserizing growth to occur. As a highly profitable sector, casino gaming may enable its operators to diversify out of this risk if they invest retained profits in non-gaming sectors to cash in on the spillover effects it has created. The gaming-dominant economy can then be directed on a more balanced and sustainable growth path, and will become less susceptible to business cycles. Indeed, economic experiences in the world's major casino resorts are consistent basically with this argument for diversification. We believe that after the current global crisis fades away, economic growth and resulting surges in global demand for gambling services can provide further opportunities for the expansion of existing casino resorts and the development of new gaming markets.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Although effective under optimal conditions, several drawbacks are imminent to the long-term application of these drugs due to their narrow therapeutic window, interactions with other drugs as well as the need for regular monitoring and the risk of a recurrent event versus the risk of bleeding. To overcome these downsides, novel anticoagulants are being developed; in contrast to vitamin K antagonists, these novel agents specifically and selectively block central elements of the coagulation cascade. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of selective FXa inhibitors (such as fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (such as lepirudin, bivalirudin, dabigatran etexilate) in the treatment of typical indications for conventional vitamin K antagonists, in particular, the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism.

44,16195185,Brain injury,Consensus guidelines on screening for hypopituitarism following traumatic brain injury.,"The goal of this consensus statement is to increase awareness among endocrinologists and physicians treating patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) of the incidence and risks of hypopituitarism among patients with TBI.	TBI poses significant risk to the pituitary gland, leading to elevated risks of diabetes, hypopituitarism and other endocrinopathies. Signs and symptoms associated with hypopituitarism often mimic the sequellae of TBI, although the severity of symptoms is not necessarily related to the severity of the injury. Patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may benefit both physically and psychologically from appropriate hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Participants at this unique consensus meeting attempted to define and spearhead an approach to increase awareness of the risks of TBI-induced endocrinopathies, in particular growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and to outline necessary and practical objectives for managing this condition.	Systematic screening of pituitary function is recommended for all patients with moderate-to-severe TBI at risk of developing pituitary deficits. Patients with hypopituitarism benefit from appropriate hormonal replacement and prospects for rehabilitation of patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may be enhanced by appropriate HRT. Further exploration of this possibility requires: (1) active collaboration between divisions of endocrinology and rehabilitation at the local level to perform a screening of pituitary function in patients after TBI, (2) creation of a consultancy service by endocrine societies for use by rehabilitation centres, (3) development of continuing medical education (CME) programmes that can be offered as crossover training to the physicians who manage the care of patients with TBIs, (4) targeting of patient organizations with educational information for dissemination to patients and their families, (5) continued efforts to more clearly define the population at greatest risk of TBI-induced hypopituitarism and (6) monitor results of efficacy studies as they become available to evaluate whether and how much replacement therapy can improve the symptoms of individuals with TBI-induced hypopituitarism.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

46,20353432,Headache,Revisiting the role of ergots in the treatment of migraine and headache.,"The harmful side effects of the ergots described by early civilizations have been overcome with efficacious treatment for headaches including migraine, cluster, and chronic daily headache. Use of ergots contributed to initial theories of migraine pathogenesis and provided the substrate for development of the triptans. Triptans are very efficacious for many migraineurs, and since their widespread use, use of ergots has significantly declined. Unfortunately, there remain many migraineurs who benefit little from triptans, yet respond very well to ergots. Discoveries in migraine pathophysiology have given us better understanding of the complex processes involved, although there remain many unknown factors in migraine treatment. Additional, unrecognized therapeutic targets may exist throughout the neuronal connections of the brainstem, cortex, and cerebral vasculature. Ergots interact with a broader spectrum of receptors than triptans. This lack of receptor specificity explains potential ergot side effects, but may also account for efficacy. The role of ergots in headache should be revisited, especially in view of newer ergot formulations with improved tolerability and side effect profiles, such as orally inhaled dihydroergotamine. Redefining where in the headache treatment spectrum ergots belong and deciding when they may be the optimal choice of treatment is necessary.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The classification of edema into vasogenic, cytotoxic, hydrocephalic and osmotic has stood the test of time although it is recognized that in most clinical situations there is a combination of different types of edema during the course of the disease. Basic information about the types of edema is provided for better understanding of the expression pattern of some of the newer molecules implicated in the pathogenesis of brain edema. These molecules include the aquaporins, matrix metalloproteinases and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors A and B and the angiopoietins. The potential of these agents in the treatment of edema is discussed.

This drug is currently mainly administered by monthly depot preparations of octreotide and lanreotide. With the innovative transient permeability enhancer, a technology enabling the absorption of drug molecules via transient opening of the tight junctions of the gut epithelium, it is possible to achieve therapeutic octreotide levels after oral ingestion. The present review summarized the preclinical work and the recently reported phase I and III study on oral octreotide capsules in patients with acromegaly. Maintenance of control in 155 participating patients was achieved in 65% at the end of core period. Once controlled on oral octreotide, the response was maintained to the end of the extension phase in 85%. Side effects were comparable to currently available preparations. There was a profound suppression of growth hormone levels, and significant symptom reduction. Currently available parental somatostatin analogs are generally well tolerated and are able to achieve longstanding biochemical control in patients with somatostatin sensitive tumors. Potential advantages of an oral alternative is the lack injection-related side effects, but there will be an ongoing need for a very strict compliance with the 2 daily dose regimen and fasting around drug administrations.

51,2420691,Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,[Aphasia in children].,"The acquired aphasia in children is a rarely seen speech and language disorders. Disturbances develop after the child has already achieved the capacity for language comprehension and verbal expression. Brain trauma is most often the cause. The clinical picture of the disorder varies over different age groups and, in contrast to adults, shows no consistent typology. In most of the cases there exists a disturbance of speech production; problems with writing and comprehension are seen less often (although comprehension of language is primarily affected in the Landau-Kleffner syndrome). Only once and a while logorrhoea and jargon can be diagnosed. Besides the speech and language disorders cognitive, motor und emotional problems may appear. Therefore, several diagnostic levels have to be considered (e.g. clinical neurology, neuropsychology, psychophysiology, psychopathology). Course and prognosis of the acquired aphasia in childhood (30% longterm difficulties) depend on several factors like etiology and extension of the lesion, the development of the functional hemispheric dominance for language and the initial recovery velocity after the symptoms appeared. The plasticity of the child's brain is a source for compensating mechanisms which might be triggered by three aspects of therapeutic activities which should be used synchronously: speech and language training, principles of psychotherapy and social medicine and treatment of additional disorders.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
52,15199474,Seminars in vascular medicine,"P2Y12, a new platelet ADP receptor, target of clopidogrel.","Clopidogrel is a potent antithrombotic drug that inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. The antiaggregating effect of clopidogrel is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of ADP binding to a purinergic receptor present at the platelet surface. Clopidogrel is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. The chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. Several purinergic receptors have been described on platelets; P2X (1), a calcium channel, and P2Y1 a Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor, have been found not to be antagonized by clopidogrel. Another Gi (2)-coupled receptor (named P2Y12) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells. These cells displayed a strong affinity for (33)P-2MeS-ADP, a stable analogue of ADP, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. The binding of (33)P-2MeS-ADP to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets. In these transfected CHO cells, as in platelets, ADP and 2MeS-ADP induced adenylyl cyclase downregulation, an effect that was inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel. These results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called 'P2t' platelet receptor and show that the active metabolite of clopidogrel binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of ADP on platelets.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
53,27781424,Clinical neuropathology,Update on the integrated histopathological and genetic classification of medulloblastoma - a practical diagnostic guideline.,"The revised WHO classification of tumors of the CNS 2016 has introduced the concept of the integrated diagnosis. The definition of medulloblastoma entities now requires a combination of the traditional histological information with additional molecular/genetic features. For definition of the histopathological component of the medulloblastoma diagnosis, the tumors should be assigned to one of the four entities classic, desmoplastic/nodular (DNMB), extensive nodular (MBEN), or large cell/anaplastic (LC/A) medulloblastoma. The genetically defined component comprises the four entities WNT-activated, SHH-activated and TP53 wildtype, SHH-activated and TP53 mutant, or non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastoma. Robust and validated methods are available to allow a precise diagnosis of these medulloblastoma entities according to the updated WHO classification, and for differential diagnostic purposes. A combination of immunohistochemical markers including β-catenin, Yap1, p75-NGFR, Otx2, and p53, in combination with targeted sequencing and copy number assessment such as FISH analysis for MYC genes allows a precise assignment of patients for risk-adapted stratification.

Here, we report an extremely rare cause of foot drop in a child, which if not recognized early, could lead to multiple complications.	A 6-year-old girl presented with difficulty in walking and left sided foot droop for1-month duration. On examination she had reduced muscle power in dorsiflexors and plantar flexors and diminished knee and absent ankle jerk in the left side. Sensory loss was noted in L4 and L5 dermatomes on the left side. Superficial abdominal reflex was absent on the left side while preserved in the right. Nerve conduction and electromyography revealed nerve root or spinal cord cause for the foot drop. These results prompted ordering MRI spine and brain which revealed Chiari malformation type-1 with holocord syrinx extending from the cervicomedullary junction to conus medullaris.

56,21458972,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,[Social skills training groups for children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome: A review].,"First described in 1944 by Hans Asperger, Asperger syndrome (AS) is now considered in international diagnostic classifications as one of the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The main symptoms of AS are severe impairment in social interaction and communication, and restricted interests, without significant delay in cognitive and language development. Its prevalence is not clearly established but might be around 0.26 per 1000. Symptoms of high-functioning autism (HFA), which is not an official diagnostic category, are quite similar. Children and adolescents with AS or HFA mostly have a social skills deficit, in connection with a lack of understanding concerning the rules governing social interactions. This deficit often leads to social isolation and peer rejection, which can alter their quality of life. Their lack of social skills can also have effects on success at school or work, integration among peers and mental health. According to recent guidelines of the French national authority for health (Haute autorité de santé, HAS) about the special needs of persons with PDD, professionals have to develop evidence-based interventions, emphasizing social interactions and participation, as described by the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF): social and professional participation as well as participation in leisure activities, clubs and societies, etc.	To explore the studies that give evidence of the value of these social skills training groups, to review the methods and programs worked out in these groups, and to highlight the best general operating principles to be adopted and combined.	Systematic searches of electronic databases, journals, and reference lists identified 12 studies published since 1984, involving social competence group interventions, led by psychotherapists who were trained in cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), for children and adolescents from 6 to 18years old with a diagnosis of AS or HFA.	According to these 12 studies, these interventions are useful and significantly effective. Adaptation of their contents and educational means to how children and adolescents with AS function is necessary to facilitate learning and decrease anxiety. Concerning the groups' setting, most of these studies insist on the value of working with a small number of participants and creating a friendly, predictable and structured environment (even the progress of the sessions itself has to be structured). The programs' contents should ally didactic teaching and training exercises, which should be diverse and adapted to the objectives. The techniques usually applied in CBT (role plays, modeling, problem-solving strategies, etc.), must be completed with strategies known to be appropriate for children and adolescents with ASD, such as social scenarios.	Although new studies are necessary to assess the generalization and long-term efficacy of such approaches, this review confirms the advantages of the main methods of social skills training groups for children and adolescents with AS. It opens up perspectives to developing new programs of social skills training groups, integrating various approaches, dimensions and objectives, working on a long-term basis.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

This review describes very recent studies on the role of HSV1 but refers also to older studies that provide background for some lesser-known related topics not covered in other recent reviews; these include the relevance of herpes simplex encephalitis and of epilepsy to AD, the action of IFN, and the possible relevance of the different types of DNA damage to AD-in particular, those caused by HSV1-and mechanisms of repair of damage. New epidemiologic data supporting previous studies on mild cognitive impairment and progression to AD are reviewed, as are those examining the relationship between total infectious burden (additive seropositivity to various microbes) and cognition/AD. The latter indicates the involvement of HSV1 and cytomegalovirus (and the necessity of taking into account any marked differences in sensitivity of antibody detection). Recent studies that provide further support for the occurrence of repeated reactivation of latent HSV1 in the brain in AD pathogenesis are also discussed.-Itzhaki, R. F.

58,18810322,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,Crystallin proteins and amyloid fibrils.,"Improper protein folding (misfolding) can lead to the formation of disordered (amorphous) or ordered (amyloid fibril) aggregates. The major lens protein, alpha-crystallin, is a member of the small heat-shock protein (sHsp) family of intracellular molecular chaperone proteins that prevent protein aggregation. Whilst the chaperone activity of sHsps against amorphously aggregating proteins has been well studied, its action against fibril-forming proteins has received less attention despite the presence of sHsps in deposits found in fibril-associated diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's). In this review, the literature on the interaction of alphaB-crystallin and other sHsps with fibril-forming proteins is summarized. In particular, the ability of sHsps to prevent fibril formation, their mechanisms of action and the possible in vivo consequences of such associations are discussed. Finally, the fibril-forming propensity of the crystallin proteins and its implications for cataract formation are described along with the potential use of fibrillar crystallin proteins as bionanomaterials.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

In addition to malignant brain tumors and vascular malformations, benign tumors have also been treated with SRS. Although surgical resection has long been considered the gold standard in the management of such benign lesions, the outcomes of SRS in various benign neoplasms appears to be comparable. In this review, we will examine the literature as it pertains to the treatment of benign brain tumors with SRS. Of particular note, we will examine the results of SRS in acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, and other benign tumors.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

61,15351342,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Effects of epilepsy surgery on psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities in children and adolescents.,"When considering surgery in children, it is important to think about the potential effect on psychiatric and behavioral outcome. A growing body of evidence suggests that the type of epilepsy (benign or catastrophic) and the age of the patient affect developmental outcome. In younger children with catastrophic epilepsy, the primary goal of therapy is not only to control seizures, but also to offer the child the opportunity for the best possible development. In older children with partial seizures, the therapeutic goal is to control seizures, which may allow a more normal life and improve behavior. Epilepsy surgery generally appears to have a positive effect on behavior and development in many younger children with catastrophic epilepsy. Psychiatric and behavioral outcomes in older children with complex partial epilepsy are less clear; many patients improve, but there does appear to be a small risk of developing new psychiatric or behavioral disorders postoperatively.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

In the sense of a bottom-up approach, a content analysis of problem-oriented interviews with 32 caregivers of patients with bipolar disorder was carried out. Additionally, the relevant literature identified by means of a computerized MEDLINE research on the years 1997 - 2007 with the key words 'caregiver'/'relative', 'burden' and 'bipolar disorder', was analysed to describe the situation of the caregivers comprehensively. Related articles in the MEDLINE search were also viewed.	The burden of relatives of bipolar patients are manifold and partially specific. On the top of the list caregivers mentioned emotional burdens like: 'lack of understanding, helplessness and hopelessness' (90,6 %) and 'own concernment' (81,2 %). Specific burdens of these caregivers are 'repulsing and uncooperative behaviour of the patient' (78,1 %) and 'burdens due to the alternation between manic and depressive symptoms' (71,9 %).

64,23791711,Neurochemistry international,The role of α-synuclein in the pathophysiology of alcoholism.,"Alcoholism has complex etiology and there is evidence for both genetic and environmental factors in its pathophysiology. Chronic, long-term alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are associated with neuronal loss with the prefrontal cortex being particularly susceptible to neurotoxic damage. This brain region is involved in the development and persistence of alcohol addiction and neurotoxic damage is likely to exacerbate the reinforcing effects of alcohol and may hinder treatment. Understanding the mechanism of alcohol's neurotoxic effects on the brain and the genetic risk factors associated with alcohol abuse are the focus of current research. Because of its well-established role in neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders, and its emerging role in the pathophysiology of addiction, here we review the genetic and epigenetic factors involved in regulating α-synuclein expression and its potential role in the pathophysiology of chronic alcohol abuse. Elucidation of the mechanisms of α-synuclein regulation may prove beneficial in understanding the role of this key synaptic protein in disease and its potential for therapeutic modulation in the treatment of substance use disorders as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Recent breakthrough discoveries identifying common genes that are causal to either ALS or FTD or an overlapping ALS-FTD syndrome have dramatically transformed our view regarding their pathogenesis. Most recently, a massive hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion mutation in C9orf72 gene has been linked to the majority of familial ALS, FTD and mixed ALS-FTD cases. C9orf72 and other genes causal to ALS and FTD are consistently associated with the formation of cellular RNA inclusions and protein aggregates.

68,28440192,CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore as a Suitable Targ e t for Neuroprotective Agents Against Alzheimer's Disease.,"A considerable amount of data suggests the age-related impairments of mitochondrial functions in the development of sporadic forms of neurodegenerative pathologies. Mitochondria and the phenomenon of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), which marks the point of no return in cell death cascades, have special value in this regard. It is important that the vulnerability to MPT-inducing factors is increased with aging. Simultaneously, a decrease in the calcium retention capacity of mitochondria is developed, which leads to the disturbance of the functional activity of neurons.	The systematic investigations and web content related to the importance of MPT as the target for the search of neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing drugs, especially with multitargeted action, are reviewed.	Here, we have highlighted some experimental data that determines the importance of mitochondria for the search of neuroprotective drugs, and drugs with multitargeted action. We have also discussed a number of new compounds with similar properties. Being MPT inhibitors/modulators, virtually all the compounds described in this review have the ability to exhibit a neuroprotective effect, interact with some other targets, providing coupled beneficial therapeutic effects such as cognitive stimulation, anti-seizure, and antidepressant actions.	Inhibitors of MPT, which increases calcium retention capacity of mitochondria, are considered as promising neuroprotective drugs able not only to halt the neurodegenerative cascade, but also to increase the functional activity of neurons.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
69,27480581,Critical reviews in biomedical engineering,Current Concepts in Sports-Related Concussion.,"Traumatic brain injury, specifically concussion, is prevalent in contact sports. In the United States (US) each year, 170 million adults participate in physical recreational activities, and 38 million children and adolescents participate in organized sports. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that in this group ~1.6 to 3.8 million concussions occur annually. Recent class-action lawsuits in the US filed by professional athletes against their respective leagues allege negligence in protecting them from concussions, and this has contributed to the attention received in the popular media. In response, concussion-related publications have increased exponentially during the past several years. Recent studies have challenged earlier assumptions that the effects of concussion are transient. Stronger links between concussion and neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease-like conditions, depression, and heightened risk for suicide are being elucidated. In this article, we explore the current knowledge on concussion, including pathophysiology, management, and long-term effects. We conclude that more evidence-based results regarding guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and return to play (RTP) are needed and should be the focus of future investigations. Attributing the etiology of certain neurodegenerative conditions to a history of concussion has been suggested in the current literature, but additional quantitative data regarding the pathophysiology and causality are needed as well. Bioengineers can have an important role in measuring the dynamic forces encountered during head impacts and their effects on the brain. These results can be effective in designing better helmets as well as improved playing surfaces to reduce the impact of such injuries. At this time, we believe that groups of people with heightened risk for concussion should be followed closely during longer periods of time and compared to matched controls. Such long-term studies are urgently needed to develop appropriate guidelines for safety and protect our young and adult athletes in the future.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
70,24439647,Complementary therapies in clinical practice,Butterbur extract: prophylactic treatment for childhood migraines.,"The incidence of migraine headaches in childhood is increasing. Migraines are often difficult to diagnose in pediatrics and even more difficult to treat and prevent. In order to decrease the impact of the condition on the child and the family, prophylactic treatment is recommended if the child is experiencing disabling migraines. The medications currently prescribed for the prevention of pediatric migraines often have significant side effects and are of questionable therapeutic value. For those patients and parents who are interested in alternative therapies and natural remedies for preventive treatment of pediatric migraines, butterbur extract derived from the butterbur plant, Petasites hybridus, has emerged as a promising treatment.

72,25359445,Pituitary,Update on radiation therapy in patients with Cushing's disease.,"Radiation therapy is an important therapy for patients with Cushing's disease who are not in remission or relapse after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery and are not considered surgical candidates. The development of stereotactic radiation therapy, using gamma knife, linear accelerators or proton beam based methods, has enabled selective radiation delivery to the target while minimizing exposure of healthy tissues. In patients whose tumors are sufficiently distant from the optic apparatus, stereotactic radiation therapy can be delivered in a single session, a procedure termed radiosurgery, which significantly improves patient convenience.	Original articles on radiation therapy in Cushing's disease, published during the past 12 months (2013-2014), were identified and pertinent data extracted.	Recent studies have reported on the outcomes of patients with Cushing's disease who received mostly stereotactic radiation therapy. While tumor control has been excellent, biochemical remission was less consistently achieved. Some studies suggested that stereotactic radiation may lead to biochemical remission faster than conventional radiation therapy. In addition, retrospective data have suggested that withdrawing medical therapy around the time stereotactic radiation therapy is administered might lead to a faster biochemical response. Regardless of the radiation therapy method, biochemical recurrences may develop and these patients are at long-term risk of developing anterior hypopituitarism and require lifelong periodic endocrine follow-up. Other, less frequent complications may include cranial neuropathies, secondary tumor formation or temporal lobe necrosis. It is plausible that complications may be less frequent after stereotactic radiation therapy, but this requires confirmation.	Radiation therapy is an effective second line therapy in patients with Cushing's disease. Ongoing refinements in delivery of radiation therapy are anticipated to lead to improved patient outcomes, but long-term follow-up data, including adequate control groups, are needed to fully investigate this possibility.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

74,24737903,Postgraduate medical journal,Republished: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides: is it time to split up the group?,"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of diseases corresponding to necrotising inflammation of small vessels with a wide range of clinical presentations. At least two of the diseases are believed to exhibit a common ground of pathophysiological mechanisms. These are granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). ANCA directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) are preferentially associated with GPA, and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA are associated mainly with MPA and eosinophilic GPA (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). Anti-MPO and anti-PR3 antibodies can activate neutrophils in vitro. In vivo data are available for humans and mice on the pathogenicity of anti-MPO but it is more controversial for PR3-ANCA. A recent genome-wide association study of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitides confirmed the genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of these conditions, with significant association of PR3-ANCA and human leukocyte antigen-DP and the genes encoding α1-antitrypsin and PR3. MPO-ANCA were significantly associated with human leukocyte antigen-DQ. Thus, recent results from epidemiological studies, genome-wide association study and therapeutic trials have suggested that these entities are, in fact, distinct. We have summarised these results and discuss the idea that these two entities should be studied separately as the nature of the two auto-antigens suggests at a molecular level despite shared ANCA involvement.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

78,27356602,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),Misregulation of iron homeostasis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Iron is essential for all mammalian cells, but it is toxic in excess. Our understanding of molecular mechanisms ensuring iron homeostasis at both cellular and systemic levels has dramatically increased over the past 15 years. However, despite major advances in this field, homeostatic regulation of iron in the central nervous system (CNS) requires elucidation. It is unclear how iron moves in the CNS and how its transfer to the CNS across the blood-brain and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers, which separate the CNS from the systemic circulation, is regulated. Increasing evidence indicates the role of iron dysregulation in neuronal cell death observed in neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective cortical czynand spinal motor neuron dysfunction that results from a complex interplay among various pathogenic factors including oxidative stress. The latter is known to strongly affect cellular iron balance, creating a vicious circle to exacerbate oxidative injury. The role of iron in the pathogenesis of ALS is confirmed by therapeutic effects of iron chelation in ALS mouse models. These models are of great importance for deciphering molecular mechanisms of iron accumulation in neurons. Most of them consist of transgenic rodents overexpressing the mutated human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Mutations in the SOD1 gene constitute one of the most common genetic causes of the inherited form of ALS. However, it should be considered that overexpression of the SOD1 gene usually leads to increased SOD1 enzymatic activity, a condition which does not occur in human pathology and which may itself change the expression of iron metabolism genes.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Beyond geneticfactors, puberty is associated with a significant delay in the circadian phase of sleep, responsible for increasing dificulties with sleep onset at night and thus with awakening in the morning. The prevalence of Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) is high in the adolescent population, affecting up to 16 % of teenagers. As sleep needs remain remarkably stable, adolescent sleep phase delay causes chronic sleep depriva- tion and subsequently daytime fatigue or even excessive daytime sleepiness, and also metabolic disturbances, neurocognitive problems associated with decreased school perfor- mance, as well as mood disorders. Whereas genetic and biological factors have been investigated by a number of studies, research on social, cognitive-behavioural or psychological factors is still limited to date. Among the latte; the technological revolution of the past decades, most importantly exposure to screens- has significantly modied adolescent behavior. This article discusses the latest research on the complex interaction of these different factors.

The recent availability of new antipsychotic medications within state facilities has resulted in more progressive treatment, reduced recidivism (and consequently cost savings), and preliminary evidence of preferential and superior treatment response in specific patient subgroups (e.g., those with aggression). At the same time, inpatient pharmacy budget increases and uncertainty in guiding the use of novel antipsychotics have influenced the availability of these agents in state hospitals.

Avoidance, or amelioration, of this secondary injury depends on early diagnosis and intervention before permanent injury occurs. However, tools to monitor brain oxygenation continuously in the neuro-intensive care unit have been lacking.	In recent times, methods of monitoring aspects of brain oxygenation continuously by the bedside have been evaluated in several experimental and clinical series and are potentially changing the way we manage head-injured patients. These monitors have the potential to alert the clinician to possible secondary injury and enable intervention, help interpret pathophysiological changes (e.g., hyperemia causing raised intracranial pressure), monitor interventions (e.g., hyperventilation for increased intracranial pressure), and prognosticate. This review focuses on jugular venous saturation, brain tissue oxygen tension, and near-infrared spectroscopy as practical methods that may have an important role in managing patients with brain injury, with a particular focus on the available evidence in children. However, to use these monitors effectively and to understand the studies in which these monitors are employed, it is important for the clinician to appreciate the technical characteristics of each monitor, as well as respective strengths and limitations of each. It is equally important that the clinician understands relevant aspects of brain oxygen physiology and head trauma pathophysiology to enable correct interpretation of the monitored data and therefore to direct an appropriate therapeutic response that is likely to benefit, not harm, the patient.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Drugs that inhibit the inactivation of NAAG by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) increase its extracellular concentration and its activation of its receptor, mGluR3. These drugs warrant attention, as they are effective in animal models of several clinical disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia. In inflammatory and neuropathic pain studies, GCPII inhibitors moderated both the primary and secondary pain responses when given systemically, locally or in brain regions associated with the pain perception pathway. The finding that GCPII inhibition also moderated the motor and cognitive effects of ethanol intoxication led to the discovery of their procognitive efficacy in long-term memory tests in control mice and in short-term memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. NAAG and GCPII inhibitors respectively reduce cocaine self-administration and the rewarding effects of a synthetic stimulant. Most recently, GCPII inhibition also has been reported to be efficacious in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. GCPII was first discovered as a protein expressed by and released from metastatic prostate cells where it is known as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). GCPII inhibitors with high affinity for this protein have been developed as prostate imaging and radiochemical therapies for prostate cancer. Taken together, these data militate in favor of the development and application of GCPII inhibitors in more advanced preclinical research as a prelude to clinical trials.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Whether that assumption is valid, and how it might impact assessment of PTSS, is unknown.	Survivors in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort study completed an assessment of PTSS without cancer orientation, global psychological functioning, perceived stress, and cancer-related anxiety.	Participants (n = 2969; Mage = 32.5 ± 8.5 years, 24.1 years since diagnosis, 49.1% female) obtained a mean score on the PTSD Checklist of 27.7, which is comparable to a normative population. Using established cutoffs, 11.8% obtained scores in the at-risk range. Multivariable modeling indicated that psychological factors [global distress (p < 0.0001), perceived stress (p = 0.001), cancer-related anxiety (p < 0.0001)] and demographic variables [female gender (p < 0.0001), survivors with less than a college education (p = 0.002)] were risk factors for increased PTSS.

89,21110803,Current medicinal chemistry,Targeting the Nogo receptor complex in diseases of the central nervous system.,"After injury to the central nervous system intrinsic factors such as myelin associated inhibitory factors inhibit cellular and axonal regeneration resulting in permanent disability. Three of these factors (Nogo-A, oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, myelin-associated glycoprotein) bind to a common receptor: the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1). NgR1 is expressed mainly on neurons and is usually associated in a trimolecular complex. The second member of the complex, LINGO-1, is often connected to NgR1 function and is further found to function independently as a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation. The third member of the NgR complex is either the p75 neurotrophin receptor, TROY, or an as yet unidentified co-receptor. Targeting of factors contained in this complex has been described to lead to the promotion of neurite outgrowth, oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation and inhibition of cell death. In the current review, we aim to describe the mechanisms of action of the chemical and biological compounds used in targeting NgR1 and LINGO-1. This will be achieved using three examples: blocking of ligand binding to NgR1 in treatment of spinal cord injury, antibody-mediated inhibition of LINGO-1 to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation in multiple sclerosis, and the use of soluble NgR1 to sequester Abeta peptide in the periphery in Alzheimer's disease.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
90,31706919,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,The role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).,"Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the major cause of death that affects patients with epilepsy. The risk of SUDEP increases according to the frequency and severity of uncontrolled seizures; therefore, SUDEP risk is higher in patients with refractory epilepsy (RE), in whom most antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are ineffective for both seizure control and SUDEP prevention. Consequently, RE and SUDEP share a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, which is mainly associated with brain overexpression of ABC-transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The activity of P-gp can also contribute to membrane depolarization and affect the normal function of neurons and cardiomyocytes. Other molecular regulators of membrane potential are the inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir), whose genetic variants have been related to both epilepsy and heart dysfunctions. Although it has been suggested that dysfunctions of the cardiac, respiratory, and brainstem arousal systems are the causes of SUDEP, the molecular basis for explaining its dysfunctions remain unknown. In rats, repetitive seizures or status epilepticus induced high expression of P-gp and loss Kir expression in the brain and heart, and promoted membrane depolarization, malignant bradycardia, and the high rate of mortality. Here we reviewed clinical and experimental evidences suggesting that abnormal expression of depolarizing/repolarizing factors as P-gp and Kir could favor persistent depolarization of membranes without any rapid functional recovery capacity. This condition induced by convulsive stress could be the molecular mechanism leading to acquired severe bradycardia, as an ineffective heart response generating the appropriate scenario for SUDEP development.

Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 (PS1) genes are fully penetrant and cause early-onset AD. Mutations in presenilin 2, a PS1 homologue, cause partially penetrant autosomal dominant AD with onset age beginning at 40 years and extending past 75 years. A fourth gene, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a risk-factor for late-onset AD. Over 40 genes have been tested as AD candidate genes, yet none has been clearly established as an AD risk factor. Linkage studies have implicated a number of chromosome regions as possible sites for late-onset AD loci with the strongest evidence being for chromosome 12. Candidate genes in this region include alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related gene (LRP), although neither has been clearly established as an AD gene. Identification of additional late-onset genes will require larger samples, more sophisticated analysis methods, and large-scale positional cloning efforts.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), West syndrome, late infantile epileptic encephalopathy, and Lennox-Gastaut are four epilepsy syndromes. These epilepsies are also among the most severe with dire consequences including intractable seizures and severe cognitive dysfunction. These epilepsies share several important characteristics: diverse causes; severe and frequent seizures; diffusely abnormal background activity on electroencephalograms that is often profound; medical intractability; and severe consequences for a normal development. Ohtahara proposed that these epilepsies exist on an electroclinical spectrum and that the clinical and electroencephalogram features are dependent on the maturation of the nervous system. One can now add Late Infantile Epileptogenic Encephalopathy (LIEE) or epilepsy with late-onset of epileptic spasms. Recently, similar gene mutations have been found in several different epilepsy syndromes, reinforcing the notion that these epilepsies are not likely to be distinguished based on cause alone. Recognition and accurate classification of these severe epilepsies is important as the first step toward improving treatment and outcomes.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
93,12395691,Psychopharmacology bulletin,Comparing the methods used to compare antidepressants.,"A wide array of antidepressants are now available to treat depression. However, the conventional wisdom that these medications are equally effective may not be true. It is argued that most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) do not have the power to discriminate between an effective and an even more effective medication. Until RCTs that enroll 300 or more patients per arm are conducted, or more sensitive research designs are developed, it will be difficult to determine if a 'not statistically different' finding reflects true therapeutic equivalence or if it is a false-negative result (or type II error). Statistical methods that evaluate data from a number of studies are used increasingly to compare treatment strategies. The relative merits and limitations of quantitative meta-analysis and pooled analysis of original data are discussed. The former method is preferred when a large number of relevant RCTs can be analyzed. Beyond the number of studies, publication bias ('file drawer' effect) and study selection criteria may influence outcomes of meta-analysis. Pooled analysis, which combines all original patient data, is preferred when there are only a handful of related RCTs. However, the integrity of a pooled analysis can be ruined by selective inclusion of studies ('cherry picking'). The validity of combining the data from different studies also must be demonstrated. Results of studies using these complementary methods suggest that there may be clinically meaningful differences in efficacy between several classes of antidepressants.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Drawing from a growing, but limited, literature on the topic, we outline a process map for identifying and troubleshooting barriers to care in this at-risk population.	Young adults with ADHD frequently lack the organizational skills, time management, prioritization, and persistence to manage their health care at an expected level of adult independence. These difficulties are compounded by a health-care system that has less time or fewer resources for supporting young adult patients.	Recommendations for easing the transition from pediatric to adult care for late adolescents with ADHD include heavily leveraging the doctor-patient relationship, and capturing the young adult's attention through technologies that already absorb them.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
95,6135252,Schizophrenia bulletin,Is there a tardive dysmentia?,"A change in the phenomenology of schizophrenia has been observed over the past several decades; affective disturbances and phasic courses have become more evident. Although there is no obvious single explanation for these changes, several ideas have been considered. The advent and use of antipsychotic drugs over the past 30 years stands out as the most significant change. Because it is well known that chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs can induce tardive dyskinesia and has been hypothesized to induce a supersensitivity psychosis, it is reasonable to believe that other behavioral changes may occur over time. We here describe a behavioral disorder that we have termed tardive dysmentia, involving changes in affect, activation level, and interpersonal interaction. A relationship between tardive dysmentia and tardive dyskinesia is suggested. It is our hypothesis that tardive dysmentia contributes to the changing course of schizophrenia and occurs after long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
96,11905606,The Lancet. Oncology,The seed and soil hypothesis: vascularisation and brain metastases.,"The development of a relevant mouse model for the establishment and growth of brain metastases is essential for study of the biology and therapy of brain metastasis. Injection of human tumour cells into the internal carotid artery of syngeneic or nude mice produces experimental metastases in specific regions of the brain; these are not due to patterns of initial cell arrest, motility, or invasiveness, but rather to the ability of metastatic tumour cells to grow. Whether the progressive growth of brain metastases depends on neovascularisation is not clear. Immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses show that the density of blood vessels within experimental metastases in the brains of nude mice, or within brain metastases derived from human lung cancer, is lower than in the adjacent, tumour-free brain parenchyma. However, blood vessels associated with brain metastases are dilated and contain many dividing endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis also reveals that tumour cells located less than 100 microm from a blood vessel are viable, whereas more distant tumour cells undergo apoptosis. The blood-brain barrier is intact in and around experimental brain metastases smaller than 0.25 mm in diameter, but is leaky in larger metastases. Nevertheless, the lesions are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The way in which the brain microenvironment influences the biological behaviour of tumour cells is a subject of intense investigation.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

We review the extent and correlates of dropping out of mental health treatment for individuals with schizophrenia and suggest strategies for facilitating treatment engagement. Although rates vary across studies, reviews of the literature suggest that up to one-third of individuals with serious mental illnesses who have had some contact with the mental health service system disengage from care. Younger age, male gender, ethnic minority background, and low social functioning have been consistently associated with disengagement from mental health treatment. Individuals with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders, as well as those with early-onset psychosis, are at particularly high risk of treatment dropout. Engagement strategies should specifically target these high-risk groups, as well as high-risk periods, including following an emergency room or hospital admission and the initial period of treatment. Interventions to enhance engagement in mental health treatment range from low-intensity interventions, such as appointment reminders, to high-intensity interventions, such as assertive community treatment. Disengagement from treatment may reflect the consumer's perspective that treatment is not necessary, is not meeting their needs, or is not being provided in a collaborative manner. An emerging literature on patient-centered care and shared decision making in psychiatry provides suggestive evidence that efforts to enhance client-centered communication and promote individuals' active involvement in mental health treatment decisions can also improve engagement in treatment.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
100,26169474,Ageing research reviews,"Autobiographical memory decline in Alzheimer's disease, a theoretical and clinical overview.","Autobiographical memory, or memory for personal experiences, allows individuals to define themselves and construct a meaningful life story. Decline of this ability, as observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), results in an impaired sense of self and identity. In our model (AMAD: Autobiographical Memory in Alzheimer's Disease), we present a critical review of theories and findings regarding cognitive and neuroanatomical underpinnings of autobiographical memory and its decline in AD and highlight studies on its clinical rehabilitation. We propose that autobiographical recall in AD is mainly characterized by loss of associated episodic information, which leads to de-contextualization of autobiographical memories and a shift from reliving past events to a general sense of familiarity. This decline refers to retrograde, but also anterograde amnesia that affects newly acquired memories besides remote ones. One consequence of autobiographical memory decline in AD is decreased access to memories that shape self-consciousness, self-knowledge, and self-images, leading to a diminished sense of self and identity. The link between autobiographical decline and compromised sense of self in AD can also manifest itself as low correspondence and coherence between past memories and current goals and beliefs. By linking cognitive, neuroanatomical, and clinical aspects of autobiographical decline in AD, our review provides a theoretical foundation, which may lead to better rehabilitation strategies.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

There is, however, less knowledge about what psychological interventions may be helpful in reducing these symptoms. Evidence from the literature, to date, suggests that of the seven studies that have addressed this issue only four were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, all these studies included less than 100 patients with the vast majority reporting positive results. Overall, it seems that although cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT)-based psychological interventions appear to be efficacious in the treatment of PPTS, the studies are too small to draw any firm conclusions and should be subjected to larger good-quality RCTs. Further research will also need to establish the role of mediating variables such as shame and depression in the treatment of PPTS.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

With the structural and mechanistic elucidation of the BBB under both physiological and pathological conditions, it is now viable to target central nervous system (CNS) disorders utilizing the presence of transferrin (Tf) receptors (TfRs). However, overexpression of these TfRs on the GBM cell surface can also help to avoid restrictions of GBM cells to deliver chemotherapeutic agents within the tumor. Therefore, targeting of TfR-mediated delivery could counteract drug delivery issues in GBM and create a delivery system that could cross the BBB effectively to utilize ligand-conjugated drug complexes through receptor-mediated transcytosis. Hence, approach towards successful delivery of antitumor agents to the gliomas has been making possible through targeting these overexpressed TfRs within the CNS and glioma cells.

The illness distresses the person and impairs his or her social functioning and quality of life. MDD is characterized by marked sadness or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, and is accompanied by weight change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, physical impairment and a high suicide rate. In 2000, the World Health Organization, or WHO, identified MDD as the fourth ranked cause of disability and premature death in the world. WHO projected that by 2020, MDD would rise in disease burden to be second only to ischemic heart disease. The disorder is common in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence rate of 17 percent and a recurrence rate of more than 50 percent.	MDD may be associated with extensive dental disease, and people may seek dental treatment before becoming aware of their psychiatric illness. MDD frequently is associated with a disinterest in performing appropriate oral hygiene techniques, a cariogenic diet, diminished salivary flow, rampant dental caries, advanced periodontal disease and oral dysesthesias. Many medications used to treat the disease magnify the xerostomia and increase the incidence of dental disease. Appropriate dental management requires a vigorous dental education program, the use of saliva substitutes and anticaries agents containing fluoride, and special precautions when prescribing or administering analgesics and local anesthetics.

106,23095594,L'Encephale,"[Acute catatonia: Questions, diagnosis and prognostics, and the place of atypical antipsychotics].","Acute catatonia is a non-specific, relatively frequent syndrome, which manifests itself through characteristic motor signs that enables its diagnosis. It occurs in association with mood disorders, psychotic disorders and several somatic or toxic diseases. Its short-term prognosis is of paramount importance. Without effective treatment, it is associated with high mortality. Despite the vital risk inherent in this disorder, it is not recognized as an independent diagnostic category by international rankings, which makes its diagnostic detection difficult and consequently does not allow adequate therapeutic care. However, if benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy have proved effective in the treatment of acute catatonia, the role of atypical antipsychotics remains controversial. In fact, despite the progress made by the DSM-IV-TR and CIM 10 by the recognition of the etiologic diversity of catatonia, we deplore the absence to date of a consensus on clinical management and therapy of catatonia, which constitutes a source of confusion for practitioners in their approach to catatonic patients. To illustrate the difficulty in supporting these patients, we report here a clinical vignette.	Mr. M. aged 21, without psychiatric history, has shown a functional acute psychotic episode involving a delirious and hallucinatory syndrome associated with a marked catatonic dimension. Olanzapine was initiated at a dose of 10mg/d on the nineth day of hospitalization; the clinical picture was complicated by a malignant catatonia justifying the halt of olanzapine and the institution, in intensive units, of 15mg per day of lorazepam. After 72hours, the patient has not responded to this treatment. ECT was expected, but the patient died on the 12th day.	This case raises a threefold question: the crucial issue of immediate vital prognosis, that of the truthfulness of the positive diagnosis of this psychotic table and finally the issue of therapeutic care, primarily the well-founded or otherwise use of an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of this type of psychotic disorder. For Mr. M., the clinical diagnosis that he has shown, according to the DSM IV-TR, is brief psychotic disorder 'temporary diagnosis'. This diagnosis - brief psychotic disorder - does not actually allow for a specific clinical approach to this type of psychotic table. The immediate vital prognosis inherent in the catatonic dimension may not be properly evaluated and the therapeutic conduct may miss the application of the specific treatment of the catatonic syndrome. The proper diagnosis for this type of psychotic disorder would be 'catatonia' as proposed by Taylor and Fink, instead of 'brief psychotic disorder' if the international rankings have included this disorder as a separate and independent diagnosis. The identification by international rankings of the catatonic syndrome as an independent diagnostic category seems essential for clinicians to allow: its clinical detection, the establishment of a syndromic diagnosis of catatonic disorder, appropriate prognostic evaluation and finally, the application of a suitable therapeutic strategy. Conventional treatment, benzodiazepine- and/or ECT-based, can solve the catatonic episode in a few days, irrespective of its etiology and its severity. Moreover, while all authors agree that conventional antipsychotics may induce a catatonic state or worsen a preexisting catatonia into a malignant catatonia and should thus be avoided for catatonic patients or with prior catatonic episodes, recent data from the literature emphasize the frequent and successful use of atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, in various clinical forms of benign catatonia. However, our patient did not respond to treatment with olanzapine and got even more complicated. Was the malignant catatonia that this patient has shown induced by olanzapine ? The answer to this question seems difficult since some authors report the efficacy of olanzapine in malignant catatonia. We wonder if we should have kept olanzapine and strengthen its dosage like Cassidy et al. in 2001 and Suzuki et al. in 2010 for the treatment of the malignant form constituted in this patient rather than having stopped it and used lorazepam as indicated by Taylor and Fink in 2003.	The non-recognition of catatonia as an independent entity, the lack of a therapeutic consensus and the pending issue on the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of catatonia are at the origin of the difficulties of therapeutic support of catatonic patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The current definitions for remission (e.g. a score of </=7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), however, allow for the presence of residual symptoms of depression even if remission is attained. The focus now is on the quality of remission, that is, ensuring a minimum of such residual symptoms, because the consequences of low-quality remission also include impairment in psychosocial functioning. The most common residual symptoms are sleep disturbances, fatigue, and disinterest. Sleep-associated residual symptoms are particularly common, and are a major concern because most current treatments fail to adequately address sleep disturbances and may even aggravate them. Other side effects of current treatments, such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction, may also reduce the quality of remission. A novel approach to the treatment of depression with agomelatine, a melatonergic MT1 and MT2 receptor agonist and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, may be an effective treatment that improves the quality of remission, as it combines good efficacy with positive effects on sleep, neutral effects on sexual function, and a favorable side effect profile.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Epidemiological surveillance is an essential instrument for planning, managing and distributing community health resources, for following up the natural history of chronic diseases and for assessing the impact of programmes of prevention. In this respect, and from a functional point of view, the proposed registry of dementias meets all the basic requirements of epidemiological surveillance.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
115,17565028,Chest,Sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes.,"The latest edition of The International Classification of Sleep Disorders: Diagnostic and Coding Manual subsumes a broad range of disorders under the heading 'Sleep Related Hypoventilation/Hypoxemic Syndromes.' Some are quite common, such as COPD with worsening gas exchange during sleep; while some are exceedingly rare, such as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. All share the attribute of abnormal gas exchange that worsens, or may only be present, during sleep. The sleep state, the sleeping posture, and the circadian rhythm driving sleep all may affect respiration by altering control of breathing and/or pulmonary mechanics. These changes are largely inconsequential in the normal individual but interact with respiratory, neurologic, or neuromuscular disease to manifest as the sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes. In addition to optimal treatment of the underlying disorder (when known and when possible), treatment usually involves nocturnal ventilatory support that is now most commonly provided by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Longitudinal and experimental training studies are examined in detail, as these are considered most appropriate for exploring a causal hypothesis of this nature. A particular focus of our analysis is the degree to which studies to date have controlled for existing literacy skills in their participants and the influence that these skills might have on performance on phonological awareness tasks. We conclude that no study has provided unequivocal evidence that there is a causal link from competence in phonological awareness to success in reading and spelling acquisition. However, we believe that such a study is possible and outline some ideas for its design and implementation.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Well-controlled laboratory studies have provided insights regarding the underlying mechanisms. Several large prospective studies suggest that these sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes. Obstructive sleep apnea, which combines sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia, is a major risk factor for insulin resistance and possibly diabetes. Whether glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients can be improved by treating sleep apnea remains controversial. Recently, sleep disturbances during pregnancy and their relationship to gestational diabetes and hyperglycemia have received considerable attention owing to potential adverse effects on maternal and fetal health. Additionally, evidence from animal models has identified disruption of the circadian system as a putative risk factor for adverse metabolic outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current state of knowledge linking sleep disturbances, circadian dysfunction, and glucose metabolism.

American journal of neuroradiology,Carotid Artery Wall Imaging: Perspective and Guidelines from the ASNR Vessel Wall Imaging Study Group and Expert Consensus Recommendations of the American Society of Neuroradiology.,"Identification of carotid artery atherosclerosis is conventionally based on measurements of luminal stenosis and surface irregularities using in vivo imaging techniques including sonography, CT and MR angiography, and digital subtraction angiography. However, histopathologic studies demonstrate considerable differences between plaques with identical degrees of stenosis and indicate that certain plaque features are associated with increased risk for ischemic events. The ability to look beyond the lumen using highly developed vessel wall imaging methods to identify plaque vulnerable to disruption has prompted an active debate as to whether a paradigm shift is needed to move away from relying on measurements of luminal stenosis for gauging the risk of ischemic injury. Further evaluation in randomized clinical trials will help to better define the exact role of plaque imaging in clinical decision-making. However, current carotid vessel wall imaging techniques can be informative. The goal of this article is to present the perspective of the ASNR Vessel Wall Imaging Study Group as it relates to the current status of arterial wall imaging in carotid artery disease.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The resulting visual impairment can be debilitating for patients, impeding daily activities such as reading and mobility. Historically, it was believed that there was little opportunity for restoration of function following visual system damage. However, the development of various visual rehabilitative strategies suggests that visual field defects are partially repairable and a certain degree of function can be improved. While this provides hope for patients, many of these strategies have been met with skepticism within the clinical and scientific communities. Further development of these strategies through carefully designed studies could validate their efficacy and reveal underlying mechanisms.

Uncertainties remain whether there is a single underlying mechanism for visual hallucinations or they have different disease-dependent causes. However, irrespective of mechanism, visual hallucinations are difficult to treat. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded a research programme to investigate visual hallucinations in the key and high burden areas of eye disease, dementia and Parkinson's disease, culminating in a workshop to develop a unified framework for their clinical management. Here we summarise the evidence base, current practice and consensus guidelines that emerged from the workshop.Irrespective of clinical condition, case ascertainment strategies are required to overcome reporting stigma. Once hallucinations are identified, physical, cognitive and ophthalmological health should be reviewed, with education and self-help techniques provided. Not all hallucinations require intervention but for those that are clinically significant, current evidence supports pharmacological modification of cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic systems, or reduction of cortical excitability. A broad treatment perspective is needed, including carer support. Despite their frequency and clinical significance, there is a paucity of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial evidence where the primary outcome is an improvement in visual hallucinations. Key areas for future research include the development of valid and reliable assessment tools for use in mechanistic studies and clinical trials, transdiagnostic studies of shared and distinct mechanisms and when and how to treat visual hallucinations.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The interactions between TP and intestinal microbiota suggest that probiotics intervention is a useful method to ameliorate neurological diseases. Now, numerous researches have suggested that TP plays a significant role in modulating intestinal bacteria, especially in the area of sustaining a stable state of intestinal microbial function and abundance. Furthermore, homeostatic intestinal bacteria can enhance the immunity of the host. The close reciprocity between intestinal microbiota and the central nervous system provides a new chance for TP to modulate neural-related diseases depending on intestinal microbiota. Therefore, based on the bidirectional relationship between the brain and the intestines, this review provides a new clue to solve insomnia symptoms and related neurological diseases that will enable us to better study the bidirectional effects of TP and intestinal microbiota on the improvement of host health.

The mismatch between the modern diet and the still ancient biological machinery of humans subtly but chronically disorders their internal milieu, giving rise to a prolonged state of low-grade potassium deficiency and low-grade metabolic acidosis whose severity increases with age. Supplemental KCI cannot redress this mismatch and correct this state. However, the mismatch is redressed and the state corrected by restoring intakes of K+ and HCO3- to levels approaching those in the diet of our prehistoric forebearers, with either fruits and vegetables or with supplemental KHCO3. So restored, KHCO3 can: 1) attenuate hypertension and possibly prevent its occurrence by suppressing the phenomenon of normotensive NaCl-sensitivity, in part by its natriuretic effect; (2) prevent kidney stones by reducing urinary excretion of calcium and increasing urinary excretion of citrate; (3) ameliorate and protect against the occurrence of osteoporosis by increasing the renal retention of calcium and phosphorus, and by suppressing bone resorption and enhancing bone formation; and (4) likely prevent stroke.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Those opposed to all instances of PAD point to Belgium and the Netherlands as a dark warning that once PAD is legalized, restricting it will prove impossible because safeguards, such as the requirement that a patient be terminally ill, will inevitably be eroded or discarded. However, some supporters respond that limiting PAD to those suffering from terminal illness, or physical illnesses generally, is arbitrary and illogical. In addition, precisely because such patients are not terminally ill, their suffering may last for years, even the rest of their lives. Finally, severe depression may not be treatable.

133,31705515,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Digital Interventions for Mental Disorders: Key Features, Efficacy, and Potential for Artificial Intelligence Applications.","Mental disorders are highly prevalent and often remain untreated. Many limitations of conventional face-to-face psychological interventions could potentially be overcome through Internet-based and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This chapter introduces core features of IMIs, describes areas of application, presents evidence on the efficacy of IMIs as well as potential effect mechanisms, and delineates how Artificial Intelligence combined with IMIs may improve current practices in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in adults. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials clearly show that therapist-guided IMIs can be highly effective for a broad range of mental health problems. Whether the effects of unguided IMIs are also clinically relevant, particularly under routine care conditions, is less clear. First studies on IMIs for the prevention of mental disorders have shown promising results. Despite limitations and challenges, IMIs are increasingly implemented into routine care worldwide. IMIs are also well suited for applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which provides ample opportunities to improve the identification and treatment of mental disorders. Together with methodological innovations, these approaches may also deepen our understanding of how psychological interventions work, and why. Ethical and professional restraints as well as potential contraindications of IMIs, however, should also be considered. In sum, IMIs have a high potential for improving the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders across various indications, settings, and populations. Therefore, implementing IMIs into routine care as both adjunct and alternative to face-to-face treatment is highly desirable. Technological advancements may further enhance the variability and flexibility of IMIs, and thus even further increase their impact in people's lives in the future.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Several compounds are under development that address both underlying pathophysiological abnormalities and core ASD symptoms. This article reviews one of these treatments, d,l-leucovorin calcium (also known as folinic acid) for treatment of folate pathway abnormalities in children with ASD. Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that is essential for normal neurodevelopment and abnormalities in the folate and related pathways have been identified in children with ASD. One of these abnormalities involves a partial blockage in the ability of folate to be transported into the brain utilizing the primary transport mechanism, the folate receptor alpha. Autoantibodies which interfere with the function of the folate receptor alpha called folate receptor alpha autoantibodies have been identified in 58%-76% of children with ASD and independent studies have demonstrated that blood titers of these autoantibodies correlate with folate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Most significantly, case-series, open-label, and single and double-blind placebo-controlled studies suggest that d,l-leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the blockage at the folate receptor alpha by using the reduced folate carrier, an alternate pathway, can substantially improve particular symptoms in children with ASD, especially those positive for folate receptor alpha autoantibodies.

144,23265360,Medical hypotheses,Angiotensin receptor blockers for bipolar disorder.,"Studies have suggested that the brain renin angiotensin system (RAS) regulates cerebral flow, autonomic and hormonal systems, stress, innate immune response and behavior, being implicated in several brain disorders such as major depression, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1R) is distributed in brain regions responsible for the control of stress response through peripheral and central sympathetic hyperactivation as well as in the hypothalamic paraventricular region, areas known for the release of several neurotransmitters related to inflammatory response facilitation. This relationship leads to the assumption that AT1R might be the receptor most related to the central deleterious actions of angiotensin II. New evidences from clinical studies have shown a possible role for RAS in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BD), a multifactorial disorder with acknowledged presence of neuronal damage via oxidative stress in brain areas such as hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum. Given the studies highlighting AT1R activation as a central pro-inflammatory pathway and, conversely, the involvement of inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of BD; this paper hypothesizes the use of AT1R antagonists for BD management and prevention of its neuroprogression, due to their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
145,10749516,Clinical pharmacokinetics,Is there a role for therapeutic drug monitoring of new anticonvulsants?,"Despite the fact that all new anticonvulsants have undergone extensive pharmacokinetic scrutiny prior to their introduction to the market, the opportunity to perform good prospective studies on their concentration-effect relationship has been largely missed, in some cases deliberately because therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is considered unfavourable for the marketing of a new drug. However, there are reasons to believe that TDM may play a useful role in maximising the therapeutic potential of new anticonvulsants. In fact, these drugs have a narrow therapeutic index, careful individualisation of dosage to optimise response is required, and inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic variability may translate into differences in dosage requirements. The wide interindividual variability in the serum concentrations at which therapeutic and toxic effects of these drugs are observed does not necessarily imply that TDM cannot be useful: indeed, a marked pharmacodynamic variability has also been reported for all the currently monitored older anticonvulsants. The new anticonvulsants which, based on their properties, are particularly attractive candidates for TDM include lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, zonisamide and felbamate. However, in the absence on sound information on the target concentration ranges of these drugs, the routine concentration monitoring of these drugs cannot be recommended. Despite this, serial measurements of serum drug concentrations may be useful in selected patients, especially those suspected of poor compliance and those in whom pharmacokinetic changes caused by disease or administration of concomitant medication are anticipated. Even in the presence of marked interindividual pharmacodynamic variability, it is often possible to empirically determine the concentration at which each patient exhibits the best response, and apply that information in subsequent management. Prospective studies, using preferably a randomised concentration-controlled design, are necessary to better characterise concentration-effect relationships for these agents.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Occupational therapy is a client-centered profession that uses meaningful activities across the spectrum of physical and mental domains to reduce limitations after stroke. Where remediation is not possible, occupational therapists implement compensatory strategies to promote independence. Rehabilitation is based on the concept of brain plasticity, which implies that it is possible to modulate or facilitate cerebral reorganization by external inputs. Occupational therapy activities are specifically geared to promote this re-education process and encourage the development of lost skills while accommodating for specific physical, cognitive or affective impairments. Principles of motor, sensory, cognitive and affective rehabilitation are incorporated into effective task-specific activities and environments are adapted to create the optimum conditions for successful rehabilitation. Several promising new rehabilitation approaches, based on neuropsychology and technological advances, have been developed to complement therapy inputs and exploit the brain's capacity to recover from stroke.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
149,6262150,Developments in biological standardization,Herd effect and virus eradication with use of killed poliovirus vaccine.,"Use of killed poliovirus vaccine reliably provides protection against paralysis in individuals and can reduce the transmission of poliovirus in communities to the point of eradication. In some countries improved hygienic conditions have blocked the fecal-oral spread of poliovirus as indicated by a shift in the age distribution and the occurrence of epidemic outbreaks of poliomyelitis. In these countries pharyngeal spread is the principal means of poliovirus transmission, and it is effectively blocked by use of killed poliovirus vaccine. In countries where poliomyelitis is endemic the fecal-oral route of spread may play a more significant role; it remains to be seen if there will be an epidemiologic effect from the reduction in fecal virus excretion that is associated with high levels of serum antibody induced by potent killed poliovirus vaccine. Nevertheless, killed poliovirus vaccine will prevent paralysis in individuals in countries where poliomyelitis is endemic, and it can prevent the disease from becoming epidemic as hygienic conditions improve.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Individuals with social anxiety disorder frequently have psychiatric comorbidity, including mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders, that can further impair a person's ability to function. This article reviews the literature on social anxiety disorder and explores questions regarding its prevalence, rates of recognition and treatment, and natural history. The association between social anxiety disorder and psychiatric comorbidity and suicide is reviewed, as well as quality-of-life issues, including the impact of social anxiety disorder on educational attainment, occupational functioning and financial dependency, marital status, and health care utilization. There is a need for further study and greater awareness among primary health care providers about the prevalence and treatment of social anxiety disorder.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
151,25666180,Recent patents on CNS drug discovery,Genetic and bioinformatic studies of antidepressant drug therapeutic efficacy and toxicity: a current overview.,"Antidepressants can relief human depression and reduce human depressive symptoms. Nevertheless, some undesired clinical events, such as suicide have been emerging. As for 2004, the US and European regulatory agencies began implementing verification programs to assess the influence on suicidal behavior from the use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). With the increasing number of reported cases, several newly developed antidepressants were faced with withdrawal from the markets. Despite unclear cause of suicide, researches focusing on revealing the relationship between efficacy and toxicities of antidepressants have been initiated in China and US. To deal with these undesired clinical consequences, new initiatives and revolutionary ideas have been proposed and verified.

152,26890312,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,Pharmacological considerations in the use of stiripentol for the treatment of epilepsy.,"Despite the fact that more than 20 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are currently available, about one-third of patients still present drug resistance. Further efforts are required to develop novel and more efficacious therapeutic strategies, especially for refractory epileptic syndromes showing few and anecdotic therapeutic options.	Stiripentol (STP) is a second generation AED that shows GABAergic activity, with immature brain selectivity, and an indirect metabolic action on co-administered AEDs. Two pivotal studies demonstrated STP efficacy in patients with Dravet syndrome with refractory partial seizures, and marketing authorization in Europe, Canada and Japan was granted thereafter. Post-marketing surveys reported a good efficacy and tolerability profile. In addition, interesting data is currently emerging regarding off-label experimentation of STP in other forms of epilepsy.	STP is an important addition to the limited treatment options available for patients resistant to common AEDs. The possibility to inhibit seizures through the metabolic pathway of lactate dehydrogenase and the inhibitory effects on the entry of Na(+) and Ca(2+) are the most recent findings to emerge about STP and could be proof of its neuroprotective action. Moreover, its positive effects on cognitive function, its good safety and tolerability profile and the increasing data about STP efficacy on other refractory epileptic syndromes may prove to be fertile grounds for further investigation.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Appropriate selection of donor and recipient nerves and surgical timing affect functional outcomes. Although the gold standard of nerve selection is intraoperative nerve stimulation, preoperative electrodiagnostic (EDX) evaluation may help guide surgical planning. Currently there is no standardized preoperative EDX protocol. This study reviews the EDX workup preceding PNT surgery in cervical SCI and proposes an informed EDX protocol to assist with surgical planning. The PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework was used to formulate relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and identify published cases of PNT in cervical SCI in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Emcare databases in the last 10 years. The EDX techniques evaluating putative donor nerves, recipient nerve branches, time sensitivity of nerve transfer and other electrophysiological parameters were summarized to guide creation of a preoperative EDX protocol. Needle electromyography (EMG) was the most commonly used EDX technique to identify healthy donor nerves. Although needle EMG has also been used on recipient nerves, compound muscle action potential amplitudes may provide a more accurate determination of recipient nerve health and time sensitivity for nerve transfer. Although there has been progress in presurgical EDX evaluation, EMG and nerve conduction study approaches are variable, and each has limitations in their utility for preoperative planning. There is need for standardization in the EDX evaluation preceding PNT surgery to assist with donor and recipient nerve selection, surgical timing and to optimize outcomes. Based on results of this review, herein we propose the PreSCIse (PRotocol for Electrodiagnosis in SCI Surgery of the upper Extremity) preoperative EDX panel to achieve said goals through an interdisciplinary and patient-centered approach.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

155,11510567,International review of cytology,Nonneuronal cellular prion protein.,"The normal cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) is a membrane sialoglycoprotein of unknown function having the unique property of adopting an abnormal tertiary conformation. The pathological conformer PrP(sc) would be the agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases. They include scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The conversion of PrP(c) into PrP(sc) in the brain governs the clinical phenotype of the disease. However, the three-dimensional structure change of PrP(c) can also take place outside the central nervous system, in nonneuronal cells particularly of lymphoid tissue where the agent replicates. In natural infection, PrP(c) in nonneuronal cells of peripheral extracerebral organs may play a key role as the receptor required to enable the entry of the infectious agent into the host. In the present review we have undertaken a first evaluation of compelling data concerning the PrP(c)-expressing cells of nonneuronal origin present in cerebral and extracerebral tissues. The analysis of tissue, cellular, and subcellular localization of PrP(c) may help us better understand the biological function of PrP(c) and provide some information on physiopathological processes underlying prion diseases.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

An 11-year-old Chinese girl presented with sudden onset of bilateral blurred vision. The clinical history, imaging studies, and molecular analysis results were reviewed. The PubMed and OVID databases were used for literature review.	Nonischemic CRVO in the subject's right eye and tortuosity of small and medium-sized retinal arterioles in the left eye were found at initial presentation. Bilateral optic disc pallor was then noted with recovery of CRVO. Severe headache and several stroke-like episodes occurred subsequently, with elevated lactate levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome was diagnosed, and mitochondrial DNA sequencing revealed G13513A heteroplasmic mutation. Vision was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/800 in the left eye at the last visit.	Mitochondrial DNA G13513A mutation can cause LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome. Nonischemic CRVO is a rare manifestation of LHON/MELAS. Atypical findings in cases of LHON should raise the suspicion of overlap syndrome or other mitochondrial diseases.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The history of 'harm reduction' in New York City is characterized within changing historical periods and in relation to the actions of stakeholders. The expansion is traced over four periods: (i) 1984-1989: emergence, activism, and science; (ii) 1990-1994 reckoning: syringe exchange legislation and consolidation; (iii) 1995-1999: bureaucratization, opposition, and challenges to institutional control; and (iv) 2000-2010 revitalization: expansion of syringe access and harm reduction. It is clear from this review that the leadership of activism and the work of advocates catalyzed syringe access policy and practice. Without this 'push,' it is unlikely that New York City would have experienced the dramatic decline in HIV infection among drug injectors in the 1990s. Second, successful arguments for expanding syringe access in New York City were based on the high HIV/AIDS infection rates. Thus, program developments were advocated as HIV prevention interventions, rather than as expanded services for addressing broader health and social issues of injecting drug use.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

As manifold as the terminology of syringomyelia are the hypotheses of the etiology. Nowadays with MRI without and with gadolinium it is possible to recognize intramedullar cavities safely, the MR especially the cine-MR provides information on pathophysiological details of the flow and intracavitary pressure dependent pulsations of the CSF. Animal models and the findings of own experimental studies have enabled us to study a form of syringomyelia which very closely resembles that brought about by dysrhaphic malformations in the human being and to examine the effectiveness of certain types of surgical therapy. In this paper the term syringomyelia is only used for dysrhaphic cavities in the medulla. After our experience with 61 patients with syringomyelia now we perform the operative decompression of the craniocervical transition as the first step in the operative treatment of the progressive syringomyelia combined with severe craniocervical malformations.

Accumulating evidence has shown that TLE is a disorder of abnormal epileptogenic networks, rather than focal sources. Graph theory allows for a network-based representation of TLE brain networks, and has potential to illuminate characteristics of brain topology conducive to TLE pathophysiology, including seizure initiation and spread. We review basic concepts which we believe will prove helpful in interpreting results rapidly emerging from graph theory research in TLE. In addition, we summarize the current state of graph theory findings in TLE as they pertain its pathophysiology. Several common findings have emerged from the many modalities which have been used to study TLE using graph theory, including structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, surface EEG, intracranial EEG, magnetoencephalography, functional MRI, cell cultures, simulated models, and mouse models, involving increased regularity of the interictal network configuration, altered local segregation and global integration of the TLE network, and network reorganization of temporal lobe and limbic structures. As different modalities provide different views of the same phenomenon, future studies integrating data from multiple modalities are needed to clarify findings and contribute to the formation of a coherent theory on the pathophysiology of TLE.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

This risk seems to be related to the COX-2 inhibitory potency and has been found with most NSAIDs except naproxen. Two main hypotheses have been advanced: an imbalance between COX-1-dependent platelet production of thromboxane and partly COX-2-dependent endothelial production of prostacyclin, and a COX-2-dependent increase in blood pressure.	Clinical trials and observational studies providing information about cardiovascular risk associated with long-term use of NSAIDs were retrieved; 14 clinical trials and 16 observational studies mentioned a follow-up of at least 6 months.	Results are ambiguous: long-term exposure seemed associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke with high-dose rofecoxib, and perhaps diclofenac, but less with other NSAIDs. In other studies, little or no increase in risk was associated with exposures shorter than 30 days. Since most NSAIDs are rarely used long term, there is little information on risks associated with long-term use.

Redistribution of body heat and heat loss to the environment result in mild hypothermia before cardiopulmonary bypass. Maintenance of normothermia, rather than hypothermia, may facilitate early tracheal extubation. Hypothermia alters the distribution and decreases the metabolism of most drugs, including anesthetic drugs and muscle relaxants, thus prolonging recovery. Postoperative shivering increases metabolic rate and potentially leads to myocardial ischemia; prevention is therefore critical to the success of early tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery. Coagulopathies, increased incidence of surgical wound infection, and perioperative cardiac morbidity are other potential risk factors identified in noncardiac patients. Hypothermia, however, does have potential benefits to the patient, including protection from cerebral ischemia and hypoxemia. Mild core hypothermia (approximately 34 degrees C) may represent the optimal balance between risks and benefits for fast-track patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Throughout history, liver transplantation for this population has been controversial, and many policies and regulations have existed to limit access to lifesaving transplant for patients who use alcohol. In recent years, the rates of liver transplantation for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease have increased dramatically; however, disparities persist. For instance, many criteria used in evaluation for transplant listing, such as social support and prior knowledge of the harms of alcohol use, are not evidence based and may selectively disadvantage patients with alcohol use disorder. In addition, few transplant providers have adequate training in the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and few transplant centers offer specialized addiction treatment. Finally, current approaches to liver transplantation would benefit from adopting principles of harm reduction, which have demonstrated efficacy in the realm of addiction medicine for years. As we look toward the future, we must emphasize the use of evidence-based measures in selecting patients for listing, ensure access to high-quality addiction care for all patients pretransplant and posttransplant, and adopt harm reduction beliefs to better address relapse when it inevitably occurs. We believe that only by addressing each of these issues will we be able to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources in liver transplantation for all patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

169,33691710,Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,Comment: difference between assessment of upper limb movement and upper limb associated reactions during walking.,"While walking, people swing their arms in a specific pattern. This specific arm swing pattern during walking has shown to have a beneficial effect on gait as it reduces walking energy cost and optimizes balance. In several patient populations the arm movements can be directly affected (e.g. in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI)), which in turn has a negative effect on their gait pattern, balance and energy cost of walking.	In December 2019, Kahn et al. published a paper in JNER concerning the quantification of upper limb associated reactions (ARs) during walking in people with ABI. ARs are defined as 'an effort-dependent phenomenon causing an involuntary increase in upper limb muscle tone, with awkward and uncomfortable postures'. These upper limb ARs appear often in patients with ABI and can have an important effect on their gait. The authors calculated kinematic measures using three-dimensional gait analysis relating to range of motion, variability and mean position over the gait cycle for the different upper limb joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist) during self-selected steady-state walking. Based on differences they found between an ABI cohort and healthy control cohort, the authors concluded that they were able to quantify ARs during walking in this population. This calculation, however, is not specific for upper limb ARs. In fact, the authors calculated general measures of arm posture (e.g. mean position over the gait cycle) or arm movement (e.g. range of motion and variability) during gait. Previous research has already indicated that other factors than ARs can influence the posture or movement of the arm during gait in patients with brain injury, such as voluntary compensations for gait instability and contractures or spasticity of upper arm muscles. Yet, it is not possible to disentangle the different causes of the altered arm posture during steady-state walking based on the proposed measures.	The kinematic arm measures proposed by Kahn et al. (J Neuroeng Rehabil 16(1):160, 2019) are not a direct measure of ARs, but provide a quantification of overall deviation of arm posture or movement during gait. Depending on the specific study design these measures may provide insights in ARs.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

This paper reviews the neurobiology and pharmacotherapy of RLS, with a critical analysis of the heterogeneity and methodological limitations of the existing scientific literature.	Although several neurotransmitter systems dysfunction and neuroanatomical abnormalities have been implicated in RLS pathogenesis, dopamine dysfunction within basal ganglia pathways, iron deficiency and opioid system abnormalities have consistently been found to be involved. Their involvement is further strengthened by the therapeutic effectiveness of dopaminergic agents, iron supplementation and opioid medications.

174,27638306,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Possible role of mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease.,"Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurological disorder that affects the striatum and cortex of patients. HD patients develop progressive motor dysfunction and psychiatric disturbances with gradual dementia. HD is caused by a pathological expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene that codifies for a protein called huntingtin (Htt), which principal function is not completely understood. Accumulative evidence shows that this pathological expansion modifies Htt function affecting different neuronal targets, including mitochondrial function which is an important factor that contributes to HD. Interestingly, several groups have shown mitochondrial disturbances including calcium handling defects, depolarization, decrease of mitochondrial transport, ATP reduction, and increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cellular and murine HD models. Systematic analysis of this evidence indicates that a mitochondrial structure, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), could be responsible for these changes that affect mitochondria. The mPTP plays an important role in apoptosis and neurodegeneration. It has also been reported to have some physiological functions in heart development and synaptic communication. In HD, the presence of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) activates this mechanism producing a significant compromise of mitochondrial metabolism and bioenergetics. Considering these findings this review explores the evidence that suggests the important role of mPTP in the mitochondrial impairment induced by mHtt, which leads to calcium derangement and contributes to neuronal dysfunction in HD.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

To facilitate both, violations of the state nurse practice act must be reported, and the employee terminated if your documentation is adequate and treatment options you offer are not pursued. This harsh approach is necessary when the impaired practitioner puts patient care at risk. Kindness promotes chemical dependency, and the harsh action may be the only event that breaks through the denial. Fifteen percent of impaired practitioners who receive coordinated, supportive, and confrontational management are not motivated to seek treatment. Nurses must remember, however, that the remaining 85% respond positively to an established and comprehensive chemical dependency policy. Defined decision-making strategies concerning chemical dependency at the state and local level motivate practitioners to seek treatment to avoid licensure action. Perioperative nurses must meet the challenge to effectively manage chemical dependency. Employing recovering nurses in a structured framework is creative resource management. The ability to conserve talented and skilled practitioners preserves the nurturing strength of nurses and increases professional cohesion.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Biomaterials can help to increase the regenerative potential of cells and biomolecules by controlling transplanted cell fate and provide a local, sustained release of biomolecules. In this review, we describe the use of a hyaluronan/methylcellulose (HAMC)-based hydrogel as a delivery vehicle to the brain, spinal cord, and retina to promote cellular survival and tissue repair. We discuss various controlled release strategies to prolong the delivery of factors for neuroprotection. The versatility of this hydrogel for a diversity of applications highlights its potential to enhance cell- and biomolecule-based treatment strategies.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
180,27040285,Acta neuropathologica,Risk stratification of childhood medulloblastoma in the molecular era: the current consensus.,"Historical risk stratification criteria for medulloblastoma rely primarily on clinicopathological variables pertaining to age, presence of metastases, extent of resection, histological subtypes and in some instances individual genetic aberrations such as MYC and MYCN amplification. In 2010, an international panel of experts established consensus defining four main subgroups of medulloblastoma (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4) delineated by transcriptional profiling. This has led to the current generation of biomarker-driven clinical trials assigning WNT tumors to a favorable prognosis group in addition to clinicopathological criteria including MYC and MYCN gene amplifications. However, outcome prediction of non-WNT subgroups is a challenge due to inconsistent survival reports. In 2015, a consensus conference was convened in Heidelberg with the objective to further refine the risk stratification in the context of subgroups and agree on a definition of risk groups of non-infant, childhood medulloblastoma (ages 3-17). Published and unpublished data over the past 5 years were reviewed, and a consensus was reached regarding the level of evidence for currently available biomarkers. The following risk groups were defined based on current survival rates: low risk (>90 % survival), average (standard) risk (75-90 % survival), high risk (50-75 % survival) and very high risk (<50 % survival) disease. The WNT subgroup and non-metastatic Group 4 tumors with whole chromosome 11 loss or whole chromosome 17 gain were recognized as low-risk tumors that may qualify for reduced therapy. High-risk strata were defined as patients with metastatic SHH or Group 4 tumors, or MYCN-amplified SHH medulloblastomas. Very high-risk patients are Group 3 with metastases or SHH with TP53 mutation. In addition, a number of consensus points were reached that should be standardized across future clinical trials. Although we anticipate new data will emerge from currently ongoing and recently completed clinical trials, this consensus can serve as an outline for prioritization of certain molecular subsets of tumors to define and validate risk groups as a basis for future clinical trials.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
181,20433479,The International journal of psycho-analysis,Murder on the mind: tyranical power and other points along the perverse spectrum.,"This paper illustrates the breadth and depth of the spectrum of perversion and perversity as currently represented in the psychoanalytic literature, raises questions about recent tendencies to include a host of diverse-seeming phenomena under the same conceptual umbrella, and strives to demonstrate what these phenomena have in common that justifies lumping them together under the same rubric. One end of this spectrum is represented by the employment of simple fetishes introduced into a sexual scene in order to promote sexual arousal. Moving along the continuum, one encounters increasing complex behavioral patterns including the enactment of scripts that actualize one's perverse fantasies, including the assumption of complementary roles (e.g. sadomasochism) that equally serve the needs, and represent the desires, of both parties involved. A unique clinical entity, 'perverse modes of relatedness,' lies on the extreme end of the spectrum, representing the reification of the relationship as it becomes little more than a vehicle to take possession and control one's object for the gratification of one's sole needs and desires. What each of these phenomena share in common is both the insertion of a thing or condition - ranging from a simple fetishistic object to an elaborate style of relating that reduces the other into pawn played upon the pervert's chessboard, between the two 'relating' objects as well as a less than honest relationship with reality.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

These views have been informed by the evolution of psychoanalysis over the past 100 years, especially by the perspective provided by an early-life variant on the Oedipus complex (Osman 2000). The author postulates that an important reason for the happy conclusion of this analysis, surprising for its brevity, was that it expedited a mourning process that released a primitive bond to the patient's father, and also, in doing so, facilitated the emergence of a less encumbered and more individuated identity. While accomplishing this, constricting bonds to his late sister Katherine and to his mother were loosened as well.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

184,27469219,Current drug metabolism,Delivery of Nanoparticles for Treatment of Brain Tumor.,"Malignant brain tumor is a highly challenging disease for diagnosis, treatment, and management. Cytotoxicity, distribution and the ability to cross blood brain barrier are some of the most significant issues for the chemotherapy of brain tumors. Nanotechnology has been widely exploited in drug delivery with great potential in improving the drug efficiency and efficacy. The advent of nanotechnology would greatly facilitate the early detection and treatment of brain tumors. This review will be primarily focused on current nano drug delivery system for brain cancer therapy. Meanwhile, the existing impediments for therapeutic nanomedicines and critical analysis of the different delivery nanoparticles are also discussed.	We systematically evaluated the major factors that impact the current nanomedicines for brain tumor therapy. Meanwhile, various nanoparticle-based formulations for brain cancer detection and therapy are evaluated.	124 papers were included in this review. From the analysis of the nanomaterials, seven major nanomaterials have been discussed regarding the functionality and current therapeutic significance. The review also explains in detail about the different types of nanomaterials and their functionalities. This shows that each of these nanomaterials has specialized functions for the treatment of various kinds of brain cancer.	Nanomaterials provide a viable potential diagnosis mechanis. In the future, more research needs to be focused on developing a better diagnosis tool for detection of cancer on an urgent basis. Blood-brain barrier and cytotoxicity are some of the primary root causes for the impediment of treatment of cancer using nanoparticles. Therefore, different delivery systems should be exploited for the nanoparticles to surmount these issues.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

186,21885540,Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,Is it safe to stop anticoagulants after successful surgery for atrial fibrillation?,"A best evidence topic in cardiothoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was: is it safe to stop anticoagulants after successful surgery for atrial fibrillation? Altogether, 177 papers were found using the reported search, of which 14 were selected that represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. Selection criteria included study relevance, primary outcome, size of study population and length of follow-up. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The weight of evidence, including over 10,000 patient-years of follow-up, supports the discontinuation of warfarin following atrial fibrillation correction procedures as being safe, with an associated annual thromboembolic stroke rate of 0-3.8% off warfarin, in studies where warfarin was stopped at a mean of 3.6 months (range 0-8 months) after the procedure. However, the confidence of this conclusion suffers from a paucity of high-quality randomized controlled trials in the field, with the main body of evidence coming instead from observational non-randomized studies. The stroke rate also varies with the exact procedure performed; pulmonary vein isolation procedures are the most extensively evaluated and carry the lowest stroke rate following warfarin discontinuation (0-0.4% per annum when performed as an isolated procedure). By contrast, left atrial appendage occlusion by insertion of a transcatheter device has an associated annual stroke rate of 0-3.8% off warfarin. Thus, discontinuation of warfarin following such transcatheter procedures cannot be recommended at this time. Concomitant heart surgeries, such as mitral valve repair have been shown to increase the thromboembolic rate both unpredictably and dramatically, and this review thus identifies concomitant mitral valve surgery as a potentially substantial risk factor for late thromboembolic stroke in patients undergoing corrective surgeries for atrial fibrillation. This review finds in favour of warfarin discontinuation in selected patients at three months post-procedure, emphasizing consideration of the patient's individual risk-factor profile as paramount. This recommendation is in line with the 2010 guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation produced by the European Society of Cardiology.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
187,2744979,The International journal of social psychiatry,A normality for us without confinement for them: notes on the associations of families of the mentally ill.,"Associations of families of the mentally ill arose in Italy in the early 1980s mainly in the country's northern and central regions. They denounced the inadequacies of an extramural service conceived of as an out-patient clinic filling the void left by the shutting down of asylums. The positions elaborated by these associations focus on four main themes: the distribution of the 'burden of care' for the ill between services and families; the ill-conceived interpretation of the families' needs owing to the professional's alleged tendency to 'point the finger of guilt' at the families themselves; the demand for greater power in regard to decisions made by the services; the interaction with the rights and liberties of the mentally ill. Two different ranges of problems are discussed. First, there is the conflict within the family between the interests and rights of its income-producing and its 'dependent' members. This conflict points not to a loss but to an overload of functions shifted to the family at a time of rising expectations for the satisfaction of needs. It therefore calls for services of a new kind, i.e. services capable of making these conflicting interests and rights compatible. Second, extramural services either reject or misinterpret the asylum's labour-saving function. These services thus ascribe care for the material life of the mentally ill to the family's own resources alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Non-systematic-review,1,0
188,8781644,Singapore medical journal,Management of panic disorder.,"Symptoms of panic attack can be found in both medical disease and mental disorder. At least 4 of 13 diagnostic symptoms need to be present to constitute an attack which onset is sudden and unpredictable. The duration of attack usually lasts minutes but sometimes longer. In panic disorder there is recurrent attacks of severe anxiety which are unprovoked and unexpected. Dominant symptoms vary from person to person. The syndrome is likely to be heterogeneous as the biological aetiology may be related to abnormalities in the function of a number of neurotransmitters ie serotonin, noradrenaline, gamabutyric acid, dopamine and cholecystokinin. As such different benzodiazepines and anti-depressants are efficacious in the treatment of the disorder. Medications should be titrated to prevent attacks and restore confidence. Maintenance therapy needs to be balanced with premature termination of treatment.

A low serum triiodothyronine (T3) level is commonly noted in starvation states and is caused by reduced peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3. Diminished T4 concentrations are also observed. Adequate nutrition normalizes this type of aberrant laboratory profile.

190,9858018,Neuroscience research,Mild hypothermia--a revived countermeasure against ischemic neuronal damages.,"Although hypothermia as a means of cerebral protection against and resuscitation from ischemic damage has a history of approximately six decades, extensive studies, both in basic and clinical fields, on the mechanisms, effects and methods of mild hypothermia at temperatures no less than 31 degrees C have started only in the last decade. In experiments on rodents, hypothermia in the postischemic period that is introduced up to several hours after reperfusion and is maintained for one day followed by a slow rewarming, significantly protects hippocampal neurons against damage. The mode of action of hypothermia is apparently non-specific and multi-focal in widely progressing cascade reactions in ischemic cells; namely, suppressing: (1) glutamate surge followed by; (2) intraneuronal calcium mobilization; (3) sustained activation of glutamate receptors; (4) dysfunction of blood brain barrier; (5) proliferation of microglial cells; and (6) production of superoxide anions and nitric oxide. In addition, mild hypothermia modulates processes in ischemic condition at the level of cell nucleus, such as the binding of transcription factor AP-1 to DNA, and ameliorates the depression of protein synthesis. This non-specific and widely affecting manner might explain why hypothermia is superior to any medicine developed. Recent clinical trials of mild hypothermia in various individual institutions have revealed significantly beneficial outcomes in some cases, along with an accumulation of practical knowledge of techniques and treatments. Large scale randomized studies involving multiple institutions as well as exchange of informations and ideas are needed for further development of hypothermia treatment.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
191,31243911,Early intervention in psychiatry,Transforming youth mental health services in a large urban centre: ACCESS Open Minds Edmonton.,"This paper outlines the transformation of youth mental health services in Edmonton, Alberta, a large city in Western Canada. We describe the processes and challenges involved in restructuring how services and care are delivered to youth (11-25 years old) with mental health needs based on the objectives of the pan-Canadian ACCESS Open Minds network.	We provide a narrative review of how youth mental health services have developed since our engagement with the ACCESS Open Minds initiative, based on its five central objectives of early identification, rapid access, appropriate care, continuity of care, and youth and family engagement.	Building on an initial community mapping exercise, a service network has been developed; teams that were previously age-oriented have been integrated together to seamlessly cover the age 11 to 25 range; early identification has thus far focused on high-school populations; and an actual drop-in space facilitates rapid access and linkages to appropriate care within the 30-day benchmark.	Initial aspects of the transformation have relied on restructuring and partnerships that have generated early successes. However, further transformation over the longer term will depend on data demonstrating how this has impacted clinical outcomes and service utilization. Ultimately, sustainability in a large urban centre will likely involve scaling up to a network of similar services to cover the entire population of the city.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

The present study aimed to examine the effects of a self-applied computerized program based on SSL that maintains the same objectives and contents as the face-to-face program.	In this randomized controlled study, 75 children (49.3 % female) aged 8-12 years (Mage = 9.45, SD = 1.31), selected for exhibiting emotional symptoms, were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n = 35) or the waiting list control (WLC) group (n = 40). Pre- and post-intervention data were collected through self-reports and the report of parents who completed parallel versions of the same measures of emotional and behavioral problems.	Overall, compared to the WLC group, the intervention group showed positive effects on targeted emotional symptomatology in the short term. Based on parents' reports, a significant reduction was found in outcomes such as anxiety, depression, emotional symptoms, and internalizing problems, while self-reported results were similar except for anxiety. In addition, a positive impact was found on symptoms related to other types of difficulties (e.g., externalizing problems and general difficulties measured).	Small sample size, non-inclusion of follow-up assessment and other informants (e.g., teachers).

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) combined with auditory feedback for trunk control on UE function and activities of daily living among subacute stroke patients with moderate impairment.	Twenty participants with hemiparesis were randomly assigned to either the mCIMT combined with auditory feedback group (n = 10) or the control group (n = 10). The mCIMT combined with auditory feedback group received the mCIMT protocol training at the same time as the auditory feedback for control of the compensatory movement of the trunk. The control group only received the mCIMT protocol. Each group underwent 20 (1 hour/day) intervention sessions (5 days/week for 4 weeks).	The mCIMT combined with auditory feedback group exhibited greater changes in the Action Research Arm Test (P = .027; 95% CI .429-6.171), Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity (P = .034; 95% CI .360-8.039), modified Barthel Index (P = .003; 95% CI 3.465-14.536), and amount of use of motor activity log (P = .009; 95% CI .078-.476) compared to the control group.

We conducted an exploratory, pilot randomized controlled trial with a mixed-methods design. Twenty persons with mild dementia and carer dyads were randomly assigned to the FindMyApps group (n = 10), receiving either the FindMyApps training and selection tool, or a control condition (n = 10), receiving only a short tablet training. Pre- and post-test measurements at a three month follow-up, consisted of questionnaires and post-test semi-structured interviews.	The FindMyApps tool was mostly perceived as useful and easy to use. Persons with dementia were generally able to learn how to use the tool, though they regularly needed support from informal carers. Persons with dementia found apps through the tool, which they used regularly. Persons with dementia and informal carers were positive about the training and support they received. No significant differences were found on outcome measures of persons with dementia, but based on effect sizes FindMyApps is a promising intervention.

At present, this population demonstrates decreased participation in physical activities and sport compared to peers due to barriers ranging from body function to accessibility challenges. Sport provides culturally relevant opportunities for social integration, community participation and physical activity and has been shown to improve the fitness, self-esteem, confidence and quality of life of children with disabilities. The Sports Stars physiotherapy group has been designed to support the development of a range of fundamental movement and sports skills through activity skill practice and participation in modified popular Australian sports.	This randomised, waitlist controlled, assessor blinded, superiority trial with two parallel groups will aim to compare the effectiveness of Sports Stars to standard care across all ICF domains. Children in the Sports Stars group are expected to demonstrate greater improvement in their individually-selected, sports related goals measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. This study will aim to assess sixty ambulant children aged six to 12 years with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Children will be excluded if they have had recent Botox or neurological/orthopaedic surgery.

205,24660674,Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,Treatment engagement and response to CBT among Latinos with anxiety disorders in primary care.,"In the current study, we compared measures of treatment outcome and engagement for Latino and non-Latino White patients receiving a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program delivered in primary care.	Participants were 18-65 years old and recruited from 17 clinics at 4 different sites to participate in a randomized controlled trial for anxiety disorders, which compared the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention (consisting of CBT, medication, or both) with usual care. Of those participants who were randomized to the intervention arm and selected CBT (either alone or in combination with medication), 85 were Latino and 251 were non-Latino White; the majority of the Latino participants received the CBT intervention in English (n = 77). Blinded assessments of clinical improvement and functioning were administered at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline. Measures of engagement, including attendance, homework adherence, understanding of CBT principles, and commitment to treatment, were assessed weekly during the CBT intervention.	Findings from propensity-weighted linear and logistic regression models revealed no statistically significant differences between Latinos and non-Latino Whites on symptom measures of clinical improvement and functioning at almost all time points. There were significant differences on 2 of 7 engagement outcomes, namely, number of sessions attended and patients' understanding of CBT principles.	These findings suggest that CBT can be an effective treatment approach for Latinos who are primarily English speaking and likely more acculturated, although continued attention should be directed toward engaging Latinos in such interventions.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

An exploratory pragmatic randomised controlled trial.,"Community mental health nurses (CMHNs) are the backbone of specialist mental health services in the UK. This study evaluated the effects of training CMHNs in a systematic psychosocial intervention (PSI), to help family carers manage behavioural changes in their relative with dementia.	One hundred and thirteen family carers received PSI support from a 'trained' (experimental), or a 'usual practice' (control) CMHN. Primary (day-to-day behaviour problems and management) and secondary (carer mood) outcome measures were obtained at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. CMHN training and supervision commenced prior to, and continued throughout, the 18-month study.	Patient cognition declined in both groups, but problem behaviour reduced in experimental group families. However this effect was associated with the practice of some, not all, CMHNs. Carer management and mood improved with PSI support. In contrast, by 18 months, families supported by conventional CMHNs reported reduced coping resources, increased problem behaviour and their level of depression worsened. Only two CMHNs adhered to the PSI-protocol.	Some, but not all, 'trained' CMHNs used the PSI to help family carers reduce behavioural problems. A relatively long but not intensive PSI of 12-18 months was needed to moderate carer mood. Dementia-specific practice arrangements, training and sustained clinical supervision are important for the delivery of effective psychosocial interventions in dementia.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Our study explores the efficacy of Pranic Healing (PH), as an adjuvant therapy in treating depression Methods: In this randomised double-blind controlled trial, 52 participants with a mean age of 34.4 years, with mild to moderate depression were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating (HAM-D) scale during the 5-week study. Both Medication + PH (MedPH) and Medication + Mock PH (MedMockPH) groups comprising 26 members received Pranic and mock healing lasting 20 minutes per session respectively once a week for 4 weeks, along with the antidepressant drug.	The average decrease in HAM-D score in MedPH was median 11 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 7-12) and was significantly higher compared with the MedMockPH group median 6.5 (IQR 3-9). At pre-assessment, both groups had 8 cases of mild and 18 cases of moderate depression. At post-assessment, HAM-D showed that the improvement in depression category was seen in 69.2% of participants in the MedMockPH group and 100% in MedPH group.

In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of CBT4CBT as a virtual stand-alone treatment, delivered with minimal clinical monitoring, and clinician-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with treatment as usual in a heterogeneous sample of treatment-seeking outpatients with substance use disorders.	This was a randomized clinical trial in which 137 individuals who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for current substance abuse or dependence were randomly assigned to receive treatment as usual, weekly individual CBT, or CBT4CBT with brief weekly monitoring.	Rates of treatment exposure differed by group, with the best retention in the CBT4CBT group and the poorest in the individual CBT group. Participants who received CBT or CBT4CBT reduced their frequency of substance use significantly more than those who received treatment as usual. Six-month follow-up outcomes indicated continuing benefit of CBT4CBT (plus monitoring) over treatment as usual, but not for clinician-delivered CBT over treatment as usual. Analysis of secondary outcomes indicated that participants in the CBT4CBT group demonstrated the best learning of cognitive and behavioral concepts, as well as the highest satisfaction with treatment.	This first trial of computerized CBT as a virtual stand-alone intervention delivered in a clinical setting to a diverse sample of patients with current substance use disorders indicated that it was safe, effective, and durable relative to standard treatment approaches and was well-liked by participants. Clinician-delivered individual CBT, while efficacious within the treatment period, was unexpectedly associated with a higher dropout rate and lower effects at follow-up.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

While animal-assisted therapy (AAT) can benefit physical function in older adults and improve symptoms of psychotic disorders, the effect of AAT on middle-aged patients with schizophrenia is unclear. The current randomized controlled trial aimed to explore the efficacy of AAT for middle-aged patients with schizophrenia. Forty participants were randomly assigned to either the AAT or control group. The AAT group participated in one-hour sessions with dog-assisted group activities once a week for 12 weeks. The controls participated in dose-matched, non-animal-related recreational activities. Both groups remained on their usual psychotropic medication during the trial. Evaluations included the Chair Stand Test (CST), Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 5-Meter walk test (5MWT), and Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills (ACIS). The increases in CST repetitions and ACIS scores were larger in the AAT group than in the controls. The two groups did not differ significantly in MoCA scores, TUG performance, or the 5MWT. The AAT group showed a greater increase in lower extremity strength and social skills, but no improvement in cognitive function, agility, or mobility.

An online registry was established to estimate the incidence of NNJ in Turkey and to facilitate a root cause analysis of NNJ and its complications.	A multicenter prospective study was conducted on otherwise healthy newborns born at ≥35 weeks of gestation and hospitalized for only NNJ in 50 collaborator neonatal intensive care units across Turkey over a 1-year period. Patients were analyzed for their demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment options, and complications.	Of the 5,620 patients enrolled, 361 (6.4%) had a bilirubin level ≥25 mg/dL on admission and 13 (0.23%) developed acute bilirubin encephalopathy. The leading cause of hospital admission was hemolytic jaundice, followed by dehydration related to a lack of proper feeding. Although all infants received phototherapy, 302 infants (5.4%) received intravenous immunoglobulin in addition to phototherapy and 132 (2.3%) required exchange transfusion. The infants who received exchange transfusion were more likely to experience hemolytic causes (60.6% vs. 28.1%) and a longer duration of phototherapy (58.5 ± 31.7 vs. 29.4 ± 18.8 h) compared to infants who were not transfused (p < 0.001). The incidence of short-term complications among discharged patients during follow-up was 8.5%; rehospitalization was the most frequent (58%), followed by jaundice for more than 2 weeks (39%), neurological abnormality (0.35%), and hearing loss (0.2%).	Severe NNJ and bilirubin encephalopathy are still problems in Turkey. Means of identifying at-risk newborns before discharge during routine postnatal care, such as bilirubin monitoring, blood group analysis, and lactation consultations, would reduce the frequency of short- and long-term complications of severe NNJ.",Remaining,0,0
216,37369805,Acta neuropathologica,SMN regulates GEMIN5 expression and acts as a modifier of GEMIN5-mediated neurodegeneration.,"GEMIN5 is essential for core assembly of small nuclear Ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of spliceosome formation. Loss-of-function mutations in GEMIN5 lead to a neurodevelopmental syndrome among patients presenting with developmental delay, motor dysfunction, and cerebellar atrophy by perturbing SMN complex protein expression and assembly. Currently, molecular determinants of GEMIN5-mediated disease have yet to be explored. Here, we identified SMN as a genetic suppressor of GEMIN5-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo. We discovered that an increase in SMN expression by either SMN gene therapy replacement or the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), Nusinersen, significantly upregulated the endogenous levels of GEMIN5 in mammalian cells and mutant GEMIN5-derived iPSC neurons. Further, we identified a strong functional association between the expression patterns of SMN and GEMIN5 in patient Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)-derived motor neurons harboring loss-of-function mutations in the SMN gene. Interestingly, SMN binds to the C-terminus of GEMIN5 and requires the Tudor domain for GEMIN5 binding and expression regulation. Finally, we show that SMN upregulation ameliorates defective snRNP biogenesis and alternative splicing defects caused by loss of GEMIN5 in iPSC neurons and in vivo. Collectively, these studies indicate that SMN acts as a regulator of GEMIN5 expression and neuropathologies.",Remaining,0,0
217,30544301,Journal of neurosurgery,A novel method to determine the natural course of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations without the need for follow-up information.,"OBJECTIVEThere is a strong clinical need to accurately determine the average annual hemorrhage risk in unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This need motivated the present initiative to use data from a uniquely large patient population and design a novel methodology to achieve a risk determination with unprecedented accuracy. The authors also aimed to determine the impact of sex, pregnancy, AVM volume, and location on the risk for AVM rupture.METHODSThe present study does not consider any specific management of the AVMs, but only uses the age distribution for the first hemorrhage, the shape of which becomes universal for a sufficiently large set of patients. For this purpose, the authors collected observations, including age at first hemorrhage and AVM size and location, in 3425 patients. The average annual risk for hemorrhage could then be determined from the simple relation that the number of patients with their first hemorrhage at a specific age equals the risk for hemorrhage times the number of patients at risk at that age. For a subset of the patients, the information regarding occurrence of AVM hemorrhage after treatment of the first hemorrhage was used for further analysis of the influence on risk from AVM location and pregnancy.RESULTSThe age distribution for the first AVM hemorrhage was used to determine the average annual risk for hemorrhage in unruptured AVMs at adult ages (25-60 years). It was concluded to be 3.1% ± 0.2% and unrelated to AVM volume but influenced by its location, with the highest risk for centrally located AVMs. The hemorrhage risk was found to be significantly higher for females in their fertile years.CONCLUSIONSThe present methodology allowed the authors to determine the average annual risk for the first AVM hemorrhage at 3.1% ± 0.2% without the need for individual patient follow-up. This methodology has potential also for other similar types of investigations. The conclusion that centrally located AVMs carry a higher risk was confirmed by follow-up information. Follow-up information was also used to conclude that pregnancy causes a substantially greater AVM hemorrhage risk. The age distribution for AVM hemorrhage is incompatible with AVMs present at birth having the same hemorrhage risk as AVMs in adults. Plausibly, they instead develop in the early years of life, possibly with a lower hemorrhage risk during that time period.",Remaining,0,0

A clinical base rate of 50% and 20%, respectively, were created by comparing a clinical sample of 203 adolescent inpatients with cooccurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders with 2 subsamples from the MMPI-A normative group. These subsamples consisted of 203 adolescents matched for sex and age, and a larger subsample of 1,015 adolescents proportionately matched for sex and age, with the clinical group. Classification accuracy analyses revealed that although clinical base rate did affect the accurate classification of cases, a T-score cutoff of 65 resulted in higher levels of accurate classification overall while minimizing the misclassification of both clinical and normal cases. Implications of these findings for the recommended use of the MMPI-A 'gray zone' are presented, and the relative areas of strength and weakness of the MMPI-A are reviewed in the identification and description of psychopathology.",Remaining,0,0

This cross-sectional study involved 163 patients having been hospitalised for at least 24 hours. The patients were asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire previously approved by the Greek Ministry of Health. Four aspects of satisfaction were investigated (medical, hotel accommodation/ organisational facilities, nursing, global). Using Principal Component Analysis, summated scales were formed and tested for internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The non parametric Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was also used and the threshold p-value for statistical significance (2-sided) was set at 0.05.	The results revealed a high degree of global satisfaction (73.31%), yet satisfaction was higher for the medical (88.88%) and nursing (84.26%) services. Moreover, satisfaction derived from the accommodation facilities and the general organisation was found to be more limited (74.17%). Statistically significant differences (based on various demographic variables) in the participants' global satisfaction were not observed. On the contrary, self-assessment of health status at admission was negatively correlated with medical (r(s)=-0.157, p=0.045) and nursing (r(s)=-0.168, p=0.032) satisfaction.

It has good psychometric properties and is acceptable to service users and mental health professionals. It is not clear whether individuals with different diagnostic conditions experience a similar reduction in social inclusion.	(1) Investigate whether current social inclusion differs between diagnostic groups (people with schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders, common mental disorder or personality disorder); (2) Identify factors associated with lower social inclusion; (3) Examine associations between social inclusion and stigma, quality of life and loneliness.	Mental health service users with psychotic disorder, personality disorder or common mental disorder, living in the community, completed the SInQUE, alongside other validated outcome measures. Multiple regression investigated associations.	About 192 service users (55% with psychotic disorder; 26% with common mental disorder; 19% with personality disorder). Current social inclusion did not vary according to diagnosis, except for the sub-domain of productivity, where individuals with personality disorder were more socially included than the other two groups. Lower social inclusion was associated with older age (p = .008), lack of higher education (p < .001), more previous admissions (p = .005), severity of current symptoms and greater experienced stigma (p = .006) and anticipated stigma (p = .035). Greater social inclusion was associated with better quality of life (p < .001) and less loneliness (p < .001).	Barriers to social inclusion in individuals with severe mental health problems include factors related to the illness, such as symptom severity and external factors, such as stigma and discrimination. Social inclusion is a recovery goal and should be routinely assessed.

Suggestions have been made to advance psychological understanding of negative symptoms by focusing on the social cognitive processes involved in symptom formation and maintenance.	Following the recommendations by the National Institute of Mental Health workshop on social cognition in schizophrenia, this study investigated associations between negative symptoms and various aspects of social cognition including Theory of Mind (ToM), attribution, empathy, self-esteem, and interpersonal self-concepts in 75 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 75 healthy controls.	Negative symptoms were significantly associated with difficulties in ToM, less readiness to be empathic, lower self-esteem, less self-serving bias, negative self-concepts related to interpersonal abilities, and dysfunctional acceptance beliefs. Different aspects of social cognition were mildly to moderately correlated and interacted in their impact on negative symptoms: Difficulties in ToM were associated with negative symptoms in persons with low but not in persons with medium or high levels of self-esteem. Taken together, the social cognition variables and their hypothesized interaction explained 39% of the variance in negative symptoms after controlling for neurocognition and depression.	The results highlight the relevance of self-concepts related to social abilities, dysfunctional beliefs, and global self-worth alone and in interaction with ToM deficits for negative symptoms and thereby provide a helpful basis for advancing psychosocial interventions.",Remaining,0,0

The relative benefit of specific therapy can then be assessed quickly and objectively by applying its effect on TILT. Three examples picked at random from the literature, illustrate application of TILT comparing 'claimed' and 'apparent' benefit of specific treatments.

Data was from the Japanese Schizophrenia Sib-pair Linkage Group (JSSLG), which is a multi-site collaborative study group established to create a national resource for genetic studies of schizophrenia in Japan. All subjects were Japanese, and the probands and their siblings had schizophrenia. Multipoint non-parametric linkage analysis and exclusion mapping were performed with GENEHUNTER software. Simulation studies suggested that in the absence of linkage we could expect one multipoint maximum LOD score (MLS) of 1.9 per genome scan. An MLS of 3.7 would be expected only once in every 20 genome scans and thus corresponds to a genome-wide significance of 0.05. No loci in the initial screen fulfilled the criteria for significant or suggestive evidence for linkage. Ten chromosomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 17, and 20) had at least one region with a nominal P value < 0.05.

Fifty-two bed-sharing couples where one individual had insomnia ('Patient'), and 55 non-sleep-disordered couples completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Sleep was monitored for seven nights. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models assessed whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted individual or dyadic sleep (wake transmission).	Greater anxiety symptoms predicted increased vulnerability to being woken by their bedpartner, as well as increased frequency of waking their bedpartner up during the night in Patients with insomnia, but not in non-sleep-disordered couples. Neither anxiety nor depression symptoms predicted an individual's or their bedpartner's sleep efficiency in either subsample. However, ISI was positively predicted by own anxiety and depression symptoms for Patients with insomnia and in non-sleep-disordered couples.	The non-sleep-disordered subsample experienced only mild symptoms of anxiety and depression, potentially reducing predictive power.	Anxiety may help reveal social determinants of sleep in couples experiencing insomnia. These data underscore the importance of considering sleep, the bedpartner, and affective symptoms in mental health and sleep assessments.",Remaining,0,0
228,27349722,Scientific reports,Central tendency effects in time interval reproduction in autism.,"Central tendency, the tendency of judgements of quantities (lengths, durations etc.) to gravitate towards their mean, is one of the most robust perceptual effects. A Bayesian account has recently suggested that central tendency reflects the integration of noisy sensory estimates with prior knowledge representations of a mean stimulus, serving to improve performance. The process is flexible, so prior knowledge is weighted more heavily when sensory estimates are imprecise, requiring more integration to reduce noise. In this study we measure central tendency in autism to evaluate a recent theoretical hypothesis suggesting that autistic perception relies less on prior knowledge representations than typical perception. If true, autistic children should show reduced central tendency than theoretically predicted from their temporal resolution. We tested autistic and age- and ability-matched typical children in two child-friendly tasks: (1) a time interval reproduction task, measuring central tendency in the temporal domain; and (2) a time discrimination task, assessing temporal resolution. Central tendency reduced with age in typical development, while temporal resolution improved. Autistic children performed far worse in temporal discrimination than the matched controls. Computational simulations suggested that central tendency was much less in autistic children than predicted by theoretical modelling, given their poor temporal resolution.",Remaining,0,0

A cross-sectional comparative study of 20 patients with PD and 20 age-matched healthy controls was conducted. Visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, pattern visual-evoked response (VER), and multifocal electroretinogram were recorded to determine functional change, whereas structural changes were evaluated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, macular thickness, macular volume, and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer complex (GCL-IPL) thickness using spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT).	PD patients ranged from Stage 1-3, with median Stage 2 (Hoehn and Yahr Classification) with mean Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III score of 19 ± 10.42, and average disease duration of 5.8 ± 2.78 years. Visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields were unaffected but contrast sensitivity was significantly worse than controls (P < 0.001). Multifocal electroretinogram values in the central 2° field revealed decreased foveal electrical activity, with increased pattern VER amplitude and latency. Significant RNFL thinning was observed in the average RNFL (P = 0.033), superior (P = 0.018), and temporal (P = 0.036) quadrants. Significant ganglion cell layer loss was captured on SD-OCT with average, minimum GCL-IPL, and all 6 sectors showing thinning (P ≤ 0.003). The functional changes correlated significantly with structural changes, disease duration, and severity. There was no correlation between structural changes in the retina and disease duration or severity.	Subclinical visual dysfunction was observed in patients with PD with good structural-functional correlation. GCL-IPL thinning may be a more reliable parameter than RNFL thickness for structural alterations of the retina in patients with PD.",Remaining,0,0

The mean of each was significantly higher than that generally observed in healthy adults. A direct correlation was noted between IgA and IgG concentrations and age. Patients who underwent splenectomy had IgM concentrations significantly lower than those of persons who did not. In two of 25 patients, multiple myeloma of the nonsecretory type developed. The migration inhibition factor (MIF) test performed with the lymphocytes of our patients was positive to glucocerebroside in four of 17 patients, to glucocerebrosidase in four of 19 patients, and to the extracts of the spleen of a patient with Gaucher's disease in three of eight patients. The results of al MIF tests were negative in six control subjects with splenomegaly of other causes.

232,9659849,The American journal of psychiatry,Use of health services by hospitalized medically ill depressed elderly patients.,"The authors examined whether depression is associated with greater use of health services by elderly medical patients before and during hospitalization.	Depression and recent use of health services were assessed in 542 patients aged 60 or over who were consecutively admitted to university medical services. Depression was measured by using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the depressive disorders section of the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule, which was administered by a psychiatrist.	After age, sex, race, education, and severity of medical illness were controlled for, Hamilton depression score significantly predicted hospital days in the past year, hospital days and total inpatient days (hospital plus nursing home) in the past 3 months, and number of outpatient medical visits in the past 3 months. Depressed patients had more hospital days in the past year and had more hospital days, total inpatient days, and outpatient medical visits in the past 3 months than did nondepressed patients. Associations between depression and length of index hospital stay, home health visits, nursing home days, and number of prescription medications disappeared when severity of medical illness was controlled. Mental health visits were no more common among depressed than nondepressed patients.	Depressed elderly medical inpatients used more hospital and outpatient medical services than nondepressed patients, but they did not receive more mental health services.

234,34057668,Journal of gambling studies,Predicting Problem Gambling Severity: Interplay between Emotion Dysregulation and Gambling-related Cognitions.,"Understanding how emotion regulation and gambling-related cognitive distortions relate to gambling problems has direct relevance for problem gambling prevention and treatment. Although these factors have been identified as robust psychological correlates for problem gambling, the interplay between emotional regulation and cognitive biases in influencing problem gambling behaviours is yet to be fully understood. Accordingly, this study examined the explanatory role of cognitive distortions in the association between emotion regulation difficulties and problem gambling behaviours and also explored the interaction between emotion regulation and cognitive distortions in predicting gambling severity. A total of 301 adults (182 males and 119 females; age range: 18-71 years, M = 32.62, SD = 10.03) completed an online questionnaire comprising measures of emotional regulation difficulties, gambling-related beliefs and problem gambling severity. Analyses revealed that emotion regulation difficulties and erroneous gambling beliefs were positively related to problem gambling severity. Further, cognitive distortions partially accounted for the relationship between emotional regulation difficulties and problem gambling, although emotion regulation retained a direct relationship with problem gambling. There was no interaction between emotional regulation and cognitive distortions. The findings indicate that emotion regulation may serve as a precursor to the development of cognitive distortions, while also directly influencing problem gambling. Implications for assessment and treatment of problem gambling are discussed.",Remaining,0,0

Data from DATASUS (the Brazilian Unified Health Computerized System) with free access in the web were collected regarding the number of beds, the development of new community centers, the number of mental health professionals, and costs involved from 1995 to 2005.	In ten years, the number of psychiatric beds decreased 41% (5.4 to 3.2 per 10,000 inhabitants) while community services have increased nine-fold (0.004 to 0.037 per 10,000 inhabitants). Psychologists and social workers have accounted for three and two-fold, respectively, as much hirings as psychiatrists. Psychiatric admissions accounted for 95.5% of the budget in 1995 and 49% in 2005, and the expenses with community services and medication have increased 15% each. As a whole, the expenses in mental health decreased by 26.7% (2.66 to 1.95 US$ per capita).	There has been a clear switch from hospital to community psychiatric care in Brazil, where the system can now provide a diversity of treatments and free access to psychotropics. However, the coverage of community services is precarious, and the reform was not accompanied by an increased public investment in mental health. The psychiatric reform is not a strategy for reducing costs; it necessarily implies increasing investments if countries decide to have a better care of those more disadvantaged.",Remaining,0,0

The purpose of this study was to clarify the prevalence of insomnia symptoms and actual situation of work productivity by job type (white-collars/blue-collars) among construction/civil engineering workers in Japan and evaluate the association between insomnia symptoms and work productivity adjusting for sleep duration and sociodemographic, work-related, and health-related variables.	This cross-sectional study included 17,828 construction/civil engineering workers (15,837 males and 1991 females) aged 40 to 74 years in Japan. The questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic characteristics, information on work productivity (work performance and absence), respective insomnia symptoms (difficulty initiating sleep; DIS, difficulty maintaining sleep; DMS, and early morning awakening; EMA), bedtime schedule, work-related factors (job type, working hours), and perceived health condition. To identify the associated factors of work productivity, the logistic regression analyses were conducted.	The percentages of workers who reported to be experiencing DIS, DMS, and EMA were 7.9, 16.3, and 13.1%, respectively. Poor work performance was associated with every insomnia symptom in both the blue-collar and white-collar workers. Meanwhile, absence was associated with DIS in blue-collar workers and both DIS and DMS in white-collar workers; however, not with EMA in both the groups. In blue-collar workers, engagement in shift work was associated with poor work performance.

We prospectively enrolled adult patients with suspected TBM, and CSF specimens were analyzed for 18 cytokines/chemokines and soluble programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Enzyme-linked immunospot assays were performed on mononuclear cells from the CSF (CSF-MCs) and peripheral blood (PBMCs). A total of 87 patients with meningitis, including 42 TBM-suspected patients and 45 non-TBM patients, were enrolled. Excluding the 32 patients with possible TBM, 10 patients with TBM and 45 patients with non-TBM were finally analyzed. Levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA), interleukin 12 subunit β (IL-12p40), IL-13, macrophage inflammatory protein α (MIP-1α), and soluble PD-1 and PD-L1 in the CSF were significantly higher in the TBM group than in the non-TBM group (P < 0.05). The optimal cutoff values for the sensitivities and specificities of the test methods for diagnosing TBM with small samples of 10 cases of definite or probable TBM were as follows: ADA > 6.95 U/L, 70% and 81%; IL-12p40 > 52.04 pg/mL, 80% and 73%; IL-13 > 0.44 pg/mL, 90% and 47%; MIP-1α > 8.83 pg/mL, 80% and 62%; soluble PD-1 > 35.87 pg/mL, 80% and 63%; soluble PD-L1 > 24.19 pg/mL, 80% and 61%; CSF-MC ELISPOT > 13.5 spots/250,000 CSF-MC, 30% and 91%; and PBMC ELISPOT > 14 spots/250,000 PBMCs, 50% and 78%, respectively.

For comparison a control group of eight previous drinkers was tested. The skin test responses were modest initially with a median area of response of 12 mm2 (range 0-31) in the heavy alcoholics and 3 mm2 (0-15) in the moderate drinkers. It improved significantly in both groups after two weeks of sobriety. The responses stabilized after 8 weeks at 74 mm2 (54-102) in the heavy alcoholics and after 9 weeks at 63 mm2 (42-76) in the moderate drinking group. The control group had skin test responses of 70 mm2 (46-87), not different from the responses of the alcohol groups after two months of abstinence.

The impact of withdrawal from substances that have different neurological mechanisms on BDNF levels is unclear. Our goal was to compare serum BDNF levels in inpatients with alcohol or crack cocaine use disorders during the early withdrawal period, and to evaluate the association with substance-related outcomes. We performed a follow-up study with 101 men under detoxification treatment (drug preference: alcohol [n = 37] and crack cocaine [n = 64]). Blood samples were collected on the 1st and 15th days of hospitalization to measure serum BDNF levels. Serum BDNF levels increased during the early stage of withdrawal (28.2 ± 10.0 vs. 32.6 ± 13.3, p < 0.001), similarly in individuals with alcohol and crack cocaine use. In the alcohol group, BDNF levels on the 15th day of hospitalization were negatively correlated with age (r = -0.394, p = 0.023). Delta BDNF levels were also negatively correlated with BDNF on the 1st day of hospitalization (p = 0.011). No significant correlation was found regarding substance-related outcomes. This is the first study to compare BDNF levels in alcohol and crack cocaine users undergoing similar treatment conditions. These findings could be related to clinical improvement after abstinence or even to drug withdrawal itself, decreasing neuronal injury. Furthermore, age may be a crucial factor, hindering the recovery of neuroplasticity in alcohol users.",Remaining,0,0

The purpose of this study was to confirm that APOE allele polymorphism also represents a risk factor for unfavorable outcomes following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).	A total of 104 patients with aneurysmal SAH were studied. Computed tomography (CT) scan findings of SAH were assessed by Fisher's grade and clinical neurologic assessment was performed using the Hunt and Hess (H&H)grading system. Serum lipids were also analyzed. Outcomes at 3 months after SAH were determined using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.	The distributions of APOE genotypes and alleles of patients were matched with those of control subjects. That 5 of 18 patients with APOE-E4 allele (28%) had an unfavorable outcome was significantly different from those without APOE-E4 (8%, chi2, p = 0.032; OR = 4.34, 95% CI 1.20-15.75). However, the presence or absence of E2 or E3 alleles had no significant difference. The relative hazard of APOE-E4 for unfavorable outcome exited after adjustment for clinical assessment (OR = 6.95, 95% CI 1.21-39.75). Total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B were elevated in patients with unfavorable rather than favorable outcomes.	Our findings confirmed that the patients with APOE-E4 allele were predisposed to unfavorable outcomes after aneurysmal SAH even though an association between APOE and incidence of the SAH may not exist. The effect of APOE on neurobiology and lipoprotein metabolism seems to partially explain the difference in outcomes and deserves further study.",Remaining,0,0

The current study aimed to describe khat dependence, use patterns, and khatrelated health problems in Australian migrant communities.	A 48-item questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 52 participants from African migrant communities who self-reported using khat in four Australian state capital cities between April 1 and June 1, 2012. Associations between Severity of Dependence Scale for khat use (SDS-khat) screening status, use patterns, and khat-related psychological and physical health problems were assessed using multivariate loglinked Poisson regression controlling for potential sociodemographic confounders.	Overall, 44.2% (n = 23) of the study participants screened positive on the SDS-khat, indicating probable khat dependence. Screening positive for khat dependence was associated with increased risk for khat use frequency in the last 30 days (adjusted prevalence risk ratio [APRR] = 2.26, 95% CI [1.23, 4.15], p = .009), experiencing three or more psychological health problems (APRR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.04, 3.36], p = .037), and experiencing two or more physical health problems (APRR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.13, 3.27], p = .016) after using khat.	Screening positive on the SDS-khat is associated with increased recent khat use frequency and elevated physical and psychological health problems, providing preliminary evidence that probable khat use dependence may be associated with an increased risk of harm in Australia. Furthermore, these preliminary results support the potential utility of the SDS-khat to healthcare providers to identify those at risk for khatrelated harms.

Chronic treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) reduces ictal central apnoea, a risk factor for SUDEP. Reduced medullary serotonergic neurones, modulators of respiration in response to hypercapnia, were reported in a SUDEP post-mortem series. The amygdala and hippocampus have high serotonergic innervation and are functionally implicated in seizure-related respiratory dysregulation. We explored serotonergic networks in mesial temporal lobe structures in a surgical and post-mortem epilepsy series in relation to SUDEP risk. We stratified 75 temporal lobe epilepsy patients with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE/HS) into high (N = 16), medium (N = 11) and low risk (N = 48) groups for SUDEP based on generalised seizure frequency. We also included the amygdala in 35 post-mortem cases, including SUDEP (N = 17), epilepsy controls (N = 10) and non-epilepsy controls (N = 8). The immunohistochemistry labelling index (LI) and axonal length (AL) of serotonin transporter (SERT)-positive axons were quantified in 13 regions of interest with image analysis. SERT LI was highest in amygdala and subiculum regions. In the surgical series, higher SERT LI was observed in high risk than low risk cases in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and subiculum (p < 0.05). In the post-mortem cases higher SERT LI and AL was observed in the basal and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala and peri-amygdala cortex in SUDEP compared to epilepsy controls (p < 0.05). Patients on SRI showed higher SERT in the dentate gyrus (p < 0.005) and CA4 (p < 0.05) but there was no difference in patients with or without a psychiatric history. Higher SERT in hippocampal subfields in TLE/HS cases with SUDEP risk factors and higher amygdala SERT in post-mortem SUDEP cases than epilepsy controls supports a role for altered serotonergic networks involving limbic regions in SUDEP. This may be of functional relevance through reduced 5-HT availability.",Remaining,0,0
247,28317947,NeuroImage. Clinical,Parietal operculum and motor cortex activities predict motor recovery in moderate to severe stroke.,"While motor recovery following mild stroke has been extensively studied with neuroimaging, mechanisms of recovery after moderate to severe strokes of the types that are often the focus for novel restorative therapies remain obscure. We used fMRI to: 1) characterize reorganization occurring after moderate to severe subacute stroke, 2) identify brain regions associated with motor recovery and 3) to test whether brain activity associated with passive movement measured in the subacute period could predict motor outcome six months later. Because many patients with large strokes involving sensorimotor regions cannot engage in voluntary movement, we used passive flexion-extension of the paretic wrist to compare 21 patients with subacute ischemic stroke to 24 healthy controls one month after stroke. Clinical motor outcome was assessed with Fugl-Meyer motor scores (motor-FMS) six months later. Multiple regression, with predictors including baseline (one-month) motor-FMS and sensorimotor network regional activity (ROI) measures, was used to determine optimal variable selection for motor outcome prediction. Sensorimotor network ROIs were derived from a meta-analysis of arm voluntary movement tasks. Bootstrapping with 1000 replications was used for internal model validation. During passive movement, both control and patient groups exhibited activity increases in multiple bilateral sensorimotor network regions, including the primary motor (MI), premotor and supplementary motor areas (SMA), cerebellar cortex, putamen, thalamus, insula, Brodmann area (BA) 44 and parietal operculum (OP1-OP4). Compared to controls, patients showed: 1) lower task-related activity in ipsilesional MI, SMA and contralesional cerebellum (lobules V-VI) and 2) higher activity in contralesional MI, superior temporal gyrus and OP1-OP4. Using multiple regression, we found that the combination of baseline motor-FMS, activity in ipsilesional MI (BA4a), putamen and ipsilesional OP1 predicted motor outcome measured 6 months later (adjusted-R[2] = 0.85; bootstrap p < 0.001). Baseline motor-FMS alone predicted only 54% of the variance. When baseline motor-FMS was removed, the combination of increased activity in ipsilesional MI-BA4a, ipsilesional thalamus, contralesional mid-cingulum, contralesional OP4 and decreased activity in ipsilesional OP1, predicted better motor outcome (djusted-R[2] = 0.96; bootstrap p < 0.001). In subacute stroke, fMRI brain activity related to passive movement measured in a sensorimotor network defined by activity during voluntary movement predicted motor recovery better than baseline motor-FMS alone. Furthermore, fMRI sensorimotor network activity measures considered alone allowed excellent clinical recovery prediction and may provide reliable biomarkers for assessing new therapies in clinical trial contexts. Our findings suggest that neural reorganization related to motor recovery from moderate to severe stroke results from balanced changes in ipsilesional MI (BA4a) and a set of phylogenetically more archaic sensorimotor regions in the ventral sensorimotor trend, in which OP1 and OP4 processes may complement the ipsilesional dorsal motor cortex in achieving compensatory sensorimotor recovery.",Remaining,0,0

The clinical data of PVE patients admitted to Beijing Anzhen Hospital from January 1997 to August 2018 were retrospectively analyzed.	In total, 62 patients with PVE were enrolled (45 males, 17 females). The patients' age ranged from 23 to 79 years (51.69 ± 15.01). Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) was the most common reason for valve replacement. Of the patients, 58 were found to have vegetations by echocardiography. Blood cultures revealed the most common pathogens to be Staphylococcus (12 cases) and fungal infections (n = 7); 18 (29.03%) patients had strokes. There were 12 cases of ischemic stroke, three cases of cerebral hemorrhage, one case of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and two cases of unclear etiology. The most commonly found clinical symptoms of stroke patients were hemiplegia (n = 10) and coma (n = 5). The five patients in coma died during hospitalization. The incidence of RHD, double valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and mitral valve vegetation was significantly higher in the stroke group than in the non-stroke group (p = 0.045, 0.000, 0.033, and 0.045, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratios (ORs) for RHD, double valve replacement, and fungal infection as risk factors of stroke were 7.26 (95% CI: 1.23-42.68), 25.60 (95%CI: 4.33-126.16), and 20.58 (95% CI: 2.13-198.82), respectively, and were statistically significant.

Stroke is a common complication in PVE that increases patient mortality. Rheumatic heart disease, double valve replacement, and fungal infection may be risk factors for patients with PVE complicated by stroke.",Remaining,0,0

250,20979638,Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,Oromotor variability in children with mild spastic cerebral palsy: a kinematic study of speech motor control.,"Treating motor speech dysfunction in children with CP requires an understanding of the mechanism underlying speech motor control. However, there is a lack of literature in quantitative measures of motor control, which may potentially characterize the nature of the speech impairments in these children. This study investigated speech motor control in children with cerebral palsy (CP) using kinematic analysis.	We collected 10 children with mild spastic CP, aged 4.8 to 7.5 years, and 10 age-matched children with typical development (TD) from rehabilitation department at a tertiary hospital. All children underwent analysis of percentage of consonants correct (PCC) and kinematic analysis of speech tasks: poly-syllable (PS) and mono-syllable (MS) tasks using the Vicon Motion 370 system integrated with a digital camcorder. Kinematic parameters included spatiotemporal indexes (STIs), and average values and coefficients of variation (CVs) of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity. An ANOVA was conducted to determine whether PCC and kinematic data significantly differed between groups.	CP group had relatively lower PCCs (80.0-99.0%) than TD group (p = 0.039). CP group had higher STIs in PS speech tasks, but not in MS tasks, than TD group did (p = 0.001). The CVs of utterance duration for MS and PS tasks of children with CP were at least three times as large as those of TD children (p < 0.01). However, average values of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity and CVs of other kinematic data for both tasks did not significantly differ between two groups.	High STI values and high variability on utterance durations in children with CP reflect deficits in relative spatial and/or especially temporal control for speech in the CP participants compared to the TD participants. Children with mild spastic CP may have more difficulty in processing increased articulatory demands and resulted in greater oromotor variability than normal children. The kinematic data such as STIs can be used as indices for detection of speech motor control impairments in children with mild CP and assessment of the effectiveness in the treatment.",Remaining,0,0
251,2708041,Headache,Cardiovascular sympathetic hypofunction in muscle contraction headache and migraine.,"There have been some recent reports proposing that muscle contraction headache (MCH) and migraine are similar and may have a common etiology. It has been hypothesized that derangement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of migraine. However, reports on the ANS function in MCH have rarely been submitted. Therefore, in this report, MCH patients were investigated as well as migraine patients. The cardiovascular reflex responses by orthostatic test, isometric work test and the pulse rate (R-R interval) variation in fifteen MCH patients and fifteen migraine patients were recorded during headache-free intervals. The plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were also measured throughout the orthostatic tests. Fifteen healthy subjects served as the age-matched control group. In the MCH group and the migraine group, blood pressure immediately after going from the supine to the erect position decreased more significantly than in the control group. The basal NE level was significantly low in both the MCH group and the migraine group, in comparison with the control group. MCH patients as well as migraine patients showed cardiovascular sympathetic hypofunction.",Remaining,0,0

ACoA patients produced more provoked confabulations and more false recognition in mirror reading than comparison subjects. Conversely, false recall/false recognition in the DRM-paradigm were similar in patients and controls.

The children were interviewed individually. They thought-listed their latest worry episodes, rated the uncontrollability of the episodes, and reported on the strategies they used to terminate worry. Content analyses showed that children's worry episodes contained predominantly thoughts reflecting negative outcome anticipation, but other types of thought content also were present. These included problem-solving, ruminating, and self-blaming thoughts. Compared to clinic-referred children, nonreferred children reported more problem solving and less ruminating. In the nonreferred group, increasing age was associated with more problem solving and less ruminating. No such age-related associations were found in the clinic-referred group. The 2 groups did not differ in the types of worry-termination strategies they reported, but clinic-referred children were more likely to keep worrying until the perceived threat was removed. The results suggest that the problem-solving function of worry is still emerging during late childhood and that developmental delays in problem solving may be associated with excessive and uncontrollable worrying.",Remaining,0,0
254,31075661,Gait & posture,Comparable walking gait performance during executive and non-executive cognitive dual-tasks in chronic stroke: A pilot study.,"Falls are a serious problem among stroke survivors due to subsequent injuries, recovery setbacks, dependence, and mortality. A growing body of dual-task (DT) studies suggests a role of executive functions in gait control and falls, particularly in subacute stroke. However, few studies have compared distinct executive and non-executive tasks, nor their effects on chronic stroke gait.	The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare the effects of distinct working memory (2-back) and inhibition (Stroop) tasks on walking gait performance in chronic stroke survivors.	A pilot sample of chronic stroke survivors (n = 11, 8 males, mean age = 70.91, 6-12months post-stroke event) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 13, 4 male; mean age = 68.46) were tested. Gait performance (speed, stride time, stride time variability, stride length and stride length variability) was measured using 2 wireless inertial measurement sensors under 4 walking conditions: 1) preferred walking (single-task: ST), 2) walking with a 2-back DT, 3) walking with a Stroop DT, and 4) walking with a non-executive motor response DT. The secondary tasks were also carried out in both ST (seated) and DT conditions, to examine bidirectional effects.	While the stroke survivor sample had a slower gait speed across conditions and tasks, there were no significant differences between the groups [F(1, 22) = 1.13, p =.299, η[2]p =  .049] on the spatial or temporal gait characteristics recorded: gait performance was maintained during executive and non-executive DTs. In addition, we did not find a significant effect of group on cognitive task performance (all p > .052). However, we observed a cost in accuracy on the 2-back DT for both groups, suggesting resource overlap and greater cognitive load (all t > 19.72, all p <  .001).	Our gait data contradict previous studies evidencing impaired gait post-stroke, suggesting functional recovery in this chronic stroke sample.",Remaining,0,0
255,22706417,Psychiatria Danubina,Psychiatrists' psychotropic drug prescription preferences for themselves or their family members.,"Psychiatrists' preference for certain medications is not only determined by their efficacy and side effect profile but may also depend on the psychiatrists' beliefs about specific therapeutic effects based on their own observation and experience. We aimed to evaluate which antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs psychiatrists would prefer for themselves, their partners and children in case of a mental illness.	The study was conducted among psychiatrists in Serbia. The sample consisted of 90 psychiatrists who were asked to complete the questionnaire about their drug selection in hypothetical situations of becoming ill with schizophrenia or depression or these conditions occurring in their partners and children.	In case of schizophrenia, risperidone was the first choice made by most psychiatrists for themselves, their partners or children, followed by clozapine, haloperidol and olanzapine. In case of depression, SSRIs and SNRIs were generally favored, with sertraline and escitalopram being the preferred medications for psychiatrists, partners and their children. With regards to depression, 82.3% of participants would opt for an antidepressant as monotherapy or in combination, but 13.3% would opt for anxiolytic monotherapy. The preferred doses were slightly lower than the recommended ones, especially for antipsychotic agents.	Most psychiatrists would take or administer atypical antipsychotics or SSRIs as the first choice for themselves, their partners or children. These preferences are mostly in accordance with current treatment guidelines, but there is still room to narrow the gap between guideline recommendations and psychiatrists' medication choices in personally meaningful situations.",Remaining,0,0

Factor analysis was carried out on NPI subscales, leading to three syndromes: 'mood', 'psychotic' and 'frontal'. Patients with the 'psychotic' syndrome were older, had older age at dementia onset, had poorer cognition, were more often males, and had faster rate of dementia progression. Patients with the 'frontal' syndrome had higher education, longer disease duration, and slower rate of progression.

Yet there is an under-representation of the older population in the BP literature. We present extensive interview data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, dealing with a population-based sample of Danish twins aged 70-102, and describing the 1-month prevalence of BP and the development of BP over time. The associations between BP and education, self-rated health, other health problems, lifestyle factors, and physical and mental function were also investigated. Data were analysed in a cross-sectional analysis for all answers given at entry into the study and in a longitudinal analysis for participants in all four surveys. Associated factors were analysed for the cross-sectional sample using univariate and multivariate analysis accounting for the non-independence of twins in complete pairs. The overall 1-month prevalence of BP was 25% and differed significantly between men and women. The variations in prevalence between the age groups and over time were negligible. The majority of participants in all four surveys had either not experienced BP during the previous month or had done so on one occasion only. Education was not associated with BP. Self-rated health was associated with BP in a significant 'dose-response' like pattern. BP was associated with bone and joint disorders, migraine headaches, lung disease, cardiovascular disorders and gastric ulcer, but not neurologic or endocrinologic diseases. BP sufferers had significantly lower scores on physical but not on mental functioning. We conclude that BP is a common symptom in old age; however, the prevalence does not change with increasing age.

VFC starts in the precapillaries/capillaries in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) and expands to the granule cell and polymorphic cell layer of the DG, and to the stratum lacunosum/molecular in the CA1 sector. Vasculopathy spreads from the tail to the body and, in a few cases, to the head of the hippocampal formation. Light and electron microscopy reveal thickening of the vascular wall with fibrosis, calcification, and enforcement of the astrocyte interface with vessels with anchorage densities associated with hemidesmosome-like structures. In moderately and severely affected cases, fragmentation and removal of calcified and occluded vessels result in local reduction of vascular network. In two AD subjects, severe vascular calcification extending from the tail to the head of the hippocampal formation was associated with loss of almost all neurons in the CA1 sector and in the subiculum proper, corresponding to hippocampal sclerosis. The topography of affected vessels and the patterns of neuronal loss reflect the middle hippocampal artery distribution with its precapillary/capillary network. The similar prevalence of vasculopathy in the AD group and in the age-matched control group, and the presence of hippocampal VFC in only one subject in the DS cohort, 96% of which is affected by Alzheimer-type pathology, oppose the link between AD and this form of vasculopathy. However, severe VFC affects the pattern of AD pathology locally by deletion of neurofibrillary degeneration and beta-amyloidosis in the CA1 sector, subiculum proper, and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal VFC appears to be a form of vascular pathology with a unique predilection for the middle hippocampal artery and corresponding capillary network, which results in patchy neuronal loss in moderately affected subjects and in almost total neuronal loss in the area of impaired blood supply in severely affected subjects. These observations suggest an etiologic link between hippocampal VFC and hippocampal sclerosis.",Remaining,0,0

Confirmatory factor analysis designed for items with categorical response types was implemented to examine six proposed structural models. The five-factor model demonstrated the most parsimonious fit based on common overall fit indices that was further supported by examination of local model fit indicators, though, the four- and six-factor models evidenced adequate-to-good fit as well. Examination of RRB factor score approaches indicated only minor differences between summed item subscale scores and extracted factor scores with regard to associations with diagnostic measures.

Neurocognitive dual-process models attribute substance use disorders and risk behaviours during adolescence to an imbalance between an overactivated affective-automatic system (involved in motivational and affective processing) and a reflective system (involved in cognitive inhibitory control). The aim of the present study was to investigate at the electrophysiological level the degree to which the motivational value of alcohol-related stimuli modulates the inhibition of a prepotent response in binge drinkers. First-year university students (n = 151, 54 % females) classified as binge drinkers (n = 71, ≥6 binge drinking episodes, defined as 5/7 standard drinks per occasion in the last 180 days) and controls (n = 80, <6 binge drinking episodes in the last 180 days) performed a beverage Go/NoGo task (pictures of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks were presented according to the condition as Go or NoGo stimuli; Go probability = 0.75) during event-related potential recording. In binge drinkers but not controls, the amplitude of the anterior N2-NoGo was larger in response to nonalcohol than in response to alcohol pictures. No behavioural difference in task performance was observed. In terms of dual-process models, binge drinkers may require increased activation to monitor conflict in order to compensate for overactivation of the affective-automatic system caused by alcohol-related bias.",Remaining,0,0

This study aimed to investigate the association between cortical thickness and methylation of BDNF promoters as well as serum BDNF levels in MDD. The participants consisted of 65 patients with recurrent MDD and 65 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Methylation of BDNF promoters and cortical thickness were compared between the groups. The right medial orbitofrontal, right lingual, right lateral occipital, left lateral orbitofrontal, left pars triangularis, and left lingual cortices were thinner in patients with MDD than in healthy controls.

Higher levels of BDNF promoter methylation may be closely associated with the reduced cortical thickness among patients with MDD. Serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in MDD, and showed an inverse relationship with BDNF methylation only in healthy controls. Particularly the prefrontal and occipital cortices seem to indicate key regions in which BDNF methylation has a significant effect on structure.",Remaining,0,0

Predictors of postpartum depression were also assessed. Few women reported current abuse experiences, although 37% reported having lifetime physical or sexual abuse or both. Women with a lifetime history of abuse were 3.6-8.4 times more likely to experience postpartum depression than their nonabused peers at each measurement time. This effect steadily increases during the first 6 months after birth and decreases at the 8th month. These findings extend recent reports of the chronicity of abuse and have implications for care providers. The standard of care for abuse assessments may need to be expanded to include consideration of lifetime physical and sexual abuse experiences of pregnant and postpartum women.",Remaining,0,0

276,28333604,The Permanente journal,Patient Preferences for Discussing Childhood Trauma in Primary Care.,"Exposure to traumatic events is common in primary care patients, yet health care professionals may be hesitant to assess and address the impact of childhood trauma in their patients.	To assess patient preferences for discussing traumatic experiences and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with clinicians in underserved, predominantly Latino primary care patients.	Cross-sectional study.	We evaluated patients with a questionnaire assessing comfort to discuss trauma exposure and symptoms using the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study questionnaire and the Primary Care-PTSD screen. The questionnaire also assessed patients' confidence in their clinicians' ability to help with trauma-related issues. Surveys were collected at an integrated medical and behavioral health care clinic.	Of 178 adult patients asked, 152 (83%) agreed to participate. Among participants, 37% screened positive for PTSD, 42% reported 4 or more ACEs, and 26% had elevated scores on both measures. Primary Care-PTSD and ACE scores were strongly positively correlated (r = 0.57, p < 0.001). Most patients agreed they were comfortable being asked about trauma directly or through screening questionnaires and did not oppose the inclusion of trauma-related information in their medical record. In addition, most patients perceived their clinician as comfortable asking questions about childhood trauma and able to address trauma-related problems.	Screening is acceptable to most primary care patients regardless of trauma exposure or positive PTSD screening. Findings may aid primary care clinicians to consider screening regularly for ACEs and PTSD to better serve the health care needs of trauma-exposed patients.",Remaining,0,0

A long-term follow-up study.,"The clinical and neuroradiological outcome of carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication was evaluated prospectively in 30 patients over a follow-up period of 3 years. Among the patients studied, 22 had been acutely exposed to CO while 8 were chronically exposed. One month after CO poisoning, 12 of the 22 patients with acute intoxication showed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities: 6 also had neurological sequelae and 6 were asymptomatic. The remaining 10 patients showed neither MRI abnormalities nor neurological sequelae. During the 3-year follow-up, 4 of the patients with both MRI abnormalities and neurological sequelae improved in both clinical features and MRI findings. One of the 6 asymptomatic patients with MRI abnormalities developed a progressive cognitive impairment 2 months after acute intoxication, with a concomitant severe worsening of the MRI lesions. Among the 10 patients with neither MRI abnormalities nor neurological sequelae, only 1 developed neurological sequelae after a clear period of 4 months. In the group of patients who experienced chronic CO intoxication, only 1 presented with a neuropsychiatric syndrome which improved at follow-up. Brain MRI showed white matter lesions which remained unchanged at control scan after 1 year. In conclusion, we observed that some patients with severe CO poisoning and neurological sequelae may fully regain normal functions after approximately 1 year. The presence of MRI lesions 1 month after CO poisoning did not accurately predict the subsequent outcome. The observation of a clear period longer than the usual 2-40 day interval in 2 patients should be considered for careful planning of follow-up and for prognosis in CO-poisoned patients.",Remaining,0,0
278,3060558,Journal of forensic sciences,Incidence of cannabinoids in medical examiner urine specimens.,"Cannabinoid use was studied in a nonspecific population of postmortem urine specimens in the State of Maryland. Of 500 sequential specimens screened for cannabinoids by enzyme multiplied immunoassay EMIT, 63 (13%) were initially positive and 58 (12%) were confirmed positive (92%). It was observed that geographic location and race did not correlate with cannabinoid prevalence. Cannabinoid use was observed to be strongly age related, with peak use by the 21- to 25-year-old age group where 22% of the cases were positive. Use of cannabinoids was also closely linked to homicides, which represented nearly half of the positive cases but only 13% of the total cases. When comparing manner of death, the greatest percent of confirmed positives was seen in homicide (26%) and drug-related (17%) deaths. The incidence of cannabinoid use was found to be more than 3 times as great in drug-related (17%) as compared to natural deaths (5%). The percent of cannabinoid-positive cases from vehicle-related accidents was low (6%) and that from nonvehicle-related accidents somewhat higher (10%). Other drugs appeared in cannabinoid-positive cases. Most prevalent was ethanol N = 18, followed by morphine (from heroin, N = 11), quinine N = 11, and cocaine N = 11. Phencyclidine (PCP) occurred twice and several other drugs were reported only once. Of the 25 homicide cases screened for drugs, 64% were positive for some drug including ethyl alcohol. Thus it appears that a high percentage of homicide cases are drug related.

Fifty-eight CD and 83 AC patients operated on over 10 years were carefully evaluated. The patients received a disease-related questionnaire and were invited for a follow-up at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurosurgery. Thirty-three CD and 52 AC patients returned the questionnaire; 25 CD and 37 AC patients participated personally. CD patients underwent a dexamethasone suppression test, and IGF-1 levels were assessed in AC patients. Data on postoperative therapy were assessed.	84.8% of those with CD and 75.0% of those with AC had been followed by endocrinologists; 9.1% of CD and 1.9% of AC patients had been under no aftercare; 96% of CD patients were in remission. A recurrence occurred in four patients, two were newly detected by our study. IGF-1 was postoperatively normalized in 25 of 37 AC patients (67.6%). Twenty patients remained in remission, five relapsed. One patient received medical therapy upon recurrence and presented normal IGF-1; four patients with relapse had not been treated yet. Ten of 12 patients with elevated early postoperative IGF-1 received medical therapy that was commenced within 6 months in nine cases. The mean duration of medical therapy was 36 months (range 2-92). IGF-1 was still elevated at the last follow-up in eight of these ten patients, all of them receiving monotherapy. In four patients, the dose had been increased once.	The postoperative transfer back to the endocrinologist after operative treatment is achieved well in both groups.

The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 112 consecutive patients (53 boys, 59 girls; mean age 10.9 years, range 10 months-21.7 years) with medically intractable epilepsy who underwent invasive monitoring at the Pediatric Epilepsy Center at St. Louis Children's Hospital between January 1994 and July 2005. There were 122 implantation procedures (85 grids and strips, 32 strips only, five grids only, four with additional depth electrodes), with a mean monitoring period of 7.1 days (range 2-21 days). Operative complications included the need for repeated surgery for additional electrode placement (5.7%); wound infection (2.4%); cerebrospinal fluid leak (1.6%); and subdural hematoma, symptomatic pneumocephalus, bone flap osteomyelitis, and strip electrode fracture requiring operative retrieval (one patient [0.8%] each). There were four cases of transient neurological deficit (3.3%) and no permanent deficit or death associated with invasive monitoring.	Placement of subdural grid and strip electrodes for invasive video electroencephalographic monitoring is generally well tolerated in the pediatric population. The authors found that aggressive initial electrode coverage was not associated with higher rates of blood transfusion or perioperative complications, and reduced the frequency of repeated operations for placement of supplemental electrodes.",Remaining,0,0

The Bruneck Study is a prospective population-based survey on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In 826 men and women 40 to 79 years old (1990 baseline), 5-year changes in carotid atherosclerosis were thoroughly assessed by high-resolution duplex scanning. The presence of chronic respiratory, urinary tract, dental, and other infections was ascertained by standard diagnostic criteria. Chronic infections amplified the risk of atherosclerosis development in the carotid arteries. The association was most pronounced in subjects free of carotid atherosclerosis at baseline (age-/sex-adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] for any chronic infection versus none, 4.08 [2.42 to 6.85]; P:<0.0001) and applied to all types of chronic (bacterial) infections. It remained independently significant after adjustment for classic vascular risk attributes and extended to low-risk individuals free of conventional risk factors. Among subjects with chronic infections, atherosclerosis risk was highest in those with a prominent inflammatory response. Markers of systemic inflammation, such as soluble adhesion molecules and circulating bacterial endotoxin, and levels of soluble human heat-shock protein 60 and antibodies to mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 were elevated in subjects with chronic infections and predictive of an increased risk of atherosclerosis.	The present study provides solid evidence for a role of common chronic infections in human atherogenesis.

The study proceeded in the form of a statistical analysis of assessments made on 46 patients according to RLS85 and GCS (i.e., when comparison was with GCS) and on 28 patients according to RLS85 and E2CS(M). In all 74 cases two physicians participating as 'observers' carried out the assessments. They were both contacting the patient--not together but--successively within a time interval of less than 20'. Hence the data appeared as 'pairwise' observations for any of the three scales above. The results of the analysis, arising from a rather strict statistical reasoning, can be summarized as follows: (1) The rank correlation coefficient r(s) between: (i) RLS85 and GCS sum score, (ii) RLS85 and E2CS(M), was found to be at a satisfactory level meaning that all three scales indicate almost the same 'ranking order of severity'. (2) Reliability was compared by taking into account as to what extent the two observers agreed on RLS85 and--simultaneously--disagreed on the other scale. The 'sign' test was applied and as a result RLS85 proved to be more reliable than; (i) GCS (EMY profile), (ii) GCS sum score, and (iii) E2CS(M), in all the above mentioned at a high level of significance. (3) Apart from the test above, some values of the index kappa (kappa) of interobserver agreement were calculated. Those corresponding to RLS85 are considerably higher. In particular the overall value based on 74 pairwise assessments amounted to kappa = 0.733 associated with a standard error sigma(kappa) = 0.061. This was a satisfactory result regarding the features of RLS85.

We sought to implement this into clinical practice.	Paediatric ED triage staff underwent competency-based assessments for HIDAT with all head injury presentations 1 May to 31 October 2020 included in analysis. We determined which patients were discharged using the tool, which underwent CT of the brain and whether there was a clinically important traumatic brain injury or representation to the ED.	Of the 1429 patients screened; 610 (43%) screened negative with 250 (18%) discharged by nursing staff. Of the entire cohort, 32 CTs were performed for head injury concerns (6 abnormal) with 1 CT performed in the HIDAT negative group (normal). Of those discharged using HIDAT, four reattended, two with vomiting (no imaging or admission) and two with minor scalp wound infections. Two patients who screened negative declined discharge under the policy with later medical discharge (no imaging or admission). Paediatric ED attendances were 29% lower than in 2018.	We have successfully implemented HIDAT into local clinical practice. The number discharged (18%) is lower than originally described; this is likely multifactorial. The relationship between COVID-19 and paediatric ED attendances is unclear but decreased attendances suggest those for whom the tool was originally designed are not attending ED and may be accessing other medical/non-medical resources.",Remaining,0,0

However, robust evidence for most of these risk factors is lacking. Effective interventions should target risk factors in the causal pathway to dementia.	To comprehensively disentangle potentially causal aspects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) to inspire new drug targeting and improved prevention.	This genetic association study was conducted using 2-sample univariable and multivariable mendelian randomization. Independent genetic variants associated with modifiable risk factors were selected as instrumental variables from genomic consortia. Outcome data for AD were obtained from the European Alzheimer & Dementia Biobank (EADB), generated on August 31, 2021. Main analyses were conducted using the EADB clinically diagnosed end point data. All analyses were performed between April 12 and October 27, 2022.	Genetically determined modifiable risk factors.	Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for AD were calculated per 1-unit change of genetically determined risk factors.	The EADB-diagnosed cohort included 39 106 participants with clinically diagnosed AD and 401 577 control participants without AD. The mean age ranged from 72 to 83 years for participants with AD and 51 to 80 years for control participants. Among participants with AD, 54% to 75% were female, and among control participants, 48% to 60% were female. Genetically determined high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were associated with increased odds of AD (OR per 1-SD increase, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05-1.16]). Genetically determined high systolic blood pressure was associated with increased risk of AD after adjusting for diastolic blood pressure (OR per 10-mm Hg increase, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.02-1.46]). In a second analysis to minimize bias due to sample overlap, the entire UK Biobank was excluded from the EADB consortium; odds for AD were similar for HDL cholesterol (OR per 1-SD unit increase, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.02-1.15]) and systolic blood pressure after adjusting for diastolic blood pressure (OR per 10-mm Hg increase, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.01-1.50]).

The authors analyze the clinical and financial outcomes of OUD in a contemporary cohort of AMI hospitalizations.	All non-elective adult (≥ 18 years) hospitalizations for AMI were tabulated from the 2016‒2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database using relevant International Classification of Disease codes. Patients were grouped into OUD and non-OUD cohorts. Bivariate and regression analyses were performed to identify the independent association of OUD with outcomes after non-elective admission for AMI, as well as subsequent readmission.	Of an estimated 3,318,257 hospitalizations for AMI meeting study criteria, 36,057 (1.1%) had a concomitant diagnosis of OUD. While OUD was not significantly associated with mortality, OUD patients experienced superior cardiovascular outcomes compared to non-OUD. However, OUD was linked to increased odds of non-cardiovascular complications, length of stay, costs, non-home discharge, and 30-day non-elective readmission.	Patients with OUD presented with AMI at a significantly younger age than non-OUD. While OUD appears to have a cardioprotective effect, it is associated with several markers of increased resource use, including readmission.

Adenoma tissues examined included 18 clinically non-functioning adenomas, 14 GH-secreting adenomas and 7 PRL-secreting adenomas. The expression of the following genes were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): DAX-1, Adrenal-4-binding protein/steroidogenic factor-1 (Ad4BP/SF-1), Pit-1, LH beta, FSH beta, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R), GH, PRL, and TSH beta, as well as beta-actin as a control.	Eleven clinically non-functioning adenomas expressed DAX-1, 10 of which also expressed Ad4BP/SF-1. Nine out of the 11 DAX-1 expressing adenomas also expressed LH beta, FSH beta and GnRH-R as well, indicating that these adenomas possessed gonadotrophic properties. Nine clinically non-functioning adenomas expressed Pit-1 as well as GH, PRL and/or TSH beta, thus having somatomammotrophic or thyrotrophic properties, 3 of which overlapped with the above DAX-1-expressing adenomas. One non-functioning adenoma expressed Ad4BP/SF1 and FSH beta but not DAX-1, and another one expressed DAX-1 and Ad4BP/SF-1 with PRL. On the other hand, all GH-secreting and PRL-secreting adenomas expressed Pit-1 and GH and/or PRL, but neither DAX-1 nor Ad4BP/SF-1.

To address this issue, we performed a genome-wide association study among 6345 apparently healthy women in which we evaluated 336,108 SNPs as potential determinants of plasma CRP concentration. Overall, seven loci that associate with plasma CRP at levels achieving genome-wide statistical significance were found (range of p values for lead SNPs within the seven loci: 1.9 x 10(-)(8) to 6.2 x 10(-)(28)). Two of these loci (GCKR and HNF1A) are suspected or known to be associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, one is a gene-desert region on 12q23.2, and the remaining four loci are in or near the leptin receptor protein gene, the apolipoprotein E gene, the interleukin-6 receptor protein gene, or the CRP gene itself. The protein products of six of these seven loci are directly involved in metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, beta cell function, weight homeostasis, and/or premature atherothrombosis.

The main purpose of this study is to determine whether the obesity paradox measured by body mass index (BMI) or by waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is real.	We evaluated the association of general obesity measured by BMI, and abdominal obesity measured by WHtR with 1-year all-cause mortality, recurrence of stroke and combined vascular events of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients in a cohort -- the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III). Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were performed to investigate the association between obesity and clinical outcomes.	A total of 14,146 patients with ischemic stroke were included. When BMI was used as a measure of obesity, compared to the normal weight patients, mortality decreased in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.91], P = 0.0035) and obese patients (HR 0.54 [0.40-0.73], P < 0.0001); and increased in underweight patients (HR 2.55 [1.75-3.73], P < 0.0001). After adjustment for confounding factors, the protective effect of obesity and overweight disappeared. BMI had no association with recurrence of stroke or combined vascular events. When WHtR was used as a measure of obesity, obese patients had lower 1-year all-cause mortality (HR 0.64 [0.43-0.97], P = 0.0357). After adjustment for confounding factors, this difference disappeared; overweight patients still had lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42 [0.26-0.67], P = 0.0003), recurrence of stroke (aHR 0.77 [0.60-0.99], P = 0.0440) and combined vascular events (aHR 0.75 [0.58-0.95], P = 0.0198).

The neural basis of apathy in bvFTD is not completely understood. Previous neuroimaging studies have poorly considered executive impairment and dementia severity as possible confounding factors. Herein we investigated the neural basis of apathy in bvFTD through structural neuroimaging taking into account these factors.	We included patients with probable bvFTD (n = 21) and cognitively healthy controls (HC, n = 22). Participants were matched for age, sex and schooling. All subjects underwent a thorough neuropsychological examination, including tests for executive functions and social cognition. Apathy was assessed with the Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS). All subjects underwent 3T brain MRI. We investigated correlations between SAS scores and gray matter atrophy within the bvFTD group. Executive function (Frontal Assessment Battery) and disease severity were considered as covariates in neuroimaging analyses.	Compared to HC, bvFTD patients had lower scores on global cognitive efficiency, executive functions and social cognition. All bvFTD had clinically relevant apathy (scores greater than 14 in the SAS). Performance in executive function tests did not correlate with apathy scores. The severity of apathy was negatively correlated with gray matter volumes in midline prefrontal regions, namely orbitofrontal cortex and both anterior and dorsal regions of cingulate cortex.	Apathy in bvFTD is related to a specific network of prefrontal cortical areas critically involved in effort-based behavior for rewards and appears to be independent of executive dysfunction.",Remaining,0,0

Cognition was assessed using both the Mini Mental State Examination and the modified Indiana University Token test, while disability was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale. Associations were explored using univariate and multivariate analyses.	The diagnosis of MDD was more frequently present in the stroke survivors (41.5%, p < 0.001). It was strongly associated with female gender (p < 0.001, O.R = 3.77, 95% C.I = 1.78-8.00), disability (p = 0.001, O.R = 3.27, 95% C.I = 1.57-6.83), and cognitive dysfunction (p < 0.001, O.R = 5.28, 95% C.I = 2.25-12.41). Female gender (p = 0.037, O.R = 2.65, 95% C.I = 1.06-6.62) and cognitive dysfunction (P = 0.03, O.R = 4.58, 95% C.I = 1.68-12.46) were independent predictors of post-stroke MDD.	Post stroke MDD is common in Nigerian survivors attending rehabilitation. The high rates reported in this population may be the result of factors affecting the efficient management of stroke in developing countries.",Remaining,0,0

The current study estimates costs of living in a nursing home for persons with dementia in the Netherlands to help inform economic evaluations of future DMTs.	Data were collected during semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals and from the financial administration of a healthcare organization with several nursing homes. Personnel costs were calculated using a bottom-up approach by valuing the time estimates. Non-personnel costs were calculated using information from the financial administration of the healthcare organization.	Total costs of a person with dementia per 24 hours, including both care staff and other healthcare providers, were € 151 for small-scale living wards and € 147 for independent living wards. Non-personnel costs were € 37 per day.	This study provides Dutch estimates for total healthcare costs per day for institutionalized persons with dementia. These cost estimates can be used in cost-effectiveness analyses for future DMTs in dementia.",Remaining,0,0

Youngsters were assessed at age 3 years (n = 60) and 3.5 years later (n = 44). Data were collected from children, parents, teachers, and clinicians. Results revealed that most diagnoses of SAD were not stable during this developmental period, as many children drifted toward subclinical or nonclinical status. In addition, children with clinical SAD, compared to those with subclinical SAD or no symptoms of SAD, had a disproportionately higher number of comorbid diagnoses and experienced significantly greater somatic concerns, anxiety, and general internalizing behavior. In addition, their parents experienced greater depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, phobic anxiety, and general distress. The results preliminarily support prior findings that most children experience a dissipation of SAD symptoms in young childhood but that some children continue to experience stable, significant distress. The results are consistent with prior research on older children that SAD remits for many but not all youth and suggest that parent and family variables may have much to do with cases of poor remission in this population.",Remaining,0,0
299,32858312,Journal of affective disorders,Applying network analysis to investigate the links between dimensional schizotypy and cognitive and affective empathy.,"Although impairment in empathy has been reported in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, little is known about the relationship between empathy and schizotypal traits. This study examines this relationship by applying network analysis to a large sample collected at 18-months follow-up in a longitudinal dataset.	One thousand four hundred and eighty-six college students were recruited and completed a set of self-reported questionnaires on empathy, schizotypy, depression, anxiety and stress. Networks were constructed by taking the subscale scores of these measures as nodes and partial correlations between each pair of nodes as edges. Network Comparison Tests were performed to investigate the differences between individuals with high and low schizotypy.	Cognitive and affective empathy were strongly connected with negative schizotypy in the network. Physical and social anhedonia showed high centrality measured by strength, closeness and betweenness while anxiety and stress showed high expected influence. Predictability ranged from 22.4% (personal distress) to 79.9% (anxiety) with an average of 54.4%. Compared with the low schizotypy group, the high schizotypy group showed higher global strength (S = 0.813, p < 0.05) and significant differences in network structure (M = 0.531, p < 0.001) and strength of edges connecting empathy with schizotypy (adjusted ps < 0.05).	Only self-rating scales were used, and disorganized schizotypy was not included.	Our findings suggest that the cognitive and affective components of empathy and dimensions of schizotypy are closely related in the general population and their network interactions may play an important role in individuals with high schizotypy.",Remaining,0,0

Available data from six Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations indicated that 1429 isolation of enteroviruses from fecal samples of those patients were performed. The most frequently isolated enterovirus serotype was echovirus type 30: 138/203 isolated enteroviruses, but also others enterovirus serotypes were isolated in a study period. In the years 1995 and 1996 the percentage of positive results of isolation was highest with the numbers of 31% and 28.27% respectively. The decrease in positive isolation results has been observed from 1997 year. Negative results of isolation come up to 90% of investigated cases. Only 1.5% of enterovirus isolation attempts finished successfully in 2002 year.

Calculation of absorbed-dose patterns for this treatment has traditionally involved complex computer programs incorporating algorithms designed to reconstruct the shape of the patient's head from computerized tomography (CT) images. A large proportion of the patients treated with SMART, however, have arteriovenous malformations for which angiography provides a better idea of lesion size and position than CT. This paper describes a computer program developed at St Bartholomew's Hospital which enables calculation of absorbed dose for a SMART treatment directly from angiographic radiographs, avoiding the need for CT.

Data on all patients admitted to a psychiatric ward from 2010-2014 in the Capital Region of Denmark was linked with information from the register of coercive measures. Patients were based on diagnosis divided into six groups. The three main patient groups were: only psychiatric diagnosis defined as all ICD-10 F-diagnosis except F10-F19, dual diagnosis (co-occurrence of diagnoses of harmful use or dependency and psychiatric diagnoses) and only other substance use diagnosis (i.e. other than harmful use or dependency). The risk of mechanical restraint was investigated by analyzing all first-time admissions in the period using Cox-proportional hazard models.	In the crude rates patients with dual diagnosis were more often mechanically restrained compared to patients with only psychiatric diagnoses or only other substance use diagnoses. However, this was attenuated when the characteristics of patients were accounted for. Patients with only other substance related diagnoses had the highest risk of being mechanically restrained.	When preventing mechanical restraint, the focus should be on actual use of substances or withdrawal effects and not on the dual diagnoses patients in them-self.",Remaining,0,0

The present study was conducted to determine whether there is an association between the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and ischemic stroke in Egyptian population. Also, we analyzed the ACE gene I/D polymorphism as a risk factor for small-vessel (SV) versus large-vessel (LV) disease.	Sixty patients with ischemic stroke were included: 30 with SV disease and 30 with LV disease. In addition, a control group of 30 apparent healthy subjects were studied. Clinical assessment, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging brain, and genetic study using the polymerase chain reaction of ACE gene were done for all subjects.	We found that the distribution of ACE gene polymorphism frequency was significantly different between the 3 groups. The DD genotype was far more common in stroke patients compared to controls. It was also significantly more common in each of the patient groups compared to controls but rather similar in the 2 patient groups with SV and LV diseases.	We found that the ACE gene deletion/deletion genotype is common in Egyptian patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke but does not appear to be specific neither to SV nor to LV disease.",Remaining,0,0

Descriptive, case series.	Three community nursing homes.	Seventy-three incontinent residents of three nursing homes participating in a trial of a behavioral intervention for nighttime urinary incontinence.	Data were collected during a baseline and repeat baseline period about 2 months later in nursing homes serving as controls for the intervention homes. Incontinence episodes were identified by incontinence pads, which were wired to detect wetness of 10 mL or more. Sleep was monitored by wireless wrist actigraphs. Noise and light changes were monitored by bedside recording devices.	Recordings covered 403 nights, during which 1715 awakenings from 10 consecutive minutes of sleep were detected as were 1168 incontinent episodes. Only 4% of the awakenings were associated with an incontinence episode, and only 23% of the incontinence episodes occurred during periods of at least 10 consecutive minutes of sleep. Of the latter episodes, only 12% appeared to awaken the resident.	Our data raise questions about the relevance of incontinence episodes to sleep disruption among chronically incontinent nursing home residents. Our findings must be interpreted cautiously because of limitations in the technologies and definitions we used to identify sleep, awakenings, and incontinence episodes. Although logistically and technically difficult to perform, studies using polysomnographic recordings of sleep are needed to examine further these important associations.",Remaining,0,0

The sample included 13,241 working people, 18-29, 30-39, and 40-59-years-old, randomly selected in France and interviewed by phone. Occupation, type of employment, physical demands, psychological demands, job dissatisfaction, gender, age, educational level, and income were considered. Data were analyzed with logistic models.	Alcohol abuse affected 20.4% of men and 7.5% of women; smoking 32.1% and 24.2%, respectively. Their patterns of association with the occupational factors varied with gender and age. Job dissatisfaction was the leading factor among young men (adjusted odds ratio for alcohol abuse and smoking: 1.71 and 2.02), whereas short-term employment was the leading factor among young women (1.69 and 1.58), this pattern being reversed in older generations. The pattern of associations of physical and psychological demands with outcomes is more complex, but overall psychological demands were more important for women (especially the younger ones) than men, especially for smoking (OR>1.6). Smoking within 5 min after waking was much more common among male and female smokers with these occupational factors, suggesting a potential dependency.	Workers with short-term employment and occupational demands are subject to a higher risk for alcohol abuse and smoking with high gender and age disparities. Gender and age should be considered when designing measures to prevent substance abuse related to occupation.",Remaining,0,0

We surveyed New York State parents of children with DDs to ascertain willingness and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines.	An online survey was distributed to statewide DD networks from June to September 2021 (vaccines were authorized for adolescents in May 2021). We report associations between vaccine willingness and concerns and race/ethnicity, child age, in-person schooling, routine/flu vaccinations, and DD diagnoses. Willingness was categorized as 'got/will get ASAP' (high), 'wait and see/only if required,' or 'definitely not.'	A total of 352 parents (49.1% White) responded. Willingness differed by age (p < 0.001). High willingness was reported for 73.9%, 50.0%, and 36.0% of children aged 12 to 17, 6 to 11, and 0 to 5 years, respectively. Willingness differed by autism diagnosis (p < 0.01) and routine and flu vaccination status (p < 0.001). Predominant concerns included side effects (89%) and children with disabilities not being in trials (80%). Less common concerns were COVID not serious enough in children to warrant vaccine (23%) and misinformation (e.g., microchips, 5G, DNA changes) (24%). Concerns about vaccine safety differed by age (p < 0.01) and were highest for older and then the youngest children. In age-stratified adjusted models, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was negatively associated with high willingness for age 5 or younger (OR = 0.02, 95% confidence interval, <0.001-0.622).	Parents of children with DD in New York seemed highly willing for them to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Although few factors predicted willingness to vaccinate, addressing safety and developmental concerns regarding young children is warranted. Given their increased vulnerability, improved COVID-19 surveillance for children with DD is warranted.",Remaining,0,0

The diagnostic value of this space was investigated in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) syndrome.	Coronal fat-saturated T2-weighted MRI of the orbit was performed in 15 patients with SIH fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for headache caused by low CSF pressure of the International Classification of Headache Disorders or the criteria for spontaneous spinal CSF leaks and intracranial hypotension. The size of the subarachnoid space in the ONS was measured in 2 slices behind the eyeballs. The images were compared before and after treatment. The CSF pressure was measured by lumbar puncture.	Before treatment, the diameter of the ONS subarachnoid space ranged from 2.58 to 4.21 mm (mean 3.34 mm) and the thickness from 0 to 0.48 mm (mean 0.15 mm). Both measurements showed significant correlations with CSF opening pressure, and 8 patients had no CSF space before treatment. The size of CSF space increased in many patients after effective treatment.	Disappearance of the CSF space in the ONS was frequently observed in patients with SIH. This characteristic finding may be useful in the diagnosis of SIH as well as in the evaluation of treatment effectiveness.",Remaining,0,0
309,23733091,Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,Best-case kappa scores calculated retrospectively from EEG report databases.,"The most popular metric for interrater reliability in electroencephalography is the kappa (κ) score. κ calculation is laborious, requiring EEG readers to read the same EEG studies. We introduce a method to determine the best-case κ score (κBEST) for measuring interrater reliability between EEG readers, retrospectively.	We incorporated 1 year of EEG reports read by four adult EEG readers at our institution. We used SQL queries to determine EEG findings for subsequent analysis. We generated logistic regression models for particular EEG findings, dependent on patient age, location acuity, and EEG reader. We derived a novel measure, the κBEST statistic, from the logistic regression coefficients.	Increasing patient age and location acuity were associated with decreased sleep and increased diffuse abnormalities. For certain findings, EEG readers exhibited the dominant influence, manifesting directly as lower between-reader κBEST scores for certain EEG findings. Within-reader κBEST control scores were higher than between-reader scores, suggesting internal consistency.	The κBEST metric can measure significant interrater reliability differences between any number of EEG readers and reports, retrospectively, and is generalizable to other domains (e.g., pathology or radiology reporting). We suggest using this metric as a guide or starting point for focused quality control efforts.",Remaining,0,0
310,28428190,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,In Vivo Detection of EGFRvIII in Glioblastoma via Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Signature Consistent with Deep Peritumoral Infiltration: The φ-Index.,"Purpose: The epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) mutation has been considered a driver mutation and therapeutic target in glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain cancer. Currently, detecting EGFRvIII requires postoperative tissue analyses, which are ex vivo and unable to capture the tumor's spatial heterogeneity. Considering the increasing evidence of in vivo imaging signatures capturing molecular characteristics of cancer, this study aims to detect EGFRvIII in primary glioblastoma noninvasively, using routine clinically acquired imaging.Experimental Design: We found peritumoral infiltration and vascularization patterns being related to EGFRvIII status. We therefore constructed a quantitative within-patient peritumoral heterogeneity index (PHI/φ-index), by contrasting perfusion patterns of immediate and distant peritumoral edema. Application of φ-index in preoperative perfusion scans of independent discovery (n = 64) and validation (n = 78) cohorts, revealed the generalizability of this EGFRvIII imaging signature.Results: Analysis in both cohorts demonstrated that the obtained signature is highly accurate (89.92%), specific (92.35%), and sensitive (83.77%), with significantly distinctive ability (P = 4.0033 × 10[-10], AUC = 0.8869). Findings indicated a highly infiltrative-migratory phenotype for EGFRvIII[+] tumors, which displayed similar perfusion patterns throughout peritumoral edema. Contrarily, EGFRvIII[-] tumors displayed perfusion dynamics consistent with peritumorally confined vascularization, suggesting potential benefit from extensive peritumoral resection/radiation.Conclusions: This EGFRvIII signature is potentially suitable for clinical translation, since obtained from analysis of clinically acquired images. Use of within-patient heterogeneity measures, rather than population-based associations, renders φ-index potentially resistant to inter-scanner variations. Overall, our findings enable noninvasive evaluation of EGFRvIII for patient selection for targeted therapy, stratification into clinical trials, personalized treatment planning, and potentially treatment-response evaluation.

An inventory of scales was developed to improve the assessment of different dimensions of somatic functioning. In order to enhance their specificity and incremental validity, the scales were constructed to be relatively independent of already known general personality variables such as Stress Reaction (neuroticism), Locus of Control, Hypochondriasis, and Absorption. Three scales, derived from orthogonal factor analyses, were developed and cross-validated: (1) Autonomic Response Frequency, assessing spontaneous fluctuations in autonomic responding; (2) Autonomic Response to Stress, assessing the amount of autonomic arousal perceived by a subject in stress situations; and (3) Somatic Response Control, a self-report measure of capacity to control both autonomic and fine muscle responses. The hypothesis that sympathetic and parasympathetic awareness might define two distinct dimensions was not supported by the data. The new scales will be useful in testing hypotheses of possible relationships among the factors measured and behavioral and psychophysiological indicators of the response to stress.",Remaining,0,0

Using a standard recognition memory task, we conducted a pilot study to examine how 24 hours of tobacco abstinence in moderate to heavy smokers would affect memory in males and females. Twenty-five moderate to heavy smokers were tested following a period of smoking normally and following 24 hours of tobacco abstinence. At each session, participants completed a recognition memory task in which items were studied under full- and divided-attention conditions (a standard manipulation of memory encoding) as well as tests of passive short-term and working memory (forward and backward digit span). Tobacco abstinence significantly reduced memory performance under full attention conditions for males but not for females. A significant main effect of smoking status in which abstinence significantly reduced performance, as well as a main effect of encoding condition (divided attention < full attention), were found. Our results demonstrate that there may be substantial sex differences in the cognitive effects of tobacco abstinence. While preliminary, the data suggest the need for further, more extensive study of how males and females differ during tobacco abstinence. Such information will inform the best strategies for tobacco cessation efforts.",Remaining,0,0

A cross-sectional survey of 1275 patients was performed from November to December 2018. Interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaires, desk review guide and urine drug assays were employed. Questionnaire recorded CPD non-medical and illicit drug use history from patients' files, CPD lifetime use and risk factors. Desk review guide recorded recently prescribed drugs in patients' files to corroborate with urine assays. Predictors were analysed by multivariate logistic regression.	From desk review, 145 (11.4%) patients had history of CPD non-medical use and 36 (2.8%) had used illicit drugs. Of 988 patients who provided urine, 166 (16.8%) self-medicated CPDs, particularly benzodiazepines while 12 (1.2%) used illicit drugs. Of those with drug-positive urine, 123 (69.1%) had no documented history of CPD non-medical and illicit drug use. Being an inpatient (OR=10.90, p<0.001) was independently associated with CPD non-medical use. Additionally, being an inpatient (OR=8.29, p<0.001) and tobacco consumption (OR=1.85, p=0.041) were associated with CPD non-medical and illicit drug use combined. Among participants, 119 (9.3%) reported CPD lifetime use, and this was independently associated with education level (OR=2.71, p<0.001) and history of treatment for substance abuse (OR=2.08, p=0.018).	CPD non-medical use is common among Uganda's psychiatric patients, and more prevalent than illicit drug use. Rapid diagnostic assays may be needed in psychiatric care in resource limited settings. It is necessary to assess how CPD non-medical use impacts mental care outcomes and patient safety. High risk groups like inpatients and tobacco consumers should be prioritised in psychiatric screening.",Remaining,0,0

The plasma leptin levels significantly decreased during 36 h fasting by 48.8 +/- 4.5% (pre: 11.3 +/- 2.3, post: 6.2 +/- 1.5 ng/ml) and 38.6 +/- 7.9% (pre: 7.6 +/- 5.0, post: 4.2 +/- 1.0 ng/ml) in SCI and AB, respectively. Plasma leptin started to decrease at 24 h of fasting in the SCI group, whereas plasma leptin started to decrease at 12 h of fasting in the AB group. The current study demonstrated that plasma leptin decreased with fasting in both SCI and AB groups, with the leptin decrease being delayed in the SCI group. The delayed leptin response to fasting in the SCI group may be because of increased fat mass (%body fat, SCI: 33.8 +/- 3.0, AB: 24.1 +/- 2.9) and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.",Remaining,0,0

Adult,An ecologically sensitive measure of executive cognition (the Breakfast Task) improves prediction of functional outcome in schizophrenia.,"Previous work has found that the Breakfast Task (BT), a computerized, ecologically informed executive ability measure, is sensitive to group differences in aging, acquired brain injury, and Parkinson's disease. We investigated whether this measure improves the prediction of functional status over and above standard measures of general intellectual ability, relationship perception, life skills, and symptom severity in individuals with schizophrenia. Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the joint and incremental validity of the BT in predicting functional disability scores on the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS 2.0). Analyses with combined patient (n = 25) and control (n = 32) participants showed that participant status (patients versus control) was the only significant predictor of functional outcome. However, in the patient data, the proportion of variance accounted for improved significantly (model R[2] of 4% vs. 25%) when BT scores were added to a model containing clinical (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), social (Relationships Across Domains), intellectual (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), and life skills (Canadian Objective Assessment of Life Skills) measures.

These soils are shown to contain significant amount of heavy metals which have been associated with hypertension.	The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between geophagia and PIH, assess the dietary intakes and health of participants.	This study was a case-control involving 30 women with PIH and 70 normotensive pregnant women.	Geophagia was not significantly associated with PIH. Women with PIH practicing geophagia recorded significantly low levels of haemoglobin, calcium and ferritin. Hypertensives recorded impaired fasting blood glucose (5.77±1.71mmol/L, p=0.051), higher levels of urea (3.60±1.29 mmol/L, p=0.000) and creatinine (382.67±11.66 µmol/L, p=0.000).

Of the 98 remaining patients, 26.5% (n=26) had visual hallucinations. Among these, one patient also had delusions, two had auditory hallucinations, and one had gustatory hallucinations. Visual hallucinations were significantly associated with worse visual acuity, lower cognitive score, higher depression score, and worse disease severity. Hallucinations were not associated with history of psychiatric disease, dose or duration of levodopa or other antiparkinsonian medication treatment, or duration of illness.	Visual hallucinations are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease and are most likely of multifactorial origin. Although higher doses of levodopa are known to be related clinically to hallucinations in individual patients, the results suggest that several underlying characteristics of patients with Parkinson's disease (disease severity, dementia, depression, worse visual acuity) may be more important determinants of which patients experience hallucinations. The data also provide preliminary evidence that abnormality of the visual system may be related to visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, as has been found in other disorders with visual hallucinations.",Remaining,0,0
320,11523839,Journal of abnormal child psychology,A confirmatory factor analysis on the DSM-IV ADHD and ODD symptoms: what is the best model for the organization of these symptoms?,"Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate five different models for the organization of the DSM-IV ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms (Model 1: a single factor model; Model 2: an ADHD and ODD two factor model; Model 3a: an inattention (INA), hyperactivity/impulsivity (HYP/IMP), and ODD three factor model; Model 3b: an INA, HYP/IMP, and ODD three factor model where the three IMP symptoms cross-load on the ODD factor; Model 4: an INA, HYP, IMP, and ODD four factor model). To evaluate these models, maternal ratings of ADHD and ODD symptoms were obtained at outpatient pediatric clinics on 742 children not in treatment and 91 children in treatment for ADHD. Model 3a resulted in a good fit as well as a significantly better fit than Model 2. Model 3a was also equivalent across treatment status, gender, and age groupings for the most part. Though Models 3b and 4 provided a statistically better fit than Model 3a, the improvement in fit was small and other model selection criteria argued against these more complex models.",Remaining,0,0
321,6799932,Pediatrics,Relationship of pneumothorax to occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage in the premature newborn.,"The relationship of pneumothorax to the occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) has been studied in the premature newborn. The major objective of the study was to determine whether the systemic hemodynamic changes that occur with pneumothorax are reflected in the cerebral circulation and whether these changes play a role in pathogenesis of IVH. Blood flow velocity was measured in the anterior cerebral arteries by a transcutaneous Doppler technique in nine infants who developed pneumothorax in the first 3 days of life. At the time of pneumothorax there was a marked increase in flow velocity, especially during diastole, and, with resolution of pneumothorax, flow velocity returned to normal levels over the ensuing hours. The changes in flow velocity correlated closely with systemic hemodynamic changes that occurred with pneumothorax, ie, and increase in mean systemic blood pressure, especially diastolic pressure. IVH, documented by serial ultrasound scans, was observed shortly after pneumothorax in the nine infants. The data thus demonstrate a marked increase in flow velocity in the cerebral circulation at the time of pneumothorax. This increase is of importance in the genesis of IVH as is suggested further by the occurrence of IVH soon after the cerebral hemodynamic changes.",Remaining,0,0

A prospective, observational feasibility study was carried out.	Intensive Care Unit of a third level hospital.	Consecutive recording was made of the adults diagnosed with brain death based on clinical criteria following admission to the Intensive Care Unit in the period from January to December 2017.	The procedure was performed at the patient bedside with the intravenous administration of technetium 99 metastable hexamethylpropylene amine oxime. The absence of perfusion in the cerebral hemispheres and brainstem was described as a pattern consistent with BD. The diagnosis was correlated to the transcranial Doppler and / or electroencephalographic findings.	A total of 66.1% of the patients were men with an average age of 60 years [IQR: 51-72]. The most frequent causes resulting in BD were hemorrhagic stroke (48.2%, n=27), followed by traumatic brain injury (30.4%, n=17), ischemic stroke (10.7%, n=6) and post-cardiac arrest anoxic encephalopathy (7.1%, n=4). A clinical diagnosis of BD was made in all cases, and the portable gamma-camera confirmed the diagnosis in 100% of the patients with a pattern characterized by the absence of brain perfusion. In addition, the results were compared with the transcranial Doppler findings in 46 patients, confirming the presence of diastolic reverberation and / or systolic peaks. The electroencephalographic tracing was obtained in 10 cases, with the appearance of electrical silence, due to the absence of an acoustic window in the transcranial Doppler study.

325,30950321,Psychological science,How Replicable Are Links Between Personality Traits and Consequential Life Outcomes? The Life Outcomes of Personality Replication Project.,"The Big Five personality traits have been linked to dozens of life outcomes. However, metascientific research has raised questions about the replicability of behavioral science. The Life Outcomes of Personality Replication (LOOPR) Project was therefore conducted to estimate the replicability of the personality-outcome literature. Specifically, I conducted preregistered, high-powered (median N = 1,504) replications of 78 previously published trait-outcome associations. Overall, 87% of the replication attempts were statistically significant in the expected direction. The replication effects were typically 77% as strong as the corresponding original effects, which represents a significant decline in effect size. The replicability of individual effects was predicted by the effect size and design of the original study, as well as the sample size and statistical power of the replication. These results indicate that the personality-outcome literature provides a reasonably accurate map of trait-outcome associations but also that it stands to benefit from efforts to improve replicability.",Remaining,0,0
326,8970655,Adolescence,Substance use among adolescents: fulfilling a need state.,"A factor that has received little investigation concerns the feeling state of need fulfillment and how this may relate to the significant public health problem of adolescent substance use. A survey of 823 students was conducted at a suburban public high school in the Southeastern United States. The questionnaire contained a scale focusing on fulfillment of adolescent needs, the Children's Depression Inventory, and items on current substance use. The results of t-tests indicated that the higher the adolescent is on the Need scale, the greater the likelihood of engaging in substance use (p < .05). Further, results indicated that cigarette smoking, drinking alcohol, and smoking marijuana are associated with significantly higher scores on the Need scale for both males and females. Although the Need scale was significantly positively correlated with the Children's Depression Inventory (r = .45, p = .0001), the two feeling states were not collinear. However, the Need scale was not significantly correlated with age, indicating that the need state is not simply a developmental process (r = .04, p = .11). The results suggest that a feeling state of unfulfilled needs may propel adolescents into the destructive behavior of substance use. A state of high wants and needs that cannot be gratified simply in a complex society may be a precursor of substance use.",Remaining,0,0
327,23514079,AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,A pilot study examining food insecurity and HIV risk behaviors among individuals recently released from prison.,"Annually 700,000 individuals are released from U.S. prison, many at risk for food insecurity and HIV. The association between food insecurity and HIV risk behaviors has been established but not in this population. To investigate this association, we recruited 110 recently released prisoners to participate in a survey. Ninety-one percent of our sample was food insecure; 37% did not eat for an entire day in the past month. Those who did not eat for an entire day were more likely to report using alcohol, heroin, or cocaine before sex or exchanging sex for money compared to those who had at least a meal each day. From this pilot study, released prisoners appear to be at risk for food insecurity, and not eating for an entire day is associated with certain HIV risk behaviors. HIV prevention efforts should include longitudinal studies on the relationship between food insecurity and HIV risk behaviors among recently released prisoners.",Remaining,0,0
328,33846423,Scientific reports,STORM imaging reveals the spatial arrangement of transition zone components and IFT particles at the ciliary base in Tetrahymena.,"The base of the cilium comprising the transition zone (TZ) and transition fibers (TF) acts as a selecting gate to regulate the intraflagellar transport (IFT)-dependent trafficking of proteins to and from cilia. Before entering the ciliary compartment, IFT complexes and transported cargoes accumulate at or near the base of the cilium. The spatial organization of IFT proteins at the cilia base is key for understanding cilia formation and function. Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and computational averaging, we show that seven TZ, nine IFT, three Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and one centrosomal protein, form 9-clustered rings at the cilium base of a ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. In the axial dimension, analyzed TZ proteins localize to a narrow region of about 30 nm while IFT proteins dock approximately 80 nm proximal to TZ. Moreover, the IFT-A subcomplex is positioned peripheral to the IFT-B subcomplex and the investigated BBS proteins localize near the ciliary membrane. The positioning of the HA-tagged N- and C-termini of the selected proteins enabled the prediction of the spatial orientation of protein particles and likely cargo interaction sites. Based on the obtained data, we built a comprehensive 3D-model showing the arrangement of the investigated ciliary proteins.",Remaining,0,0

Although strong associations were observed, brain homogenates were used to generate the data, introducing complications because of the range of cell types analyzed. In order to address the issue of cellular heterogeneity in homogenate samples we isolated microglial, astrocytes and neurons by laser capture microdissection from CA1 of hippocampus in the same individuals with a clinical and pathological diagnosis of AD and matched control cases. Using this unique RNAseq data set, we show that in the hippocampus, ANK1 is significantly (p<0.0001) up-regulated 4-fold in AD microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes from the same individuals. These data provide evidence that microglia are the source of ANK1 differential expression previously identified in homogenate samples in AD.",Remaining,0,0

However, little is known about the long-term quality and consistency of the sqEEG signal, which is the objective of this study.	The largest multicenter cohort of sqEEG was analyzed, including 14 patients with epilepsy and 12 healthy subjects, implanted with a sqEEG device (24/7 EEG[™] SubQ), and recorded from 23 to 230 days (median 42 days), with a median data capture rate of 75% (17.9 hours/day). Median power spectral density plots of each subject were examined for physiological peaks, including at diurnal and nocturnal periods. Long-term temporal trends in signal impedance and power spectral features were investigated with subject-specific linear regression models and group-level linear mixed-effects models.	sqEEG spectrograms showed an approximate 1/f power distribution. Diurnal peaks in the alpha range (8-13Hz) and nocturnal peaks in the sigma range (12-16Hz) were seen in the majority of subjects. Signal impedances remained low, and frequency band powers were highly stable throughout the recording periods.	The spectral characteristics of minimally invasive, ultra long-term sqEEG are similar to scalp EEG, whereas the signal is highly stationary. Our findings reinforce the suitability of this system for chronic implantation on diverse clinical applications, from seizure detection and forecasting to brain-computer interfaces.",Remaining,0,0

Prospective study.	This study was hospital-based and included 62 inpatients with stroke.	The primary outcome was swallowing ability at discharge. The swallowing ability was assessed using the Food Intake Level Scale (FILS). The FILS change was calculated by subtracting FILS at admission from FILS at discharge. Ultrasound images were acquired at admission using B-mode ultrasound imaging. Muscle mass and intramuscular adipose tissue of the quadriceps were assessed based on muscle thickness and echo intensity, respectively. The mean muscle thickness and echo intensity of the right and left quadriceps were used in the analysis. A multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors independently associated with the FILS at discharge and FILS change. The independent variables were the muscle thickness and echo intensity of the quadriceps, FILS at admission, age, sex, body mass index, days from stroke onset, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index, number of medications, unit number of rehabilitation therapy, and Barthel Index score at admission.	Muscle thickness of the quadriceps was significantly and independently associated with FILS at discharge (β = 0.27) and FILS change (β = 0.40). Echo intensity of the quadriceps was not significantly and independently associated with FILS at discharge (β = 0.22) and FILS change (β = 0.31).	Our results indicated that greater quadriceps muscle mass at post-acute care admission was associated with better swallowing ability at discharge in patients with stroke. Assessing muscle mass of the quadriceps at admission is important for predicting recovery of swallowing ability and interventions for quadriceps muscle mass may be effective for improving swallowing ability of patients with stroke.",Remaining,0,0
333,17064420,"Substance abuse treatment, prevention, and policy",Perceptions of Pakistani medical students about drugs and alcohol: a questionnaire-based survey.,"Drug abuse is hazardous and known to be prevalent among young adults, warranting efforts to increase awareness about harmful effects and to change attitudes. This study was conducted to assess the perceptions of a group of medical students from Pakistan, a predominantly Muslim country, regarding four drugs namely heroin, charas, benzodiazepines and alcohol.	In total, 174 self-reported questionnaires were received (87% response rate). The most commonly cited reasons for why some students take these drugs were peer pressure (96%), academic stress (90%) and curiosity (88%). The most commonly cited justifiable reason was to go to sleep (34%). According to 77%, living in the college male hostel predisposed one to using these drugs. Sixty percent of students said that the drugs did not improve exam performance, while 54% said they alleviated stress. Seventy-eight percent said they did not intend to ever take drugs in the future. Females and day-scholars were more willing to discourage a friend who took drugs. Morality (78%), religion (76%) and harmful effects of drugs (57%) were the most common deterrents against drug intake. Five suggestions to decrease drug abuse included better counseling facilities (78%) and more recreational facilities (60%).	Efforts need to be made to increase student awareness regarding effects and side effects of drugs. Our findings suggest that educating students about the adverse effects as well as the moral and religious implications of drug abuse is more likely to have a positive impact than increased policing. Proper student-counseling facilities and healthier avenues for recreation are also required.",Remaining,0,0
334,27070004,Journal of Parkinson's disease,Impaired Switching from Self-Prepared Actions in Mild Parkinson Disease.,"Planned and initiated actions frequently need to be terminated in favor of another action. It is known that many individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) have more difficulty self-initiating movement (i.e., endogenously evoked movement)than moving in response to environmental stimuli (i.e., exogenously evoked movement). However, it is not known if individuals with PD display this same endogenous-exogenous asymmetry when needing to terminate, disengage, and reprogram movements.	This study used a novel reaction time (RT) paradigm to test whether patients with mild PD have subclinical deficits of endogenous movement initiation and endogenous movement reprogramming.	Twelve non-demented individuals with PD on medication and 15 demographically similar healthy control (HC)participants completed an experimental paradigm that examined their RTs (key press) following self-selected valid action preparation (endogenous cues) versus valid exogenously presented cues. The paradigm also assessed participants' ability to rapidly stop their endogenous or exogenous preparation following an invalid cue and execute an alternative action (key press).	Participants with PD produced similar RTs as controls following endogenous and exogenous valid cues, and following invalid exogenous cues. However, following invalid endogenous cues, PD participants were slower than HC participants to stop an endogenous preparation and execute an alternative action.	Despite having mild disease and being on dopaminergic medication, these individuals with PD displayed deficits in motor disengagement and reprograming of self-selected actions. Future studies should examine how this phenomenon influences every day actions, as well as possible treatments for this deficit.",Remaining,0,0

However, direct access to the underlying data for academic institutions and individual physicians or pharmacists is intricate, and easily employable analysis modes for everyday clinical situations are missing. This underlines the need for a tool to bring pharmacovigilance to the clinics. To address these issues, we have developed OpenVigil FDA, a novel web-based pharmacovigilance analysis tool which uses the openFDA online interface of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to access U.S. American and international pharmacovigilance data from the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS). OpenVigil FDA provides disproportionality analyses to (i) identify the drug most likely evoking a new adverse event, (ii) compare two drugs concerning their safety profile, (iii) check arbitrary combinations of two drugs for unknown drug-drug interactions and (iv) enhance the relevance of results by identifying confounding factors and eliminating them using background correction. We present examples for these applications and discuss the promises and limits of pharmacovigilance, openFDA and OpenVigil FDA. OpenVigil FDA is the first public available tool to apply pharmacovigilance findings directly to real-life clinical problems.

Research on homelessness and smoking to date has been concentrated predominantly in the US and Australia. This study aimed to describe smoking and quitting behaviour in homeless adult smokers in Great Britain. Data on perceptions of, and willingness to try, e-cigarettes were also gathered.	Cross sectional survey of 283 adult smokers accessing homeless support services in Kent, the Midlands, London and Edinburgh. Participants answered a four-part survey: i) demographics; ii) current smoking behaviour and dependence (including the Fagerström Test of Cigarette Dependence [FTCD]); iii) previous quit attempts; and iv) e-cigarettes perceptions.	High levels of cigarette dependence were observed (FTCD: M = 7.78, sd ± 0.98). Although desire to quit was high, most had made fewer than 5 quit attempts and 90% of these lasted less than 24 h. 91.5% reported that others around them also smoked. Previous quit methods used included cold turkey (29.7%), NRT (24.7%), varenicline (22.3%) and bupropion (14.5%). 34% were willing or able to spend £20 or more for an e-cigarette and 82% had tried one in the past although 54% reported that they preferred smoking.	We observed high nicotine dependence, few long-term quit attempts, strong desire to quit and amenability to both traditional cessation methods and e-cigarettes. Community embedded and non-routine approaches to cessation may be promising avenues promoting engagement with the homeless community. Likely barriers to uptake include low affordability, preference for cigarettes and high numbers of smoking acquaintances.",Remaining,0,0

342,26274986,Journal of neurosurgery,Anatomy and approaches along the cerebellar-brainstem fissures.,"OBJECT Fissure dissection is routinely used in the supratentorial region to access deeply situated pathology while minimizing division of neural tissue. Use of fissure dissection is also practical in the posterior fossa. In this study, the microsurgical anatomy of the 3 cerebellar-brainstem fissures (cerebellomesencephalic, cerebellopontine, and cerebellomedullary) and the various procedures exposing these fissures in brainstem surgery were examined. METHODS Seven cadaveric heads were examined with a microsurgical technique and 3 with fiber dissection to clarify the anatomy of the cerebellar-brainstem and adjacent cerebellar fissures, in which the major vessels and neural structures are located. Several approaches directed along the cerebellar surfaces and fissures, including the supracerebellar infratentorial, occipital transtentorial, retrosigmoid, and midline suboccipital approaches, were examined. The 3 heads examined using fiber dissection defined the anatomy of the cerebellar peduncles coursing in the depths of these fissures. RESULTS Dissections directed along the cerebellar-brainstem and cerebellar fissures provided access to the posterior and posterolateral midbrain and upper pons, lateral pons, floor and lateral wall of the fourth ventricle, and dorsal and lateral medulla. CONCLUSIONS Opening the cerebellar-brainstem and adjacent cerebellar fissures provided access to the brainstem surface hidden by the cerebellum, while minimizing division of neural tissue. Most of the major cerebellar arteries, veins, and vital neural structures are located in or near these fissures and can be accessed through them.",Remaining,0,0
343,29076783,Journal of neurosurgery,Systematic histopathological analysis of different 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence levels in newly diagnosed glioblastomas.,"OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by distinct intratumoral histopathological heterogeneity with regard to variable tumor morphology, cell proliferation, and microvascularity. Maximum resection of a GBM results in an improved prognosis and thus represents the aim of surgery in the majority of cases. Fluorescence-guided surgery using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is currently widely applied for improved intraoperative tumor visualization in patients with a GBM. Three intratumoral fluorescence levels (i.e., strong, vague, or no fluorescence) can usually be distinguished during surgery. So far, however, their exact histopathological correlates and their surgical relevance have not been clarified sufficiently. Thus, the aim of this study was to systematically analyze tissue samples from newly diagnosed GBMs with different fluorescence levels according to relevant histopathological parameters. METHODS This prospective study recruited patients who underwent 5-ALA fluorescence-guided resection of a newly diagnosed radiologically suspected GBM. Each patient received 5-ALA approximately 3 hours before surgery, and a modified neurosurgical microscope was applied for intraoperative visualization of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. During surgery, tissue samples with strong, vague, or no fluorescence were collected. For each sample, the presence of tumor tissue, quality of tissue (compact, infiltrative, or no tumor), histopathological criteria of malignancy (cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and presence of microvascular proliferation/necrosis), proliferation rate (MIB-1 labeling index [LI]), and microvessel density (using CD34 staining) were investigated. RESULTS Altogether, 77 patients with a newly diagnosed, histopathologically confirmed GBM were included, and 131 samples with strong fluorescence, 69 samples with vague fluorescence, and 67 samples with no fluorescence were collected. Tumor tissue was detected in all 131 (100%) of the samples with strong fluorescence and in 65 (94%) of the 69 samples with vague fluorescence. However, mostly infiltrative tumor tissue was still found in 33 (49%) of 67 samples despite their lack of fluorescence. Strong fluorescence corresponded to compact tumors in 109 (83%) of 131 samples, whereas vague fluorescence was consistent with infiltrative tumors in 44 (64%) of 69 samples. In terms of the histopathological criteria of malignancy, a significant positive correlation of all analyzed parameters comprising cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis with the 3 fluorescence levels was observed (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the proliferation rate significantly and positively correlated with strong (MIB-1 LI 28.3%), vague (MIB-1 LI 16.7%), and no (MIB-1 LI 8.8%) fluorescence (p < 0.001). Last, a significantly higher microvessel density was detected in samples with strong fluorescence (CD34 125.5 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) than in those with vague (CD34 82.8 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) or no (CD34 68.6 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) fluorescence (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Strong and vague 5-ALA-induced fluorescence enables visualization of intratumoral areas with specific histopathological features and thus supports neurosurgeons in improving the extent of resection in patients with a newly diagnosed GBM. Despite the lack of fluorescence, tumor tissue was still observed in approximately half of the cases. To overcome this current limitation, the promising approach of complementary spectroscopic measurement of fluorescence should be investigated further.",Remaining,0,0

This paper presents preliminary prevalence data from the database which were analysed by age, sex, degree of handicap and geographical region. Comparisons are drawn with the findings of two previous censuses which are conducted in Ireland in 1974 and 1981 and implications for future service provision are discussed.",Remaining,0,0
345,31715440,Drug and alcohol dependence,Long-term naturalistic follow-up of chronic pain in adults with prescription opioid use disorder.,"Chronic pain is common in patients with prescription opioid use disorder (OUD), and pain severity has been shown to predict opioid use for those with chronic pain. However, recent research suggests that focusing on pain status (i.e., the presence or absence of chronic pain) at treatment initiation may not reflect the clinical significance of pain over the long-term course of OUD. Reports of variability in chronic pain and its clinical significance over time have yet to be investigated in patients with prescription OUD. The present study examined variability in chronic pain status from entry into prescription OUD treatment through 3.5-year follow-up. Additionally, we examined the association between concurrent chronic pain and opioid use at three follow-up time points.	This secondary analysis (N = 309) of a national, randomized, controlled trial of prescription OUD treatment used generalized estimating equations to assess variability in the prevalence of chronic pain from study entry to 3.5-year follow-up, and the association between chronic pain status and concurrent opioid use.	Fifty-three percent of participants reported variability in chronic pain status over time. The prevalence of chronic pain decreased from study entry through follow-up (aOR = 0.47, p < 0.001). Chronic pain was associated with increased opioid use at each follow-up assessment (aOR = 3.56, p < 0.001).	Chronic pain status may vary over time in those with prescription OUD, and chronic pain appears to be associated with concurrent opioid use. The present findings highlight the importance of assessing chronic pain throughout the course of prescription OUD.",Remaining,0,0

Six patients were also examined post mortem, MSA being confirmed in four and excluded in two (Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy). Clinical examination showed the following abnormalities; excessive square wave jerks--21 of 30 patients; mild vertical supranuclear gaze palsy--8 of 30; gaze-evoked nystagmus--12 of 30 patients, three of whom had no extraocular evidence of cerebellar dysfunction; positioning downbeat nystagmus--10 of 25; mild or moderate saccadic hypometria--22 of 30; impaired ('broken up') smooth pursuit--28 of 30; reduced VOR suppression--16 of 24. Electro-oculography and caloric testing did not add significant extra information. In patients presenting with an akinetic-rigid syndrome it can be difficult to differentiate idiopathic Parkinson's disease from MSA-P and other causes of atypical parkinsonism. Our findings suggest that the presence of excessive square wave jerks, mild-moderate hypometria of saccades, impaired VOR suppression, spontaneous nystagmus or positioning downbeat nystagmus may be oculomotor 'red flags' or clues to the presence of MSA. Further, the presence of clinically slow saccades, or moderate-to-severe gaze restriction, suggests a diagnosis other than MSA.",Remaining,0,0
347,15926646,Journal of the National Medical Association,The prevalence of cognitive impairment among African-American patients with congestive heart failure.,"This cross-sectional study sought to determine the prevalence of cognitive impairment among African-American patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). We studied 100 African-American CHF patients (aged 55-87 years) in New York Heart Association classes II-IV, who are enrolled in an ongoing, randomized, controlled trial, evaluating the effectiveness of a telemonitoring intervention to improve access to ambulatory care for heart failure patients. These CHF patients were recruited from an inner-city practice, rural physician practices and an urban physician practice in Atlanta. The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used to measure cognition. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MMSE score of less than 24. The crude prevalence of cognitive impairment was 10% in this population of African Americans with CHF. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated an increase in odds of cognitive impairment with increasing age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10 and 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.20; p=0.042]. There was no significant relationship between cognitive impairment and gender, education status, depression and severity of CHF. This study indicates that cognitive impairment is relatively prevalent among African Americans with CHF, but lower than previously reported among Caucasians with CHF.",Remaining,0,0
348,25660618,Neuroscience letters,An evaluation of association between common variants in C4BPB/C4BPA genes and schizophrenia.,"Epidemiological studies have indicated that both maternal bacterial and viral infections during pregnancy increase the risk of schizophrenia among offspring, but to date there is not clear explanation for this increased risk. Previously, the decreased C4b-binding protein (C4BP), a potent circulating soluble inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathways of complement, was reported to be associated with risk of schizophrenia. Here, we analyzed 4 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of C4BPB and 5 SNPs of C4BPA in a group of 556 schizophrenia patients and a matched group of 610 healthy controls to see if the genes C4BPB and C4BPA, which encode C4BP, may confer a susceptibility to schizophrenia. Comparing the genotype and allele frequencies of those SNPs between cases and controls, we found no association between the C4BPB/C4BPA variants and schizophrenia. Our results provided preliminary evidence that C4BPB/C4BPA may not confer susceptibility to schizophrenia among Han Chinese. Further genetic studies from large-scale population are required to obtain more conclusive results.",Remaining,0,0
349,9460801,Psychiatric genetics,Physical mapping of a glutamate receptor gene in relation to a balanced translocation associated with schizophrenia in a large Scottish family.,"The metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5a (mGluR5a) gene has been localised on the Gene Map of the Human Genome to chromosome 11q, approximately 1 cM from the genetic marker D11S931. D11S931 has been shown to lie close to a translocation breakpoint associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders in a large Scottish family. Because glutamate receptor genes are excellent candidates for psychiatric disorders, we have investigated the physical distance of this gene from the translocation breakpoint on chromosome 11. We have shown that the mGluR5a gene lies at least 850 kb from the breakpoint and, hence, cannot be directly disrupted in translocation carriers. However, a long range position effect of the translocation on this gene, or co-segregation of the translocation with a mutant allele of mGluR5a cannot be ruled out.",Remaining,0,0

This study aims to compare SBIs, deep white matter lesions (DWMLs), and periventricular white matter lesions (PWMLs) in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres to internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, and investigate their association with stenosis grade in patients with asymptomatic ≥ 50% unilateral extracranial ICA stenosis. Patients without previous history of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack who had ≥ 50% stenosis in unilateral ICA on carotid color Doppler ultrasound were enrolled in the study. Patient demographics, vascular risk factors and ICA stenosis grades; number, location, and size of SBIs, DWMLs, and PWMLs in ICA territory were evaluated in both hemispheres using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Of the 69 patients, 53 had 50-69% (76.8%) and 16 had ≥ 70% (23.2%) unilateral ICA stenosis. There was no statistically significant difference in SBIs between ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres to ≥ 50% ICA stenosis. Comparison of ICA stenoses as 50-69% and ≥ 70% revealed a greater number of patients with SBI in ipsilateral hemisphere to ≥ 70% stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.025). The number of SBIs was also higher in ipsilateral hemisphere to ≥ 70% stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.022). While DWMLs and PWMLs did not differ between hemispheres, frequency of Fazekas grade 1 DWMLs was lower in ipsilateral hemisphere to either 50-69% or ≥ 70% ICA stenosis compared to contralateral (p = 0.035 and p = 0.025, respectively). Results of the present study indicate that stenosis grade may be relevant in the association between asymptomatic carotid stenosis and SBIs, and ≥ 70% stenosis may pose a risk of SBI development.",Remaining,0,0

Sleep assessment was conducted using an actigraph for three consecutive days. The participants were asked to record their sleep behaviors and activities over these 3 days, and complete two questionnaires (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS] and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]). As compared to the mothers of term infants, the sleep efficiency in the preterm mothers was significantly lower than that in the term mothers. The total sleep time was shorter and nighttime awakenings were more frequent in the preterm mothers at 2 weeks after childbirth, but without a significant difference. We analyzed the changes in the sleep data of the mothers of preterm infants longitudinally, including sleep behaviors and the EPDS and PSQI scores. The total sleep time at 1 month postpartum was shorter than that at other periods, and significantly shorter than that at 2 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Our results suggested that sleep problems tended to last longer in mothers of preterm infants than in mothers of term infants, as the problems occurred twice, immediately after childbirth and immediately after discharge.",Remaining,0,0
352,36916904,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Expanding the Phenotypic Spectrum of Kenny-Caffey Syndrome.,"Kenny-Caffey syndrome (KCS) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by short stature, hypoparathyroidism, and electrolyte disturbances. KCS1 and KCS2 are caused by pathogenic variants in TBCE and FAM111A, respectively. Clinically the phenotypes are difficult to distinguish.	The objective was to determine and expand the phenotypic spectrum of KCS1 and KCS2 in order to anticipate complications that may arise in these disorders.	We clinically and genetically analyzed 10 KCS2 patients from 7 families. Because we found unusual phenotypes in our cohort, we performed a systematic review of genetically confirmed KCS cases using PubMed and Scopus. Evaluation by 3 researchers led to the inclusion of 26 papers for KCS1 and 16 for KCS2, totaling 205 patients. Data were extracted following the Cochrane guidelines and assessed by 2 independent researchers.	Several patients in our KCS2 cohort presented with intellectual disability (3/10) and chronic kidney disease (6/10), which are not considered common findings in KCS2. Systematic review of all reported KCS cases showed that the phenotypes of KCS1 and KCS2 overlap for postnatal growth retardation (KCS1: 52/52, KCS2: 23/23), low parathyroid hormone levels (121/121, 16/20), electrolyte disturbances (139/139, 24/27), dental abnormalities (47/50, 15/16), ocular abnormalities (57/60, 22/23), and seizures/spasms (103/115, 13/16). Symptoms more prevalent in KCS1 included intellectual disability (74/80, 5/24), whereas in KCS2 bone cortical thickening (1/18, 16/20) and medullary stenosis (7/46, 27/28) were more common.	Our case series established chronic kidney disease as a new feature of KCS2. In the literature, we found substantial overlap in the phenotypic spectra of KCS1 and KCS2, but identified intellectual disability and the abnormal bone phenotype as the most distinguishing features.",Remaining,0,0

Thirty-two patients (mean age 47 years) with histologically proven or suspected high grade glioma (n = 12) or metastatic brain lesions (n = 20) were prospectively examined by MR imaging. After the administration of gadolinium dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) the lesions were imaged with a T1-weighted MT-fast low angle shot (FLASH) pulse sequence and with a conventional T1-weighted SE sequence without MT saturation.	The mean CNR of enhancing lesions on T1-weighted MT-FLASH was 15 +/- 5 compared to 11 +/- 4 on SE images, representing a significant (p < .01) improvement. The mean tumor diameter of malignant gliomas was significantly (p < .01) larger measured on T1-weighted MT-FLASH images compared to those obtained from T1-weighted SE images and were comparable for metastatic lesions. Lesion conspicuity and delineation were improved in 50% of patients with high grade gliomas and in 35% of patients with brain metastases. Lesion conspicuity was markedly improved in the posterior fossa. Additional contrast enhancing lesions were detected in 10% of patients with metastases on MT-FLASH images.	It is concluded that contrast-enhanced MT-FLASH images may improve lesion detection and delineation in the planning process of radiosurgery in patients with intracranial high grade gliomas or metastases or even alter the treatment approach.",Remaining,0,0
354,2018095,American journal of medical genetics,Cognitive profiles of the carrier fragile X woman.,"Cognitive deficits in females with fragile X [fra(X)] syndrome have been reported, but studies have rarely focused on women with normal intelligence, nor have they separated fra(X)-negative carriers from fra(X)-positive carriers. Questions specifically addressed here are: 1) is the degree of fragility predictive of IQ? 2) are cognitive patterns consistent across fragility levels? and 3) do consistent individual profiles exist? These questions were addressed with the help of 74 heterozygous women, 38 of whom were fra(X)-negative carriers. All women completed the WAIS-R, and full-scale IQ was normally distributed (mean = 99.65). A strong inverse relationship between IQ and fragility levels was found. Also, the group of fra(X)-positive women had a significantly different subtest pattern from that of the fra(X)-negative women. However, when results were analyzed individually, no consistent patterns emerged. The cognitive performance of fra(X)-negative carriers has probably been underestimated due to the lack of differentiation between positive and negative carrier females in previous studies. These women appear to be cognitively unimpaired and should be considered separately from fra(X)-positive women. Since consistent WAIS-R patterns are not observable on an individual basis, their use as a diagnostic/predictive tool appears to be inappropriate.",Remaining,0,0
355,33860704,Aging & mental health,Medical help-seeking intentions for cognitive impairment by the patient.,"Objectives: Older adults represent one of the fastest growing population groups. As the aged population increases, incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias will also increase. Professionals agree that early intervention is essential for therapeutic and quality of life purposes; however, many older adults wait several months or years to seek medical help after first noticing signs of cognitive impairment. The present study sought to identify the predictors of help-seeking for cognitive impairment by an individual for him/herself after the first detection of symptoms.Method: An online survey was administered to adults (N = 250) 50 years old and older. Individuals responded about their help-seeking intentions in response to a hypothetical vignette depicting symptoms of cognitive decline derived from a similar study with caregivers conducted by Qualls and colleagues. Additional standardized measures measuring constructs such as knowledge of Alzheimer's disease were completed.Results: The present study reveals that cognitive (i.e. symptom identification and disease attribution) and affective (i.e. symptom impact and threat appraisal) factors, as well as an interaction between the two, are predictive of help-seeking intentions with excellent model fit.Conclusion: Help-seeking intentions by individuals with possible cognitive impairment are comparable to those of potential caregivers. Contrary to hypotheses, high threat appraisal positively predicted help-seeking intentions despite the expectation that threat-induced fear would lead to avoidance. Recommendations are made for future research to further investigate both patients' help-seeking intentions and actions in response to signs of cognitive impairment.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1910791 .",Remaining,0,0
356,17441009,Aggressive behavior,Insight into illness and adherence to psychotropic medications are separately associated with violence severity in a forensic sample.,"Violence towards others by a minority of psychotic individuals is a significant public health concern. The severity of this other-directed violence (ODV) in the community may be influenced by insight into illness and adherence to psychotropic medications; however, few studies have tested these associations. Sixty male psychotic inpatients, legally detained at a forensic unit in New York City, were assessed with semi-structured interviews, supplemented with information from hospital and official records, family members and the treating clinician. Results indicated that in this unique sample of detained persons with psychotic disorders; (1) increase in the severity of community violence is associated with medication non-adherence, all dimensions of poor insight into illness, and several previously reported covariates such as substance use comorbidity; (2) no relationship was found between insight and adherence in this particular sample; (3) multivariate analyses showed that select covariates, along with medication adherence, and select insight domains predicted a total of 73% of the magnitude of ODV behavior in this sample. Overall, medication non-adherence explained a large amount of how violently participants behaved toward others. Since non-adherence was independent of poor insight, it may be more worthwhile for clinicians to develop treatment strategies to target medication adherence without directly addressing an elusive target such as insight into illness. Treatment addressing medication adherence needs to concomitantly target substance use behaviors since the latter was responsible for a substantial increase in ODV.",Remaining,0,0

The aim of this study was to investigate the current state and estimated need for ECT in forensic psychiatry in Germany.	A questionnaire was designed consisting of questions about the current practice and estimated need for ECT in this population. This questionnaire was sent electronically (and by post if needed) to the forensic psychiatric hospitals in Germany.	We received replies from 52 hospitals (66%) and 29 of these hospitals stated that they were capable of treating patients with ECT. An indication for ECT treatment was seen in 3.4% of all detained patients across all forensic hospitals. In 1 year (2018) 32 ECT treatment courses were carried out with on average good effectiveness and a mean clinical global impressions (CGI) scale of 2.32. The most frequent reason for not using ECT was lack of structural requirements. Approximately one third of the forensic psychiatric hospitals stated that there was a medium or even high need for ECT in forensic psychiatry.	The use of ECT in German forensic psychiatry is currently very limited. It is striking that the number of applied ECT treatments is eight times lower in comparison to the frequency of indications. Nevertheless, approximately two thirds of the forensic hospitals stated a medium or high need for ECT, which seems to suggest a shortage of ECT in the treatment of forensic psychiatry patients.	HINTERGRUND UND ZIEL DER ARBEIT: Für die Elektrokonvulsionstherapie (EKT) liegen Leitlinienempfehlungen zur Behandlung schwerer affektiver und psychotischer Erkrankungen vor, wie sie auch bei Patienten im Maßregelvollzug (MRV) vorkommen.

Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist eine Erhebung des Ist-Zustands sowie des geschätzten Bedarfs an EKT im MRV.	Es wurde ein Fragebogen zur Erhebung der aktuellen Anwendung sowie der Einschätzung des Bedarfs an EKT in dieser Population entwickelt. Dieser wurde elektronisch und bei Bedarf postalisch an die forensischen Kliniken in Deutschland versendet.	Wir erhielten Antwort von 52 Kliniken (66 %). 29 der Kliniken gaben an, Patienten mit EKT behandeln zu können.

361,29039020,Molecular neurobiology,Systemic Inflammation and Multimodal Biomarkers in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,"There is increasing evidence suggesting that one of the most relevant pathophysiological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuroinflammation, which plays an important role in the production and regulation of AD-related proteins (amyloid beta (Aβ) and Tau) and exacerbates AD pathology. Neuroinflammation can also be induced by systemic influences (factors from outside the central nervous system). However, the role of systemic inflammation in AD pathophysiology is much less understood. Thus, our main objective in this study was to verify whether the presence of serum cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α) affects different AD biomarkers: Aβ1-42 and Tau protein levels, hippocampal volumes (HV), and default mode network functional connectivity (DMN FC) in healthy elderly controls, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients due to AD, and mild AD patients. To accomplish this, we acquired 3-T MRI, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 42 healthy controls, 55 aMCI patients due to AD, and 33 mild AD patients. Comparing the groups, we found that the mild AD patients presented smaller HV, disrupted DMN FC, and proportionally less IL-1β than the controls. The aMCI patients only differed from the controls in DMN FC. In intra-group comparison, aMCI and mild AD with detectable levels of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-12) had decreased DMN FC. On the other hand, patients with detectable levels of IL-10 and IL-12 presented a more favorable AD biomarkers profile (larger HV, more CSF Aβ1-42, and less p-Tau), indicating a possible protective role of these ILs. Our findings indicate a possible relationship between systemic inflammation with DMN FC disruption, hippocampal atrophy, and CSF protein levels in the subjects with mild AD and aMCI.",Remaining,0,0

A data-base of parent report of sleep problems of children with autism (N=55), ranging from 5 to 12 years of age (M=8.2 years) was evaluated. Results suggested that fewer hours of sleep per night predicted overall autism scores and social skills deficits. Similarly, stereotypic behavior was predicted by fewer hours of sleep per night and screaming during the night. Increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli in the bedroom and screaming at night predicted communication problems. Finally, sensitivity to environmental stimuli in the bedroom also predicted fewer developmental sequence disturbances.

366,7771669,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",The Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale: a self-rated instrument for the quantification of thoughts about alcohol and drinking behavior.,"It has been suggested that a crucial dimension of alcohol 'craving' includes the concept of both obsessive thoughts about alcohol use and compulsive behaviors toward drinking. An interview-based rating scale, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-heavy drinkers (YBOCS-hd), has been found useful in quantifying this concept in alcohol-dependent individuals. A self-rating scale, the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) has been developed by us as a modification of the YBOCS-hd. The YBOCS-hd showed excellent interrater reliability in our hands. The correlation between the YBOCS-hd and the OCDS total scores obtained on 60 alcohol-dependent individuals was 0.83. The test-retest correlation for the OCDS total score was 0.96, and the obsessive and compulsive subscales test-retest correlations were 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. The internal consistency of the items in the OCDS was high (0.86) and did not improve significantly with removal of individual items. The shared variance between the OCDS scores and alcohol consumption during the period of evaluation was only approximately 20%, indicating that the dimension measured by the scale was somewhat independent of actual drinking. As such, it might act as an independent measure of the 'state of illness' for alcohol-dependent individuals. When used during a prospective 12-week treatment research study, initial results indicate that the OCDS seems to validly measure a dimension of alcohol dependence, because it decreased from baseline during alcohol reduction and increased in relationship to relapse drinking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Remaining,0,0

Latent class analyses were used to characterize polysubstance abuse/dependence (AB/D) in 43 093 individuals who participated in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the association between the classes of life-time illicit drug AB/D and gender, age and race, as well as life-time Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV) alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia and antisocial personality disorder.	Five latent classes were identified: no AB/D (class 1: 92.5%), cannabis AB/D only (class 2: 5.8%), stimulants + hallucinogen AB/D (class 3: 0.6%), prescription drug AB/D (class 4: 0.6%) and polysubstance AB/D (class 5: 0.5%). Major depressive disorder and nicotine dependence were associated most strongly with class 5. Anxiety disorders were associated strongly with the prescription drug AB/D class while alcohol AB/D and ASPD were associated with classes 2, 3, 4 and 5 when compared to the reference class (class 1).

369,30079883,Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs,The Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index for Adolescent Alcohol and Drug Problems: A Comprehensive Modern Psychometric Study.,"The Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI) has been used extensively as a measure of alcohol-related problems experienced by adolescents and young adults. The present study aimed to comprehensively examine the psychometric profile and criterion-related validity of an 18-item RAPI adapted to measure negative consequences resulting from alcohol and other drug use in an at-risk adolescent population.	Categorical confirmatory factor analysis and the graded response model were used for evaluations of the latent factor structure, item properties, test information, and item invariance across gender, age groups (middle vs. late adolescence), and drug use profiles (readily available drugs vs. other illicit drugs), as well as computation of the item response theory scale scores for each of 617 alternative high school students (44% female).	A reduced set of 16 RAPI items provided plausible evidence of unidimensionality and good measurement precision at a relatively wide range of the latent trait continuum. All but two items were invariant across the drug use profiles. The other illicit drug group had higher levels of the latent substance-related problems than the readily available drug group. Criterion-related validity was supported using a measure of past-year polysubstance use.	The RAPI can be effectively modified to measure negative consequences resulting from alcohol and other drug use and reflects a sufficiently wide range of the latent continuum of problem use.",Remaining,0,0
370,32000208,Professional case management,The Montreal Cognitive Test Intervention: The Relationship Between Cognitive-Impaired Patients and Readmissions.,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between cognitive impairment among Medicare patients and hospital readmissions. Although there has been research on cognitive impairment and readmissions, seldom action has been done in regard to economic costs with hospitals. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) established the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program in 2012. Hospitals may not be fully reimbursed for Medicare patient readmissions within 30 days ().	An ethnographic approach was utilized with purposive sampling.This was a nonrandomized purposive sampling intervention study using data from Epic health systems database.	The intervention spanned over 5 months and the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) intervention was conducted in the hospital in a 3-phase study. The purpose of the study was for quality improvement and to detect cognitive impairment among Medicare readmitted patients.	The result shows cognitive impairment is prevalent among the Medicare population. Seventy-one (61%) had evidence of cognitive impairment (i.e., obtained a score below 25). The mean MoCA score for the 71 patients identified as having evidence of cognitive impairment was 17.84 (SD, ±5.06; range, 5-24). MoCA is useful in the acute care setting for identifying patients who are at increased risk for readmission. A randomly assigned controlled clinical trial test is warranted to further validate the association between cognitive impairment and readmissions.	The ACA aims to improve case management by improving effective outcomes for individuals, care coordination among hospital professionals, economic efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and the collaborative process that services the patient. Hospitals across the country are implementing polices that adhere to patient-centered care. Before the ACA was passed, health care services were value metric. The ACA regulates hospitals toward holistic care or quality metrics. Case management will be critical, as hospitals look toward innovative methods to evaluate their patients.",Remaining,0,0
371,35922871,Alzheimer's research & therapy,Inflammatory plasma biomarkers in subjects with preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"This study investigated plasma biomarkers for neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in subjects with preclinical AD compared to healthy elderly. How these biomarkers behave in patients with AD, compared to healthy elderly is well known, but determining these in subjects with preclinical AD is not and will add information related to the onset of AD. When found to be different in preclinical AD, these inflammatory biomarkers may be used to select preclinical AD subjects who are most likely to develop AD, to participate in clinical trials with new disease-modifying drugs.	Healthy elderly (n= 50; age 71.9; MMSE >24) and subjects with preclinical AD (n=50; age 73.4; MMSE >24) defined by CSF Aβ1-42 levels < 1000 pg/mL were included. Four neuroinflammatory biomarkers were determined in plasma, GFAP, YKL-40, MCP-1, and eotaxin-1. Differences in biomarker outcomes were compared using ANCOVA. Subject characteristics age, gender, and APOE ε4 status were reported per group and were covariates in the ANCOVA. Least square means were calculated for all 4 inflammatory biomarkers using both the Aβ+/Aβ- cutoff and Ptau/Aβ1-42 ratio.	The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of the subjects (n=100) was 72.6 (4.6) years old with 62 male and 38 female subjects. Mean (SD) overall MMSE score was 28.7 (0.49) and 32 subjects were APOE ε4 carriers. The number of subjects in the different APOE ε4 status categories differed significantly between the Aβ+ and Aβ- groups. Plasma GFAP concentration was significantly higher in the Aβ+ group compared to the Aβ- group with significant covariates age and sex, variables that also correlated significantly with GFAP.	GFAP was significantly higher in subjects with preclinical AD compared to healthy elderly which agrees with previous studies. When defining preclinical AD based on the Ptau181/Aβ1-42 ratio, YKL-40 was also significantly different between groups. This could indicate that GFAP and YKL-40 are more sensitive markers of the inflammatory process in response to the Aβ misfolding and aggregation that is ongoing as indicated by the lowered Aβ1-42 levels in the CSF. Characterizing subjects with preclinical AD using neuroinflammatory biomarkers is important for subject selection in new disease-modifying clinical trials.

373,19734013,Schizophrenia research,The impact of context processing deficits on task-switching performance in schizophrenia.,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been described as important for maintaining and implementing contextual information in the service of goal-oriented behavior. Accordingly, impairments in context processing are thought to underlie cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, a clinical disorder that has been linked to PFC dysfunction (Servan-Schreiber et al., 1996). However, task switching, a cognitive ability linked to PFC function, has not been consistently impaired in schizophrenia. In this experiment, we assessed whether task-switching performance would be selectively impaired for patients when context demands were high. In the rule-switching condition, a switch required the updating of the relevant task response rules whereas perceptual switching did not entail a switching of contextual information. Instead, a perceptual switch entailed a shift of visuospatial attention to the relevant feature. A second goal was to determine whether potential deficits in context switching would be observed in schizophrenia even in situations when these patients do not need to overcome a prepotent response. Studies of context processing have typically required patients with schizophrenia to use contextual rules to overcome prepotent response tendencies whereas our switching paradigm did not require the inhibition of a competing response. Patients were much slower to switch tasks than controls when contextual rules switched from one trial to the next whereas their performance was intact when the switch occurred between different feature sets and contextual demands were low. Our results demonstrate that context processing deficits are observable in schizophrenia even when there is no prepotent response tendency to inhibit. Moreover, our results suggest that PFC impairments influence performance primarily when patients are required to switch the application of one explicit rule to another.",Remaining,0,0

The aim of this study was to investigate whether sex affected cortical thinning in the disease progression of AD.	We prospectively recruited 36 patients with early-stage AD and 14 people with normal cognition. All subjects were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, Year 1, Year 3, and Year 5. We performed cortical thickness analyses using surface-based morphometry on magnetic resonance imaging.	Women with AD showed more rapid cortical thinning in the left dorsolateral frontal cortex, left superior temporal gyrus, bilateral temporo-parietal association cortices, bilateral anterior cingulate gyri, bilateral medial frontal cortices, and bilateral occipital cortices over 5 years than men with AD, even though there was no difference in cortical thickness at baseline. In contrast, there were no regions of significantly more rapid atrophy in men with AD.	Our findings suggest that women deteriorate faster than men in the progression of AD.",Remaining,0,0
375,33764656,Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,Age differences in broader autism phenotype traits from young adulthood to older adulthood.,"Much of past research has been dedicated to refining the operationalization and correlates of the broader autism phenotype (BAP) and less on how the BAP differs by socio-demographic characteristics, like age-particularly after midlife. This gap is important because other nonclinical trait-like characteristics (e.g., personality) have shown considerable age differences, leading to work assessing the malleability of psychological characteristics and improving outcomes for individuals and their significant others. In the current study, we examined cross-sectional age differences in the BAP in a large sample of adults ranging in age from 18 to 85. We recruited a sample of 2966 adults ranging in age from 18 to 85 (Mage = 36.53, SD = 12.61; 58.9% Female; 1.1% with an ASD diagnosis) recruited from an online survey service. We found that total BAP scores were higher in younger adults and lower among older adults. These differences were particularly true for pragmatic language difficulties, with this component of the BAP showing the most dramatic age differences. Aloofness showed similar negative associations with age, albeit much smaller. Rigidity was not significantly associated with age. The results are consistent with other research showing an abatement of symptoms among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) across early life and theories predicting changes in other psychological characteristics (e.g., personality). The results are discussed in the context of the malleability of ASD and BAP traits across life, the clinical implications of these changes, and the origins and consequences for lifespan differences in BAP. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about how subclinical autistic-like traits among middle-aged and older adults compare to younger adults. We found that these subclinical traits were highest in young adults and lowest in older adults. Knowing how these traits differ by age can provide researchers and clinicians with a sense of how much these traits might change across life, if the traits might be sensitive to interventions, and when in development it might be best to intervene.",Remaining,0,0

In recent years, the role of prenatal exposure to testosterone has been emphasized in the development of the GD. The aim of this study was to compare the 2D:4D digit ratio, which is considered to be a morphological indicator of exposure to testosterone in the prenatal period, in individuals with GD.	The study included 99 participants diagnosed with GD comprising 54 assigned the female gender at birth [AFB-GD], 45 assigned the male gender at birth [AMB-GD], and 58 female and 58 male participants making up the control group. The right and the left hands of the participants were photocopied and finger lengths were measured using digital calipers.	The 2D:4D digit ratio on the right hand of the AFB-GD group was significantly lower (p=0.028) than that of the female controls, but it did not differ significantly as compared to male controls. The ratio on the left hand of the AFB-GD group did not significantly differ from that of the female controls, but it was higher than that of the male controls (p=0.045). The 2D:4D digit ratio on the right hand of the AMB-GD group did not differ significantly from that of the male controls, but they had a lower finger ratio as compared to the female controls (p<0.001). The ratio on the left hand of the AMB-GD group did not differ significantly from those of the male and female controls.

A cross-sectional study of IDU recruited from the streets by ex-IDU interviewers. A standardized and anonymous questionnaire which explored behaviors in the previous 6 months was used. Saliva samples were collected to determine human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence. Logistic regression models were used to identify determinants of accepting and passing on used syringes.	Of the 300 participants, 17.7% and 13.3% accepted and passed on used syringes, respectively. 74.8% practiced front-backloading (to prepare the drug solution in a syringe and then divide it up into other syringes) and 77.9% shared other equipment. The prevalence of HIV was 57.7%. The predictors of accepting used syringes were using more than 4 drugs (odds ratio [OR] = 5.6), having a positive hepatitis C virus status (OR = 7.3), practising front/backloading (OR = 12.6) and having an IDU steady partner (OR = 2.9); and with passing on used syringes were practicing front/backloading (OR = 4.9), having an IDU steady partner (OR = 5.8), and having sexual risk behaviors with casual partners (OR = 4.0). Starting to inject drugs older than 15 years of age was a protective factor (OR = 0.2).

380,12707046,The American journal of pathology,Microtubule reduction in Alzheimer's disease and aging is independent of tau filament formation.,"Biochemical studies show that phosphorylated tau, like that found in paired helical filaments (PHFs), does not promote microtubule assembly leading to the view that PHF formation leads to microtubule deficiency in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, although this issue is one of the most important aspects to further understanding the cell biology of AD, no quantitative examination of microtubule diminution in AD and its relationship with PHFs has been performed. To examine this issue directly, we undertook a morphometric study of brain biopsy specimens from AD and control cases. Ultrastructural analysis of neurons was performed to compare the microtubule assembly state in neurons of diseased and control cases and to examine the effect of PHF accumulation. We found that both number and total length of microtubules were significantly and selectively reduced in pyramidal neurons from AD in comparison to control cases (P = 0.000004) but that this decrement in microtubule density was surprisingly unrelated to PHFs (P = 0.8). Further, we found a significant age-dependent decrease in microtubule density with aging in the control cases (P = 0.016). These findings suggest that reduction in microtubule assembly is not dependent on tau abnormalities of AD and aging.",Remaining,0,0

Subjects were pathologically classified as high (n = 25), intermediate (n = 22), and low likelihood DLB (n = 9) according to the Third Report of the DLB Consortium criteria. We included 2 additional pathologic comparison groups without LBs: one with low likelihood Alzheimer disease (AD) (control; n = 27) and one with high likelihood AD (n = 33). The associations between MRI-based volumetric measurements and the pathologic classification of DLB were tested with analysis of covariance by adjusting for age, sex, and MRI-to-death interval.	Antemortem hippocampal and amygdalar volumes increased from low to intermediate to high likelihood DLB (p < 0.001, trend test). Smaller hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were associated with higher Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage (p < 0.001).

All zero-order correlations between six CBCL DSM-oriented scales (DOS) and three competence scales (CS) were negative and small-to-moderate. After implementing multiple regressions we found robust enough prediction only for ADH DOS on school CS, and for anxiety DOS on social CS. Results from the intrapair differences model indicated shared elements of liability, rather than direct causation, as more likely explanations for the negative phenotypic correlations between these emotional/behavioural problem and competencies scores.

A culture and education fair battery of cognitive tests was developed and validated for population based studies in low- and middle-income countries including India by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group.	We explored the machine learning methods based on the 10/66 battery of cognitive tests for the diagnosis of dementia based in a birth cohort study in South India.	The data sets for 466 men and women for this study were obtained from the on-going Mysore Studies of Natal effect of Health and Ageing (MYNAH), in south India. The data sets included: demographics, performance on the 10/66 cognitive function tests, the 10/66 diagnosis of mental disorders and population based normative data for the 10/66 battery of cognitive function tests. Diagnosis of dementia from the rule based approach was compared against the 10/66 diagnosis of dementia. We have applied machine learning techniques to identify minimal number of the 10/66 cognitive function tests required for diagnosing dementia and derived an algorithm to improve the accuracy of dementia diagnosis.	Of 466 subjects, 27 had 10/66 diagnosis of dementia, 19 of whom were correctly identified as having dementia by Jrip classification with 100% accuracy.	This pilot exploratory study indicates that machine learning methods can help identify community dwelling older adults with 10/66 criterion diagnosis of dementia with good accuracy in a LMIC setting such as India.

The study population consisted of persons testing for HIV in public settings in New York City during 2001 (n = 114,703). We applied a less sensitive enzyme immunoassay (LS-EIA) (Vironostika, BioMerieux, Durham, NC) to the diagnostic blood specimen of 1022 persons in whom HIV (non-AIDS) had been diagnosed for the first time in 2001. The distribution of transmission risk among HIV-negative persons--men who have sex with men (MSM), injection drug users (IDUs), heterosexuals-from a large telephone health survey was used to generate denominators for transmission risk groups.	The 1022 persons tested by the LS-EIA represented 27% of all persons in whom HIV (non-AIDS) had been diagnosed in New York City during 2001. The incidence of HIV was estimated to be 0.29% per year (95% CI: 0.20-0.38), and was significantly higher for men than women (rate ratio 3.6, 95% CI: 2.6-5.1), and HIV incidence increased with age.

Repeated resting-state MEG recordings and clinical assessments were obtained in the context of a unique longitudinal cohort study over a seven-year period using a multiple longitudinal design. We used linear mixed-models to analyze the relationship between neurophysiological (spectral power and functional connectivity) and clinical data. At baseline, early-stage (drug-naïve) PD patients demonstrated spectral slowing compared to healthy controls in both subcortical and cortical brain regions, most outspoken in the latter. Over time, spectral slowing progressed in strong association with clinical measures of disease progression (cognitive and motor). Global functional connectivity was not different between groups at baseline and hardly changed over time. Therefore, investigation of associations with clinical measures of disease progression were not deemed useful. An analysis of individual connections demonstrated differences between groups at baseline (higher frontal theta, lower parieto-occipital alpha2 band functional connectivity) and over time in PD patients (increase in frontal delta and theta band functional connectivity). Our results suggest that spectral measures are promising candidates in the search for non-invasive markers of both early-stage PD and of the ongoing disease process.",Remaining,0,0

In patients with Parkinson's disease, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the D allele, but there was no difference in the frequency of the alleles in familial compared to sporadic Parkinson's disease. The D and I-16 promoters direct higher NQO2 gene expression that results in higher enzyme activity. Overexpression of NQO2 in the catecholaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species when exposed to exogenous dopamine. The results suggest that the association of the D promoter with Parkinson's disease may be due to an increase in expression of the NQO2 gene.",Remaining,0,0

Measurement of the midsagittal areas of infratentorial structures disclosed progressive atrophy of the pontine base and cerebellum, which correlated significantly with age, whilst midbrain and pontine tegmentum showed atrophy with no significant progression, suggesting it was better identified as 'small size' and might have mostly been completed before the initial symptoms. Such differences between regions in atrophy progression must be caused by a difference in the neuropathological course.",Remaining,0,0

Seventeen patients with 21 carotid artery plaques received examinations with CEUS. According to the nature of the plaques, the patients were divided into soft and mixed plaque group and hard and calcified plaque group. The maximal enhancement intensity of the plaques (I(MAX)) and maximal plaque density (D(MAX)) were measured to quantify the neovasculature. The patients also underwent concurrent ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT, and ¹⁸F-FDG uptake was quantified by the mean standard uptake values (SUV(mean)), an index reflecting the inflammatory activity in the plaque. The findings in CEUS and PET/CT were comparatively analyzed for these cases.	The D(MAX) of the plaque in soft and mixed plaque group was significantly greater than that in hard and calcified plaque group (4.26±3.65 vs 1.41±1.47, P<0.05); the I(MAX) was also greater in the former group, but this difference was not statistically significant (26.83±19.61 vs 24.73±29.85, P=0.869). The soft and mixed plaques tended to have higher SUVmean than the hard and calcified plaques (1.70±0.45 vs 1.47±0.12, P=0.099). The values of I(MAX) and D(MAX) were not found to correlate to SUV(mean) in these patients.	CEUS can sensitively show the status of neovascularization within the carotid atherosclerosis plaques, and PET/CT reflects the inflammatory activity in the plaques. The combination of these two imaging modalities allows the evaluation of plaque stability in terms of neoangiogenesis and inflammatory activity.",Remaining,0,0

In 2005, 47 laboratory-confirmed and probable clinical cases of SLEV infection were reported in Córdoba, Argentina. Although the causes of 2005 outbreak remain unknown, they might be related not only to virological factors, but also to ecological and environmental conditions. We hypothesized that one of the factors for SLE reemergence in Córdoba, Argentina, was the introduction of a new SLEV genotype (SLEV genotype III), with no previous activity in the area. In order to evaluate this hypothesis we carried out a molecular characterization of SLEV detections from mosquitoes collected between 2001 and 2004 in Córdoba city. A total of 315 mosquito pools (11,002 individuals) including 12 mosquitoes species were analyzed. Overall, 20 pools (8 mosquitoes species) were positive for SLEV. During this study, genotypes II, V and VII were detected. No mosquito pool infected with genotype III was detected before the 2005 outbreak. Genotype V was found every year and in the 8 sampled sites. Genotypes II and VII showed limited temporal and spatial activities. We cannot dismiss the association of genotype II and V as etiological agents during the outbreak. However, the silent circulation of other SLEV strains in Córdoba city before the 2005 outbreak suggests that the introduction of genotype III was an important factor associated to this event. Not mutually exclusive, other factors such as changes in avian hosts and mosquitoes vectors communities, driven by climatic and environmental modifications, should also be taken into consideration in further studies.",Remaining,0,0

396,35193083,Drug and alcohol dependence,Fathers' alcohol consumption and risk of substance-related disorders in offspring.,"Few studies have assessed how children are affected by parental alcohol consumption without clinically diagnosed alcohol problems, especially in relation to more long-term and severe consequences. The aim is to investigate how fathers' alcohol use is related to the risk for substance-related disorders in offspring.	A prospective cohort study of 64 710 Swedish citizens whose fathers were conscripted for compulsory military training at ages 18-20 in 1969/70. Information on fathers' alcohol consumption, frequency of intoxication and apprehended for drunkenness, was collected during conscription. Offspring was followed for substance-related disorders from age 12 to end of follow up in 2009.	All measures of fathers' alcohol use were significantly and positively associated with risk for substance-related disorders in offspring. The associations were to a large extent explained by other risk factors in childhood. In the fully adjusted model, those with fathers in the highest alcohol consumption quintile still had a 63% higher risk (HR=1.63 CI 1.26-2.12) of substance-related disorders compared to those whose fathers' reported abstinence. The highest risk was found among offspring to fathers with alcohol-related disorders or that had been apprehended for drunkenness, with a more than two-fold increased risk for substance-related disorders.	Despite the lower risk found among offspring to fathers with sub-clinical drinking when compared to those with alcohol-related disorders, the former group accounts for a much larger proportion of all cases of substance-related disorders in the population, prompting universal prevention efforts targeting the level of total alcohol consumption in society.",Remaining,0,0

The authors undertook a study of cerebral hemodynamic changes while the plateau waves were observed in five brain-tumor patients. Although the number of cases studied was small, a remarkable decrease in cerebrovascular resistance was seen in all patients during the plateau waves. It is suggested that the plateau waves are caused by a marked cerebral vasodilatation. The present results support the thesis that cerebral blood volume is increased during the plateau waves. The plateau waves are closely related to the intrinsic vasomotor control of cerebral circulation, and can occur as long as cerebral vasodilating ability is maintained, irrespective of the existence of cerebral autoregulation.",Remaining,0,0

We conducted an online survey of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender individuals to examine sexual behaviors and HIV/syphilis testing in China.	We recruited MSM and transgender individuals from 2 major Chinese lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Web platforms. χ Test and logistic regression were used to compare risk behaviors, HIV and syphilis testing history, and prevalence between transgender individuals and other MSM.	Among the 1320 participants, 52 (3.9%) self-identified as transgender. Demographics, including education, employment, and marital status, were similar between both groups, whereas transgender individuals were older. Condomless anal intercourse rate was comparable between the groups. Transgender individuals were less likely to report ever testing for HIV (34.6% vs. 62.0%) and syphilis (15.7% vs. 31.2%) with adjusted odds ratios of 0.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.65) and 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.91), respectively. We found a trend toward a higher HIV prevalence among transgender individuals (11.1% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.12).	Transgender individuals have suboptimal HIV and syphilis testing rates in China. Given the substantial risk behaviors and burden of HIV/STI in the general Chinese MSM population and a lack of knowledge about transgender individuals, enhanced HIV/syphilis testing programs for transgender individuals in China are needed.",Remaining,0,0

An eight year follow-up study.,"The objective of this study was to report changes in characteristics of admissions to an established Psychiatric Emergency Care Centre (PECC) eight years after its opening.	Key clinical characteristics of admissions to the PECC were documented for 327 patients in 2015 and compared with the 477 patients in 2007, which is when the centre first opened. The characteristics of admission were evaluated using an audit of medical records from June to December in both 2007 and 2015.	Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) between 2007 and 2015 were: a reduction in the numbers of patients admitted with depression; a reduction in the numbers of patients diagnosed with adjustment disorder; an increase in the numbers of patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder; a reduction in pro re nata (prn) use, including a reduction in the need for chemical restraint with midazolam and a decrease in the length of admission in the PECC.	The significant reduction in aggression, the use of prn medication and the number of people with longer stays within the PECC support the usefulness of PECCs in relation to patient satisfaction and adherence to admission criteria policy.

The signs of involvement of the medulla, of the cauda equina, and those which complicate the basilar impressions usually develop in a progressive and not very spectacular fashion. Nevertheless, they should be recognized as soon as possible so that therapeutic measures may be taken.

We hypothesized that the parenchymal abnormality on CTASI in faster scanners would overestimate ischemic core.	This prospective study assessed the correlation of Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on NCCT, CTASI, and computed tomography perfusion (CTP) with final infarct size in patients within 8 hours of AIS. Follow-up with NCCT or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 24 hours. Correlations of NCCT and CTASI with final infarct size and with CTP parameters were assessed. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients who underwent intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Inter-rater reliability was tested using Spearman's rank correlation. A P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.	A total of 105 patients were included in the final analysis. NCCT had a stronger correlation with the final infarct size than did CTASI (Spearman's ρ = .85 versus .78, P = .13). We found an overestimation of the final infarct size by CTASI in 47.6% of the cases, whereas NCCT underestimated infarct size in 60% of the patients. NCCT correlated most strongly with CBV (ρ = .93), whereas CTASI correlated most strongly with CBF (ρ = .87). Subgroup analysis showed less correlation of CTASI with final infarct size in the group that received thrombolysis versus the group that did not (ρ = .70 versus .88, P = .01).	In a 256-slice scanner, the CTASI parenchymal abnormality includes ischemic penumbra and thus overestimates final infarct size-this could result in inappropriate exclusion of patients from thrombolysis or thrombectomy.",Remaining,0,0

More than one in ten (9.2% of the males and 13.1% of the females) had abnormal eating attitude scores. Chi-square analysis revealed that there were no significant differences in the prevalance of abnormal eating behaviors based on gender. Analysis of covariance indicated that participants who had disturbed eating attitudes had lower self-esteem, higher social physique anxiety, and higher trait anxiety than those who had normal eating attitudes. It was concluded that the prevalence of disturbed eating attitudes was high among these Turkish late adolescents, and that disturbed eating attitudes were related to several psychological characteristics.",Remaining,0,0

Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",High-resolution joint symbolic analysis to enhance classification of the cardiorespiratory system in patients with schizophrenia and their relatives.,"Schizophrenia as a mental illness is one of the most serious in the world. Patients with schizophrenia have an increased cardiac mortality rate, but the reasons for this remain unclear. In addition to other factors, the role of impaired autonomic regulation during acute psychosis has become more evident in different studies applying heart rate (HR) variability analyses. But, until now, respiration and cardiorespiratory regulation, which are important for homeostatic control, have not been considered. In this study, short-term cardiorespiratory couplings (CRCs) of 23 unmedicated patients with paranoid schizophrenia (SZO), 20 of their healthy first-degree relatives (REL) and 20 healthy subjects (CON) matched according to age and sex of SZO and REL were investigated by applying high-resolution joint symbolic dynamics (HRJSD) analysis. We found a significantly (p<0.0061) altered HR pattern, respiratory pattern and CRCs in SZO and only marginal alterations for the REL group in comparison with the CON group when we applied HRJSD. These results might be an indication of decreased vagal activity within the brainstem, an altered or suppressed interaction of the brainstem and higher regulatory centres, or panic- and anxiety-related changes in the brainstem associated with the acute psychosis of these patients.",Remaining,0,0
407,18952610,The Journal of biological chemistry,A Drosophila protein family implicated in pheromone perception is related to Tay-Sachs GM2-activator protein.,"Low volatility, lipid-like cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones produced by Drosophila melanogaster females play an essential role in triggering and modulating mating behavior, but the chemosensory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Recently, we showed that the CheB42a protein, which is expressed in only 10 pheromone-sensing taste hairs on the front legs of males, modulates progression to late stages of male courtship behavior in response to female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons. Here we report that expression of all 12 genes in the CheB gene family is predominantly or exclusively gustatory-specific, and occurs in many different, often non-overlapping patterns. Only the Gr family of gustatory receptor genes displays a comparable variety of gustatory-specific expression patterns. Unlike Grs, however, expression of all but one CheB gene is sexually dimorphic. Like CheB42a, other CheBs may therefore function specifically in gustatory perception of pheromones. We also show that CheBs belong to the ML superfamily of lipid-binding proteins, and are most similar to human GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP). In particular, GM2-AP residues involved in ligand binding are conserved in CheBs but not in other ML proteins. Finally, CheB42a is specifically secreted into the inner lumen of pheromone-sensing taste hairs, where pheromones interact with membrane-bound receptors. We propose that CheB proteins interact directly with lipid-like Drosophila pheromones and modulate their detection by the gustatory signal transduction machinery. Furthermore, as loss of GM2-AP in Tay-Sachs disease prevents degradation of GM2 gangliosides and results in neurodegeneration, the function of CheBs in pheromone response may involve biochemical mechanisms critical for lipid metabolism in human neurons.",Remaining,0,0

Participants in the Women's Health Initiative who had Type 2 diabetes and data on depressive symptoms (N=8895) were included in the analyses. In multivariable linear regression models controlling for sociodemographic, medical and psychosocial covariates, we examined the main effect of depressive symptoms, as well as the interactions between depressive symptoms and antidepressant use, and between depressive symptoms and optimism, on sleep disturbance, physical activity, physical health-related quality of life; and global quality of life.	In all, 16% of women with Type 2 diabetes reported elevated depressive symptoms. In multivariable analyses, women with depressive symptoms had greater sleep disturbance (P<0.0001) and lower global quality of life (P<.0001). We found evidence of significant statistical interaction in the models for quality-of-life outcomes: the increased risk of poor physical health-related quality of life associated with antidepressant use was stronger in women without vs with depressive symptoms, and the association between greater optimism and higher global quality of life was stronger in women with vs without depressive symptoms.

Responses to scenarios were made from the perspective of self, an attachment figure and a same sex acquaintance. Data were analysed using multiple regression statistics with ED related symptoms as the dependent variable. High levels of ED related symptoms were associated with 'concretised' understanding of own emotions (i.e. a greater number of food related responses), but sophisticated understanding of same sex acquaintance's emotions. They were associated with fewer positive thoughts for self, fewer negative emotions about their own behaviour, and more food responses for same sex acquaintance's behaviour. Similarities and differences were observed in the different perspectives. Limitations are discussed.

410,22757585,IET systems biology,Dynamic modelling of protein and oxidative metabolisms simulates the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.,"Research into Parkinson's disease (PD) is difficult and time consuming. It is a complex condition that develops over many decades in the human brain. For such apparently intractable diseases, mathematical models can offer an additional means of investigation. As a contribution to this process, the authors have developed an ordinary differential equation model of the most important cellular processes that have been associated with PD. The model describes the following processes: (i) cellular generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species; (ii) the possible damage and removal of the protein -synuclein and, (iii) feedback interactions between damaged α-synuclein and reactive oxygen species. Simulation results show that the Parkinsonian condition, with elevated oxidative stress and misfolded α-synuclein accumulation, can be induced in the model by known PD risk factors such as ageing, exposure to toxins and genetic defects. The significant outcome of the paper is the demonstration that it is possible to reproduce in silico the multi-factorial interactions that characterise the pathogenesis of PD. As such, the model provides a systematic explanation of the variability and heterogeneity of PD and provides the basis for computational studies of further facets of this complex multi-factorial condition.

Our aim was to investigate the relationships between IR, inflammation, oxidative stress and stroke severity in acute ischemic stroke patients.	We examined the relationships between inflammation, oxidative stress and stroke severity in 75 acute stroke patients with and without IR. Serum levels of oxidative stress markers (nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH)) were measured as well as the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10).	The levels of IL-10 (13.7±19.11 vs 51.20±89.32 pg/ml, p<0.00) in IR group were significantly reduced. Patients with IR had higher levels of NO (30.26±17.63 vs 22.57±14.5 µmol/L, p=0.04) and IL6 (27.44±57.13 vs 8.68±11.8 pg/ml, p<0.00) and higher NIHSS scores (11.40±5.35 vs 8.81±5.76, p=0.04) when compared with noninsulin resistant group. IL-10 was found negatively correlated with HOMA. Additionally, the parameters with positive correlations with HOMA were NIHSS, IL-6 and NO.	Inflammation and oxidative stress are more evident in acute stoke patients with insulin resistance which may cause worse stroke severity. Our data also suggest that IL-10 as an antiinflammatory cytokine can be much lower in insulin resistance in acute phase of ischemic stroke.

In addition to the prevalence of the 677C-->T mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, we compared plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations of 35 schizophrenic patients with those of 104 unrelated controls. Schizophrenic patients had significantly lower plasma folate concentrations after adjustment for Hcy levels, and elevated RBC folate levels compared to controls. Vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and Hcy levels did not differ from control values. Plasma folate levels below the 10th percentile of controls were associated with an approximate 4-7-fold (before and after adjustment of folate levels for Hcy, respectively) risk of having schizophrenia. In addition, a significant dose-response relation between plasma folate concentrations and risk for schizophrenia suggested a protective effect by high plasma folate concentrations. Elevated Hcy levels and, in line with this finding, homozygosity for the 677C-->T mutation in the MTHFR gene were not associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia. Evidence is presented suggesting that folate metabolism is disturbed in schizophrenic patients, independently of Hcy.",Remaining,0,0

A sample of 52 older adults underwent neuropsychological assessments, including CompCog, and medical appointments, to be classified as a control group or be diagnosed with MCI. The accuracy of CompCog for distinguishing between the two groups was calculated.	The results from diagnostic accuracy analyses showed that the AUCs of ROC curves were as high as 0.915 (CI 0.837-0.993). The subtest with the highest sensitivity and specificity (choice reaction time subtest) had 91.7% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity. The logistic regression final model correctly classified 92.3% of individuals, with 92.9% specificity and 91.7% sensitivity, and included only four variables from different subtests.	In summary, the study showed that reaction time assessed through CompCog is a good screening measure to differentiate between normal aging and MCI. Reaction time measurements in milliseconds were more accurate than correct answers. This test can form part of routine clinical tests to achieve the objectives of screening for MCI, indicating further procedures for investigation and diagnosis and planning interventions.

Despite growing efforts to understand associations between potential risk factors and outcomes after injury, prognosis is elusive and lacks the inclusion of genetic variables which may convey additional predictive power. This study assessed which factors contribute to pediatric QoL 6 and 18 months post-recruitment in 159 participants (mTBI = 52; orthopedic injury [OI] = 43; typically developing controls [TDC] = 64) aged 18 to 60 months at the time of injury (M = 37.50, SD = 11.69). Family environment, injury characteristics, and child cognitive-behavioral functioning were assessed at 6 months via parent questionnaires and socio-cognitive assessment. QoL was determined using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory at both time points. Genetic information (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] genotype) was collected using saliva samples. Hierarchical regression analyses testing biological, family-environmental, injury and cognitive-behavioral factors revealed that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was a significant independent predictor of better QoL 6 months post-injury in the mTBI group. Lower parental distress significantly and independently predicted higher QoL 18 months after mTBI, and 6 months post-recruitment in the TDC group. At 18 months, models were non-significant for both control groups. Genetic factors involved in neuroplasticity may play an important role in recovery 6 months after mTBI and contribute to outcome via their interplay with environmental factors. Over time, family factors appear to become the primary determinants of post-mTBI outcome.",Remaining,0,0

Prevalence of any disorder, internalizing or externalizing disorders among Muslim adolescents were 19.2, 15.8 and 4.2%, respectively and among Druze adolescents 10.9, 5.9 and 5.5%, respectively. Muslim adolescents were 3.2 times more likely than Druze adolescents to have an internalizing disorder, while Druze were 2 times more likely than Muslim to have an externalizing disorder. Males were at higher risk than females for externalizing disorders in both populations, though among Druze the risk was more striking. Learning disabilities increased the likelihood of having an externalizing disorder in both populations. Risk factors for internalizing disorders among Muslim adolescents were female gender, a very low socio-economic level, few siblings, LD, high maternal GHQ-12 score and high FDI; and for externalizing disorders, male gender, a relatively low socio-economic level but not the lowest, learning disability and high maternal GHQ-12 score.	We found an association between religion/ethnicity and internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as a strong correlation between religion/ethnicity and socio-economic variables. Therefore, we tend to conclude that not religion per se but the multifaceted socio-cultural and economic factors that characterize religious groups are associated with mental disorders. Very low socio-economic level and feeling discriminated which were traits connected only to Muslim adolescents, were associated with internalizing disorders. When preparing preventive measures aimed at furthering mental health among minority adolescents, authorities should focus on improving the socio-economic status of minorities and reducing institutional and personal discrimination. The educational and mental health establishments could undertake measures to improve resilience and coping strategies of Muslim families living in the most adverse conditions, such as providing special support through the school counseling services and coordinating, at the ministerial levels, school and community health services in order to carry out joint preventive programs and referrals to specialist services when needed.",Remaining,0,0
417,16389739,Scandinavian journal of occupational therapy,Play assessment for group settings: a pilot study to construct an assessment tool.,"The Play Assessment for Group Setting (PAGS) was constructed to measure children's play performance. The study was undertaken with 93 children aged from 2 to 8 years to examine whether the items of the PAGS construct a unidimensional scale that can be used to measure children's play ability. The internal scale validity and the person response validity of the PAGS were investigated by examining the goodness-of-fit of the play items and children's play performance to the many-faceted Rasch model for the PAGS. In total, 46 of the 51 play items demonstrated acceptable goodness-of-fit. Of the 93 children, 90.3% demonstrated acceptable goodness-of-fit on the scale of play items. Overall, the results support both the scale and person response validity for the PAGS, as well as providing preliminary evidence that the PAGS can be used for a more detailed evaluation of children's abilities in play performance within natural day-care contexts. Further research is needed to examine other aspects of the validity and reliability of the PAGS measures.",Remaining,0,0
418,26321021,Parkinsonism & related disorders,Mild Cognitive Impairment in newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease: A longitudinal prospective study.,"In PD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) occurs since early stages of disease. The aims were to assess presence of PD-MCI in untreated, drug-naive PD patients, and to follow-up the sample over 4 years to ascertain evolution of neurocognitive profile.	Seventy-six patients underwent neuropsychological testing at baseline (T0), and after 2 (T1:n = 62) and 4 years (T2:n = 55). Diagnosis of PD-MCI and PD-associated dementia (PDD) was made according to current consensus criteria.	PD-MCI occurred in 25/76 patients (32.9%) at baseline, and 4 of them reverted from PD-MCI to Normal Cognition (Reverters), 7 remained stable (Non-Reverters) and 2 developed PDD at T2; 12 patients were lost to the follow-up. Among the 51 patients with normal cognition (PD-CN) at T0, 27 had normal cognition at T2 (5 of them were Reverters with respect to diagnosis at T1), 5 had MCI at T1 and T2 (Non-Reverters), 9 had MCI at T2 only, whereas 1 developed PDD; 9 patients were lost to the follow-up. At baseline, Reverters (n = 9) had younger age at onset and better performance on constructional visuospatial task than Non-Reverters (n = 12). Compared to patients without PD-MCI at all evaluations (n = 19), Reverters had poorer performance on verbal immediate recall and attention tasks and higher level of apathy at T0. Reduced performance on the Stroop Test at baseline predicted PD-MCI at T2.	Executive dysfunctions predicted development of PD-MCI after few years from onset. Reversal from PD-MCI to PD-CN was related to young age at onset and high level of apathy at baseline evaluation.",Remaining,0,0
419,35411967,Annals of neurology,Heterozygous PNPT1 Variants Cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 25.,"Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are characterized by genetic heterogeneity. Some mapped and named loci remain without a causal gene identified. Here we applied next generation sequencing (NGS) to uncover the genetic etiology of the SCA25 locus.	Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing were performed in families linked to SCA25, including the French family in which the SCA25 locus was originally mapped. Whole exome sequence data were interrogated in a cohort of 796 ataxia patients of unknown etiology.	The SCA25 phenotype spans a slowly evolving sensory and cerebellar ataxia, in most cases attributed to ganglionopathy. A pathogenic variant causing exon skipping was identified in the gene encoding Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase PNPase 1 (PNPT1) located in the SCA25 linkage interval. A second splice variant in PNPT1 was detected in a large Australian family with a dominant ataxia also mapping to SCA25. An additional nonsense variant was detected in an unrelated individual with ataxia. Both nonsense and splice heterozygous variants result in premature stop codons, all located in the S1-domain of PNPase. In addition, an elevated type I interferon response was observed in blood from all affected heterozygous carriers tested. PNPase notably prevents the abnormal accumulation of double-stranded mtRNAs in the mitochondria and leakage into the cytoplasm, associated with triggering a type I interferon response.	This study identifies PNPT1 as a new SCA gene, responsible for SCA25, and highlights biological links between alterations of mtRNA trafficking, interferonopathies and ataxia.

420,26940435,Scientific reports,"Intratumoral heterogeneity identified at the epigenetic, genetic and transcriptional level in glioblastoma.","Heterogeneity is a hallmark of glioblastoma with intratumoral heterogeneity contributing to variability in responses and resistance to standard treatments. Promoter methylation status of the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is the most important clinical biomarker in glioblastoma, predicting for therapeutic response. However, it does not always correlate with response. This may be due to intratumoral heterogeneity, with a single biopsy unlikely to represent the entire lesion. Aberrations in other DNA repair mechanisms may also contribute. This study investigated intratumoral heterogeneity in multiple glioblastoma tumors with a particular focus on the DNA repair pathways. Transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity was identified in 40% of cases with variability in MGMT methylation status found in 14% of cases. As well as identifying intratumoral heterogeneity at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, targeted next generation sequencing identified between 1 and 37 unique sequence variants per specimen. In-silico tools were then able to identify deleterious variants in both the base excision repair and the mismatch repair pathways that may contribute to therapeutic response. As these pathways have roles in temozolomide response, these findings may confound patient management and highlight the importance of assessing multiple tumor biopsies.",Remaining,0,0

We aimed to establish the impact of this pandemic on epilepsy patients in terms of patient-reported seizure control and emerging symptoms.	This is a cross-sectional study including consecutive patients assessed by telephone contact in an epilepsy clinic during the first month of confinement. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded, and a 19-item questionnaire was systematically completed. Data regarding the impact of confinement, economic effects of the pandemic, and subjective perception of telemedicine were recorded. Additional clinical data were obtained in patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis.	Two hundred and fifty-five patients were recruited: mean age 48.2 ± 19.8 years, 121 (47.5%) women. An increase in seizure frequency was reported by 25 (9.8%) patients. Sixty-eight (26.7%) patients reported confinement-related anxiety, 22 (8.6%) depression, 31 (12.2%) both, and 72 (28.2%) insomnia. Seventy-three (28.6%) patients reported a reduction in economic income. Logistic regression analysis showed that tumor-related epilepsy etiology [OR = 7.36 (95% CI 2.17-24.96)], drug-resistant epilepsy [OR = 3.44 (95% CI 1.19-9.95)], insomnia [OR = 3.25 (95% CI 1.18-8.96)], fear of epilepsy [OR = 3.26 (95% CI 1.09-9.74)], and income reduction [OR = 3.65 (95% CI 1.21-10.95)] were associated with a higher risk of increased seizure frequency. Telemedicine was considered satisfactory by 214 (83.9%) patients. Five patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with no changes in seizure frequency.	The COVID-19 pandemic has effects in epilepsy patients. Patients with tumor-related, drug-resistant epilepsy, insomnia, and economic difficulties are at a higher risk of increased seizure frequency.

A retrospective study was undertaken to define better the incidence and clinical features of this infection, and to establish current diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. Forty cases of spinal epidural abscess were encountered at our institution between July 1979 and March 1991. All medical records and radiological images were reviewed. We report a significant increase in the incidence of epidural abscess after June 1988 (p = 0.0195). Sixteen patients used drugs intravenously, and six had undergone spinal procedures. Twelve patients were misdiagnosed in various emergency rooms or clinics and discharged. Localized back pain, fever, and neurological deficit remained the typical clinical manifestations. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated uniformly when measured (21 cases). Magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic specifically in 23 of 24 instances. The majority of patients underwent surgical drainage, but five selected patients were managed nonoperatively. The highly variable presentation of spinal epidural abscess may confuse the diagnosis and delay indicated surgical intervention. Localized back pain in a febrile patient at significant risk for epidural abscess warrants erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement. The presence of erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevation or evidence of spinal cord compression on physical examination are indications for immediate magnetic resonance imaging examination with contrast enhancement. Surgical drainage with sustained intravenous antibiotic treatment remains the cornerstone of therapy. Nonoperative management may be considered in selected cases.",Remaining,0,0

It is produced by activated blood monocytes, macrophages, and glial cells. The objective of our study was to assess the role of interleukin-15 as a marker of increased proinflammatory activity in patients with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. We measured cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-15 levels in 17 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 7 patients with frontotemporal dementia in comparison with 17 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 15 patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia had significantly higher cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-15 levels compared with patients with noninflammatory neurological diseases (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). In Alzheimer's disease, a significant positive correlation was noted between interleukin-15 levels and age of onset (R = .48, P = .05). Our findings suggest that interleukin-15 may be implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.",Remaining,0,0
424,11115331,Archives of general psychiatry,Increased neocortical neurofibrillary tangle density in subjects with Alzheimer disease and psychosis.,"Psychosis is common in patients with Alzheimer disease. While the relationship between psychosis and clinical variables has been examined frequently, few studies have examined the relationship between psychosis and the 2 major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease: neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. We characterized the occurrence of psychosis in relation to dementia severity and determined if subjects with Alzheimer disease and psychosis had a greater neurofibrillary tangle or senile plaque burden than subjects with Alzheimer disease and no psychosis.	One hundred nine subjects with Alzheimer disease were followed longitudinally with semistructured assessments in order to assign a Clinical Dementia Rating and determine whether psychosis was present. After the subjects died, their brains were obtained for histological examination. Analysis of variance was used to compare the densities of neurofibrillary tangles, total senile plaques, and cored senile plaques in subjects with psychosis vs subjects without psychosis, in several neocortical regions, the hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex.	Psychosis occurred commonly in Alzheimer disease, affecting 63% of subjects. The frequency of psychosis increased with increasing dementia severity. More importantly, we found that subjects with psychosis had a 2.3-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.9) greater density of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles than did subjects without psychosis. The increase was independent of dementia severity. No similar relationship with psychosis was seen for total senile plaques or cored senile plaques.	The increase in psychosis frequency that occurs with the progression of dementia severity and the independent association between psychosis and neurofibrillary tangle density suggest the possibility that some common underlying process or processes specific to Alzheimer disease may regulate both phenomena.

Furthermore to study the consequences of pain and to identify pain-exacerbating and pain-relieving factors.	In a national survey, fifty-five adolescents with spinal muscular atrophy and dystrophinopathy completed a questionnaire assessing pain frequency, duration, location using a body map, intensity and discomfort using visual analogue scales, pain interference using a modified version of Brief Pain Inventory and factors exacerbating and relieving pain.	Sixty-nine per cent of the adolescents reported pain during the past three months and 50% reported chronic pain. The pain prevalence did not differ significantly between diagnostic groups or between ambulators and non-ambulators. The average pain intensity was graded as mild and the worst pain as moderate. The pain typically occurred weekly, most frequently in the neck/back or legs. General activity and mood were the areas that were most affected by pain. Common pain-exacerbating factors were sitting, too much movement/activity and being lifted or transferred.	Pain is a frequent problem in adolescents with spinal muscular atrophy and dystrophinopathy. The assessments used enable an understanding both of the nature and scope of pain and of the impact of pain in everyday life. The study highlights the importance of assessing pain in a systematic manner and offering an individual approach to interventions designed to reduce pain in this population.",Remaining,0,0
426,3522814,Journal of clinical hypertension,Common carotid blood flow in patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery.,"Common carotid blood flow has been measured using pulsed Doppler techniques in hypertensive patients over 45 years of age, with and without stenosis of the internal carotid artery. In hypertensive patients without stenosis, arterial diameter remained within the normal range, whereas blood flow velocity and blood flow were significantly reduced. Vascular resistance was significantly increased but did not change markedly after administration of the vasodilating drug isosorbid dinitrate. Patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery were compared with two different populations used as controls: In comparison with hypertensive patients without stenosis of the internal carotid artery, both arterial diameter and blood flow velocity were reduced, leading to a more pronounced decrease in blood flow; and in comparison with normotensive patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery, common carotid blood flow was more reduced at any degree of stenosis. In a subset of patients, blood flow returned toward normal ranges after endarterectomy. The study suggested that in patients with hypertension without stenosis of the internal carotid artery, the decrease in blood flow is due to a decrease in blood flow velocity with normal arterial diameter despite the elevated blood pressure, and in patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery, blood flow was more reduced than in the normotensive patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery, suggesting that caution must be taken with indications of antihypertensive treatment.",Remaining,0,0

The following oculomotor paradigms were investigated: horizontal and vertical saccades of different sizes (10-80 degrees), smooth pursuit eye movements, optokinetic and vestibular nystagmus. It was found that 75% of the HD patients had pathologically slow saccades. This number rose to 87% if other oculomotor deficits were included. Thus a small, but definite number of HD patients had normal eye movements. This included patients with disease durations of more than 14 years. A comparison with the results of clinical and evoked potential studies on these patients showed that they were clinically only mildly affected but did not form a different group of HD patients. Subjects at risk had statistically (P less than 0.01) slower horizontal saccades (average 427 deg/sec) than the controls (455 deg/sec). For 11% of the subjects at risk horizontal saccade velocity was pathological and altogether 22% had some oculomotor deficits. Subjects with pathological slow horizontal saccades also had a high incidence (64%) of pathological evoked potentials. Thus, subjects with pathological slow horizontal saccades can be considered to have a high risk of developing the clinical symptoms of HD.",Remaining,0,0

Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare disorder that causes death. Children die early due to either gradual atrophy or an infection of the lungs. Therefore, family members experience anticipatory loss, which causes grief before the actual loss. Family members feel physically and mentally exhausted, which results in a family crisis. Therefore, it is important to explore their experiences related to anticipatory loss to assist with the adjustment of the families to their circumstances.	This study applied a phenomenology method and purposive sampling.	The 19 parents who participated in this study were referred to us by two medical centers in Taiwan. Their average age was 32-49 years.	Using in-depth interviews, this study explored parents' anticipatory loss. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Meanings were extracted using Giorgi analysis, and precision was assessed according to Guba and Lincoln, which was treated as the evaluation standard.	Four themes were identified from the parents' interviews. The themes included enduring the helplessness and pressure of care, suffering due to the child's rare and unknown condition, loss of hope and a reinforcement of the parent-child attachment, and avoiding the pressure of death and enriching the child's life.	The research findings help nurses identify anticipatory loss among parents of school-age children with type I or II spinal muscular atrophy. They enhance health professionals' understanding of the panic that occurs in the society surrounding the families, family members' dynamic relationships, and the families' demands for care.	In an attempt to providing intersubjective empathy and support with family having a child with type I and II SMA, nurses may recognize relevant family reactions and enhancing their hope and parent-child attachment. Encourage family members and child go beyond the pressure of death and create customized care plans meeting families' emotional and medical needs.",Remaining,0,0

Parents indicated in a free response format that 'immaturity' and 'small size' were the reasons for retention. The present follow-up study obtained academic achievement data on 47 of the 56 short children from the Holmes et al. (1982) study to assess what role academic factors, not spontaneously mentioned by parents, may have had in the retention decision. Results indicated that despite repeating a year in the primary grades, the group of retained children were still functioning 6 months below grade expectation, compared to grade appropriate achievement in the never-retained group. Parents and teachers were both accurate in their perceptions of children's academic achievement. Behavioural ratings by teachers indicated more adjustment difficulties for retained children, while parent ratings of behaviour showed a similar high level of problems for short children regardless of retention status. Although both groups of children possessed average intellectual abilities, the retained children obtained lower IQ scores than the never retained children. In summary, a majority of short children were achieving appropriate grade levels, but a substantial minority were experiencing under-achievement, behaviour problems, and grade retention, despite average intelligence.",Remaining,0,0
434,29531139,Diabetes,Altered Brain Dynamics in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes During Working Memory Processing.,"It is now generally accepted that diabetes increases the risk for cognitive impairment, but the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. A critical problem in linking diabetes to cognitive impairment is that patients often have multiple comorbidities (e.g., obesity, hypertension) that have been independently linked to cognitive deficits. In the study reported here we focused on young adults with and without type 1 diabetes who were virtually free of such comorbidities. The two groups were matched on major health and demographic factors, and all participants completed a verbal working memory task during magnetoencephalographic brain imaging. We hypothesized that patients would have altered neural dynamics in verbal working memory processing and that these differences would directly relate to clinical disease measures. Accordingly, we found that patients had significantly stronger neural responses in the superior parietal cortices during memory encoding and significantly weaker activity in parietal-occipital regions during maintenance compared with control subjects. Moreover, disease duration and glycemic control were both significantly correlated with neural responses in various brain regions. In conclusion, young healthy adults with type 1 diabetes already have aberrant neural processing relative to their peers without diabetes, using compensatory responses to perform the task, and glucose management and duration may play a central role.",Remaining,0,0

438,16737451,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",Cold pressor task reactivity: predictors of alcohol use among alcohol-dependent individuals with and without comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder.,"The association between stress and alcohol dependence has been well established. Abnormalities in stress reactivity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) function may be involved in the mechanistic connection between stress and the initiation, development, and/or maintenance of alcohol dependence. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occurs with alcohol dependence and is characterized by HPA axis abnormalities. This study investigated the relationship between subjective and neuroendocrine stress reactivity to the cold pressor task (CPT) and prospective alcohol use among individuals with alcohol dependence, with and without comorbid PTSD.	Participants were 63 individuals with (a) alcohol dependence only (n=35) or (b) comorbid alcohol dependence and PTSD (n=28). Participants completed the CPT, a widely used physical laboratory stressor. Subjective stress, craving, adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), and cortisol were measured before, immediately after, and at 5, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the CPT. Alcohol use during 1 month following testing was also assessed.	For the alcohol-only group, change in craving immediately following the CPT and craving during the 120-minute recovery phase were predictive of follow-up alcohol use. For the alcohol/PTSD group, change in craving was not predictive of follow-up use. Baseline drinking was, however, predictive of followup alcohol use for the alcohol/PTSD group. For the alcohol-only group, a blunted ACTH response coupled with a higher change in craving following the CPT was associated with significantly greater frequency and intensity of drinking during the follow-up phase.	These preliminary findings demonstrate significant differences between the alcohol-only and the alcohol/PTSD group in predictors of relapse. For the alcohol-only group, reactivity to an acute laboratory stressor may be predictive of subsequent alcohol use. This was not true for the alcohol/PTSD group. Although preliminary, the findings may help shed light on the mechanistic relationship between stress reactivity and increased risk for alcohol relapse and dependence in individuals with and without other Axis I comorbidity.",Remaining,0,0
439,30108144,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Oligodendrocyte precursor survival and differentiation requires chromatin remodeling by Chd7 and Chd8.,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) constitute the main proliferative cells in the adult brain, and deregulation of OPC proliferation-differentiation balance results in either glioma formation or defective adaptive (re)myelination. OPC differentiation requires significant genetic reprogramming, implicating chromatin remodeling. Mounting evidence indicates that chromatin remodelers play important roles during normal development and their mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental defects, with CHD7 haploinsuficiency being the cause of CHARGE syndrome and CHD8 being one of the strongest autism spectrum disorder (ASD) high-risk-associated genes. Herein, we report on uncharacterized functions of the chromatin remodelers Chd7 and Chd8 in OPCs. Their OPC-chromatin binding profile, combined with transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analyses of Chd7-deleted OPCs, demonstrates that Chd7 protects nonproliferative OPCs from apoptosis by chromatin closing and transcriptional repression of p53 Furthermore, Chd7 controls OPC differentiation through chromatin opening and transcriptional activation of key regulators, including Sox10, Nkx2.2, and Gpr17 However, Chd7 is dispensable for oligodendrocyte stage progression, consistent with Chd8 compensatory function, as suggested by their common chromatin-binding profiles and genetic interaction. Finally, CHD7 and CHD8 bind in OPCs to a majority of ASD risk-associated genes, suggesting an implication of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in ASD neurological defects.

Using a longitudinal design, we examined developmental patterns of the bidirectional links between neural mechanisms and substance use throughout adolescence.	167 adolescents (aged 13-14 years at Time 1, 53% male) were assessed annually four times. Risk-related neural processing was assessed by blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses in the insula during a lottery choice task, cognitive control by behavioral performance during the Multi-Source Interference Task, and substance use by adolescents' self-reported cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use.	Latent change score modeling indicated that greater substance use predicted increased insula activation during risk processing, but the effects of insula activation on changes in substance use were not significant. The coupling effect from substance use to insula activation was particularly strong for adolescents with low cognitive control, which supports the theorized moderating role of cognitive control.	Our results elucidate how substance use may alter brain development to be biased toward maladaptive decision-making, particularly among adolescents with poor cognitive control. Furthermore, the current findings underscore that cognitive control may be an important target in the prevention and treatment of adolescent substance use given its moderating role in the neuroadaptive effects of substance use on brain development.",Remaining,0,0
441,28834788,Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,Associations Between Family Member BMI and Obesity Status of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"To determine whether there is an association between parent and sibling obesity status and obesity status in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).	We examined predictors of obesity in children with ASD with body mass index data for the proband, 1 sibling, and 2 parents using data from the multisite Simons Simplex Collection.	In a stepwise logistic regression model, proband obesity status was associated with obesity status of the sibling (odds ratio [OR] 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92-3.70), mother (OR 2.10; 95% CI, 1.59-2.77), and father (OR 1.51; 95% CI, 1.15-1.98). Proband obesity was also related to somatic complaints (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.006-2.53), mood stabilizers (OR 1.80; 95% CI, 1.19-2.72), internalizing problems (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.14-2.30), age (OR 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01), and some adaptive functioning domains (OR 0.987; 95% CI, 0.977-0.997). Race, ethnicity, income, sex, and maternal education were not significant predictors.	Familial factors were generally the strongest predictors of obesity rather than medication use, demographics, or psychological characteristics.

442,32665027,Acta neuropathologica communications,The unfolded protein response is activated in the olfactory system in Alzheimer's disease.,"Olfactory dysfunction is an early and prevalent symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the olfactory bulb is a nexus of beta-amyloid plaque and tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during early AD progression. To mitigate the accumulation of misfolded proteins, an endoplasmic reticulum stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) occurs in the AD hippocampus. However, chronic UPR activation can lead to apoptosis and the upregulation of beta-amyloid and tau production. Therefore, UPR activation in the olfactory system could be one of the first changes in AD. In this study, we investigated whether two proteins that signal UPR activation are expressed in the olfactory system of AD cases with low or high amounts of aggregate pathology. We used immunohistochemistry to label two markers of UPR activation (p-PERK and p-eIF2α) concomitantly with neuronal markers (NeuN and PGP9.5) and pathology markers (beta-amyloid and tau) in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex and the CA1 region of the hippocampus in AD and normal cases. We show that UPR activation, as indicated by p-PERK and p-eIF2α expression, is significantly increased throughout the olfactory system in AD cases with low (Braak stage III-IV) and high-level (Braak stage V-VI) pathology. We further show that UPR activation occurs in the mitral cells and in the anterior olfactory nucleus of the olfactory bulb where tau and amyloid pathology is abundant. However, UPR activation is not present in neurons when they contain NFTs and only rarely occurs in neurons containing diffuse tau aggregates. We conclude that UPR activation is prevalent in all regions of the olfactory system and support previous findings suggesting that UPR activation likely precedes NFT formation. Our data indicate that chronic UPR activation in the olfactory system might contribute to the olfactory dysfunction that occurs early in the pathogenesis of AD.",Remaining,0,0
443,33837088,Science advances,C9orf72-derived arginine-containing dipeptide repeats associate with axonal transport machinery and impede microtubule-based motility.,"A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). How this mutation leads to these neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Here, we show using patient stem cell-derived motor neurons that the repeat expansion impairs microtubule-based transport, a process critical for neuronal survival. Cargo transport defects are recapitulated by treating neurons from healthy individuals with proline-arginine and glycine-arginine dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced from the repeat expansion. Both arginine-rich DPRs similarly inhibit axonal trafficking in adult Drosophila neurons in vivo. Physical interaction studies demonstrate that arginine-rich DPRs associate with motor complexes and the unstructured tubulin tails of microtubules. Single-molecule imaging reveals that microtubule-bound arginine-rich DPRs directly impede translocation of purified dynein and kinesin-1 motor complexes. Collectively, our study implicates inhibitory interactions of arginine-rich DPRs with axonal transport machinery in C9orf72-associated ALS/FTD and thereby points to potential therapeutic strategies.",Remaining,0,0
444,15957200,Schizophrenia bulletin,Reduced red blood cell membrane essential polyunsaturated fatty acids in first episode schizophrenia at neuroleptic-naive baseline.,"There is emerging evidence in schizophrenia of membrane abnormalities, primarily reductions in the essential omega-3 and omega-6 series of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Because previous studies have largely been in chronic patients, it is not known whether these membrane abnormalities also occur early in illness. In the present study, red blood cell membrane fatty acid levels were determined by capillary gas chromatography from 24 neuroleptic-naive patients with first episode schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 31 age-matched normal controls. Relative to normal subjects, patients had significant reductions in total PUFA (-13%) but not in monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids. Specifically, significant reductions were found in arachidonic acid (-18%), docosapentaenoic acid (-36%), and docosahexaenoic acid (-26%) concentrations. These reductions were not related to age, gender, smoking status, or cotinine levels. These results confirm previous findings of membrane deficits in schizophrenia and show that significant PUFA reductions occur early in the illness, prior to initiation of treatment, raising the possibility that these deficits are trait related. The findings also suggest that membrane fatty acid losses are quite specific to the highly unsaturated fatty acids.",Remaining,0,0

We determined the rates of brain atrophy using serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PDD and compared this finding to rates seen in cognitively intact Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and age-matched control subjects. Thirty-one patients (PD = 18, PDD = 13) and 24 age-matched controls underwent serial volumetric 1.5 T MRI scans, approximately 1 year apart. Baseline and repeat scans were registered and quantification of the brain boundary shift integral was used to determine whole-brain atrophy rates. Rates of brain atrophy were significantly increased in PDD (1.12 +/- 0.98%/year) compared to PD (0.31 +/- 0.69%/year; P = 0.018) and control subjects (0.34 +/- 0.76%/year; P = 0.015). There were no differences in atrophy rates between controls and PD (P = 0.79). No correlations between increased atrophy rates and age or dementia severity (Mini-Mental State Examination score) were observed.

Data from identical measures done on two groups of perimenopausal-age women, one recruited for menopausal age and the other for same age but sleep problems plus controls, were tested using a two-way analysis of variance for the main effects of recruitment group and the presence or absence of 'poor' sleep as well as the joint effects of both.	'Poor' sleep was reported by more than one-third of the women, but menopausal status and perceived sleep quality were not statistically related. Women with 'poor' sleep took longer to fall asleep, spent longer in bed, and had higher scores for psychological distress and for four out of five somatic symptom clusters (p < or = 0.03), compared to women with 'good' sleep.	In sum, midlife women reporting poor sleep are likely to have trouble falling asleep and to have higher psychological distress and somatic symptoms, especially musculoskeletal discomfort and fatigue, coinciding with their perceived poor sleep.",Remaining,0,0

We created a retrospective multicenter cohort of patients with (1) GCA diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria between 1995 and 2015, and (2) stroke occurring at the time of GCA diagnosis or occurring within 4 weeks of starting GCA therapy. The control group consisted of GCA patients without stroke.	Forty patients [21 women (53%), median age 78 (60-91) yrs] with GCA-related stroke were included and were compared with 200 control patients. Stroke occurred at GCA diagnosis in 29 patients (73%), whereas it occurred after diagnosis in 11 patients. Vertebrobasilar territory was involved in 29 patients (73%). Seven patients died within a few hours or days following stroke. Compared with the control group, stroke patients had more ophthalmic ischemic symptoms [25 (63%) vs 50 (25%), p < 0.001]. Conversely, they demonstrated lower biological inflammatory variables [C-reactive protein: 61 (28-185) mg/l vs 99 (6-400) mg/l, p = 0.04] and less anemia [22/37 (59%) vs 137/167 (79%), p = 0.03] than patients without stroke. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the best predictors for the occurrence of stroke were the presence of ophthalmic ischemic symptoms at diagnosis (OR 5, 95% CI 2.14-12.33, p = 0.0002) and the absence of anemia (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.99, p = 0.04).

The majority of treatment for depression occurs in primary care, but effective care remains elusive. Clinical decision making and comparative studies of real-world antidepressant effectiveness are limited by the absence of clinical measures of severity of illness and suicidality.	The Distributed Ambulatory Research in Therapeutics Network (DARTNet) was engaged to systematically collect data using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at the point of care. We used electronic health records (EHRs) and the PHQ-9 to capture, describe, and compare data on both baseline severity of illness and suicidality and response and suicidality after diagnosis for depressed patients in participating DARTNet practices.	EHR data were obtained for 81,028 episodes of depression (61,464 patients) from 14 clinical organizations. Over 9 months, data for 4900 PHQ-9s were collected from 2969 patients in DARTNet practices (this included 1892 PHQ-9s for 1019 adults and adolescents who had at least one depression diagnosis). Only 8.3% of episodes identified in our depression cohort had severity of illness information available in the EHR. For these episodes, considerable variation existed in both severity of illness (32.05% with no depression, 26.89% with minimal, 19.54% with mild, 12.04% with moderate, and 9.47% with severe depression) and suicidality (69.43% with a score of 0, 22.58% with a score of 1, 4.97% with a score of 2, and 3.02% with a score of 3 on item 9 of the PHQ-9). Patients with an EHR diagnosis of depression and a PHQ-9 (n = 1019) had similar severity but slightly higher suicidality levels compared with all patients for which PHQ-9 data were available. The PHQ-9 showed higher sensitivity for identifying depression response and emergent (after diagnosis) severity and suicidality; 25% to 30% of subjects had some degree of suicidal thought at some point in time according to the PHQ-9.	This study demonstrated the value of adding PHQ-9 data and prescription fulfillment data to EHRs to improve diagnosis and management of depression in primary care and to enable more robust comparative effectiveness research on antidepressants.",Remaining,0,0
453,34050644,Journal of analytical toxicology,Increasing Prevalence of Ketamine in Drivers in New York City Including the Identification of 2-Fluoro-Deschloroketamine.,"Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used in veterinary and human medicine since the 1970s. Its clinical use has expanded to control of seizures, by pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS), and is finding new purpose as an analgesic alternative and antidepressant. Ketamine brings hope for effective management of chronic pain in the absence of opioids and decreasing suicidal ideations; however, its persistence as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic properties remains. In the wake of expanding medicinal purposes, the diversity of New York City's population was explored to better understand its misuse. This retrospective study looks at the prevalence of ketamine in driver fatalities over a period of 18 years (2003-2020) and cases involving suspected driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) over a period of 6 years (2015-2020). Ketamine was identified in 6 driver fatalities and in 47 DUID cases. None of the driver fatalities were suspected of ketamine misuse, due to administration either in hospital or by EMS. In the DUID cases, an increasing trend was observed over the 6-year study period with 100% (n = 47) of the cases confirmed as non-hospital/non-EMS administered ketamine. Of the DUID cases, 94% were male with the majority between the age of 21 and 39 years (85%) and were predominantly Hispanic (36%) and Asian (34%). Blood concentrations of ketamine ranged from 27 to >2000 ng/mL with polydrug use prevalent. The most common drug classes detected in addition to ketamine were cannabinoids (38%), ethanol (32%), benzodiazepines (26%), cocaine (19%) and amphetamines/3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (15%). In 2019, 2-fluoro-deschloroketamine was identified in two cases for the first time. Despite its increased acceptance for mental health disorders, ketamine's persistence and misuse as a recreational drug remains and should continue to be monitored by relevant toxicological, clinical and law enforcement communities along with emerging illicit ketamine analogs.",Remaining,0,0

Normalized nonsynonymous substitutions were more frequent at the divergence of lymphoid and brain sequences, indicating stronger adaptive selection in brain compared to lymphoid tissue. Brain-specific nonsynonymous substitutions were found within an NH(3)-terminal CTL epitope, the PACS1 binding motif, or positions predicted to be important for activation of the myeloid-restricted Src family tyrosine kinase Hck.

Previous studies indicate that several components of emotional processing are intact in schizophrenia when subjects are instructed to attend to emotionally-evocative stimuli. However, few studies have examined whether emotional stimuli capture attention to a normal degree in people with schizophrenia when attention is directed elsewhere. The current event-related potential study examined motivated attention to task-irrelevant emotional stimuli in 35 stabilized outpatients and 26 healthy controls with a modified visual P300 oddball detection task. Participants viewed images of rare target and commonly occurring standard letter stimuli, as well as intermixed emotional (unpleasant, pleasant, neutral) pictures. Subjects were instructed to count the number of rare targets; the emotional valence of the picture stimuli was, therefore, task-irrelevant. We separately evaluated the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) and Late Positive Potential (LPP) to emotional pictures and the P300 to target stimuli. Patients and controls showed similar patterns of EPN and LPP amplitude to the emotional stimuli, such that the EPN and LPP were larger for both pleasant and unpleasant versus neutral pictures. Although patients performed worse than controls on the target counting task, both groups showed comparable P300 differentiation between target versus non-target stimuli. Emotional stimuli captured attentional resources in people with schizophrenia even when the emotional stimuli were task-irrelevant, suggesting intact motivated attention at the level of early electrophysiological responding.",Remaining,0,0

While amyloid deposition has been noted within atrial appendages, the incidence and significance remains incompletely understood. More accurate amyloid typing methodologies and targeted pharmacotherapeutics have recently been developed, prompting pathologists to provide more detailed information about the type of amyloid identified in such samples. This study sought to fully characterize the morphologic characteristics of atrial amyloid as well as its incidence and clinical significance. Tissue archives were queried for atrial appendages removed during the cardiac surgeries (2010-2014). Patient demographics, imaging features, and salient clinical findings were recorded. Pattern and extent of amyloid deposition were recorded. Typing of the amyloid protein, when present, was performed on a subset of cases by laser capture microdissection with mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. A total of 383 atrial appendages from 345 consecutive patients were included in the study (mean age, 69 years; range, 26-92 years). Amyloid was present in 46% of patients. A linear relationship was observed between age and presence of atrial amyloidosis. Women were more likely to have atrial amyloidosis. Two distinct morphologies of amyloid were observed: filamentous and nonfilamentous, and correlated perfectly with amyloid type (filamentous = AANF-type amyloid; nonfilamentous = ATTR-type amyloid). Filamentous deposits were observed in 91% of those with amyloid. Amyloid was more likely to be found in the left atrial appendage than the right. Patients with atrial amyloid, irrespective of type, were more likely to have experienced stroke or TIA and more likely to have atrial arrhythmia preoperatively. Postoperatively, those with atrial amyloid are more likely to experience recurrence of arrhythmia than those who did not have atrial amyloid. Understanding the morphologic characteristics of AANF-type amyloid will allow for identification by the light microscopy and obviates the need for expensive ancillary typing techniques. The finding of nonfilamentous amyloid, should still prompt confirmation of amyloid type so that targeted therapy may be employed.",Remaining,0,0

Serum level of NSE in healthy adults ranged from 4.1 to 8.9 ng/ml (5.6 +/- 1.38 ng/ml, n = 15) and that of CSF ranged from 4.9 to 7.3 ng/ml (means 6.1 ng/ml, n = 3). Serum samples from patients with malignant gliomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors contained abnormally high level of NSE, of which mean value were 22.3 ng/ml and 16.1 ng/ml, respectively. However, serum samples from patients with low grade gliomas and other intracranial tumors arising from non-neuroectodermal tissues were within normal range.

459,19682673,Cognition,Visual perspective taking impairment in children with autistic spectrum disorder.,"Evidence from typical development and neuroimaging studies suggests that level 2 visual perspective taking - the knowledge that different people may see the same thing differently at the same time - is a mentalising task. Thus, we would expect children with autism, who fail typical mentalising tasks like false belief, to perform poorly on level 2 visual perspective taking as well. However, prior data on this issue are inconclusive. We re-examined this question, testing a group of 23 young autistic children, aged around 8years with a verbal mental age of around 4years and three groups of typical children (n=60) ranging in age from 4 to 8years on a level 2 visual perspective task and a closely matched mental rotation task. The results demonstrate that autistic children have difficulty with visual perspective taking compared to a task requiring mental rotation, relative to typical children. Furthermore, performance on the level 2 visual perspective taking task correlated with theory of mind performance. These findings resolve discrepancies in previous studies of visual perspective taking in autism, and demonstrate that level 2 visual perspective taking is a mentalising task.",Remaining,0,0

Twenty-four ambulatory patients (mean age, 10.0 years) with spastic cerebral palsy who were scheduled for single event multilevel surgery, including distal hamstring lengthening, were included. Preoperatively, peak isometric muscle strength was measured for the hip flexor, hip extensor, knee flexor, and knee extensor muscle groups using a handheld dynamometer, and three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis and gross motor function measure (GMFM) scoring were also performed. Correlations between peak isometric strength and GMFM, gait kinematics, and gait kinetics were analyzed.	Peak isometric muscle strength of all muscle groups was not related to the GMFM score and the gross motor function classification system level. Peak isometric strength of the hip extensor and knee extensor was significantly correlated with the mean pelvic tilt (r=-0.588, p=0.003 and r=-0.436, p=0.033) and maximum pelvic obliquity (r=-0.450, p=0.031 and r=-0.419, p=0.041).

To verify that ICCD certification is a valid indicator of program quality for use in setting benchmark performance rates, 71 certified and 48 noncertified programs were compared on a variety of organizational variables.	Even though certified and noncertified clubhouses were similar in organizational structure and resources, findings from a logistic regression analysis confirmed that certified clubhouses provided a wider array of rehabilitation services and achieved higher rates of employment.	The findings suggest that ICCD certification is a valid indicator of program quality. The ICCD has therefore proposed that the average performance of certified U.S. clubhouses in specific domains be adopted as benchmarks for organizational performance. When tailored for programs in particular regions and with specific levels of funding, the ICCD benchmarks for clubhouse performance set fair and reasonable expectations for clubhouse programs and for the design of performance contracts between departments of mental health and ICCD clubhouses.",Remaining,0,0
462,16226047,Journal of clinical forensic medicine,Near miss incidents in police custody suites in London in 2003: a feasibility study.,"Potentially preventable deaths in police custody include those which involve illicit drugs, alcohol and deliberate self-harm. Near miss incidents (NMI) that did not result in death have a crucial role in understanding risk factors in custody. Such research has not previously been undertaken. A program of research has been developed to study NMI, in order to better identify those at risk in police custody. For the purposes of this research, NMI have been defined as 'an unplanned and unforeseeable or unforeseen event that could have resulted, but did not result, in human death or may have resulted in injury or other adverse outcomes'. It was intended that the definition although broad, would not include simple accidents (e.g. slipping on urine in a cell) or trivial injury.	The two aims of the study are (a) to determine whether it is realistic to attempt to assess NMI with the intention of identifying information of use in enhancing detainee care and (b) to assess how frequently NMIs occur and whether there are specific patterns. Pilot interviews were conducted with three forensic physicians practising in London, UK to create a structured questionnaire for all forensic physicians working in London. The questionnaire provided the basis of a retrospective recall survey of all forensic physicians working in London as Forensic Medical Examiners. The questionnaire was designed to assess the numbers of NMI, patterns in occurrence and relevant learning points within the previous 6 months. A covering letter, background questionnaire (exploring the background of the medical practitioner), copies of the survey, and reply paid envelopes were sent to each Forensic Medical Examiner (n=134) in London, contracted to provide forensic medical services for the Metropolitan Police Service. Data about all incidents were anonymized.	Ninety six (73%) Forensic Medical Examiners responded. Of these 18% were Principal grade, the remainder were Senior (24%), Standard (35%) and Assistant (23%). Thirty eight NMI were reported by 27 Forensic Medical Examiners (of all levels). The initial reason for police contact was recorded as alcohol (n=8), theft and robbery (n=7), warrants (n=4), violence (n=3), traffic violations (n=2) and single cases of drugs, murder and immigration offences. Of the main perceived cause of each NMI, illicit drugs were involved in 12/38, alcohol in 17/38, deliberate self-harm in 11/38, issues concerning searches, checks or rousing in 8/38, failure of inter-agency communications in 5/38, and possible resource issues in 4/38. In a number of cases more than one factor was involved.	The information established about NMI is broadly consistent with documented patterns of deaths in police custody in England and Wales which supports the validity of the data. The next stage of this research will be a prospective six month study in which NMI will be analysed in order to learn lessons which may be utilised to attempt to prevent potentially avoidable deaths in police custody.",Remaining,0,0

The objective of this study was to review existing and identify novel radiological and clinical characteristics of CM1 patients that associate syrinx development and surgical intervention.	Patients with Chiari I malformation diagnosed on imaging between 0 and 18 years were retrospectively reviewed from January 1, 2007 to February 12, 2020. Participants were included if they had a baseline MRI of the head and spine prior to surgical intervention if required. Forty age-matched controls with cranial imaging were identified for comparison. Imaging parameters and clinical symptoms were recorded.	A total of 122 CM1 patients were included in this study. Of the 122 patients, 28 (23%) had syrinx, and 27 (22%) had surgery. The following imaging parameters associated with syrinx and surgical intervention were identified: midbrain length (P < 0.001; P = 0.032), the obex position (P = 0.002; P < 0.001) and medullary kinking (P = 0.041; P < 0.001).

Youths with bipolar disorder (BD) also present with irritability, but with an episodic course. To date, it is not clear whether aberrant white matter microstructure-a well-replicated finding in BD-can be observed in DMDD and relates to symptoms of irritability.	We acquired diffusion tensor imaging data from 118 participants (BD = 36, DMDD = 44, healthy volunteers (HV = 38). Images of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were processed with tract-based spatial statistics controlling for age and sex. The data were also used to train Gaussian process classifiers to predict diagnostic group.	In BD vs DMDD, FA in the corticospinal tract was reduced. In DMDD vs HV, reductions in FA and AD were confined to the anterior corpus callosum. In BD vs HV, widespread reductions in FA and increased RD were observed. FA in the anterior corpus callosum and corticospinal tract was negatively associated with irritability. The Gaussian process classifier could not discriminate between BD and DMDD, but achieved 68% accuracy in predicting DMDD vs HV and 75% accuracy in predicting BD vs HV.	Aberrant white matter microstructure was associated with both categorical diagnosis and the dimension of irritability. Alterations in DMDD were regionally discrete and related to reduced AD. In BD, we observed widespread increases in RD, supporting the hypothesis of altered myelination in BD. These findings will contribute to the pathophysiological understanding of DMDD and its differentiation from BD.

Therefore, maintaining the quality of life (QoL) of caregivers is an integral part of dementia care.	To explore the relationship between the QoL of people with dementia and their caregivers in Indonesia.	This is a cross-sectional study using binary correlations to analyze the relationship between people with dementia and caregivers' QoL. Conducted in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, the subjects were 42 people diagnosed with dementia according to the PPDGJ-III (adapted from the ICD 10) and 42 primary caregivers with at least 6 hours duration of caregiving per day. The QoL of people with dementia was measured by EuroQol-5D and VAS EQ-5D, while severity of dementia was measured by MMSE. Caregivers underwent an interview using WHO Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) and NPI.	Most caregivers were women, aged 40-70 years old. The study found caregivers' QoL environmental domain strongly correlated with people with dementia's QoL (r = 0.839). Severity of dementia had a strong correlation with caregivers' QoL physical domain (r = 0.946). Age, duration of caregiving per day, period of care provided by caregivers, and caregiver's distress had a strong correlation with caregiver QoL for specific domains.	There was a strong correlation between people with dementia's QoL and caregiver QoL, so in managing dementia, clinicians should consider caregivers' wellbeing as an essential part significantly affecting the quality of elderly care improvement.",Remaining,0,0

The aims of the present study were (1) to establish normative data, and (2) to compare the scores of patients and healthy controls to assess whether or not the questionnaire is able to discriminate between these populations. The normative sample included 213 healthy participants. The patient group included 63 cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, who were compared to a subsample of 63 matched healthy controls. The questionnaire had good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alphas = .74-.91). The oldest patients had significantly more cognitive complaints (p < .001). Cognitive complaints were significantly related with Trail Making Test scores (p < .001). Furthermore, the FACT-Cog subscales correlated significantly with anxiety and depression. Patients had more complaints than matched controls on the subscales Perceived Cognitive Impairments (p = .01), Impact on Quality of Life (p = .001) and Perceived Cognitive Abilities (p = .027).

The WD locus (WND) has previously been linked to esterase D (ESD) and localized to 13q14-22. With the large Centre d'Etude Polymorphisme Humain cohort, a refined map of DNA markers from this region was constructed, with the following locus order: D13S1-D13S21-D13S22-D13S10-ESD-RB-WND-D 13S26-D13S12-D13S2. A significant excess of male recombination was observed between D13S21 and D13S22. Intervals distal to D13S22 showed an excess of female recombination. When these markers were tested on 19 WD families from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, the two closest loci were shown to be RB and D13S26. The retinoblastoma gene locus (RB) was shown to be proximal to WND at a distance of 4.4 centimorgans (cM), and D13S26 was placed distal to WND at a distance of 4.0 cM.

473,8733222,Psychological medicine,Causal attributions about common somatic sensations among frequent general practice attenders.,"The causal attributions that people make about bodily symptoms or sensations are likely to influence their decisions whether or not to consult a doctor. Previous research has supported the model that people tend initially to look for external or environmental explanations for bodily sensations (normalizing attributions) and only if this process fails do they search for attributions internal to themselves (somatic or psychological attributions). This study tested two hypotheses about frequent general practice attenders: (1) compared with others, they are more likely to make somatic attributions and less likely to make normalizing ones; and (2) given a bodily symptom together with a somatic explanation, frequent attenders will have greater difficulty than others in finding reasons why the given (pathological) explanation is untrue. The frequent attenders' group had themselves initiated an average of 12 general practice visits in the 12 months before assessment, while a control group of infrequent attenders had not made appointments to see their general practitioner for an average of 24 months. The results provide partial support for the hypotheses. Frequent attenders generated significantly fewer normalizing explanations for a series of common bodily sensations than the comparison group, although the two groups did not differ in their somatic attributions. Given a common bodily sensation and an accompanying pathological explanation, the frequent attenders were less able than the control group to generate reasons why the given explanation might be untrue.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG repeat in the first exon of the SCA7 gene.	Clinical and related examinations were performed in all affected or at-risk individuals from 4 Chinese families presenting with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and decreased visual acuity. The size of the (CAG)(n) array of the SCA7 gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and related techniques in the 4 families and 67 healthy controls. The relationship between expanded repeat number and age of onset was statistically analyzed.	The SCA7 mutation was identified in 2 families. Clinical study revealed that great variation occurred in the age of onset, initial symptoms, and associated signs. Meanwhile, the analysis of 11 parent-child couples demonstrated the existence of marked anticipation. Some distinct retinal changes were noted in 2 affected patients. All SCA7 patients in our series exhibited expanded CAG repeats, ranging from 44 to 85 repeats, with a strong negative correlation between repeat size and age of onset. Repeat lengths of expanded alleles showed somatic mosaicism in leukocyte DNA. There were some subtle clinical differences between the SCA7-positive and -negative cases.	Clinical variation occurred not only among the SCA7 families but also within the same kindred.

Using the FHC microTargeting platform as a model, we introduce a fully customized design that has all the constructive elements positioned by a computer algorithm, according to the planned trajectories, anchoring points, and anatomic constraints. All the constructive elements form a single-body fixture, which allows for the efficient implantation of multiple depth electrodes following trajectories having a wide range of orientations. We aim at evaluating the safety and accuracy of this stereotactic system in a clinical setting.	A total of 173 depth electrodes were implanted in 21 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Matlab and DEETO software packages were used to postoperatively evaluate the targeting accuracy. Automatic detection of electrode locations eliminated any subjectivity in calculating the targeting errors.	As a result of using custom geometry of the stereotactic platform, the new design is optimized for each patient and streamlines the surgical procedures. The most important results characterizing the platform's accuracy are the values of 1.22 mm for the median lateral target point localization error and 1.17 mm for the median lateral entry point localization error.

The prolactin (PRL) response to d,l-fenfluramine (60 mg p.o.) was used as an index of central serotonergic function. The NPI aggression score, NPI irritability score, and Behavioral Pathology in AD aggression score were positively correlated to prolactin concentrations following fenfluramine challenge (r(S) =.61, p =.003; r(S) =.53, p =.012; and r(S) =.47, p =.029 respectively).

This article summarizes the main surveys and attempts to interpret the increase of prevalence from a methodological perspective.	Regional and national surveys conducted in China during 1960-1990 focused on severe mental disorders and revealed very low and stable rates of disorders. By contrast, those performed in the last decade, whether psychiatrists or lay interviewers were used, have shown much higher and more 'reliable' rates comparable to those found in high-income countries. This is especially so for depression and anxiety disorders.	Given the sociopolitical turmoil that had previously plagued people in China, the dramatic rise in prevalence estimates of mental disorders in recent years cannot be simply interpreted as a substantive deterioration of mental health following rapid social change. Global and local factors that shape research methodology aimed at showing that mental disorders are common may play an important role in the dramatic increase.

American journal of neuroradiology,The radiologic assessment of trigeminal neuropathy.,"The clinical and radiologic records of 76 patients with trigeminal neuropathy and an abnormal imaging study (CT and/or MR) were analyzed retrospectively. The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) was divided into proximal (brainstem, preganglionic, gasserian ganglion, and cavernous sinus) and distal (extracranial V1, V2, and V3) segments. Lesions were organized according to segments and correlated with the type and distribution of clinical symptoms or signs. The purpose of the study was to (1) determine the efficacy of clinical localization of cranial nerve V lesions, (2) compare CT and MR for cranial nerve V imaging, (3) develop an MR protocol for effective cranial nerve V imaging, and (4) construct a differential diagnosis by anatomic segment for lesions of cranial nerve V. Clinical localization was found to be extremely inaccurate. CT was not as sensitive as MR for lesions involving the basal cisterns and skull base and will not detect the most common brainstem lesions (small infarcts and multiple sclerosis plaques). The MR protocol developed does not rely heavily on clinical localization. On the basis of lesions found in this series, a differential diagnosis by segment was developed. Patients with cranial nerve V symptoms should undergo MR imaging according to the protocol provided in this article. CT is not as effective as MR in imaging some cranial nerve V segments. Clinical localization is inaccurate.",Remaining,0,0

The outcomes of recent studies in the general Dutch population as well as recent HCV data from specific risk groups including migrants, men who have sex with men (MSM) and injecting drug users (IDUs), were implemented in a modified version of the Workbook Method (a spreadsheet originally designed for HIV estimations), to estimate Dutch HCV seroprevalence. The estimated national seroprevalence of HCV was 0·22% (min 0·07%, max 0·37%), corresponding to 28 100 (min n = 9600, max n = 48 000) HCV-infected individuals in The Netherlands.

490,9514295,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",Alcohol consumption and sexually transmitted disease risk behavior: partner mix among male Korean university students.,"This study examined alcohol consumption and sexually transmitted disease risk behavior as related to prostitute visits and sex partner mix among male Korean university students in 1993 to 1994.	Questionnaires were completed by a representative sample of 1103 university students in Seoul. Lifetime sexually transmitted disease risk behavior was categorized as none, only one, and multiple sexual experiences with prostitutes, whereas risk according to partner mix was classified as no sexual experience with prostitutes, sexual experience with prostitutes only, and with both prostitutes and girlfriends. The proportional odds model was applied to the data.	A total of 25.8% of the university students had visited prostitutes--17.6% visited twice or more, and 12.9% had sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends. Heavier alcohol consumption was significantly related to multiple visits to prostitutes (odds ratio = 1.71) and to sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends (odds ratio = 2.30).	In this first systematic study of the association between alcohol consumption and sexual experiences among Korean male university students, alcohol use was associated with risky sexual behaviors, and with first and most recent sexual experience with prostitutes, supporting our hypotheses.	In Asia, where men frequently have sex with prostitutes, there is a direct and statistically significant dose-response relationship between frequency of sex with prostitutes and HIV-1 seroprevalence. Young Korean men are reported to routinely have sex with prostitutes. Findings are reported from an examination of alcohol consumption and sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk behavior as related to prostitute visits and sex partner mix among 1095 representative male Korean university students aged 17-32 years, of mean age 22.1 years, during 1993-94. The men were drawn from 4 universities in Seoul. 25.8% of surveyed university students had visited prostitutes, 17.6% at least 2 times, and 12.9% had sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends. Heavier alcohol consumption was significantly related to multiple visits to prostitutes and to sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends.",Remaining,0,0
491,20346443,Biological psychiatry,Characterization of a family with rare deletions in CNTNAP5 and DOCK4 suggests novel risk loci for autism and dyslexia.,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by social, communication, and behavioral deficits and complex genetic etiology. A recent study of 517 ASD families implicated DOCK4 by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association and a microdeletion in an affected sibling pair.	The DOCK4 microdeletion on 7q31.1 was further characterized in this family using QuantiSNP analysis of 1M SNP array data and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Extended family members were tested by polymerase chain reaction amplification of junction fragments. DOCK4 dosage was measured in additional samples using SNP arrays. Since QuantiSNP analysis identified a novel CNTNAP5 microdeletion in the same affected sibling pair, this gene was sequenced in 143 additional ASD families. Further polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis included 380 ASD cases and suitable control subjects.	The maternally inherited microdeletion encompassed chr7:110,663,978-111,257,682 and led to a DOCK4-IMMP2L fusion transcript. It was also detected in five extended family members with no ASD. However, six of nine individuals with this microdeletion had poor reading ability, which prompted us to screen 606 other dyslexia cases. This led to the identification of a second DOCK4 microdeletion co-segregating with dyslexia. Assessment of genomic background in the original ASD family detected a paternal 2q14.3 microdeletion disrupting CNTNAP5 that was also transmitted to both affected siblings. Analysis of other ASD cohorts revealed four additional rare missense changes in CNTNAP5. No exonic deletions of DOCK4 or CNTNAP5 were seen in 2091 control subjects.	This study highlights two new risk factors for ASD and dyslexia and demonstrates the importance of performing a high-resolution assessment of genomic background, even after detection of a rare and likely damaging microdeletion using a targeted approach.",Remaining,0,0

The present study reviewed the records of 100 male and female cocaine abusers admitted to a private substance abuse treatment program between 1987 and 1989. Patterns of cocaine use and levels of impairment were found to be similar for men and women, with male cocaine abusers more likely to abuse additional substances. Male cocaine abusers were employed more frequently than women and held higher status jobs despite equivalent levels of education. Female cocaine abusers were more likely to be diagnosed with concurrent psychiatric disorders and were more likely to report family histories of substance abuse. Both groups produced elevations on MMPI scales indicating depression, anxiety, paranoid features, and acting-out tendencies. These data suggest that while male and female cocaine abusers show similarities on some measures, there are significant gender differences that may have implications for both research and treatment.",Remaining,0,0

Though barriers to implementing systematic screening for alcohol and drug use have been examined in urban settings, less is known about screening in rural primary care.	To identify current screening practices, barriers, facilitators, and recommendations for the implementation of substance use screening in rural federally qualified health centers (FQHCs).	As part of a multi-phase study implementing electronic health record-integrated screening, focus groups (n = 60: all stakeholder groups) and individual interviews (n = 10 primary care providers (PCPs)) were conducted.	Three stakeholder groups (PCPs, medical assistants (MAs), and patients) at three rural FQHCs in Maine.	Focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed. Themes surrounding current substance use screening practices, barriers to screening, and recommendations for implementation were identified and organized by the Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework.	Identifying the problem: Stakeholders unanimously agreed that screening is important, and that universal screening is preferred to targeted approaches. Adapting to the local context: PCPs and MAs agreed that screening should be done annually. Views were mixed regarding the delivery of screening; patients preferred self-administered, tablet-based screening, while MAs and PCPs were divided between self-administered and face-to-face approaches. Assessing barriers: For patients, barriers to screening centered around a perceived lack of rapport with providers, which contributed to concerns about trust, judgment, and privacy. For PCPs and MAs, barriers included lack of comfort, training, and preparedness to address screening results and offer treatment.	Though stakeholders agree on the importance of implementing universal screening, concerns about the patient-provider relationship, the consequences of disclosure, and privacy appear heightened by the rural context. Findings highlight that strong relationships with providers are critical for patients, while in-clinic resources and training are needed to increase provider comfort and preparedness to address substance use.",Remaining,0,0
494,32012170,PLoS medicine,Association of coincident self-reported mental health problems and alcohol intake with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality: A Norwegian pooled population analysis.,"The disease burden attributable to mental health problems and to excess or harmful alcohol use is considerable. Despite a strong relationship between these 2 important factors in population health, there are few studies quantifying the mortality risk associated with their co-occurrence in the general population. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality according to self-reported mental health problems and alcohol intake in the general population.	We followed 243,372 participants in Norwegian health surveys (1994-2002) through 2014 for all-cause and CVD mortality by data linkage to national registries. The mean (SD) age at the time of participation in the survey was 43.9 (10.6) years, and 47.8% were men. During a mean (SD) follow-up period of 16.7 (3.2) years, 6,587 participants died from CVD, and 21,376 died from all causes. Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs according to a mental health index (low, 1.00-1.50; high, 2.01-4.00; low score is favourable) based on the General Health Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and according to self-reported alcohol intake (low, <2; light, 2-11.99; moderate, 12-23.99; high, ≥24 grams/day). HRs were adjusted for age, sex, educational level, marital status, and CVD risk factors. Compared to a reference group with low mental health index score and low alcohol intake, HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality were 0.93 (0.89, 0.97; p = 0.001), 1.00 (0.92, 1.09; p = 0.926), and 1.14 (0.96, 1.35; p = 0.119) for low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. HRs (95% CIs) were 1.22 (1.14, 1.31; p < 0.001), 1.24 (1.15, 1.33; p < 0.001), 1.43 (1.23, 1.66; p < 0.001), and 2.29 (1.87, 2.80; p < 0.001) for high index score combined with low, light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. For CVD mortality, HRs (95% CIs) were 0.93 (0.86, 1.00; p = 0.058), 0.90 (0.76, 1.07; p = 0.225), and 0.95 (0.67, 1.33; p = 0.760) for a low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively, and 1.11 (0.98, 1.25; p = 0.102), 0.97 (0.83, 1.13; p = 0.689), 1.01 (0.71, 1.44; p = 0.956), and 1.78 (1.14, 2.78; p = 0.011) for high index score combined with low, light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. HRs for the combination of a high index score and high alcohol intake (HRs: 2.29 for all-cause and 1.78 for CVD mortality) were 64% (95% CI 53%, 74%; p < 0.001) and 69% (95% CI 42%, 97%; p < 0.001) higher than expected for all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, respectively, under the assumption of a multiplicative interaction structure. A limitation of our study is that the findings were based on average reported intake of alcohol without accounting for the drinking pattern.	In the general population, the mortality rates associated with more mental health problems and a high alcohol intake were increased when the risk factors occurred together.",Remaining,0,0
495,32279420,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,HOTAIR/miR-125 axis-mediated Hexokinase 2 expression promotes chemoresistance in human glioblastoma.,"Drug resistance is one of the major obstacles in glioblastoma (GBM) treatments using temozolomide (TMZ) based conventional chemotherapy. Recent studies revealed that Hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated glycolysis is one of the sources, as the association of chemoresistance and the expression of HK2 was confirmed in multiple cancers. However, there has been little knowledge of the functional contribution of HK2 to TMZ resistance in GBM. In our study, we found that HK2 expression is crucial for GBM proliferation and chemoresistance. In contrast to the healthy brain, HK2 expression is much higher in human GBM, especially in those patients with GBM recurrence. High HK2 expression is negatively related to the overall survival in GBM patients. HK2 depletion in GBM cells suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to TMZ-induced apoptosis. Both HK2-mediated glycolysis and mitochondria permeability transition pore opening (MPTP) were associated with its function in chemoresistance. Furthermore, we also revealed that the abnormal expression of HK2 was modulated by the expression of HOTAIR, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The absence of HOTAIR in GBM cells suppressed the HK2 expression in protein and mRNA level and, therefore, inhibited the cell proliferation and enhanced the cytotoxicity of TMZ both in vivo and in vitro. HOTAIR promoted the expression of HK2 by targeting mir-125, which suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased the TMZ-induced apoptosis. These findings shed light on a new therapeutic strategy in modulating HOTAIR/miR-125, which may interfere with the expression of HK2, and enhance the therapeutic sensitivity of GBM to TMZ.",Remaining,0,0
496,15970229,Social science & medicine (1982),"Individual socio-economic status, community socio-economic status and stroke in New Zealand: a case control study.","There is considerable debate about the association between individual socio-economic status, community socio-economic status and health. The current study examines individual data from a case-control study of stroke (n = 3489) conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. The study sought to identify whether individual socio-economic status (as measured by income from lifetime occupation) and community socio-economic status (measured in a number of ways) predicts the onset of stroke both independently and after controlling for individual risk factors (e.g., smoking, obesity and hypertension). Logistic regression results show that individual socio-economic status and all of the community socio-economic status measures predict the onset of stroke before controlling for individual risk factors. However, there is a high correlation between the various measures of community socio-economic status. Stepwise regression results suggest that average household income is the measure of community-level socio-economic status with the greatest predictive power. The results suggest that individual income and average household income are significant predictors of onset of stroke both independently and after controlling for behavioural and medical risk factors. Logistic regression analysis of the pathway suggests that individual income is a significant predictor of smoking and obesity, and that community socio-economic status is a significant predictor of heart disease, heavy drinking, diabetes, smoking and obesity.",Remaining,0,0

Participants were 448 patients referred to a private practice in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada for psychological or neuropsychological assessment, related to evaluation of impairment and disability resulting from a work-related or non-work related accident. All patients were involved in some form of compensation claim at the time of their evaluation. All patients completed two tests designed to detect exaggerated cognitive deficits, the Computerized Assessment of Response Bias (CARB) and the Word Memory Test (WMT) as part of their evaluation. The diagnostic groups included 322 head injury cases, varying from very minor to very severe. Normative data for the smell test were derived from 126 patients with orthopedic injuries who passed both the CARB and the WMT. Patients with more severe traumatic brain injuries were 10-12 times more likely to have olfactory deficits than persons with trivial to mild head injuries. In a subgroup of patients who failed either the CARB or the WMT, there was no relationship between injury severity and total scores on the smell test. Therefore, the dose-response relationship between brain injury severity and olfactory deficits is severely attenuated when patients who are probably exaggerating their cognitive deficits are included in the analyses. Those patients with trivial to mild head injuries who demonstrated adequate effort on both the CARB and the WMT were no more likely to show olfactory deficits than the non-head-injured orthopedic control subjects. Therefore, anosmia following mild traumatic brain injury should not be concluded from self-reports or from tests of smell unless tests of effort have been passed. Effort should also be controlled in group studies of olfaction.",Remaining,0,0

A new stroke imaging protocol was initiated at Emory University Hospital including computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and computed tomographic perfusion (CTP). All patients presenting within 4.5 hours from last known normal time with suspected stroke were prospectively identified. Impact of CTA and CTP on the clinical management was recorded prospectively by stroke team members.	During the study period, 87 patients met eligibility criteria for the CTA/CTP protocol, of which 83 (95%) underwent this upfront comprehensive imaging protocol and 30 (34%) received IV thrombolytics. Overall, stroke team members reported that CTA and/or CTP aided their clinical management in 39 (47%) cases, including aiding in identification of a nonstroke diagnosis (n = 18), triage to the neurologic intensive care unit (n = 9), early triage to endovascular therapy (n = 4), and initiation of IV thrombolytic for low National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score with large vessel occlusion (n = 3). Door to needle time ≤60 minutes was achieved in only 18% of patients receiving IV thrombolysis during the study period, but had improved to 44% in the subsequent 6-month period.	An upfront CTA/CTP protocol aided stroke team decision-making in nearly half of cases. Implementation of a CTA/CTP protocol was associated with a learning curve of 6 months before door to needle time ≤60 minutes returned to similar rates as the pre-CTA/CTP protocol.",Remaining,0,0

Complaints of snoring are examined, and its prevalence, risk factors and screening reliability are discussed. The subjects who participated in the study were 6445 new outpatients from a general hospital. They were asked to answer a sleep questionnaire that consisted of 34 items with seven demographic items; each item was composed of four grades of frequency. In order to offset possible seasonal variations in sleep habits, data were collected across four seasons. Sleep patterns, insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders were covered. Habitual snoring was seen in 16.0% of males and 6.5% of females. Male predominance was noted. From these data, the relationship between habitual snoring and sleep complaints was statistically analyzed. Habitual snorers (HS) were observed to wake up more frequently during sleep (17.8% of males, 21.5% of females) than were non-habitual snorers (NHS; 6.6% of males, 9.7% of females). Mid-sleep awakening of HS was also more frequent than it was for NHS; however, there were no differences in difficulty in falling asleep and early morning awakening. Body mass index, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were also correlated with habitual snoring.",Remaining,0,0

To further examine the role of OPTN in ALS, we sought to identify novel ALS variants in OPTN and examine their potential for pathogenicity in vitro. Whole exome sequence data from 74 familial ALS cases were analysed for the presence of novel OPTN mutations. Pathogenicity was assessed by analysing effects on Golgi fragmentation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-linked CHOP activation, and cellular localization of optineurin in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells expressing mutant optineurin. We identified a novel heterozygous missense mutation in OPTN (c.883G > T, p.Val295Phe) in a single familial ALS case. This mutation induced recognized cellular features of ALS pathogenesis including Golgi fragmentation and ER stress in NSC-34 cells. In conclusion, the identification of a novel OPTN mutation in an Australian ALS family, and its capacity to induce ALS-like pathological features in vitro, further strengthens evidence for the role of optineurin in the pathogenesis of ALS.",Remaining,0,0

A secondary aim was to use the emerging themes in service planning and to develop an evaluation tool. Focus groups and individual interviews with women in receipt of psychiatric services in Croydon were used. The findings suggest continuity with both negative and positive aspects of institutional care described before the policy of community care was introduced. The attempts to 'normalize' institutional care by desegregating wards appear rather to have compounded problems faced by women. Women were clear about what they felt they wanted and needed. Women are dissatisfied about many aspects of care aside from the problems associated specifically with mixed sex wards. This suggests that sexual segregation of wards alone is a necessary but an insufficient measure to improve inpatient care. The findings can inform development of a women-only service in Croydon and of a tool to evaluate it.,Remaining,0,0

By light microscopy the tumours were composed of agranular cells and generally PAS negative cytoplasm. The immunofluorescence technique revealed the presence of immunoreactive FSH (beta-subunit) alone in two cases, of both FSH and LH in six cases with immunoreactive beta endorphin in two of them. By electron microscopy, the cells contained an often dilated moderately or well developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, secretory granules measuring 150 nm to 200 nm which varied in electron density, and numerous microtubules. Basal plasma FSH and LH levels were simultaneously elevated in two cases; FSH levels alone were elevated in two cases; in three cases, both FSH and LH plasma values were normal. FSH and LH intratumour concentrations were simultaneously elevated in five cases; FSH alone was elevated in two cases. In all cases, the concentrations of the other hormones were negligible, except in two cases where beta endorphin concentration was elevated. The comparison of the immunocytochemical findings, the hormonal plasma levels and intratumour concentrations showed a good relationship between the immunoreactivity of the tumour and the intratumour RIA.

A total of 3,212 AIS patients enrolled from December 2013 to May 2014 across 22 hospitals in Suzhou city were included in the present study. Hyperfibrinogenemia was defined as having a serum fibrinogen＞4.0g/L. Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of hyperfibrinogenemia on all-cause in-hospital mortality and poor discharge outcome (modified Rankin Scale score≥3) in AIS patients.	During hospitalization, 106 patients (3.3%) died from all-cause and 1226 (38.2%) patients experienced poor functional outcome at discharge. Multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, white blood cell count and other covariates, showed that hyperfibrinogenemia was associated with a 1.76-fold increase in the risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.81; P-value=0.019).

The Nutrition Cohorts 1 (NC1) and 2 (NC2) are longitudinal observational mother-child cohorts in the Republic of Seychelles. Maternal serum LC-PUFA was measured at 28 weeks gestation and genotyping for rs174537 (FADS1), rs174561 (FADS1), rs3834458 (FADS1-FADS2) and rs174575 (FADS2) was performed in both cohorts. The children completed the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II) at 30 months in NC1 and at 20 months in NC2. Complete data were available for 221 and 1310 mothers from NC1 and NC2 respectively. With increasing number of rs3834458 minor alleles, maternal concentrations of AA were significantly decreased (NC1 p=0.004; NC2 p<0.001) and precursor:product ratios for linoleic acid (LA) (18:2n-6)-to-AA (NC1 p<0.001; NC2 p<0.001) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) (18:3n-3)-to-DHA were increased (NC2 p=0.028). There were no significant associations between maternal FADS genotype and BSID-II scores in either cohort. A trend for improved PDI was found among infants born to mothers with the minor rs3834458 allele.In these high fish-eating cohorts, genetic variability in FADS genes was associated with maternal AA status measured in serum and a subtle association of the FADS genotype was found with neurodevelopment.",Remaining,0,0

510,15118119,Radiology,Carotid perfusion CT with balloon occlusion and acetazolamide challenge test: feasibility.,"Carotid balloon test occlusion (BTO) is used to assess the collateral circulation and cerebrovascular reserve in patients in whom carotid artery occlusion is contemplated. Eight patients in whom the test was successful were evaluated with perfusion computed tomography (CT) in the resting state and after acetazolamide challenge. Three of the patients showed symmetric blood flow and normal response to acetazolamide. One of them underwent permanent carotid occlusion and did not develop any delayed ischemic stroke. The remaining five patients showed asymmetric blood flow. One of them had markedly low blood flow and abnormal response to acetazolamide. The patient developed ipsilateral hemispheric stroke following permanent carotid occlusion after the superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass graft occluded. In the other four patients, the steal phenomenon was seen in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Although definitive quantitative values for perfusion CT are not yet standardized, it may be feasible to predict that the patients with symmetric blood flow and normal acetazolamide-enhanced challenge test results will do well after permanent carotid occlusion. Patients with asymmetric blood flow and abnormal response to the acetazolamide challenge test may require a revascularization procedure to protect them from delayed ischemic stroke.",Remaining,0,0
511,28447919,The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception,Postpartum dyspareunia and sexual functioning: a prospective cohort study.,"Sexual functioning is an important concern for women in the postpartum period. The aim of this research was to investigate the prevalence and determinants of dyspareunia and sexual dysfunction before and after childbirth.	Between November 2013 and April 2014, 109 women in their third trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at Ghent University Hospital. Dyspareunia, sexual functioning and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated at enrolment and again 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Sexual functioning and QOL were assessed using validated self-report questionnaires: the Female Sexual Function Index and the Short Form-36 health survey. Dyspareunia was evaluated by a specific self-developed questionnaire.	One hundred and nine women were enrolled; respectively, 71 (65.1%), 66 (60.6%) and 64 (58.7%) women returned the questionnaires prepartum, and 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Sexual functioning at 6 weeks was predictive of sexual functioning at 6 months postpartum (rs = 0.345, p = .015). The prevalence of dyspareunia in the third trimester of pregnancy, and 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum was, respectively, 32.8%, 51.0% and 40.7%. The severity of pain decreased significantly between 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum (p = .003). In the first 6 weeks postpartum, the degree of dyspareunia was significantly associated with breastfeeding (p = .045) and primiparity (p = .020). At 6 months, only the association with primiparity remained significant (p = .022).	The impaired postpartum sexual functioning, the high prevalence of dyspareunia postpartum and their impact on QOL indicate the need for further investigation and extensive counselling of pregnant women, especially primiparous women, about sexuality after childbirth.",Remaining,0,0

This study also examined the effects of ADHD on the academic and social lives of college students. The sample consisted of 219 university students. These students were interviewed by a psychiatrist with regard to ADHD symptoms according to the DSM-IV. The Adult ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS), the Teen Interpersonal Influence Scale, and a demographic information form were used as measurement devices. The ADHD and control groups were classified in three different ways: (1) met the ADHD criteria for both Clinical Diagnosis and the ASRS; (2) met only the criteria for Clinical Diagnosis; or (3) met only the criteria of the ASRS. Our research shows that individuals with ADHD experience more problems with money management and are more affected by the media, friends, and brands compared with individuals without ADHD. Smoking and alcohol use disorders, accidents, being held back, and disciplinary actions often accompany ADHD in college students. To the best of our knowledge, the shopping attitudes of young adults with ADHD and the influence of the media, peers, family, and brands have not been studied until now.",Remaining,0,0

If untreated, WD, which is initially a liver disease, can turn into a multi-systemic disease with neurological involvement. Very few studies have described cognitive impairment in WD. The aim of this study is to report the cognitive profile of 31 treated WD patients.	Patients were classed into two groups using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS): WD patients without neurological signs (WD-N(-)) (n=13), and WD patients with neurological signs (WD-N(+)) (n=18). The patients participated in a neuropsychological assessment evaluating memory, executive function and visuo-spatial abilities.	Both groups performed well for verbal intelligence and episodic memory skills. However, the majority of these patients exhibited altered performance for at least one cognitive test, particularly in the executive domain. The WD-N(+) group performed less well than the WD-N(-) group on cognitive tests involving rapid motor function, abstract thinking, working memory and top-down inhibitory control.	Cognitive impairment in treated WD patients essentially affects executive function involving fronto-striatal circuits. Verbal intelligence and episodic memory abilities seem to be remarkably preserved. Neuropsychological assessment is a valuable tool to evaluate the presence and the consequences of these cognitive impairments in WD patients with or without neurological signs in the course of this chronic disease.",Remaining,0,0

The gene responsible for MEN 1 syndrome was recently identified and cloned. Low rates of MEN 1 gene mutations and deletions have been reported in sporadic pituitary adenomas. To elucidate the role of the MEN 1 gene in the pathogenesis of MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors, we examined pituitary adenomas from 11 MEN 1 patients for the presence of 11q13 allelic loss. Ten of the 11 pituitary tumors were informative by PCR-based loss of heterozygosity analysis. Using a combination of family pedigree analysis and restriction analysis directed at the mutated allele in 8 of the 10 informative cases, it was demonstrated in all 8 cases that it is the wild-type allele that undergoes deletion. All 11 tumors, 4 of which were growth hormone secreting, were additionally analyzed for mutation in the Gs alpha subunit (gsp) gene. None of the tumors (0 of 11 tumors) revealed a gsp gene mutation. Therefore, genetic alterations of the MEN 1 gene seem to play a dominant role in MEN 1-associated pituitary tumorigenesis, whereas gsp gene mutations do not seem to be a frequent event in either growth hormone-secreting or other types of MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors. These results suggest that MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors develop via genetic pathways that differ from those of most sporadic pituitary tumors.",Remaining,0,0

Contrary to previous studies no significant differences occurred on the locus of control measure. It was hypothesized that problem gamblers would be more extraverted and intuitive than social gamblers. However, none of the four scales on the Myers Briggs Type Indicator showed a significant difference between the groups. These findings and the results of earlier studies are compared and discussed. Earlier studies are difficult to interpret because of inappropriate or inconsistent controls. It is suggested that future personality studies of problem gamblers differentiate between different types of gambling and different types of problem gamblers.",Remaining,0,0

PD patients underwent comprehensive neuropsychological and neurological evaluations and ACE-R assessment.	The ACE-R was superior to the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) in detecting PD-MCI, with a cutoff score of ≤93 offering a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 64%. The utility of the ACE-R in detecting PD-MCI is largely influenced by the fluency sub-domain score, and has optimal discriminability when utilized in patients with lower levels of education (≤12 years of formal schooling).	The ACE-R must be used cautiously as a screening tool for PD-MCI, with results being most influenced by its fluency sub-domain score and patient education levels.",Remaining,0,0
517,16546355,Schizophrenia research,The influence of religious affiliation on time to first treatment and hospitalization.,"Longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) has been associated with treatment-refractory illness, significant cognitive decline, and poorer long-term outcomes. There are many factors, including social and cultural, that promote longer DUP. To date, there have been no studies to evaluate religion's effect on DUP. In this study, we evaluated the effect of certain religious affiliations and degree of religious practice on the DUP.	A total of 195 patients were recruited aged 18 to 45 years with the presence of at least 1 psychotic symptom (delusions, hallucinations, or prominent thought disorder). Patients were evaluated on their religious practice prior to the index episode using a Likert-style scale. Using a similar scale, patients were asked about their religious affiliation categorized as Catholic, Protestant, or neither.	Correlational analysis revealed that the time to first treatment and time to first hospitalization were both was negatively related to degree of religious practice (r = -0.15, N = 161, p < 0.05 and r = -0.18, N = 161, p < 0.05, respectively). Between-group comparisons revealed longer DUP in the Protestant group compared to the no affiliation and Catholic groups (p = 0.05).	From our results, it appears that the degree of religious practice does not affect length of time to treatment in psychotic patients. However, having a Protestant religious affiliation is strongly associated with having a greater delay in treatment seeking for psychosis. Factors contributing to a longer DUP in this group warrant further study.",Remaining,0,0

519,33498908,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Brain Asymmetry Detection and Machine Learning Classification for Diagnosis of Early Dementia.,"Early identification of degenerative processes in the human brain is considered essential for providing proper care and treatment. This may involve detecting structural and functional cerebral changes such as changes in the degree of asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres. Changes can be detected by computational algorithms and used for the early diagnosis of dementia and its stages (amnestic early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), Alzheimer's Disease (AD)), and can help to monitor the progress of the disease. In this vein, the paper proposes a data processing pipeline that can be implemented on commodity hardware. It uses features of brain asymmetries, extracted from MRI of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, for the analysis of structural changes, and machine learning classification of the pathology. The experiments provide promising results, distinguishing between subjects with normal cognition (NC) and patients with early or progressive dementia. Supervised machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks tested are reaching an accuracy of 92.5% and 75.0% for NC vs. EMCI, and 93.0% and 90.5% for NC vs. AD, respectively. The proposed pipeline offers a promising low-cost alternative for the classification of dementia and can be potentially useful to other brain degenerative disorders that are accompanied by changes in the brain asymmetries.",Remaining,0,0

Parents of children aged 2 to 14 years were surveyed at two general clinics between 1998 and 2000. A Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire generated validated scores for SDB and PLMS. The Conners Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-48) produced an age- and sex-adjusted Conduct Problem Index (CPI) and Hyperactivity Index.	Parents of about 1,400 children were approached; those of 872 (62%) completed the surveys. Bullying and other specific aggressive behaviors were generally two to three times more frequent among 114 children at high risk for SDB than among the remaining children. An association between high CPI and SDB scores (p <.0001) retained significance after adjustment for sleepiness, high Hyperactivity Index, stimulant use, or PLMS scores. Analogous results were obtained for the association between high CPI and PLMS scores.	Conduct problems were associated with symptoms of SDB, restless legs syndrome, and PLMS. Although these results cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship, assessment for sleep disorders may provide a new treatment opportunity for some aggressive children.",Remaining,0,0

To generate and cross-validate a blood-based screener for AD that yields acceptable accuracy across both serum and plasma.	Analysis of serum biomarker proteins were conducted on 197 Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants and 199 control participants from the Texas Alzheimer's Research Consortium (TARC) with further analysis conducted on plasma proteins from 112 AD and 52 control participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The full algorithm was derived from a biomarker risk score, clinical lab (glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, homocysteine), and demographic (age, gender, education, APOE*E4 status) data.

Despite evidence of such dissociations, experimental design in this area has not always been consistent with contemporary memory research. Within a paradigm that aimed for conceptual and methodological clarity, we presented 40 high and 38 low hypnotizable individuals with a word list either before or during hypnosis, gave them a PHA suggestion for the word list, and tested them on explicit and implicit memory tasks. In the absence of conscious recollection, highs showed equivalent levels of priming (perceptual and semantic) to lows. However, when analysis focused only on those highs who remained amnesic after the implicit memory tasks, we confirmed perceptual, but not semantic, priming. These findings highlight the impact of methodological choices on theoretical interpretations of memory performance following a suggestion for PHA.",Remaining,0,0

Seven cases are presented. HCSR is a relative condition; besides increased irritability of the receptor or target organs, susceptibility of the nerve center to ischemia probably is induced by a slow heart rate or low blood pressure in any patient with pre-existing occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Dizziness and syncope of this type represent hemodynamic TIA in contrast to thromboembolic TIA. The carotid sinus massage test is recommended for differentiating the two types of TIA; the treatments differ. At present there is no uniform management that can be applied to either TIA or HCSR routinely. Therefore, treatment should be approached on an individual basis, keeping in mind the different pathophysiologic factors operating in the specific patient.",Remaining,0,0

Eighteen consecutive patients with symptoms of acute stroke underwent PCT at admission. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all patients after 3.6 +/- 1.7 days (range, 1.5-6 days). PCT maps were generated focusing on the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) ipsilateral and contralateral to the ischemic lesion as AIFs. Infarct, penumbra, and total ischemic lesion were delineated on cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps. CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) were calculated in the ischemic regions as provided by the 3 different AIFs, the normality test was applied for the obtained parameters, and the values were correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient). Volumes of the ischemic regions (as obtained by the different AIFs) also were correlated and compared (paired t test) to the follow-up infarct volume.	The CBF and CBV values obtained by the different AIFs in the infarct, penumbra, and total ischemic lesion were significantly correlated (r=0.94-0.96, P<or=0.01). Only in the infarct region calculated MTT values were correlated (r=0.88-0.91, P<0.05) between the different AIFs groups. High correlation coefficients (r=0.79-0.91, P<0.001) were observed between the admission PCT infarct and total ischemic volume and the MRI follow-up infarct volume. ACA as AIF provided the best correlations (r=0.91, P=0.0002) with the follow-up measurements. No statistically significant difference was found between the 3 different AIF-estimated admission total ischemic volumes and the follow-up infarct volume.	The AIF selection in the ACA as well as in the ipsilateral (to the hypoperfused area) or contralateral branches of the MCA has no statistically significant impact on the calculation of the CBF, CBV values, and the volume estimation of the ischemic region in the acute stroke patients.",Remaining,0,0

There were 340 CS, 183 (27%) IP, and 157 (23%) IF patients; mean age 65 years; and 302 (44.4%) female. Of these, 587 and patients presented with TIA/IS and 93 (13.6%) had ICH. Both IP and IF patients were significantly more likely to present >24 h from symptom onset (odds ratios [ORs] vs. CS 1.87 and 2.23). IP patients more commonly had body mass indexes >30 (OR 1.94). Current smoking and excess alcohol intake were higher in CS. Hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease were significantly higher in both IP and IF groups in comparison to CS. IP patients had higher rates of AF and those with known AF were more commonly undertreated than both IF and CS patients (OR 2.24, p = 0.007). ICH was more common in IP patients (OR 2.32, p = 0.005), while more IF patients had intracranial arterial disease (OR 5.10, p < 0.001).

Build upon successful deep learning techniques, a novel brain tumor segmentation method is developed by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in a unified framework to obtain segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency. We train a deep learning based segmentation model using 2D image patches and image slices in following steps: 1) training FCNNs using image patches; 2) training CRFs as Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) using image slices with parameters of FCNNs fixed; and 3) fine-tuning the FCNNs and the CRF-RNN using image slices. Particularly, we train 3 segmentation models using 2D image patches and slices obtained in axial, coronal and sagittal views respectively, and combine them to segment brain tumors using a voting based fusion strategy. Our method could segment brain images slice-by-slice, much faster than those based on image patches. We have evaluated our method based on imaging data provided by the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) 2013, BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2016.

Using a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 19 participants completed 4 sessions where they received: (i) placebo, (ii) alcohol, (iii) AmED 500 ml energy drink (ED), and (iii) AmED 750 ml ED. Performance on measures of psychomotor function (Compensatory Tracking Task [CTT]), information processing (Digit Symbol Substitution Task [DSST]; Inspection Time Task [ITT]), and response inhibition (Brief Stop-Signal Task [Brief SST]) was assessed at ~0.05% ascending BrAC, ~0.08% peak BrAC, and ~0.05% descending BrAC.	The ITT and Brief SST showed no differential effect of AmED versus alcohol (gs < 0.30 and gs < 0.36, respectively). Moderate magnitude improvements in alcohol-induced impairment of CTT and DSST performance were observed after AmED versus alcohol on the descending BrAC limb (gs > 0.45 and gs > 0.37, respectively). A moderate magnitude decrease in DSST errors was also observed after AmED relative to alcohol at 0.050% ascending target BrAC (gs > 0.43).	Changes in cognitive function after AmED administration were dependent on the degree of intoxication, BrAC curve limb, and ED volume. Co-administration of ED doses which matched (500 ml) and exceeded (500 ml) maximum daily intake guidelines with alcohol decreased impairment of psychomotor function and global information processing after alcohol consumption. These results cannot be necessarily interpreted to suggest that people are less impaired after AmED, as behavior is the result of coordination of multiple cognitive functions, and reduced impairment on one aspect of cognition may not translate into global improvements.",Remaining,0,0

532,19194374,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,A polymorphism of the MAOA gene is associated with emotional brain markers and personality traits on an antisocial index.,"Association studies suggest that the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-uVNTR polymorphism confers risk for emotional disturbances associated with antisocial traits, particularly in males. Here, we assessed the low (MAOA-L) activity variant in relation to both brain function and a behavioral index of antisocial traits. From an initial sample of 290 healthy participants, 210 had low (MAOA-L) or high (MAOA-H) activity variants. Participants underwent a brief assessment of personality traits and event-related potential (ERP) recording during an emotion-processing task. Genotype differences in ERPs were localized using LORETA. The MAOA-L genotype was distinguished by elevated scores on the index of antisocial traits. These traits were related to altered ERPs elicited 120-280ms post-stimulus, particularly for negative emotion. Altered neural processing of anger in MAOA-L genotypes was localized to medial frontal, parietal, and superior temporo-occipital regions in males, but only to the superior occipital cortex in females. The MAOA low activity variant may increase susceptibility to antisocial traits through alterations to the neural systems for processing threat-related emotion, especially for males. Monoamines such as noradrenalin and serotonin may modulate these relationships, given that their metabolism varies according to MAOA variants, and that they modulate both emotional brain systems and antisocial aggression.",Remaining,0,0
533,19892579,Parkinsonism & related disorders,Sexual and relationship dysfunction in people with Parkinson's disease.,"To quantify the extent of self-reported sexual and relationship problems in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).	A cross-sectional correlation design was used. All people with idiopathic PD, according to the UK Brain Bank criteria, who were known to the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust PD service, were asked to participate. Those who consented were assessed by a research nurse during a six month period using a series of rating scales, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the PD Questionnaire-39, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Szasz sexual functioning scale and, for those in long-term relationships, the Golombok Rust Inventory of Marital State.	Concern over sexual function was reported in 22 (25%) of the 88 participants in the study. Males (p = 0.001) and younger people with PD (p = 0.001) were significantly more likely to report problems with sexual function. Gender (p = 0.007) and UPDRS score (p = 0.045) were significant independent predictors of relationship problems. Males with PD and those with increasing functional problems (UPDRS score) were more likely to report problems in their relationship. Disease duration and levels of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) were not associated with sexual or relationship problems.	Sexual and relationship dysfunction was a problem for many people in this study, but these problems were unlikely to be volunteered unless specifically enquired about. Problems were apparent across all age groups and genders.",Remaining,0,0
534,14689176,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,Community attitudes toward and knowledge of mental illness in South Africa.,"Although recent advances in psychiatry have increased our understanding of psychiatric disorders,many people with chronic or severe psychiatric disorders may be unaware that effective treatment is available. It is possible that ignorance and stigma prevent such persons from seeking appropriate help, and that community attitudes and beliefs play a role in determining the help-seeking behaviour and successful treatment of the mentally ill. Nevertheless, there is little research on the attitudes of lay persons toward mental illness within the South African community.	The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of the general South African public toward mental illness, specifically regarding the causes of illness and treatment options.	The study design employed a questionnaire survey. Structured interviews (n = 667) were conducted with members of the general public. One of eight vignettes, portraying depression, schizophrenia, panic disorder or substance abuse, with subtle or obvious symptoms, was presented to each respondent.	The main findings were that cases were most often conceptualised as stress-related or due to a lack of willpower rather than as medical disorders. Treatment advocated was more often to talk the problem over than to consult professional medical help. Psychotherapy was the preferred treatment option, particularly in vignettes where symptom presentation was subtle, and in cases of substance abuse.	These data suggest that stigma and misinformation regarding mental illness exist, influencing preferred treatment modality and help-seeking behaviour. More work needs to be done to educate the public about the psychobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and about the value of effective treatments. A better understanding of these disorders amongst the public would presumably lessen stigmatisation and encourage the use of currently available and effective interventions.",Remaining,0,0
535,9745353,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,[A study of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in the presenium and senium].,"Recently, with the increase in elderly population, we have had more opportunities to administer neuroleptics to elderly patients for hallucinatory delusional state, delirium, psychomotor excitement, wandering etc. However, little is known about the characteristics of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in elderly patients, which is the most serious side effect of neuroleptics. In this paper, we present the clinical course of five NMS patients in the presenium and senium. Case 1 was 72-year-old male who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with late onset). He showed nocturnal wandering, insomnia, and irritability. Tiapride 60 mg per day had been administered previously. Just after the addition of oxypertine 10 mg per day, NMS occurred, and he died of pneumonia a week later. Case 2 was 75-year-old male who was diagnosed as having vascular dementia. He showed insomnia, hyperactivity and wandering. He had been given levomepromazine (LPZ) 10 mg per day over a long period of time. At first, he had daily episodic fever, however, serum CPK levels did not increase at that time. A month later, all the symptoms of NMS appeared and then the patient's condition suddenly deteriorated and he died three days later. Case 3 was a 64-year-old male who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with early onset). He showed insomnia, irritability and violence. Tiapride 50-125 mg per day was administered along with oxypertine 50-115 mg per day. Almost two months later, NMS occurred. He had daily episodic fever at first, extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic instabilities gradually increased. Soon after symptoms of NMS were completed. In this case, NMS seemed to be induced by bacterial pneumonia after long term administration of LPZ 5 mg per day. Case 4 was a 75-year-old female who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with late onset). She showed hallucinatory delusional state. Although she had autonomic instabilities just after adminstration of haloperidol 1-2 mg per day, NMS itself occurred after discontinuing the neuroleptic. Case 5 was a 61-year-old female who was diagnosed as having schizophrenia at the age of forty. She was given various neuroleptics over a period of time. The neuroimaging in SPECT showed her cerebral cortex was generally hypoactive. She had a tendency to have autonomic instabilities after the administration of relatively high potential neuroleptics. Risperidone 3-6 mg per day was administered, and almost a month later, autonomic instabilities increased and she was diagnosed as having NMS. All the patients would be able to have brain dysfunction, which suggested that such patients may be liable to NMS. In our patients, NMS occurred after the additional administration of oxypertine 10 mg per day or after long time administration of LPZ 5 mg per day. It was suggested that NMS could occur after the administration of low dose and relatively low potential neuroleptics in elderly patients. Our 3 of 5 patients showed the delayed type of NMS, which might be relatively more frequent in senior and presenior patients than in younger patients. In case 3, NMS was induced by the somatic disease (bacterial pneumonia), however in other cases, NMS was not always induced by somatic disease. Our 4 of 5 patients experienced some of the symptoms of NMS--episodic fever, extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic instabilities--before the onset of NMS. Such symptoms may be 'pre-steps' to NMS. Once NMS occurred, the patient's systemic condition tended to deteriorate acutely. Due to the fact that our 2 of 5 patients died, it was suggested that the prognosis of the NMS patients in presenium and senium tends to be much worse. It is important to find the 'pre-steps' to NMS and treat them as soon as possible for better prognosis.",Remaining,0,0
536,24080672,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,Prevalence of psychotic symptoms in those with melancholic and nonmelancholic depression.,"The best classification of depressive disorders is still to be established. A melancholic subtype has a lengthy history, and recent research demonstrates its relevance. This study compares the prevalence of psychotic symptoms in nonmelancholic and melancholic depression and assesses whether there is a dimensional pattern in the severity of symptoms among the subtypes. Patients with unipolar depression were assessed for melancholic status, psychotic symptoms, and severity of depression. The diagnosis of melancholia was made by both Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), criteria and CORE measure. The DSM criteria assigned a much higher percentage of patients as melancholics (67.4%) than did the CORE (24.9%). Prevalence of psychosis was distinctly higher in the melancholics. Symptoms severity was higher among the melancholics when compared with the nonmelancholics. The presence of psychotic symptoms was not associated with an increase in the intensity of depressive symptoms. Psychotic symptoms are more frequently associated with the melancholic subtype of depression. This suggests clinical contiguity between the melancholic and psychotic subtypes and the clinical relevance of identifying melancholia.",Remaining,0,0
537,8086734,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",Growth and skeletal maturation in children with phenylketonuria.,"Growth and skeletal maturation was evaluated in 82 children participating in the German Collaborative Study of Children Treated for Phenylketonuria (PKU). Height, weight, head circumference and bone age were recorded at regular intervals for the first 6 years of life. The mean SD score (SDS) for height was not significantly different from zero at study entry, but decreased mainly during the second year of life to a nadir of -0.78 in boys and -0.54 in girls at 2.5 years. During the subsequent years, a significant trend towards a regain of height SDS was noted in both sexes. Weight-for-height SDS was close to zero in both sexes, with a significant continuous increasing trend throughout the observation period. Head circumference SDS decreased in boys during the first year of life from -0.28 to -0.68, whereas girls showed only a minor change. During the further follow-up period, head circumference SDS remained at approximately -0.3 in boys and 0.0 in girls. While the mean verbal and performance IQ of the total study population at 5 and 6 years of age did not differ from a group of 212 healthy non-PKU children, patients with a head circumference SDS less than the population median at 2 years of age exhibited poorer cognitive abilities at school age than those patients with a relative head size greater than the population median. The children with a head circumference less than the median at 2 years had smaller head sizes already at birth; in addition, the change in relative head size during the first 2 years was correlated significantly with cognitive abilities at school age in boys. Mean bone age was identical to chronological age at each time point of observation. The rate of maturation was one year of bone age per year of chronological age. No correlation between phenylalanine intake or phenylalanine concentrations and the rates of body or head growth or skeletal maturation could be established. We conclude that despite adequate weight gain, moderate growth retardation occurred during the first 2 years of life in this group of children treated for PKU. Growth was more compromised in boys than in girls and tended to be compensated during later follow-up. Early infantile head circumference and growth appear to be predictors of cognitive development.",Remaining,0,0

Hierarchical regressions controlling for depression revealed main effects of gender such that women reported greater weight/shape concerns, eating pathology, dietary restraint, eating concerns, and binge eating compared to men. Main effects for sexual harassment indicated that as harassment increased, participants reported increased weight/shape concerns, eating pathology, dietary restraint, eating concerns, binge eating, and compensatory behaviors. There were small but significant interactions between gender and harassment for eating pathology total score (which included each of the domains listed above), weight/shape concerns, dietary restraint, and eating concerns such that the relationship between increased harassment and increased pathology was stronger for women compared to men. The largest interaction was found for compensatory behaviors, such that while women and men's scores both increased as harassment increased, the relationship was stronger for men.",Remaining,0,0
539,9733408,Seizure,The neurophysiological evaluation of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.,"The most reliable technique for the diagnosis of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is nocturnal video-polysomnography, which is an expensive procedure and unavailable in many Departments of Neurology and Epileptology around the world. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of routine video-EEG and video-EEG after sleep deprivation, during the daytime, in the diagnosis of NFLE. We studied 23 patients complaining of repeated nocturnal motor attacks using a 3-level neurophysiological evaluation, including video-EEG when awake (level 1), video-EEG after sleep deprivation, during the daytime (level 2) and nocturnal video-polysomnography (level 3). All the patients had a normal video-EEG when awake. The video-EEG after sleep deprivation (level 2) allowed a diagnosis of NFLE in 52.2% of the patients, while the nocturnal video-polysomnography (level 3) allowed this diagnosis in 87.0% of the same sample. In the patients complaining of repeated nocturnal motor attacks, a video-EEG after sleep deprivation performed during the daytime, could be useful for diagnosis in about one half of cases. This methodology is routinely performed in many Departments of Neurology and Epileptology, and is much less binding and expensive than nocturnal video-polysomnography and so it could be important economically for the health service.",Remaining,0,0
540,30875614,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,Early prediction of long-term tactile object recognition performance after sensorimotor stroke.,"Until now tactile agnosia has been reported only in small, but detailed cross-sectional case studies. Here we show that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of early diffusion-weighted lesion maps can be used to accurately predict long-term recovery of tactile object recognition (TOR) in 35 subjects with varying hand skill impairment and associated specific daily activity limitation after cortical sensori-motor stroke. Multiple regression analysis revealed the essentially dysfunctional subprocesses for object recognition in the specifically impaired subjects, i.e., grasping as determined by a subtest of Jebsen Taylor hand function test, and perception of macrogeometrical object properties. The Gaussian process regression of MVPA represents a function that relates a selection of lesioned voxels as input variables to TOR performance scores as target variables. On the behavioural level, patients fell into three recovery subgroups, depending on TOR performance over the observation period. Only baseline motor hand skill and shape discrimination were significantly correlated with the TOR trajectories. To define functionally meaningful voxels, we combined information from MVPA of lesion maps and a priori knowledge of regions of interest derived from a data bank for shape recognition. A high significance for the predicted TOR performances over nine months could be verified by permutation tests, leading us to expect that the model generalises to larger patient cohorts with first cortical ischemic stroke. The lesion sites of the persistently impaired subjects exhibited an overlap with critical areas related to the MVPA prediction map in the cytoarchitectonic areas PFt of inferior parietal lobule and OP1 of parietal operculum which are associated with higher order sensory processing. This ultimate check corroborated the significance of the MVPA map for the prediction of tactile object recognition. The clinical implication of our study is that neuroimaging data acquired immediately after first stroke could facilitate individual forecasting of post-stroke recovery.",Remaining,0,0

The present study was undertaken to identify the viruses causing AES and develop diagnostic algorithm so as to help in improved diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control.	The present study is a hospital-based descriptive, observational study. Samples were processed at Grade-1 DHR/ICMR Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at SMS, Jaipur.	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were processed for IgM antibody detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for mumps virus (MPV), measles virus (MV), Rubella virus (RV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue virus using commercial kits. Nucleic acid was extracted from CSF using automated extraction system. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was done using specific primers and probes for Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and enterovirus (EV).	Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA.	Among 3088 patients, 702 (22.7%) patients were positive for one or more viruses.

Adolescents having experienced an earthquake were recruited (n = 330) and assessed within 1 month of the trauma. Follow-up surveys were conducted 12 months, 24 months and 36 months later, respectively. Symptoms were assessed by the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale and the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children. Results indicate that the prevalence of probable PTSD in different stages was 42.2%, 20.1%, 30.3% and 11.2%. The corresponding rate of depression was 32.3%, 20.7%, 31.0% and 30.3%. The sub-symptoms of PTSD, intrusion and arousal, tended to decrease at the 1st year, followed by a rebound at the 2nd year, then dropping again at the 3rd year. The avoidance showed a consistent diminishing. The PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with gender and the degree of earthquake exposure. However, the gender, family relationship and despair played crucial roles in the development of depressive symptoms. Despite of the tendency of timing abatement, the prevalence of probable PTSD and depression might show rebound at the second year, which remind us a vital threshold for psychological intervention.",Remaining,0,0
543,33389151,European child & adolescent psychiatry,The significance of limited prosocial emotions among externalizing disorders in children.,"Limited Prosocial Emotion (LPE) specifier of conduct disorder (CD) includes lack of remorse or guilt, callousness/lack of empathy, unconcern about performance, and shallow/deficient affect. Given the relatively recent inclusion of the LPE specifier in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fundamental information is still unknown about LPE, such as how common the different domains are, how much they overlap with one another, whether they predict unique variance from each other, and the potential for the LPE specifier as a transdiagnostic facet of externalizing problems. Caregivers (n = 1,50) of children (Mage = 8.42, SD = 2.31) completed a questionnaire assessing individual LPE domains and measures of externalizing symptoms. Results showed that LPE specifier domains were highly related but separable. All LPEs were uniquely associated with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), CD, and overall impairment after controlling for other LPE items, child sex, and ADHD symptoms. Being unconcerned about performance, emotionally manipulative, and having shallow/deficient affect were uniquely associated with ADHD while controlling for ODD and CD symptomatology. Our findings fit with the historical conceptualization of LPE as a unidimensional construct and contributes to the growing evidence of the potential utility of assessing LPE across externalizing disorders in children. Future research should look to replicate and extend our findings in clinical samples of youth.",Remaining,0,0

The assessments at baseline were conducted double-blind to HIV serostatus. Measures included a neuropsychological battery, neurological examination and full psychiatric assessment. There were no differences between the asymptomatic HIV+ and HIV- groups at baseline or at follow-up in terms of mean scores on neuropsychological tests. Mean scores were within the normal range for all neuropsychological tests for both groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict each individual's performance at follow-up on the basis of their baseline performance, psychiatric state, neurological history and drug use for each of the neuropsychological tests.

546,8825886,American journal of medical genetics,Sensory gating deficits in parents of schizophrenics.,"Although schizophrenia clusters in families, it is not inherited in Mendelian fashion. This suggests that there may be alternative phenotypic expressions of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia, such as more elementary physiological or biochemical defects. One proposed phenotype is impaired inhibitory gating of the auditory evoked potential to repeated stimuli. Normally, the amplitude of the P50 response to the second stimulus is significantly less than the response to the first, but this gating of response is generally impaired in schizophrenia. Clinically unaffected individuals within a pedigree who have both an ancestral and descendant history of schizophrenia may be useful for studying whether this physiological defect is a possible alternative phenotype. We have studied inhibitory gating of the auditory P50 response to pairs of auditory stimuli in 17 nuclear families. In 11, there was one parent who had another relative with a chronic psychotic illness, in addition to the schizophrenic proband. All of the parents with family histories of schizophrenia had gating of the P50 response similar to their schizophrenia offspring, whereas only 7% of the parents without family history had gating of the P50 response in the abnormal range. These results support loss of gating of the auditory P50 wave as an inherited deficit related to schizophrenia and suggest that studies of parents may help elucidate the neurobiological expression of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia.",Remaining,0,0

549,32623925,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",Genetically Predicted Blood Pressure Across the Lifespan: Differential Effects of Mean and Pulse Pressure on Stroke Risk.,"Hypertension is the leading risk factor for stroke. Yet, it remains unknown whether blood pressure pulsatility (pulse pressure [PP]) causally affects stroke risk independently of the steady pressure component (mean arterial pressure [MAP]). It is further unknown how the effects of MAP and PP on stroke risk vary with age and stroke cause. Using data from UK Biobank (N=408 228; 38-71 years), we selected genetic variants as instruments for MAP and PP at age ≤55 and >55 years and across age deciles. We applied multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses to explore associations with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and their subtypes. Higher genetically predicted MAP was associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage across the examined age spectrum. Independent of MAP, higher genetically predicted PP only at age >55 years was further associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio per-SD-increment, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.13-1.34]). Among subtypes, the effect of genetically predicted MAP on large artery stroke was attenuated, whereas the effect of genetically predicted PP was augmented with increasing age. Genetically predicted MAP, but not PP, was associated with small vessel stroke and deep intracerebral hemorrhage homogeneously across age deciles. Neither genetically predicted MAP nor PP were associated with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Beyond an effect of high MAP at any age on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, our results support an independent causal effect of high PP at older ages on large artery stroke. This finding warrants further investigation for the development of stroke preventive strategies targeting pulsatility in later life.",Remaining,0,0
550,9292187,Brain and cognition,The decoding of emotional concepts in patients with focal cerebral lesions.,"The effects of focal brain lesions on the decoding of emotional concepts in facial expressions were investigated. Facial emotions are hierarchically organized patterns comprising (1) structural surface features, (2) discrete (primary) emotional categories and (3) secondary dimensions, such as valence and arousal. Categorical decoding was measured using (1) selection of category labels and selection of the named emotion category; (2) matching one facial expression with two choice expressions. Dimensional decoding was assessed by matching one face with two different expressions with regard to valence or arousal. 70 patients with well documented cerebral lesions and 15 matched hospital controls participated in the study. 27 had left brain damage (LBD; 10 frontal, 10 temporal, 7 parietal); 37 had right brain damage (RBD; 15 frontal, 11 temporal, 11 parietal). Six additional patients had lesions involving both frontal lobes. Right temporal and parietal lesioned patients were markedly impaired in the decoding of primary emotions. The same patients also showed a reduced arousal decoding. In contrast to several patients with frontal and left hemisphere lesions, emotional conceptualization and face discrimination was not independent in these groups. No group differences were observed in valence decoding. However, right frontal lesions appeared to interfere with the discrimination of negative valence. Moreover, a distraction by structural features was noted in RBD when facial identities were varied across stimulus and response pictures in matching tasks with differing conceptual load. Our results suggest that focal brain lesions differentially affect the comprehension of emotional meaning in faces depending on the level of conceptual load and interference of structural surface features.",Remaining,0,0

Fifty patients underwent examination with dynamic CT for nonendocrinologic disease as a control group to establish the normal pattern of pituitary gland enhancement. One hundred seventy microadenomas (65.4%) displayed the usual dynamic CT pattern (ie, they did not show early enhancement before that of the portal system of the pituitary gland: those pituitary microadenomas appeared less enhanced than the normal pituitary gland during the entire examination). On the other hand, in 90 microadenomas (34.6%), early partial or complete enhancement was seen within the microadenoma before the normal portal enhancement of the gland. Therefore, analysis with dynamic CT yields two groups of pituitary microadenomas separable on the basis of blood supply: those with portal blood supply only and those with partial or predominantly direct arterial blood supply; in theory, the second group avoids hypothalamic control.",Remaining,0,0

However, studies on cholesterol measured in late-life and cognitive function have been inconsistent. Few studies have explored nonlinear relationships or considered interactions with other biomarker measures.	A cross-sectional sample of 1,889 participants from four rural counties in the People's Republic of China was included in this analysis. Serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and homocysteine levels were measured in fasting blood samples.

Analysis of covariance models were used to investigate the association between biomarker measures and the composite cognitive scores.	There was a significant interaction between the homocysteine quartile group and the cholesterol quartile group on cognitive scores (P=0.0478). In participants with normal homocysteine levels, an inverse U-shaped relationship between total cholesterol level and cognitive score was found, indicating that both low and high cholesterol levels were associated with lower cognitive scores. In participants with high homocysteine levels, no significant association between cholesterol and cognition was found.	The relationship between cholesterol levels and cognitive function depends upon homocysteine levels, suggesting an interactive role between cholesterol and homocysteine on cognitive function in the elderly population.

A total of 137 patients were eligible for analysis. Mean age was 63 ± 15.4 years and median IGR was 5.13ml/hour. SP(n = 69) had higher median ASPECTS, lower median rCBF<30% lesion volume, higher proportion of favorable collaterals and hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR)<0.4, higher minimal mean arterial blood pressure before reperfusion, and lower rates of general anesthesia compared to FP(n = 68). Symptom-reperfusion time was comparable between both groups. SP had higher rates of 90-day mRS0-2(71.9%vs.38.9%,aOR;7.226,95%CI[2.431-21.482],p < 0.001) and lower median FIV. Symptom-reperfusion time was associated with 90-day mRS0-2 in FP (aOR;0.541,95%CI[0.309-0.946],p = 0.03) but not in SP (aOR;0.874,95%CI[0.742-1.056],p = 0.16). On multivariable analysis, high ASPECTS and favorable collaterals in the NCCT/CTA model, and low rCBF<30% and HIR<0.4 in the CTP model were independent predictors of SP.	The impact of symptom-reperfusion time on outcomes significantly varies across slow-versus fast-progressors. ASPECTS, collateral score, rCBF<30%, and HIR define stroke progression profile.",Remaining,0,0
555,31155341,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,Environmental risk factors and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): A case-control study of ALS in China.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease mainly involving central and peripheral motor neurons. The etiology of ALS is not clear. In China, there is a preliminary exploration of genetic factors, but the study on environmental factors is relatively inadequate, which needs to be further clarified. To investigate the protective or harmful effects of different environmental factors on ALS, and explore the possible etiology of ALS of the Chinese for further study. Case-control study were used in 123 patients and 239 healthy controls from 2013 to 2016. Statistical analysis and description were performed with SPSS24.0. The risk factors of ALS include head trauma (OR = 3.397, 95% [1.298, 8.893], P = 0.013), drinking (OR = 1.760, 95% CI [1.110,2.790], p = 0.016), smoking (OR = 3.196, 95% [1.375, 7.427], P = 0.351), low BMI (OR = 1.231, 95% CI [1.115, 1.319], P = 0.000), workers or famers (OR = 2.539, 95% [1.441,4.475], P = 0.001, 30-34 yrs); factors that reduce incidence of ALS including hypertension (OR = 0.526, 95% [0.313, 0.883], P = 0.015), severe physical activities (OR = 0.808, 95% [0.711, 0.918], P = 0.001), longer duration of education (OR = 0.183, 95% [0.078, 0.428], P = 0.000, >12 yrs), reading (OR = 0.225, 95% [0.126, 0.516], P = 0.000, 13-30 yrs), retirement or unemployment (OR = 0.040, 95% [0.005, 0.291], P = 0.000, 30-34 yrs); family history of neurologic disorder, general trauma, years and numbers of smoking, artistic activities, and other occupational factors did not show correlation with ALS. Head trauma, alcohol consumption, smoking, low BMI, workers or farmers are risk factors for ALS; high blood pressure, severe physical activity, longer duration of education, reading, retirement or unemployment are protective factors for ALS; whether there is a connection between ALS and family history, general trauma, years or numbers of smoking, artistic activities, and other occupational factors need to be confirmed by further study.",Remaining,0,0
556,1358438,Cancer research,Evidence for the involvement of a potential second tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 17 distinct from p53 in malignant astrocytomas.,"Molecular analysis of malignant astrocytomas demonstrated three distinct groups of tumors with chromosome 17p abnormalities, which include (a) deletion of the p53 locus (17p13.1) and mutations in the remaining allele, (b) deletion of the p53 locus but no detectable mutations in the remaining allele, and (c) deletions not including the p53 locus but mutations in one of the alleles. Furthermore, deletion mapping analysis demonstrated allelic loss of genes distal to D17S28/D17S5 markers (17p13.3) in group C tumors. The loss of heterozygosity of genes on chromosome 17 without detectable mutation (group B) or deletion (group C) in the p53 gene implies the presence of a second tumor suppressor gene in the telomeric region of 17p, the homozygous functional inactivation of which may play a role, either alone or in conjunction with p53, in the initiation and/or progression of astrocytic neoplasms.",Remaining,0,0
557,20300735,Psychopharmacology,Altered parahippocampal functioning in cannabis users is related to the frequency of use.,"Converging lines of evidence suggest an association between cannabis use and impaired episodic memory as well as related associative learning. These deficits have been associated with the duration, frequency, and age of onset of cannabis use. However, it remains unclear whether these parameters of use differently impact memory-related hippocampal functioning.	Forty-two cannabis users were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging while they encoded and retrieved face-profession associations. Region of interest analysis was subsequently used to compare (para-)hippocampal functioning in users with (1) a longer and shorter duration of use, (2) a higher and lower frequency of use, and (3) an earlier and later onset. To further separate the effects of these parameters of use on performance and (para-)hippocampal activity, linear regression analysis was applied.	Compared to low-frequency users, high-frequency users displayed stronger blood oxygenation level-dependent response during encoding in the left parahippocampal gyrus. No differences were obvious for the groups separated according to duration of use or an earlier and later onset of use. Linear regression analysis confirmed the association between a higher frequency of use and increased activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus.	Our findings suggest that the frequency of use might have a particular critical impact on intact parahippocampal functioning in cannabis users. Increased activity within the encoding-related network might reflect functional compensation to maintain cognitive functioning.",Remaining,0,0

In this review we aim to give an overview of postoperative symptoms and look at factors influencing therapeutic choices and surgical techniques.	A wide range of physical and psychological factors contribute to the symptoms of disease. Patients suffer from impaired quality of life, depression, anxiety and chronic and acute pain. Validated questionnaires have been used to assess patient response. Surgical excision of endometriosis improves dyspareunia and the quality of sex life of patients. It is superior in outcomes to medical therapy in achieving increased pregnancy rates. Catastrophizing and biopsychosocial variables are implicated in the severity of pain experienced in patients with endometriosis. Patients with endometriosis score lower on quality of life assessments and the addition of psychosomatic therapy to medical treatments has shown to improve the emotional status of patients with improved treatment outcomes.	Despite its prevalence, there is no optimal treatment for endometriosis; recurrence of disease is a common problem. Laparoscopic surgery compared with medical therapies shows improved patient satisfaction outcomes in general health, quality of life and emotional wellbeing. Management of this varied aetiology improves in the context of a multidisciplinary team.",Remaining,0,0
559,18367428,Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape,Long-term cognitive and behavioural follow-up in three patients with eye closure-triggered paroxysmal activity.,"To study clinical, EEG, neuropsychological and behavioural evolution of three patients presenting with epileptic activity triggered by eye closure (EC) over a mean 10-year follow-up period.	All patients were studied at the time of the first observation (T0) and after a long follow-up period (T1). At both T0 and T1, each patient underwent: 1) traditional and specific activation techniques during prolonged video-EEG monitoring to detect possible inducing factors; 2) neuropsychological evaluations during video-EEG monitoring either with eyes closed or eyes open to detect any transient cognitive impairment (TCI); 3) detailed neuropsychological assessment without simultaneous EEG recording, to detect any stable cognitive impairment (SCI).	EEG recordings showed transient, generalized paroxysms in one case and a continuous epileptic activity triggered by eye closure in the other two cases, at both T0 and T1. In all patients, no particular epileptiform discharge-induced factors were identified except for eye blinking (spontaneous, voluntary or induced by corneal reflex). The results of neuropsychological assessment while eyes were closed as compared to performances with eyes open, showed no significant differences at T0 or at T1 in two cases, thus possibly indicating the absence of TCI. Wechsler Intelligence Scales showed a decrease in performance at T1 in the two patients with eye closure-induced, continuous epileptiform activity. Detailed neuropsychological assessment without EEG recordings demonstrated an impairment of facial recognition ability in all three patients at T1.	The lack of any differences between the results of neuropsychological tests performed with eyes open and eyes closed in two patients might suggest that not all eye-closure-triggered paroxysms are associated with TCI. On the other hand, our data highlight that EC-triggered, EEG epileptic discharges can produce long-lasting neuropsychological and behavioural effects, and also indicate that EEG discharges recurring over time might exert a disruptive effect on cognitive functions. Our three patients showed extreme variability across the neuropsychological tasks except for a facial recognition deficit that was evident in all cases, thus suggesting a possible dysfunction of temporo-occipital brain structures and/or of the fusiform face area as recently demonstrated by combined fMRI/EEG studies in patients with fixation-off sensitivity.",Remaining,0,0

Therefore, we herein investigated the relationship between SARC-F scores and functional outcomes in stroke patients. The primary outcome in the present study was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 3 months after stroke. The relationship between SARC-F scores and poor functional outcomes was examined using a logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the applicability of SARC-F scores to the assessment of poor functional outcomes was analyzed based on the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC). Eighty-one out of the 324 patients enrolled in the present study (25%) had poor functional outcomes (mRS ≥ 4). The results of the multivariate analysis revealed a correlation between SARC-F scores (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.05-1.59, p = 0.02) and poor functional outcomes. A cut-off SARC-F score ≥ 4 had low-to-moderate sensitivity (47.4%) and high specificity (87.3%). The present results suggest that the measurement of pre-stroke SARC-F scores is useful for predicting the outcomes of stroke patients.",Remaining,0,0

Direct contact with patients during pharmacy experiential education helps establish positive attitudes toward people with mental illness yet may not be available to all students. The use of film in pharmacy education has the potential to facilitate learning and improve attitudes.	We evaluated students' perceptions regarding the impact of an elective course for pharmacy students which incorporated feature films about mental illnesses. Students completed surveys addressing their perceptions of each film's role in facilitation of learning, attitudes about mental illness, and comfort level for interacting with patients with mental illness.	A total of 125 students completed a course featuring 17 films over the four-year study period. The films with the highest weighted positive rankings were Temple Grandin, Helen, As Good As It Gets, Born on the Fourth of July, Iris, A Beautiful Mind, and Silver Linings Playbook. Less favored films included One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Prozac Nation, and My Own Private Idaho.	Direct contact with patients may best prepare future pharmacists to serve the needs of people with mental illness. This study suggests that students perceive feature films used in an elective course may have a positive impact on facilitating learning and improving attitudes of pharmacy students toward individuals with mental illness. Further well-designed studies are warranted, including in other health professions students, to substantiate and define the role of film as a tool to teach and address stigma.",Remaining,0,0

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a short version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale assessing changes on 4 different dimensions of impulsivity, namely urgency, (lack of) premeditation, (lack of) perseverance, and sensation seeking, arising in the course of a neurodegenerative disease. To this end, caregivers of 83 probable AD patients completed a short questionnaire adapted from the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the data were performed and revealed that a model with 4 distinct but related latent variables corresponding to 4 different dimensions of impulsivity fit the data best. Furthermore, the results showed that lack of perseverance, followed by lack of premeditation and urgency, increased after the onset of the disease, whereas sensation seeking decreased. Overall, the multifaceted nature of impulsivity was confirmed in a sample of AD patients, whose caregivers reported significant changes regarding each facet of impulsivity. Consequently, the short version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale opens up interesting prospects for a better comprehension of behavioral symptoms of dementia.",Remaining,0,0
564,29554099,PLoS computational biology,The Pathway Coexpression Network: Revealing pathway relationships.,"A goal of genomics is to understand the relationships between biological processes. Pathways contribute to functional interplay within biological processes through complex but poorly understood interactions. However, limited functional references for global pathway relationships exist. Pathways from databases such as KEGG and Reactome provide discrete annotations of biological processes. Their relationships are currently either inferred from gene set enrichment within specific experiments, or by simple overlap, linking pathway annotations that have genes in common. Here, we provide a unifying interpretation of functional interaction between pathways by systematically quantifying coexpression between 1,330 canonical pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to establish the Pathway Coexpression Network (PCxN). We estimated the correlation between canonical pathways valid in a broad context using a curated collection of 3,207 microarrays from 72 normal human tissues. PCxN accounts for shared genes between annotations to estimate significant correlations between pathways with related functions rather than with similar annotations. We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships. Comprehensive exploration of PCxN can be performed at http://pcxn.org/.",Remaining,0,0

While evaluating patients' memory problems, the memory clinic staff has periodically identified ADHD in previously undiagnosed older adults. The authors conducted a survey to assess the extent to which other memory clinics view ADHD as a relevant clinical issue.	The authors developed and sent a questionnaire to memory clinics in the United States to determine the extent to which they identified patients with ADHD and the extent to which they took it into consideration.	Approximately one half of the memory clinics that responded reported seeing ADHD patients, either identifying previously diagnosed cases and/or newly diagnosing ADHD themselves. One fifth of clinics reported screening regularly for ADHD, and few clinics described accessing collateral informants to establish the diagnosis.	This article suggests that U.S. memory clinics may not adequately identify and address ADHD in the context of late-life cognitive disorders.",Remaining,0,0
566,11725215,"Neuropsychiatry, neuropsychology, and behavioral neurology",Behavioral changes in Huntington Disease.,"This study aimed to gain a better understanding of behavioral abnormalities in Huntington disease (HD) and to develop a method for reliably assessing these changes.	Behavioral changes are a central feature of HD and often cause considerable distress and difficulty to patients and their relatives. However, they have received little attention from research despite their prevalence and clinical significance.	One hundred thirty-four patients with HD were assessed using the Problem Behaviors Assessment for Huntington Disease (PBA-HD), an instrument for rating the presence, severity and frequency of behavioral abnormalities in HD.	The findings confirm that behavioral problems are common among patients with HD. The most common symptoms were loss of energy and initiative, poor perseverance and quality of work, impaired judgment, poor self-care and emotional blunting. Affective symptoms such as depression, anxiety and irritability occurred in around half the patients studied. Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) were rarely reported. Factor analysis distinguished three clusters of behavioral symptoms, which were interpreted respectively as reflecting Apathy, Depression and Irritability. The 'Apathy' factor was highly correlated with duration of illness, whereas no such relationship was observed for the 'Depression' and 'Irritability' factors.	The results suggest that certain behavioral changes are fundamental to the progression of HD, whereas others have a more complex relationship to the disease process. The findings have implications for the choice of behavioral measures used to evaluate efficacy of therapeutic interventions.",Remaining,0,0

VRK2 is considered to be related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between VRK2, rs4380187 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and schizophrenia.	Peripheral blood DNA was extracted using a genomic DNA extraction kit. The DNA samples were genotyped using the Agena MassARRAY platform, and four genetic models were applied to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional logistic regression. The p value was obtained by the chi-square and t test for independent samples.	The C allele of rs4380187 SNP was significantly (p = 0.008) associated with decreased risk of SZ. The AA genotype of rs4380187 showed significantly (p = 0.009) lower frequency in cases with SZ than in controls and was associated with decreased risk of the disease. The frequency of the CA genotype of rs4380187 correlated with a 0.73-fold decreased risk of SZ (p = 0.033). In the co-dominant genetic model, the genotype of rs4380187 was associated with a decreased risk of SZ (p = 0.010). We also found that the log-additive model of rs4380187 significantly reduced the risk of SZ disease (p = 0.007).	This study provides further evidence that rs4380187 SNP is associated with SZ.

The screenings included the following tests administered to 535 subjects: anxiety, depression, dementia, neurosis were measured; recent medical records were compared to survey data for 330 of the same subjects.	The summary of prevalence of mental disorders measured in this study was as follows: anxiety 34.7% (severe), dementia 44.68% (mild), depression 66% (mild), 15.94% (medium), 7.88% (severe), neurosis 66.73% (mild, medium, and severe).

A treatment gap was observed between mental health treatment for neurosis, as indicated by medical records, and the diagnostic prevalence of neurosis as measured by the survey instruments: there were three times as many people diagnosed as neurotic in the survey as had been noted in village medical records. Additionally, the unique position of cerebrovascular alteration was established between the mental and somatic factors.	The study demonstrates the successful simultaneous collection of a wide spectrum of data on somatic conditions, mental disorders, and socio-economic status of the subjects.

Study the clinical progression of a late-stage PD (LSPD) population over one year follow-up.	50 LSPD patients (Schwab and England ADL Scale <50 or Hoehn Yahr Stage >3 in MED ON) underwent an extensive clinical assessment at baseline and after one year and an acute levodopa test at baseline.	Mean age of LSPD patients (female 46%) was 77.5 ± 5.9 years and mean disease duration was 15.5 ± 6.5 years. At baseline, 76% had levodopa-induced motor complications (MC), usually non-troublesome, 68% were demented, 54% had psychosis and 68% depression. Caregiver distress was high. l-dopa responsiveness was mild (18% ± 12 of improvement on MDS-UPDRS-III). After one-year, 20% of the patients were dead, institutionalized or HY 5. MDS-UPDRS-motor mean score worsened 7.2 ± 10.3 points although there was heterogeneity between patients, and there was a global worsening of non-motor symptoms, mostly in cognition/mood, urinary and gastrointestinal domains. Nevertheless, MC improved despite similar levodopa equivalent dose. Functional independence and quality of life worsened. Dysphagia severity at baseline predicted a poor outcome (death, institutionalization or HY 5) (Hazard ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.12-4.4; p = 0.01), whereas magnitude of l-dopa response of LSPD patients did not.

579,21497911,Journal of affective disorders,Screening for depression in adolescent paediatric patients: validity of the new Depression Screener for Teenagers (DesTeen).,"Depression in adolescents is often hard to detect. In many cases paediatricians are the first point of contact. In order to increase recognition rates, screening instruments may be a helpful support for health care professionals. However, there is a lack of valid and economical screening instruments for primary care patients. Thus, the aim of the study was the development of the new Depression Screener for Teenagers (DesTeen) and its validation in a paediatric sample.	326 patients between 13 and 16 years old completed the DesTeen and a diagnostic interview, serving as gold standard. Prevalence rate for any depressive disorder (minor depression, major depression and dysthymia) was 12.6%. Psychometric properties were calculated. For validity measures, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for any depressive disorder and the diagnostic subgroups was computed.	DesTeen showed a high reliability (Cronbach's α=.87) and a high validity (AUC=.91). For the diagnostic subgroups AUC values did not significantly differ from overall accuracy of any depressive disorder (major depression: AUC=.95, p=.179; dysthymia: AUC=.88, p=.605; minor depression: AUC=.87, p=.327). The optimal cut-off point for any depressive disorder according to the Youden-Index yielded a sensitivity of .90 and a specificity of .80. An abbreviated 5-item version of DesTeen showed no loss in validity (AUC=.90, p=.695).	Overall, DesTeen can be regarded as a valid screening instrument for adolescent paediatric patients. For practical use, the 5-item version is even more promising. A replication of these results is essential.",Remaining,0,0

Existing research has not considered demographic differences in mortality patterns.	To analyze differences in cause of death for adults who did/did not have CP reported on their death certificates and to assess sex and racial-ethnic difference in causes of death among adult decedents with CP.	Data are from the 2013-2017 US Multiple Cause of Death Mortality files (N = 13,332,871; n = 13,897 with CP). Multiple logistic regression models were used to compare differences in causes of death between adults with and without CP and to determine sex and racial-ethnic differences in causes of death among adults with CP. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.	As compared with decedents without CP, those with CP were more likely to die from pneumonitis (aOR 31.14, 95% CI 29.42-32.96), influenza/pneumonia (8.78, 8.30-9.29), respiratory failure (17.24, 15.19-18.69), and choking (20.66, 18.86-22.62) and less likely to die from heart disease (0.61, 0.58-0.65), cancer (0.12, 0.11-0.13), chronic lower respiratory diseases (0.50, 0.44-0.56), and cerebrovascular diseases (0.66, 0.59-0.75). Among adults with CP, female decedents were more likely than males to die from respiratory failure (1.21, 1.03-1.42), and non-Hispanic Black decedents were more likely than non-Hispanic White decedents to die from heart disease (1.24, 1.07-1.45) and cerebrovascular disease (1.77, 1.29-2.49).	In 2013-2017, heart disease was the leading cause of death for adults with and without CP. However, for people with compared to those without CP, likelihood of death from likely preventable respiratory causes of death was higher. Non-Hispanic Black adults were more likely than non-Hispanic White adults to die from heart and cerebrovascular diseases. Public health, clinical, and rehabilitation efforts must use a multifaceted approach to address respiratory and circulatory health among people with CP.

581,32623545,Behavior genetics,Examining the Role of Genetic Risk and Longitudinal Transmission Processes Underlying Maternal Parenting and Psychopathology and Children's ADHD Symptoms and Aggression: Utilizing the Advantages of a Prospective Adoption Design.,"Although genetic factors may contribute to initial liability for ADHD onset, there is growing evidence of the potential importance of the rearing environment on the developmental course of ADHD symptomatology. However, associations between family-level variables (maternal hostility, maternal depressive symptoms) and child behaviors (developmental course of ADHD and aggression) may be explained by genes that are shared by biologically related parents and children. Furthermore, ADHD symptoms and aggression commonly co-occur: it is important to consider both simultaneously to have a better understanding of processes underlying the developmental course of ADHD and aggression. To addresses these issues, we employed a longitudinal genetically sensitive parent-offspring adoption design. Analyses were conducted using Cohort I (n = 340) of the Early Growth and Development Study with cross-validation analyses conducted with Cohort II (n = 178). Adoptive mother hostility, but not depression, was associated with later child ADHD symptoms and aggression. Mothers and their adopted children were genetically unrelated, removing passive rGE as a possible explanation. Early child impulsivity/activation was associated with later ADHD symptoms and aggression. Child impulsivity/activation was also associated with maternal hostility, with some evidence for evocative gene-environment correlation processes on adoptive mother depressive symptoms. This study provides novel insights into family-based environmental influences on child ADHD and aggression symptoms, independent of shared parental genetic factors, implications of which are further explicated in the discussion.",Remaining,0,0
582,17996378,Neuroscience,Working memory load-related electroencephalographic parameters can differentiate progressive from stable mild cognitive impairment.,"Recent studies described several changes of endogenous event-related potentials (ERP) and brain rhythm synchronization during memory activation in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To examine whether memory-related EEG parameters may predict cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we assessed P200 and N200 latencies as well as beta event-related synchronization (ERS) in 16 elderly controls (EC), 29 MCI cases and 10 patients with AD during the successful performance of a pure attentional detection task as compared with a highly working memory demanding two-back task. At 1 year follow-up, 16 MCI patients showed progressive cognitive decline (PMCI) and 13 remained stable (SMCI). Both P200 and N200 latencies in the two-back task were longer in PMCI and AD cases compared with EC and SMCI cases. During the interval 1000 ms to 1700 ms after stimulus, beta ERS at parietal electrodes was of lower amplitude in PMCI and AD compared with EC and SMCI cases. Univariate models showed that P200, N200 and log% beta values were significantly related to the SMCI/PMCI distinction with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, 0.78 and 0.72, respectively. The combination of all three EEG hallmarks was the stronger predictor of MCI deterioration with 90% of correctly classified MCI cases. Our data reveal that PMCI and clinically overt AD share the same pattern of working memory-related EEG activation characterized by increased P200-N200 latencies and decreased beta ERS. They also show that P200 latency during the two-back task may be a simple and promising EEG marker of rapid cognitive decline in MCI.",Remaining,0,0
583,24589148,Quality in primary care,Intervention fidelity in primary care complex intervention trials: qualitative study using telephone interviews of patients and practitioners.,"Treatment fidelity has previously been defined as the degree to which a treatment or intervention is delivered to participants as intended. Underreporting of fidelity in primary care randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of complex interventions reduces our confidence that findings are due to the treatment or intervention being investigated, rather than unknown confounders.	We aimed to investigate treatment fidelity (for the purpose of this paper, hereafter referred to as intervention fidelity), of an educational intervention delivered to general practice teams and designed to improve the primary care management of insomnia.	We conducted telephone interviews with patients and practitioners participating in the intervention arm of the trial to explore trial fidelity. Qualitative analysis was undertaken using constant comparison and a priori themes (categories): 'adherence to the delivery of the intervention', 'patients received and understood intervention' and 'patient enactment'.	If the intervention protocol was not adhered to by the practitioner then patient receipt, understanding and enactment levels were reduced. Recruitment difficulties in terms of the gap between initially being recruited into the study and attending an intervention consultation also reduced the effectiveness of the intervention. Patient attributes such as motivation to learn and engage contributed to the success of the uptake of the intervention.	Qualitative methods using brief telephone interviews are an effective way of collecting the depth of data required to assess intervention fidelity. Intervention fidelity monitoring should be an important element of definitive trial design.	ClinicalTrials. gov id isrctn 55001433 - www.controlled-trials.com/isrctn55001433.",Remaining,0,0

Our goal is to investigate two treatment-seeking samples of adults collected in Brazil and the United States, countries with different socio-cultural backgrounds. This comparison may lead to a better understanding of cultural influences on GD.	The total studied sample involved 733 treatment-seeking subjects: 353 men and 380 women (average age=45.80, standard deviation ±10.9). The Brazilian sample had 517 individuals and the American sample 216. Subjects were recruited by analogous strategies.	We found that the Brazilian sample was younger, predominantly male, less likely to be Caucasian, more likely to be partnered, tended to have a faster progression from recreational gambling to GD, and were more likely to endorse chasing losses.	This study demonstrated that there are significant differences between treatment-seeking samples of adults presenting GD due to EGM in Brazil and in the United States. These findings suggest that cultural aspects may have a relevant role in GD due to EGM.",Remaining,0,0
585,31707936,Eating disorders,Changes in meal-related anxiety predict treatment outcomes in an intensive family-based treatment program for adolescents with anorexia nervosa.,"Meal-related anxiety in individuals with eating disorders is associated with reduced caloric intake and persisting eating-disordered behaviors, which may reduce the likelihood of attaining or sustaining remission. The current study is the first to examine changes in meal-related anxiety as a predictor of outcomes in the context of a family-based partial hospitalization program. A sample of 51 adolescents with anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia rated anxiety before and after all treatment meals using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS). Regression analyses suggested that participants experiencing a greater reduction in meal anxiety endorsed fewer eating disordered symptoms on the EDE at the end of treatment. Reductions in meal anxiety did not predict EBW at end of treatment, which could be because family-based treatment (FBT) supports adequate food intake regardless of meal anxiety (i.e., parents ensure food intake). Findings suggest that reductions in meal-related anxiety may be an important predictor of outcomes in family-based interventions, and future research is needed to examine if directly targeting meal anxiety may enhance outcomes.",Remaining,0,0

In the present study thirty participants with schizophrenia were compared with demographically matched controls on Virtual Week, a measure that closely represents the types of prospective memory tasks that actually occur in everyday life, and provides an opportunity to investigate the different sorts of prospective memory failures that occur. Participants with schizophrenia were significantly and comparably impaired on Virtual Week, irrespective of the specific prospective memory task demands. Importantly, after controlling for general cognitive functioning, executive functioning and retrospective memory, although the absolute magnitude of the deficit was reduced, significant impairment remained. These results suggest that individuals with schizophrenia experience generalized difficulties with prospective memory, and that whilst other cognitive deficits contribute to these difficulties, there is something unique to prospective remembering that is additionally disrupted in schizophrenia.",Remaining,0,0

A quality improvement project was initiated at a nonpediatric community ED to implement an institution-specific, PECARN-based Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool. Baseline head CT use at the participating ED was determined for children with closed head injury through retrospective chart review from March 2014 through November 2015. Head injury patients were identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes for head injury, unspecified (959.01) and concussion with and without loss of consciousness (850-850.9) until October 2015, after which ICD-9 was no longer used. To identify eligible patients after October 2015, lists of all pediatric patients evaluated at the participating ED were reviewed, and patients were included in the analysis if they had a physician-assigned discharge diagnosis of head injury or concussion. Exclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, penetrating head trauma, history of brain tumor, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, bleeding disorder, or presentation > 24 hours postinjury. Medical history, injury mechanism, symptoms, head CT use, and disposition were recorded. Implementation of the Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool was achieved through provider education sessions beginning in December 2015 and ending in August 2016. Head CT use was monitored for 12 months postimplementation, from September 2016 through August 2017. Patients were classified into low, intermediate, or high risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) by chart review. ED length of stay (LOS), disposition, and ED returns within 72 hours were recorded. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables, using Kruskal-Wallis test.	A total of 252 children with closed head injury were evaluated preimplementation (March 2014 through November 2015), 132 children were evaluated during implementation (December 2015 through August 2016), and 172 children were evaluated postimplementation (September 2016 through August 2017). Overall CT use decreased from 37.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 31.7-43.7) preimplementation to 16.9% (95% CI = 11.3-22.5) postimplementation (p < 0.001). Only 1% (95% CI = 0%-2.9%) of low-risk patients received a head CT postimplementation compared to 22.6% (95% CI = 16.1%-29.1%) preimplementation (p < 0.001). CT use among patients ≥ 24 months decreased from 42.9% (95% CI = 36.5%-49.6%) to 19.6% (95% CI = 13.1%-26.1%; p < 0.001) and remained low and unchanged for patients < 24 months. Transfers to a pediatric trauma center and ED returns within 72 hours were unchanged, while median ED LOS improved from 1.5 to 1.3 hours (p = 0.03). There were no missed ciTBIs after implementation of the guideline.	Implementation of the PECARN-based Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool reduced head CT use in a nonpediatric ED.

In the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, 75 828 postmenopausal women reported habitual sleep duration at baseline 1993-1998. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of CRC and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI).

596,35274469,Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,Attribution of intentions in autism spectrum disorder: A study of event-related potentials.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social cognition deficits, including difficulties inferring the intentions of others. Although deficits in attribution of intentions (AI) have been consistently replicated in ASD, their exact nature remains unexplored. Here we registered the electrophysiological correlates of a nonverbal social cognition task to investigate AI in autistic adults. Twenty-one male autistic adults and 30 male neurotypical volunteers performed a comic strips task depicting either intentional action (AI) or physical causality with or without human characters, while their electroencephalographic signal was recorded. Compared to neurotypical volunteers, autistic participants were significantly less accurate in correctly identifying congruence in the AI condition, but not in the physical causality conditions. In the AI condition a bilateral posterior positive event-related potential (ERP) occurred 200-400 ms post-stimulus (the ERP intention effect) in both groups. This waveform comprised a P200 and a P300 component, with the P200 component being larger for the AI condition in neurotypical volunteers but not in autistic individuals, who also showed a longer latency for this waveform. Group differences in amplitude of the ERP intention effect only became evident when we compared autistic participants to a subgroup of similarly performing neurotypical participants, suggesting that the atypical ERP waveform in ASD is an effect of group, rather than a marker of low-task performance. Together, these results suggest that the lower accuracy of the ASD group in the AI task may result from impaired early attentional processing and contextual integration of socially relevant cues. LAY SUMMARY: To understand why autistic people have difficulties in inferring others' intentions, we asked participants to judge the congruence of the endings of comic strips depicting either intentional actions (e.g., fetching a chair to reach for something) or situations solely following physical rules (e.g., an apple falling on someone's head), while their electrical brain activity was recorded. Autistic individuals had more difficulties in inferring intentions than neurotypical controls, which may reflect impaired attention and contextual integration of social cues.",Remaining,0,0

The discriminatory ability of MRI variables in distinguishing patients from controls was estimated using the Concordance Statistics (C-statistic) within logistic regression analyses. Correlations between cortical thickness measures and disease progression rate were tested using the Pearson coefficient. Relative to controls, ALS patients showed a bilateral cortical thinning of the primary motor, prefrontal and ventral frontal cortices, cingulate gyrus, insula, superior and inferior temporal and parietal regions, and medial and lateral occipital areas. There was a significant age-by-group effect in the sensorimotor cortices bilaterally, suggesting a stronger association between age and cortical thinning in ALS patients compared to controls. The mean cortical thickness of the sensorimotor cortices distinguished patients with ALS from controls (C-statistic ≥ 0.74). Cortical thinning of the left sensorimotor cortices was related to a faster clinical progression (r = -0.33, p = 0.03). Cortical thickness measurements allowed the detection and quantification of motor and extramotor involvement in patients with ALS. Cortical thinning of the precentral gyrus might offer a marker of upper motor neuron involvement and disease progression.",Remaining,0,0
599,35320762,Thrombosis research,Knowledge about atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation affects the risk of clinical outcomes.,"Knowledge about atrial fibrillation (AF) and oral anticoagulation (OAC) is insufficient among AF patients.	We examined the association between this knowledge and event rate.	We studied 174 anticoagulated patients with AF aged 69±10.7 years (median CHA2DS2 -VASc 4). Knowledge was assessed at baseline using the Jessa AF Knowledge Questionnaire (JAKQ). The primary endpoint was a composite of ischemic cerebrovascular events, major or non-major clinically relevant bleeding, and death, recorded during a median follow-up of 42 months.	The primary endpoint occurred in 48 (27.5%) patients (10.5 per 100 patient-years) including 12 ischemic cerebrovascular events (2.2 per 100 patient-years) and 29 bleeding episodes (5.8 per 100 patient- years). Lower baseline JAKQ scores were associated with the primary outcome (p=0.007), solely when patients who bled during follow-up were compared with the remainder (p=0.007). Patients who were aware of the importance of a regular anticoagulant intake despite the absence of AF symptoms, had, however, a lower risk of cerebrovascular events (p<0.0001). The subjects who experienced bleeding or the primary endpoint were less likely to understand the essence of AF (p=0.03), to know safe painkillers used in combination with OAC (p<0.001), and what to do when the anticoagulant was forgotten (p=0.02). Worse knowledge about AF and OAC, longer OAC therapy, and higher CHA2DS2 -VASc score were independent predictors for the primary endpoint.	Our study shows a prognostic value of low knowledge about AF and OAC supporting the need for improved education of AF patients.",Remaining,0,0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PPCS in children after mTBI and to identify clinical variables in children who are at high risk for developing PPCS. A multicenter, retrospective matched cohort in which PPCS symptoms were evaluated in children 8-15-year-old, 6-60 months after being admitted to the emergency department because of mTBI. The control group included children admitted to the emergency department because of uncomplicated distal radius fractures. The children's guardians were interviewed for the presence of PPCS symptoms using the 'Rivermead Post-Concussion Questionnaire'. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of PPCS. Two-hundred and five children were included in the mTBI group and 205 in the control. The median time from the injury was 33.5 months in the mTBI group and 33.8 in the control. The prevalence of PPCS in the mTBI group was 25.3% and PPCS like symptoms in the control was 2.4%, p < 0.001. Within the 6-60 months period, the PPCS prevalence was not influenced by the time that elapsed from the injury. In the mTBI group, motor vehicle accidents and adolescence were found to be risk factors for PPCS. PPCS is underdiagnosed in the pediatric population and 25% of children admitted to the ED due to mTBI may suffer from PPCS. Screening guidelines should be implemented to identify and properly treat these children.",Remaining,0,0

Similar results were observed for the women who were able-bodied as well as for the women who had poliomyelitis (P>.05). The relationships between heart rate and RPE and Ve and RPE for able-bodied patients and patients with poliomyelitis were similar (R(2)>.87). The relationship between Vo(2) and RPE was stronger in the able-bodied participants compared wih the participants with poliomyelitis, regardless of sex (P<.05). However, when the data were controlled for age, there was no significant difference in the strength of this relationship between able-bodied participants and those with poliomyelitis, regardless of sex (P>.05).

We used data from the Stroke Prevention in Young Women Study, a population-based case-control study of risk factors for ischemic stroke in women aged 15 to 49 years to examine the relationship between cigarette smoking and ischemic stroke. Historical data, including smoking history, was obtained through standardized interviews. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using logistic regression. Cases (n=466) were women with stroke in the greater Baltimore-Washington area, and controls (n=604) were women free of a stroke history identified by random digit dialing.	After multivariable adjustment, the OR comparing current smokers to never smokers was 2.6 (P<0.0001); no difference in stroke risk was observed between former smokers and never smokers. Adjusted OR increased with increasing number of cigarettes smoked per day (OR=2.2 for 1 to 10 cigs/d; 2.5 for 11 to 20 cigs/d; 4.3 for 21 to 39 cigs/d; 9.1 for 40 or more cigs/d).	These results suggest a strong dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and ischemic stroke risk in young women and reinforce the need for aggressive smoking cessation efforts in young adults.",Remaining,0,0
604,29288994,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,Detecting sub-second changes in brain activation patterns during interictal epileptic spike using simultaneous EEG-fMRI.,"Epileptic spikes are associated with rapidly changing brain activation involving the epileptic foci and other brain regions in the 'epileptic network'. We aim to resolve these activation changes using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings.	Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings from 9 patients with epilepsy were used in the analysis. Our method employed the whole scalp EEG data to generate regressors for the analysis of fMRI data using the general linear model.	We were able to resolve, with milliseconds temporal resolution, changes in activation patterns involving suspected epileptic foci and other brain regions in the epileptic network during spike and slow wave. Using summary maps (called SSWAS maps) which show the activation frequency of voxels, we found that suspected epileptic foci tend to be significantly active during this interval. SSWAS maps also enabled the detection of the epileptic foci in 4 of 5 patients where the conventional event-timing-based analysis failed to identify.	These findings demonstrated the efficacy of the method and the potential application of SSWAS maps to identify epileptic foci.	The method could help resolve activation changes during epileptic spike and could provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology of these changes.",Remaining,0,0
605,25031221,Schizophrenia bulletin,Mediodorsal and visual thalamic connectivity differ in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with and without psychosis history.,"Empirical and theoretical studies implicate thalamocortical circuits in schizophrenia, supported by emerging resting-state functional connectivity studies (rs-fcMRI). Similar but attenuated alterations were found in bipolar disorder (BD). However, it remains unknown if segregated loops within thalamocortical systems show distinct rs-fcMRI alterations in schizophrenia. For instance, the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus, known to project to prefrontal networks, may be differently altered than the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), known to project to the occipital cortex. Also, it remains unknown if these circuits show different patterns of alterations in BD as a function of psychosis history, which may be associated with a more severe clinical course. We addressed these questions in 90 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 73 remitted BD patients (33 with psychosis history) matched to 146 healthy comparison subjects. We hypothesized that the MD vs LGN would show dissociations across diagnostic groups. We found that MD and LGN show more qualitative similarities than differences in their patterns of dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. In BD, patterns qualitatively diverged between thalamic nuclei although these effects were modest statistically. BD with psychosis history was associated with more severe dysconnectivity, particularly for the MD nucleus. Also, the MD nucleus showed connectivity reductions with the cerebellum in schizophrenia but not in BD. Results suggest dissociations for thalamic nuclei across diagnoses, albeit carefully controlling for medication is warranted in future studies. Collectively, these findings have implications for designing more precise neuroimaging-driven biomarkers that can identify common and divergent large-scale network perturbations across psychiatric diagnoses with shared symptoms.",Remaining,0,0

The data were obtained from a health system with 19 emergency departments in northeast Ohio in the United States. Baseline period from January 1 to March 8, 2020, was compared with the COVID period from March 9, to April 2, 2020. The variables included were total daily stroke alerts across the hospital emergency departments, thrombolysis, time to presentation, stroke severity, time from door-to-imaging, time from door-to-needle in thrombolysis, and time from door-to-puncture in thrombectomy. The 2 time periods were compared using nonparametric statistics and Poisson regression.	Nine hundred two stroke alerts during the period across the emergency departments were analyzed. Total daily stroke alerts decreased from median, 10 (interquartile range, 8-13) during baseline period to median, 8 (interquartile range, 4-10, P=0.001) during COVID period. Time to presentation, stroke severity, and time to treatment were unchanged. COVID period was associated with decrease in stroke alerts with rate ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.28). Thrombolysis also decreased with rate ratio, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.28-0.97) but thrombectomy remained unchanged rate ratio, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.52-1.62) Conclusions: We observed a significant decrease in acute stroke presentations by ≈30% across emergency departments at the time of surge of COVID-19 cases. This observation could be attributed to true decline in stroke incidence or patients not seeking medical attention for emergencies during the pandemic.",Remaining,0,0

608,34915734,Crisis,Passive Suicidal Ideation in Childhood.,"Background: A growing body of empirical research shows that suicidal behaviors are prevalent in childhood. Yet, few studies have examined risk factors related to suicidal ideation (SI) among children aged 12 and younger. Aims: The current study addresses this gap. Method: A questionnaire was filled out by 1,350 Flemish primary caregivers (94.7% mothers) of 9-year-old children (50.4% boys, Mage = 9.45). Their responses were analyzed using logistic regression and independent samples t tests. Results: The presence of passive SI was reported in 10.5% of the children. A psychiatric, developmental, or behavioral condition (or multiple conditions), a learning disorder, impulsivity, aggression, and experiencing multiple stressful family life events were discovered as potential risk factors of passive SI in childhood. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of this study meant that causality could not be inferred. In addition, it was based on reports of primary caregivers, rather than on reports from the children themselves. Conclusion: These new empirical findings can be used for the development of prevention programs and be taken into account in risk assessments of SI in clinical practice. Confirmation of our findings in a longitudinal child-reported study is needed.",Remaining,0,0

Twenty-four patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who reported hallucinated voices were compared with 21 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who did not report voices and 26 normal subjects. Narrative speech perception was assessed through use of a masked speech tracking task with three levels of superimposed phonetic noise. A sentence repetition task was used to assess grammar-dependent verbal working memory, and an auditory continuous performance task was used to assess nonlanguage attention.	Masked speech tracking task and sentence repetition performance by hallucinating patients was impaired relative to both nonhallucinating patients and normal subjects. Although both hallucinating and nonhallucinating patients demonstrated auditory attention impairments when compared to normal subjects, the two patient groups did not differ with respect to these variables.	Results support the hypothesis that hallucinated voices in schizophrenia arise from disrupted speech perception and verbal working memory systems rather than from nonlanguage cognitive or attentional deficits.",Remaining,0,0
610,32759986,Scientific reports,"Impaired consciousness at stroke onset in large hemisphere infarction: incidence, risk factors and outcome.","Impaired consciousness (IC) at stroke onset in large hemispheric infarctions (LHI) patients is common in clinical practice. However, little is known about the incidence and risk factors of IC at stroke onset in LHI. Besides, stroke-related complications and clinical outcomes in relation to the development of IC has not been systematically examined. Data of 256 consecutive patients with LHI were collected. IC at stroke onset was retrospectively collected from the initial emergency department and/or admission records. Of the 256 LHI patients enrolled, 93 (36.3%) had IC at stroke onset. LHI patients with IC at stroke onset were older (median age 66 vs. 61, p = 0.041), had shorter prehospital delay (24 vs. 26 h, p < 0.001and higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (19 vs. 12, p < 0.001). Independent risk factors of IC at stroke onset were high NIHSS score (odds ratio, OR 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.23) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.47). Dyslipidemia appeared to protect against IC at stroke onset (adjusted OR 0.416, 95% CI 0.175 to 0.988). IC at stroke onset was associated with higher frequency of stroke-related complications (90.32% vs. 67.48%, p < 0.001), especially brain edema (45.16% vs. 23.31%, p < 0.001) and pneumonia (63.44% vs. 47.82%, p = 0.019). The IC group had higher rates of in-hospital death (23.66% vs. 11.66%, p = 0.012), 3-month mortality (49.46% vs. 24.87%, p = 0.002), and 3-month unfavorable outcome (64.51% vs. 49.07%, p = 0.017). However, after adjusting for age, baseline NIHSS score and other confounders, IC at stroke onset was not an independent predictor of in-hospital death (adjusted OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.47), 3-month mortality (adjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.14) and 3-month unfavorable outcome (adjusted OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.33) in LHI patients (all p > 0.05). Our results suggested that IC occur in 1 out of every 3 LHI patients at stroke onset and was associated with initial stroke severity and atrial fibrillation. LHI patients with IC at stroke onset more frequently had stroke-related complications, 3-month mortality and unfavorable outcome, whereas IC was not an independent predictor of poor outcomes.",Remaining,0,0

Thus, this study examined which gait and balance parameters best correlate with periventricular LA to better understand the pathogenesis of mobility decline in MCI. High resolution MRI and detailed mobility assessment were performed in 61 subjects (72 years+/-5) with MCI. Cognitive assessment included Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and the Trail Making test part B (TMB). Mobility assessment included reports of falls in the previous 6-month period, the walking while talking test, the timed 'up and go test' (TUG), measurement of fast gait speed, the standing test and the one-leg standing test. There was an association between marked periventricular LA and slow postural changes, slow gait (TUG and gait speed), altered balance (standing test and one-leg standing test), altered walking while talking test. But after adjusting for age and ventriculomegaly on a logistic multiple regression model, performance on the TUG test was the only clinical predictor of periventricular LA (>10 s, P=0.002). Poorer TUG performances were more frequent with vascular than Alzheimer's disease-like profiles on the FCSRT and TMB tests (P=0.01). In conclusion, the clinical profile of patients demonstrating a main MR brain correlate of mobility dysfunction supports a main pathomechanism of subtle vascular extrapyramidal dysfunction in MCI.",Remaining,0,0

This is a retrospective, interventional case report of four patients seen in the clinic over a 1-year period. All patients had analysis of the Norrie gene by direct sequencing.	All patients presented with a similar retinal appearance of dense stalk tissue, globular dystrophic retina, and peripheral avascular retina with pigmentary changes. Each patient was found to have a mutation in the Norrie gene affecting a cystine residue in the cystine knot domain. The mutations are predicted to disrupt the structure of the protein product, norrin, which is required for activation of the Wnt receptor:beta-catenin pathway.	No other vitreoretinopathy that the authors have seen demonstrates this characteristic retinal presentation of severe retinal dysplasia. All four patients were found to have mutations in the Norrie gene which alter the cystine knot motif. Mutations affecting this domain appear to have devastating effects on retinal development and indicate phenotype correlates with mutations affecting the cystine knot domain.",Remaining,0,0
613,33951249,Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,Hyperactive behaviour in Angelman syndrome: the association with sleep problems and age of epilepsy onset.,"Sleep problems are common in many neurodevelopmental disorders, but little is known about how sleep is related to behavioural symptoms in Angelman syndrome (AS) or other genetic disorders. Hyperactive behaviour, sleep problems and epilepsy seem to be more common in AS than in other genetic conditions associated with severe intellectual disability. We hypothesised that both more sleep problems and earlier onset of epileptic seizures would predict more symptoms of hyperactivity. Hence, the aim of the project was to explore the association between hyperactive behaviour, sleep problems and age of epilepsy onset in individuals with AS.	All known parents/guardians (n = 115) of individuals with AS in Norway were invited to participate in this descriptive correlational study. Fifty-six individuals (49%) responded, and 42 people (25 male and 17 female; mean age 18.5 years, range 2-57 years) with genetically verified AS were included. Scores for 'hyperactivity' and 'sleep problems' were derived from questionnaire data. Information on epilepsy was obtained from medical records.	'Hyperactivity' was positively correlated with 'total sleep problems' (r = 0.46, P = 0.002) and negatively correlated with 'age of epilepsy onset' (r = -0.47, P = 0.01). 'Age of epilepsy onset' was not correlated with 'total sleep problems'. An overall multiple regression model with 'hyperactivity' as the dependent variable and 'age of epilepsy onset' and 'total sleep problems' as covariates was significant (R[2]  = 0.39, F = 8.16, P = 0.002). Hence, hyperactivity in AS could be predicted from both age of epilepsy onset and current sleep problems.	Sleep problems may increase hyperactivity symptoms in individuals with AS. The association between hyperactivity and sleep problems in AS indicates that both should be investigated together as part of routine clinical assessment and intervention for either area of difficulty. Younger age of epilepsy onset was associated with more hyperactivity in AS, which may be related to encephalopathic effects of seizures and epilepsy.",Remaining,0,0

615,24243441,Schizophrenia bulletin,"Aberrant coupling within and across the default mode, task-positive, and salience network in subjects at risk for psychosis.","The task-positive network (TPN) is anticorrelated with activity in the default mode network (DMN), and possibly reflects competition between the processing of external and internal information, while the salience network (SN) is pivotal in regulating TPN and DMN activity. Because abnormal functional connectivity in these networks has been related to schizophrenia, we tested whether alterations are also evident in subjects at risk for psychosis. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was tested in 28 subjects with basic symptoms reporting subjective cognitive-perceptive symptoms; 19 with attenuated or brief, limited psychotic symptoms; and 29 matched healthy controls. We characterized spatial differences in connectivity patterns, as well as internetwork connectivity. Right anterior insula (rAI) was selected as seed region for identifying the SN; medioprefrontal cortex (MPFC) for the DMN and TPN. The 3 groups differed in connectivity patterns between the MPFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), and between the rAI and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In particular, the typically observed antagonistic relationship in MPFC-rDLPFC, rAI-PCC, and internetwork connectivity of DMN-TPN was absent in both at-risk groups. Notably, those connectivity patterns were associated with symptoms related to reality distortions, whereas enhanced connectivity strengths of MPFC-rDLPFC and TPN-DMN were related to poor performance in cognitive functions. We propose that the loss of a TPN-DMN anticorrelation, accompanied by an aberrant spatial extent in the DMN, TPN, and SN in the psychosis risk state, reflects the confusion of internally and externally focused states and disturbance of cognition, as seen in psychotic disorders.",Remaining,0,0
616,17469116,Annals of neurology,Pathological TDP-43 distinguishes sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with SOD1 mutations.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a common, fatal motor neuron disorder with no effective treatment. Approximately 10% of cases are familial ALS (FALS), and the most common genetic abnormality is superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) mutations. Most ALS research in the past decade has focused on the neurotoxicity of mutant SOD1, and this knowledge has directed therapeutic strategies. We recently identified TDP-43 as the major pathological protein in sporadic ALS. In this study, we investigated TDP-43 in a larger series of ALS cases (n = 111), including familial cases with and without SOD1 mutations.	Ubiquitin and TDP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed on postmortem tissue from sporadic ALS (n = 59), ALS with SOD1 mutations (n = 15), SOD-1-negative FALS (n = 11), and ALS with dementia (n = 26). Biochemical analysis was performed on representative cases from each group.	All cases of sporadic ALS, ALS with dementia, and SOD1-negative FALS had neuronal and glial inclusions that were immunoreactive for both ubiquitin and TDP-43. Cases with SOD1 mutations had ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions; however, no cases were immunoreactive for TDP-43. Biochemical analysis of postmortem tissue from sporadic ALS and SOD1-negative FALS demonstrated pathological forms of TDP-43 that were absent in cases with SOD1 mutations.	These findings implicate pathological TDP-43 in the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS. In contrast, the absence of pathological TDP-43 in cases with SOD1 mutations implies that motor neuron degeneration in these cases may result from a different mechanism, and that cases with SOD1 mutations may not be the familial counterpart of sporadic ALS.",Remaining,0,0

Identify a useful system to obtain a reliable remote monitoring of glucose and the most important vital parameters in the acromegalic subjects.	Sixteen acromegalic patients (from 30 to 73 years old) were enrolled. We provided health monitor devices to the patients for continuous acquisition of physiological signals including twelve-lead electrocardiography (EKG) and nocturnal SpO2. At the same time, we applied on the same patients the blinded continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS).	The lowest saturation peaks at night (<80%) were achieved in patients with a known diagnosis of OSAS. A positive correlation was demonstrated between the lowest oxygen saturation values and the CGM peaks (pV <0,0001) and between the average values of oxygen saturation and CGM (pV<0,0003). Patients with a previous diagnosis of OSAS, obtained by polysomnography, showed on the multiparametric monitor recordings superimposable to their known condition. Instead we noticed a discordance in the two EKG recording: the wireless mode showed an irregular rhythm in 5/16 patients, which was not confirmed by the recording mode with cables.	The health monitor device associated with CGM may be a new useful and versatile tool for fragile patients who can self-manage remote monitoring, and for physicians who can obtain real-time information for the clinical and therapeutic management of patients.

SULEHS is an ultra-rare disorder associated with biallelic loss-of-function variants of the TASP1 gene, and up-to-date, seven patients from five families have been reported in the literature. Loss of TASP1 function has been reported to alter H3K4 histone modifications and expression of TFIIA and HOX transcription factors in the SULEHS phenotype. In this report, a new patient molecularly diagnosed with SULEHS by a novel homozygous c.404-2A > G variant in the TASP1 gene is presented with the long-term follow-up. Although the majority of the patient's clinical characteristics were similar to those of previously reported SULEHS patients, this study was the first to describe some additional anomalies, such as cystic hygroma, increased nuchal thickness, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary sequestration anomaly, chronic constipation, encephalomalacia, and aggressive behavior. Because of the remarkable similarities between the clinical features of Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BRWS) and the patient, BRWS was considered the most likely diagnosis before the molecular diagnosis. Network analysis also supported that the interaction of the SULEHS-associated TASP1 gene with the BRWS-associated ACTB and ACTG1 genes through common intermediate molecules. Overall, despite the existence of differences in clinical features, inheritance patterns, and underlying pathophysiology between BRWS and SULEHS, both diseases could be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the high clinical similarities, including the dysmorphic features, growth parameters, neurodevelopmental phenotype, neurological problems, and multisystem involvement. Additionally, this report could contribute to a better understanding of the genotypic and clinical features of SULEHS by describing a novel pathogenic variant and new clinical features, such as prenatal manifestations.",Remaining,0,0
620,24225435,The Israel journal of psychiatry and related sciences,Elaboration on posttraumatic stress disorder diagnostic criteria: a factor analytic study of PTSD exposure to war or terror.,"In societies facing prolonged exposure to war and terror, empirical research provides mixed support for the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters groupings identified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR) as re-experiencing the event, avoidance and emotional numbing, and hyperarousal.	This study examines the validity of the PTSD symptom clusters in elements of Israeli society exposed to man-made trauma. Survivors (N=2,198) of seven different war and terror-related traumas were assessed using a DSM-IV-TR based PTSD inventory. Four confirmatory factor analytic models were compared.	The most acceptable model was a correlated model consisting of four factors of re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal. DSM-IV-TR avoidance empirically split into active avoidance and emotional numbing. These results corroborate knowledge and suggest that in Israel, where stressors are ongoing, the PTSD symptom clusters may be reformulated in DSM-5 to consist of re-experiencing, active avoidance, emotional numbing and hyperarousal.",Remaining,0,0

Cardiovascular Imaging,[18F]FDG positron emission tomography in patients presenting with suspicion of giant cell arteritis-lessons from a vasculitis clinic.,"The usefulness of [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([18F]FDG-PET/CT) for diagnosing giant cell arteritis (GCA) has been previously reported. Yet, the interpretation of PET scans is not clear-cut. The present study aimed at determining the best method to analyse PET/CT in a large, real-life cohort of patients presenting with suspicion of GCA.	One hundred and three patients with clinical suspicion of GCA undergoing PET/CT between 2006 and 2012 were included. Clinical data were retrieved from patients' charts. PET/CT was categorized by visual scoring of the uptake and by the artery/liver standardized uptake values (SUV) ratios. Diagnosis of GCA was confirmed in 68 patients and excluded in 35 patients, which served as the controls. GCA patients were older (median age 75 vs. 68 years), and presented more often with ischaemic symptoms. The best discrimination between GCA patients and controls was achieved for PET/CT findings within the supra-aortic arteries (sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.91 for a SUV/LE cut-off value of 1.0). Specificity of PET/CT for the aorta and the iliofemoral arteries was lower (<0.34). Visual scoring correlated poorly to SUV measurements (Kendall Tau-b 0.13-0.55) and had a lower diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.75). Prednisone treatment for ≥10 days significantly reduced PET/CT sensitivity (P = 0.009).	SUV based analysis of PET/CT enhances diagnostic accuracy with best discrimination in the supra-aortic region, particularly in steroid naïve patients. For discrimination based on the aorta and the iliofemoral region, higher cut-off values have to be applied, resulting in lower sensitivities for diagnosing GCA.",Remaining,0,0
622,29067401,Journal of vision,Motion-generated optical information allows event perception despite blurry vision in AMD and amblyopic patients.,"Events consist of objects in motion. When objects move, their opaque surfaces reflect light and produce both static image structure and dynamic optic flow. The static and dynamic optical information co-specify events. Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and amblyopia cannot identify static objects because of weakened image structure. However, optic flow is detectable despite blurry vision because visual motion measurement uses low spatial frequencies. When motion ceases, image structure persists and might preserve properties specified by optic flow. We tested whether optic flow and image structure interact to allow event perception with poor static vision. AMD (Experiment 1), amblyopic (Experiments 2 and 3), and normally sighted observers identified common events from either blurry (Experiments 1 and 2) or clear images (Experiment 3), when either single image frames were presented, a sequence of frames was presented with motion masks, or a sequence of frames was presented with detectable motion. Results showed that with static images, but no motion, events were not perceived well by participants other than controls in Experiment 3. However, with detectable motion, events were perceived. Immediately following this and again after five days, participants were able to identify events from the original static images. So, when image structure information is weak, optic flow compensates for it and enables event perception. Furthermore, weakened static image structure information nevertheless preserves information that was once available in optic flow. The combination is powerful and allows events to be perceived accurately and stably despite blurry vision.",Remaining,0,0

Additionally, the relationship of the scores to chemical, physical, and cognitive findings is described.	With Rutter's Child Behavior Scale A and a modified Werry-Weiss-Peters Activity Scale, 118 Yu-chen children and matched controls were followed biannually from 1985 to 1991.	At each year, the Yu-cheng children scored 7% to 43% worse (mean = 23%) than control children on the Rutter scale. At any fixed age, the Yu-cheng children scored 11% to 63% (mean = 28%) worse. The effect for children born later did not differ from that for those born earlier; neither was there any improvement as the children aged. A similar but weaker picture was seen for the activity score. These behavioral findings were not related to physical or cognitive findings or to serum PCB levels.	In utero exposure to heat-degraded PCBs appears to cause mildly disordered behavior and increased activity level; the effect persists over time and is similar in children born up to 6 years after the mothers were exposed.",Remaining,0,0

Their ictal perfusion patterns were analyzed in relation to temporal and frontal hyperperfusion during TLE seizures using SPECT subtraction.	Thirty-three TLE patients had interictal and ictal SPECT, video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, and volumetric MRI. SPECT subtraction with MRI coregistration was performed using commercial software. The presence of ictal hyperperfusion was determined in the ipsilateral and contralateral temporal lobe, frontal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia.	All patients showed ictal hyperperfusion in the temporal lobe of seizure origin. Vermian cerebellar hyperperfusion (CH) was observed in 26 patients (78.8%) and hemispheric CH was found in 25 (75.8%). Compared with the side of the epileptogenic temporal lobe, there were 7 patients with ipsilateral hemispheric CH (28.0%), 15 with contralateral hemispheric CH (60.0%), and 3 with bilateral hemispheric CH (12.0%). CH was observed more frequently in patients with additional frontal hyperperfusion (14/15, 93.3%; 2 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 10 contralateral, and 2 bilateral) than in patients without frontal hyperperfusion (11/18, 61.1%). Among 18 patients with temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion, 11 patients showed hemispheric CH (5 ipsilateral to seizure focus, 5 contralateral, 1 bilateral). Hyperperfusion in the basal ganglia (BGH) was seen in 11 of the 15 patients with temporal and frontal hyperperfusion (73.3%) and in 11 of the 18 with only temporal hyperperfusion (61.1%). In 17 patients with unilateral BGH (13 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 4 contralateral), CH contralateral to the BGH was observed in 14 (82.5%), CH ipsilateral to the BGH was found in 2 (11.8%), and CH bilateral to the BGH was found in 1 (5.9%).	During TLE seizures, hemispheric CH occurred not only in contralateral but also in ipsilateral or bilateral cerebellar hemispheres to the side of seizure origin. Although temporal lobe origin seizures associated with additional frontal hyperperfusion produced more frequent hemispheric CH, seizures showing only temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion could produce BGH and CH. To determine the side of hemispheric CH, the most important factor appears to be the side of BGH, not the side of seizure origin.",Remaining,0,0

Their common complaints are examined as core symbolic elements in culturally patterned complexes of meanings focused around personal trauma, stressful life events, personal and social reactions, expectations about treatment, and the course of illness. Many of these women report themselves to be 'nervous,' to be 'sick from nerves,' or to have had an 'ataque de nervios.' 'Nervousness' is the base symbolic domain in Puerto Rico of what psychiatry labels 'anxiety disorder,' although it is also a common complaint of many disorders. What 'nervousness' means to patients/clients and their clinicians or healers is examined within the frames of multilayered popular and biomedical interpretations. The special difficulties of women in Puerto Rico are highlighted, and psychiatric and ethnopsychological (Spiritist) models of etiology and treatment are compared.",Remaining,0,0

Furthermore, a specific category of women, deemed to be women-at-risk, face particular challenges in their journey and resettlement process. This longitudinal study investigated psychological distress in refugee women-at-risk one year after resettlement in Australia. Follow-up survey of 83 women-at-risk (mean age = 33.41 years; SD = 11.93) assessed: trauma events and symptoms; loss events and loss distress; level of post-migration problems; anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms; and absence of trust in community members. Participants demonstrated no symptom change since initial assessment (p > .05). Substantial proportions of women reported traumatization (39%), PTSD (20%), anxiety (32%), and depression (39%) above clinical cut-offs, and high levels of somatization and loss distress. Post-migration problems, trauma events, and region of birth were associated with all symptoms, with post-migration problems the strongest predictor. Absence of trust in community members was associated with trauma, depression, and somatic symptoms. Initial trauma and somatic symptoms were associated with follow-up traumatic and somatic symptoms. Loss and trauma events were associated with loss distress. Findings underline the role of post-migration problems on psychological distress and the need to consider women's psychological wellbeing in the context of their trauma and loss history, potential impacts of ethnicity, and complex socio-cultural dynamics underpinning issues of trust within communities. Effective service delivery requires that practitioners screen for and address psychological distress in women-at-risk at least up to 18 months after resettlement.",Remaining,0,0

631,9426989,Ethnicity & health,Symptoms in children of British and of Bangladeshi parents measured by the Rutter B2 Questionnaire.,"Bangladeshi children are less frequently referred to a child psychiatric clinic than their British peers. This study aimed to ascertain if teachers observed less psychological symptoms in Bangladeshi than British children.	Teachers completed a Rutter B2 Scale on samples of 113 'Bangladeshi' and 61 British children aged between 5 and 11 years.	Teachers recognised less symptomatology in the Asian children than their British peers. This trend was significant in children under the age of 8, but there was no significant difference in those aged 8-11 years. Only 13% of Bangladeshi children were fully fluent in English.	Two alternate hypotheses are put forward to explain these findings: (a) because more of the younger children could not speak English and communicate freely with their teachers, their symptoms were not noted by teachers; (b) the symptoms of the older children were a response to the pressures both the children and families faced as new immigrants. This study clearly needs to be replicated with a larger sample and also with interviews with both children and parents in order to validate the Rutter B2 questionnaires as an appropriate measure of disturbance in Bangladeshi children. It should be replicated with validated assessments of the children's fluency in English. It is also important to discuss with Bangladeshi parents what support they would like from both the school and from child psychiatric services, to promote their children's psychological health.",Remaining,0,0
632,29052307,Developmental science,Instrumental learning and cognitive flexibility processes are impaired in children exposed to early life stress.,"Children who experience severe early life stress show persistent deficits in many aspects of cognitive and social adaptation. Early stress might be associated with these broad changes in functioning because it impairs general learning mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we examined whether individuals who experienced abusive caregiving in childhood had difficulties with instrumental learning and/or cognitive flexibility as adolescents. Fifty-three 14-17-year-old adolescents (31 exposed to high levels of childhood stress, 22 control) completed an fMRI task that required them to first learn associations in the environment and then update those pairings. Adolescents with histories of early life stress eventually learned to pair stimuli with both positive and negative outcomes, but did so more slowly than their peers. Furthermore, these stress-exposed adolescents showed markedly impaired cognitive flexibility; they were less able than their peers to update those pairings when the contingencies changed. These learning problems were reflected in abnormal activity in learning- and attention-related brain circuitry. Both altered patterns of learning and neural activation were associated with the severity of lifetime stress that the adolescents had experienced. Taken together, the results of this experiment suggest that basic learning processes are impaired in adolescents exposed to early life stress. These general learning mechanisms may help explain the emergence of social problems observed in these individuals.",Remaining,0,0

The densities of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles labelled by anti-ubiquitin antibody were correlated with the Blessed test score. Ubiquitin-positive neurofibrillary tangles were less numerous than those labelled by Gallyas, anti-tau, Bodian's and Bielschowsky's methods. There were five times more beta A4 deposits than ubiquitin positive plaques. beta A4 deposits could be numerous in cases in which ubiquitin immunolabelling was entirely negative. Bielschowsky's method, silver methenamine and thioflavin S revealed more senile plaques than anti-ubiquitin, whereas anti-tau, Gallyas', Bodian's and Cross' techniques revealed similar numbers. Anti-ubiquitin positive lesions were correlated with the severity of dementia. Compared with other staining methods, sensitivity of anti-ubiquitin was weaker for neurofibrillary tangles than for senile plaques. These findings suggest that ubiquitin epitopes are linked to the neurofibrillary changes (in the perikaryon or within the senile plaques), and are absent from beta A4 deposits, either diffuse or compact.",Remaining,0,0

The CBFVs, resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were measured in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries (ACA and MCA) of 38 normal neonates.	The mean peak systolic, end diastolic and time-averaged velocities (PSV, EDV and TAV) were 36.3 ± 6.6, 12.4 ± 3.9 and 22.0 ± 4.0 cm/s (ACA) and 41.4 ± 13.2, 13.0 ± 5.5 and 25.8 ± 7.9 cm/s (MCA), respectively.

Correlations were observed with post-natal age and post-prandial time (dichotomous). The average angle of insonation was greater in the ACA than in the MCA (median of 5° vs. 18°).	Results corresponded with previous published studies. No correlation was observed between Doppler indices and gestation as component velocities all increase with advancing gestation.

The aim of this study was to develop and internally validate a model for aneurysm rupture based on hemodynamic and geometric parameters, aneurysm location, and patient gender and age.	Cross-sectional data from 1061 patients were used for image-based computational fluid dynamics and shape characterization of 1631 aneurysms for training an aneurysm rupture probability model using logistic group Lasso regression.

An adverse hemodynamic environment characterized by a higher maximum oscillatory shear index, higher kinetic energy and smaller low shear area as well as a more complex aneurysm shape, male gender and younger age were associated with an increased rupture risk. The corresponding AUC of the model was 0.86 (95% CI [0.85, 0.86], after correction for optimism 0.84).

To directly investigate the role of acid SMase in IL-1 and TNF receptor-mediated signal transduction, we examined the ability of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) type A fibroblasts, which are deficient in acid SMase, to induce IL-8 gene expression through activating NFkB. Unexpectedly, IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha efficiently induced IL-8 production and IL-8 mRNA in NPD type A fibroblasts as in normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, activation of NFkB was also induced in NPD type A fibroblasts in response to IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha stimulation to a similar extent as in normal fibroblasts. These results provide evidence that acid SMase is not essential in IL-1 and TNF receptor signaling leading to NFkB activation as well as the cytokine gene activation which is regulated by NFkB.",Remaining,0,0

Mental patients have unhealthier lifestyles and they appear to be more refractory to recommendations than the general population, indicating the necessity of specific health promotion programmes in this population.",Remaining,0,0
643,12206066,Journal of drug education,The expected personality characteristics of alcohol-dependent individuals.,"The Big Five personality factors were used as a framework for examining the expected personality characteristics of individuals who are alcohol-dependent. In an experimental study, participants used a measure of the Big Five personality factors to rate two individuals, each described with either signs of alcohol dependence or not. The ratings of the participants showed that they expected the alcohol-dependent versions of both individuals to be less agreeable and less conscientious. The participants expected the alcohol-dependent college student to be more extraverted and the alcohol-dependent lawyer-father to be more neurotic. The expected personality characteristics of the alcohol-dependent versions of the two described persons were very similar to the actual personality characteristics of alcohol-dependent individuals. The results were consistent with prior findings regarding narrow-band personality traits related to the Big Five. The results help explain prior findings about the social handicap of problem drinking with regard to making friends, dating, marriage, and working. The findings have potential use in alcohol-problem prevention and treatment.",Remaining,0,0
644,19176415,"Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)",Treatment patterns for schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia among Medicaid patients.,"This study compared background characteristics, pharmacologic treatment, and service use of adults treated for schizoaffective disorder and adults treated for schizophrenia.	Medicaid claims data from two states were analyzed with a focus on adults treated for schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia. Patient groups were compared regarding demographic characteristics, pharmacologic treatment, and health service use during 180 days before and after a claim for either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.	A larger proportion of patients were treated for schizophrenia (N=38,760; 70.1%) than for schizoaffective disorder (N=16,570; 29.9%). During the 180 days before the index diagnosis claim, significantly more patients with schizoaffective disorder than those with schizophrenia were treated for depressive disorder (19.6% versus 11.4%, p<.001), bipolar disorder (14.8% versus 5.8%, p<.001), substance use disorder (11.8% versus 9.7%, p<.001), and anxiety disorder (6.9% versus 5.3%, p<.001). After the index claim, a similar proportion of both diagnostic groups were treated with antipsychotic medications (schizoaffective disorder, 87.3%; schizophrenia, 87.0%), although patients with schizoaffective disorder were significantly more likely than patients with schizophrenia to receive antidepressants (61.7% versus 44.0%, p<.001), mood stabilizers (55.2% versus 34.4%, p<.001), and anxiolytics (43.2% versus 35.1%, p<.001). Patients with schizoaffective disorder were also significantly more likely than patients with schizophrenia to receive psychotherapy (23.4% versus 13.0%, p<.001) and inpatient mental health care (9.4% versus 6.2%, p<.001), although the latter was not significant after the analysis controlled for background characteristics.	Schizoaffective disorder is commonly diagnosed among Medicaid beneficiaries. These patients often receive complex pharmacologic regimens, and many also receive treatment for mood disorders. Differences in service use patterns between schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia argue for separate consideration of their health care needs.",Remaining,0,0

Patients had lower BMI, lower Fat Mass and lower Bone Mass compared to controls; their serum levels of LH, FT(3), DHEAS, Insulin and Leptin were significantly reduced. Low Bone Density, especially in the lumbar region, correlated with concentrations of FT(3), Cortisol, Insulin and Leptin, hormones expressive of metabolic adjustment to malnutrition. Lean Mass was a strong predictor of osteopenia and osteoporosis.

The Project SIEP-DIRECT'S].,"To evaluate the quality of psychiatric care during the acute psychotic episode and the early post-acute period.	Data concerning 24 indicators, drawn from NICE recommendations, were collected in 19 Departments of Mental Health, in the frame of the SIEP-DIRECT'S Project to evaluate the implementation of NICE recommendations in Italian Mental Health Services.	The treatment of the acute episode in the Italian Mental Health Services is not based only on admissions in Psychiatric Ward in General Hospitals, but also on intensive home based care. The utilization of day hospital facilities for treating acute episodes is less frequent, as the presence of home based follow up after discharge. About 3/4 of Departments of Mental Health did not have clinical guidelines concerning the pharmacological treatment in this area. However usually the standard practices followed NICE recommendations in terms of prescribed dosages, monitoring side effects and rationale for shifting to atypical antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drugs, atypical or conventional, were frequently prescribed concurrently, while utilization of atypical antipsychotic drugs was increasing.	The results show critical points concerning on one hand the scarce diffusion of clinical guidelines, on other hand the connection between standard practices, clinical guidelines and marketing of atypical antipsychotic drugs. It should be reinforced the role of the community and particularly at service level the capacity of community mental health teams to treat the acute patients.",Remaining,0,0

The aim of this study is to evaluate the liquid phase gastric emptying and motility in migraine patients in ictal and interictal periods in comparison to normal subjects with gastric emptying scintigraphy. Seven women with migraine and age, sex matched controls who applied to the Neurology Department from May 2009 to May 2010 were compared. Gastric emptying study with a standard liquid was performed one time in the non-migraineur group and two times in the migraineur group. Non-migraineur controls and migraineurs were compared. The mean T1/2 was longer in ictal period in migraineurs. The T1/2 of migraineurs interictally and the control groups were similar. The T1/2 of migraineurs ictally and migraineurs interictally were also compared. We also considered the percentage of the radioactive material remaining in the stomach. There were no significant differences between non-migraineurs and migraineurs interictally. However, increased amount of radioactive material remaining in the stomach was observed in migraineurs ictally. We concluded that the liquid emptying was delayed in spontaneous migraine attacks in migraine without aura, however in the interictal period the emptying of liquids did not differ between migraineurs and non-migraineurs.",Remaining,0,0

Although current guidelines do not recommend routine blood culture in uncomplicated cellulitis, their implementation in clinical practice remains challenging. We therefore aimed to assess the frequency, determinants and microbiology of bacteremia in hospitalized patients with uncomplicated cellulitis.	We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all adult patients admitted at a primary-care hospital with a diagnosis of community-acquired uncomplicated cellulitis during a 4-year period. We looked at the factors associated with blood cultures sampling and at the incidence, determinants and microbiology of bacteremia in this population.	Among the 476 patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of cellulitis, 250 (52.5%) had blood cultures. Fever, high C-reactive protein and lymphatic insufficiency were significantly associated with the sampling of blood cultures. Twelve (4.8%) patients had bacteremia. Alcoholism and duration of hospitalization were associated with bacteremia in multivariate analysis. Among the 12 patients with bacteremia, 9 had Streptococcus sp. and 3 had Staphylococcus aureus infection.	In our study population with uncomplicated cellulitis, representative of unselected population admitted at primary-care hospitals, bacteremia was uncommon and not associated with discriminant patient characteristics, except for alcohol abuse. Episodes of bacteremia were exclusively due to gram-positive cocci susceptible to co-amoxicilin, a common first-line empirical therapy. In accordance with existing guidelines, we do not recommend to collect blood for cultures in uncomplicated cellulitis. Clinicians' awareness of guidelines and of the poor yield of blood cultures could reduce useless investigation.",Remaining,0,0

This study aims to investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation on patients with diagnosed peripheral arterial disease.	This is a retrospective study using The Health Improvement Network database, which contains prospectively collected data from participating primary care practices. Patients with a new diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease between January 8, 1995 and January 5, 2017 were identified in the database alongside relevant demographic information, clinical history, and medications. Every patient in the dataset with peripheral arterial disease and baseline atrial fibrillation (case) was matched to a patient without atrial fibrillation (control) with similar characteristics using propensity score matching. Cox-regression analysis was performed and hazard ratios (HR) calculated for the outcomes of death, stroke, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and major amputation.	Prevalence of atrial fibrillation in this cohort was 10.2%. All patients with peripheral arterial disease and atrial fibrillation (n = 5685) were matched with 5685 patients without atrial fibrillation but otherwise similar characteristics. After multivariate analysis, atrial fibrillation was independently associated with mortality (HR 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.26; P < .01), cerebrovascular events (HR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17-1.57; P < .01), and heart failure (HR 1.87; 95% CI, 1.62-2.15; P < .01), but not with ischemic heart disease or limb loss.	In peripheral arterial disease patients, atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for mortality, stroke, and heart failure. This emphasizes the need for proactive surveillance and holistic management of these patients.",Remaining,0,0

A total of 7.3% of patients had suicidal ideation during the in-hospital evaluation (acute-onset suicidal ideation), and 11.3% developed it during the chronic 3 to 24 month rehabilitation period (delayed-onset suicidal ideation). Compared with delayed-onset suicidal patients, acute-onset suicidal patients had more predisposing risk factors (i.e., personal psychiatric history and alcohol abuse/dependence) and less social support (i.e., lower frequency of being married). Both acute and delayed-onset suicidal ideation, however, were strongly associated with the existence of major depression and impaired social functioning. These findings suggest that the detection and appropriate treatment of depressive disorders and social isolation may be the most important factor in preventing suicide both during the acute and chronic period following life-threatening physical illnesses.",Remaining,0,0

The Institute of Cognitive Neurology Frontal Screening (IFS) is a well-validated screening tool allowing the rapid assessment of multiple components of executive function in Spanish-speaking individuals. In this study, we examined performance on the IFS in subjects with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), an inherited condition leading to the early onset of SVD. We further explored associations between performance on the IFS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of SVD.	We recruited 24 asymptomatic CADASIL subjects and 23 noncarriers from Colombia. All subjects underwent a research MRI and a neuropsychological evaluation, including the IFS. Structural MRI markers of SVD were quantified in each subject, together with an SVD Sum Score representing the overall burden of cerebrovascular alterations. General linear model, correlation, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to explore group differences on the IFS and relationships with MRI markers of SVD.	CADASIL subjects had a significantly reduced performance on the IFS Total Score. Performance on the IFS correlated with all quantified markers of SVD, except for brain atrophy and perivascular spaces enlargement. Finally, while the IFS Total Score was not able to accurately discriminate between carriers and noncarriers, it showed adequate sensitivity and specificity in detecting the presence of multiple MRI markers of SVD.	These results suggest that the IFS may be a useful screening tool to assess executive function and disease severity in the context of SVD.",Remaining,0,0
652,18258339,Neurobiology of aging,Prefrontal cortex atrophy predicts dementia over a six-year period.,"The present study investigated prefrontal cortex (PFC) atrophy as a possible predictor of dementia. Eighty-eight older participants of the Maastricht Aging Study (MAAS) were administered for neuropsychological tests at baseline and after three years (t(3)). Magnetic resonance images were acquired at t(3) and nine years after baseline all participants were screened for dementia. Three groups were distinguished: (1) participants who did not develop dementia or cognitive decline, (2) participants who did not develop dementia but did show significant cognitive decline, and (3) participants who developed dementia. Gray matter volume of structures in the PFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL) was measured. Prefrontal volume was significantly smaller in group 3 than in the other two groups, and PFC volume was significantly better than MTL volume in distinguishing between groups 2 and 3. These findings suggest that PFC atrophy is highly associated with dementia and can be considered an important predictor of the disease. It may even be a better predictor than the MTL atrophy that has been found in earlier studies.",Remaining,0,0

We aimed to examine suicide risk among Tunisian UHR and First Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients at baseline, and to evaluate the evolution and correlates of suicidal ideation over a 12-month period in the UHR group exclusively.	35 UHR (aged 22.8 ± 4.0 years, 45.7% male) and 33 FEP (aged 27.3 ± 4.8 years, 63.6% male) participants were included. The Comprehensive Assessment of at Risk Mental States, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were used.	No significant differences were found between the UHR and the FEP groups with regard to levels of suicidal ideation at baseline. Suicidal ideation scores showed a significant decrease over time in UHR participants (p=.014; η2=0.242). An increase in total PANSS scores at 1 year (Beta=0.03; p=.048; 95%CI 0.001, 0.060; η2=0.182) significantly increased suicidal ideation scores at 1 year in the UHR group.

Fourteen people with ABI and related gait pattern impairment (age 32 +/- 8 yr) wore an MTI Actigraph that measured activity (counts.min(-1)) and a Cosmed K4b(2) that measured oxygen consumption (mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) during four activities: quiet sitting (QS) and comfortable paced (CP), brisk paced (BP), and fast paced (FP) walking. MET levels were predicted from Actigraph counts using a published equation and compared with Cosmed measures. Predicted METs for each of the 56 activity bouts (14 participants x 4 bouts) were classified (light, moderate, vigorous, or very vigorous intensity) and compared with Cosmed-based classifications.	Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that walking condition intensities were significantly different (P < 0.05) and the Actigraph detected the differences. Overall correlation between measured and predicted METs was positive, moderate, and significant (r = 0.74). Mean predicted METs were not significantly different from measured for CP and BP, but for FP walking, predicted METs were significantly less than measured (P < 0.05). The Actigraph correctly classified intensity for 76.8% of all activity bouts and 91.5% of light- and moderate-intensity bouts.	Actigraph counts provide a valid index of activity across the intensities investigated in this study. For light to moderate activity, Actigraph-based estimates of METs are acceptable for group-level analysis and are a valid means of classifying activity intensity. The Actigraph significantly underestimated higher intensity activity, although, in practice, this limitation will have minimal impact on activity measurement of most community-dwelling people with ABI.",Remaining,0,0

In patients with Cushing's disease ACTH, beta-endorphin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels in the inferior petrosal sinus ipsilateral to the adenoma were significantly higher than in the periphery and in the contralateral inferior petrosal sinus (p < 0.01, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). In patients with other pituitary diseases only ACTH and beta-endorphin, but not alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels in both inferior petrosal sinuses were significantly higher than in the periphery (p < 0.01). Furthermore, no difference was found in the peripheral blood among patients with Cushing's disease, patients with other pituitary diseases and normal subjects for ACTH and beta-endorphin level. By contrast, in patients with Cushing's disease peripheral alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone levels were significantly higher than in patients with other pituitary diseases and in normal subjects (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that only in patients with Cushing's disease, but not in patients with other pituitary diseases, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is released by adenomatous pituitary corticotrophs together with ACTH and beta-endorphin.",Remaining,0,0

This study examined which factors of psychopathology are linked with the referral of BN patients to inpatient treatment while controlling for history of suicide attempts and history of underweight. 126 females with a current diagnosis of BN purging type were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and interviewed about their history of treatment for the BN, history of weight, and history of suicide attempts. Logistic regressions were conducted to examine whether psychiatric comorbidity, suicide attempts, and underweight were associated with inpatient treatment history. Axis I comorbidity in general, but no specific axis I disorder, was associated with inpatient history. Axes II comorbidity, especially Cluster B disorders and to a lesser degree depressive/negativistic personality disorders, was associated with a history of inpatient treatment. History of suicide attempts was also linked with inpatient experience, but history of underweight was not. The results showed that BN patients with specific types of comorbidity are more likely to be hospitalized than others.",Remaining,0,0

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of mutations occurring in exon 14 of ATP7B gene in Romanian patients referred to a tertiary gastroenterology center, with known or suspected WD and in asymptomatic first degree relatives of index cases.	93 patients were included in the study. Exon 14 of ATP7B gene has been amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and mutations identified by sequencing.	Only H1069Q missense mutation was detected in our study group. In patients with an established diagnosis of WD (38 cases), 34.2% were heterozygous for H1069Q and 21.1% were homozygous, with an allelic frequency of 38.1%. In paediatric WD patients (12 cases) 25% were heterozygous and 16.7% were homozygous (not significant versus adult population). Among asymptomatic first degree relatives of patients with WD (12 siblings, 25 parents) there were 40.5% cases heterozygous for H1069Q. In patients with suspected WD (17 cases), only 5.9% were heterozygous and no homozygous patient was identified. In our study group, H1069Q screening alone could not raise the Leipzig score to confirm diagnosis in patients with suspected WD or in asymptomatic first degree relatives.

This observational study of 1507 depressed adults examined baseline screens for hazardous drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score ≥ 8), severe anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item score ≥ 15) and bipolar disorder [Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ) positive screen]; 6-month depression remission; primary care, psychiatric, emergency department (ED) and inpatient visits 1 year postbaseline; and multiple covariates. Analyses included logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression.	At unadjusted baseline, 60.7% had no positive screens beyond depression, 31.5% had one (mostly severe anxiety), 6.6% had two and 1.2% had all three. In multivariate models, positive screens reduced odds of remission versus no positive screens [e.g., one screen odds ratio (OR) = 0.608, p = .000; all three OR = 0.152, p = .018]. Screening positive for severe anxiety predicted more postbaseline visits of all types; severe anxiety plus hazardous drinking predicted greater primary care, ED and inpatient; severe anxiety plus MDQ and the combination of all three positive screens both predicted greater psychiatric visits (all p < .05). Regression-adjusted utilization patterns varied across combinations of positive screens.	Positive screens predicted lower remission. Severe anxiety and its combinations with other positive screens were common and generally predicted greater utilization.

However, it is challenging to create anatomically accurate head phantoms with realistic brain imaging properties because standard fabrication methods are not optimized to replicate any patient-specific anatomical detail and 3D printing materials are not optimized for imaging properties. In order to test and validate a novel navigation system for use during brain tumor surgery, an anatomically accurate phantom with realistic imaging and mechanical properties was required. Therefore, a phantom was developed using real patient data as input and 3D printing of molds to fabricate a patient-specific head phantom comprising the skull, brain and tumor with both ultrasound and X-ray contrast. The phantom also had mechanical properties that allowed the phantom tissue to be manipulated in a similar manner to how human brain tissue is handled during surgery. The phantom was successfully tested during a surgical simulation in a virtual operating room. The phantom fabrication method uses commercially available materials and is easy to reproduce. The 3D printing files can be readily shared, and the technique can be adapted to encompass many different types of tumor.",Remaining,0,0

However, the association between diabetes duration and the prognosis of stroke remains uncertain. We aimed to characterize whether an association exists between diabetes duration and stroke outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).	Between 2015 and 2018, 14,674 patients with ischemic stroke or TIA within 7 days and older than 18 years from the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III) were included in this analysis. Diabetes duration at baseline was collected by face-to-face interviews and further categorized into groups of without diabetes, diabetes < 4, 4 to <8 and ≥8 years. The association between diabetes duration and clinical outcomes, including stroke recurrence, poor function outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6), and all-cause mortality at the 1-year follow-up after stroke onset, was evaluated by a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model, competing risk model and logistic regression model with adjustment for demographic and clinical features.	Among the 14,674 patients included, the average age was 62.0 years, and 68.5% were male. There were 1419 (9.7%) patients who had stroke recurrence, 1912 (13.0%) who had poor function outcome, and 478 (3.3%) who had all-cause mortality at the 1-year follow-up. After adjusting for potential covariates, a diabetes duration ≥8 years was associated with an increased risk of 1-year stroke recurrence (adjusted hazards ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.64; p = .02) in comparison to those without Diabetes mellitus. Using a competing risk regression model, a diabetes duration ≥8 years was a significant risk factor for stroke recurrence (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53). In contrast, there was no significant association between diabetes duration < 4, 4 to <8 years and clinical outcomes.

Semi-structured interviews of between 40 and 60 min were conducted with three men and one woman, with spinal injuries at C7 or higher, within 6 months of discharge from inpatient spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. Data were subject to an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).	Participants described their injuries as more than a biological impairment that limited certain functional abilities. For them, SCI was a sudden event that also disrupted one's 'life biography'. Interviews uncovered three key themes essential to an individual's ability to restore feelings of self-agency and biographical continuity: The importance of information, regaining control, and restoring a sense of personal narrative.	Findings from studies using IPA have much to contribute to discussion and debate at the level of rehabilitation theory and can guide future research directions. The findings of the present study support a growing body of literature that argues that rehabilitation research needs to focus more intensely on the biographical disruption caused by SCI. Implications for Rehabilitation Participants in the present study experienced a significant disruption to their biographical narratives following a SCI as they entered an unknown and uncertain world. The findings from the present study provide an evidence-base that is best applied to discussion regarding psychosocial adjustment at the level rehabilitation theory.

664,3418380,Journal of neurosurgery,CSF leukotriene C4 following subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Leukotrienes derive from arachidonic acid metabolism via the lipoxygenase pathway and modulate several cellular events. In the central nervous system, leukotrienes are mainly synthesized in the gray matter and in vascular tissues. Their production is enhanced in ischemic conditions and in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Previous studies have indicated the ability of the leukotrienes C4 and D4 to constrict arterial vessels in vivo and in vitro and have suggested their involvement in the pathogenesis of cerebral arterial spasm. In the present study, the authors measured lumbar and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of leukotriene C4 in 48 patients who had suffered aneurysmal SAH. In 12 of the cases, symptomatic and radiological spasm was evident. The mean lumbar CSF level of immunoreactive-like activity of leukotriene C4 (i-LTC4) was significantly higher (p less than 0.005) than in control cases, while the cisternal CSF level was higher than the lumbar mean concentration (p less than 0.005). Patients presenting with vasospasm had significantly higher levels of i-LTC4 compared to patients without symptomatic vasospasm. This is the first report concerning monitoring of i-LTC4 levels in the CSF after SAH. The results of this study suggest that: 1) metabolism of arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway is enhanced after SAH; 2) the higher cisternal CSF levels of i-LTC4 may be part of the biological response in the perianeurysmal subarachnoid cisterns after the hemorrhage; and 3) the higher CSF levels of i-LTC4 in patients presenting with vasospasm suggest that a relationship exists between this compound and arterial spasm and/or reflect the development of cerebral ischemic damage.",Remaining,0,0
665,23398776,International journal of older people nursing,How much do residential aged care staff members know about the nutritional needs of residents?,"Undernutrition, weight loss and dehydration are major clinical issues for people with dementia in residential care, with excessive weight loss contributing to increased risk of frailty, immobility, illness and premature morbidity. This paper discusses a nutritional knowledge and attitudes survey conducted as part of a larger project focused on improving nutritional intake of people with dementia within a residential care facility in Brisbane, Australia.	The specific aims of the survey were to identify (i) knowledge of the nutritional needs of aged care facility residents; (ii) mealtime practices; and (iii) attitudes towards mealtime practices and organisation.	A survey based on those used in other healthcare settings was completed by 76 staff members. The survey included questions about nutritional knowledge, opinions of the food service, frequency of feeding assistance provided and feeding assessment practices.	Nutritional knowledge scores ranged from 1 to 9 of a possible 10, with a mean score of 4.67. While 76% of respondents correctly identified risk factors associated with malnutrition in nursing home residents, only 38% of participants correctly identified the need for increased protein and energy in residents with pressure ulcers, and just 15% exhibited correct knowledge of fluid requirements. Further, while nutritional assessment was considered an important part of practice by 83% of respondents, just 53% indicated that they actually carried out such assessments. Identified barriers to promoting optimal nutrition included insufficient time to observe residents (56%); being unaware of residents' feeding issues (46%); poor knowledge of nutritional assessments (44%); and unappetising appearance of food served (57%).	An important step towards improving health and quality of life for residents of aged care facilities would be to enhance staff nutritional awareness and assessment skills. This should be carried out through increased attention to both preservice curricula and on-the-job training.	The residential facility staff surveyed demonstrated low levels of nutrition knowledge, which reflects findings from the international literature. This has implications for the provision of responsive care to residents of these facilities and should be explored further.",Remaining,0,0
666,28728096,European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,Early life stress explains reduced positive memory biases in remitted depression.,"There is contradictory evidence regarding negative memory biases in major depressive disorder (MDD) and whether these persist into remission, which would suggest their role as vulnerability traits rather than correlates of mood state. Early life stress (ELS), common in patients with psychiatric disorders, has independently been associated with memory biases, and confounds MDD versus control group comparisons. Furthermore, in most studies negative biases could have resulted from executive impairments rather than memory difficulties per se.	To investigate whether memory biases are relevant to MDD vulnerability and how they are influenced by ELS, we developed an associative recognition memory task for temporo-spatial contexts of social actions with low executive demands, which were matched across conditions (self-blame, other-blame, self-praise, other-praise). We included fifty-three medication-free remitted MDD (25 with ELS, 28 without) and 24 healthy control (HC) participants without ELS.	Only MDD patients with ELS showed a reduced bias (accuracy/speed ratio) towards memory for positive vs. negative materials when compared with MDD without ELS and with HC participants; attenuated positive biases correlated with number of past major depressive episodes, but not current symptoms. There were no biases towards self-blaming or self-praising memories.	This demonstrates that reduced positive biases in associative memory were specific to MDD patients with ELS rather than a general feature of MDD, and were associated with lifetime recurrence risk which may reflect a scarring effect. If replicated, our results would call for stratifying MDD patients by history of ELS when assessing and treating emotional memories.",Remaining,0,0

American journal of neuroradiology,Mitochondrial disorders: analysis of their clinical and imaging characteristics.,"Investigation of the clinical, imaging, and in vivo MR spectroscopy (MRS) characteristics of disorders of mitochondrial function.	Clinical, imaging (five CT and 20 MR examinations), and MRS (six studies in five patients) findings in 19 patients with mitochondrial disorders were retrospectively reviewed. Results were critically analyzed and, when applicable, compared with results in the literature.	Patients included four with mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), two with myoclonus, epilepsy, and ragged red fibers (MERRF), two with Kearns-Sayre syndrome, seven with Leigh syndrome, one with progressive cerebral poliodystrophy (Alpers syndrome), and three with trichopoliodystrophy (Menkes disease). MELAS, MERRF, and Kearns-Sayre tended to occur in older children and adults, whereas Leigh syndrome, Alpers syndrome, and Menkes disease occurred in infants and young children. All diseases involved gray matter early in their course, manifest primarily as T2 prolongation, with the deep cerebral nuclei being involved more often than the cerebral cortex. When T2 prolongation was seen in the white matter (MELAS, MERRF, Kearns-Sayre, Leigh), the peripheral and retrotrigonal white matter showed early involvement. Patients with Menkes disease showed rapidly progressive atrophy accompanied by large subdural hematomas. Proton MRS showed an elevated lactate level in involved regions of the brain; the lactate peak disappeared in old areas of T2 prolongation.	Mitochondrial disorders have a wide range of both clinical and imaging findings. Although no one set of findings is diagnostic of these disorders, the combination of deep gray matter involvement and peripheral white matter involvement in young adults or children should suggest the diagnosis, especially when associated with an elevated lactate level on proton MRS.",Remaining,0,0

Between 1996 and 1998, with the assistance of the Twin Association and junior high schools in Taipei City, we solicited a list of twins from 51 junior high schools in Taipei. Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the twins enrolled in these schools were obtained. The vast majority of the recruited twins were between 12 and 16 years old. The recruited twins received assessments for behavioral problems, general and schizotypal personality, and cognitive functions. Their parents rated their children on behavioral/ emotional problems and were assessed on their own general and specific personality. Same-sex sibling pairs (ages vary within 2 years) and their parents from three schools were also recruited to increase sample size for the group with a kinship coefficient of .50. Twins' zygosity was determined by a combination of DNA typing and physical similarity. The Mx program was used to estimate parameters for the full model and its reduced models.

Impact on growth up to two years of age.,"A study was undertaken to investigate growth in children with different types of early feeding problems without any obvious medical explanation. Altogether 42 children were studied and followed up to the age of two years. Twenty-five children refused to eat (RTE), nine had colic, seven had vomiting and one child displayed hyperirritability at mealtimes. Comparisons were made with controls matched for sex, age and residential area. Attained weight and length were measured frequently; rates of gain were calculated and the growth variables were transformed to standard deviation scores (SD scores). After the onset of the symptoms the SD scores of attained weight and length decreased significantly in the children with RTE and in those with vomiting (p less than 0.05), and the rate of weight gain was significantly lower in the RTE group than in the control group (p less than 0.001). At two years of age the children with vomiting had recovered and showed a complete catch-up growth, while the RTE group had attained significantly lower SD scores of attained weight (p less than 0.001) and length (p less than 0.001) than the control group. It was found that the risk of growth impairment was greatest in children who refused all food or all food except breast milk.",Remaining,0,0

All had a history of auditory hallucinations, 71 with Schizophrenia and 9 with schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Demographic and clinical data were collected by a semi-structured interview, tape recording the sessions for every patient. For the reliability study, 27 patients of the sample were evaluated independently by the first four auhors of this paper. For the study of concurrent validity the results of this scale were compared with those of the Krawiecka scale in 60 patients of the sample.	In the Spanish version, the 11 items were conserved with slight modifications in two of them. The scale showed high reliability with coefficients in the 11 items higher than 0.85. The concurrent validity showed high association between the hallucination item of the Krawiecka scale and the PSYRATS.

Alcoholic men (n = 43) and women (n = 21) who responded to notices about a research study were screened, clinically assessed and administered Wechsler Memory and Intelligence tests after 3 months of sobriety, on average. Cognitive performance was compared with that of an age-matched sample of healthy controls (n = 51).	As a group, the alcoholics achieved significantly lower scores than controls on summary indices of the Wechsler Memory and Adult Intelligence Scales and showed greater decline from estimated premorbid intelligence levels than controls. Almost 60% of the alcoholics had at least one additional psychiatric (mood or anxiety) or past substance-dependence comorbidity. There were no marked sex differences in patterns of comorbidity. Comorbid alcoholics were younger, had consumed less alcohol over their lifetime and performed between noncomorbid alcoholics and controls on all tests.	Mood and anxiety comorbidity did not necessarily compound poor cognitive test performance associated with chronic alcohol misuse. While unexpected, this finding suggests that, in this sample, poorer cognitive performance was more a function of alcoholism per se than nonalcoholic comorbidity.",Remaining,0,0

With this in mind, the authors constructed a new scale, the Post-Stroke Depression Scale (PSDS) which takes into account a series of symptoms and problems commonly observed in depressed stroke patients. The PSDS and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDS) were administered to a group of 124 patients, who had been classified, on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria, in the following categories: No depression (n = 32); Minor PSD (n = 47); Major PSD (n = 45). Scores obtained by these stroke patients on the PSDS and on the HDS were compared to those obtained on the same scales by 17 psychiatric patients also classified as major depression on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria. An analysis of the symptomatological profiles clearly showed that: (1) a continuum exists between the so-called 'major' and 'minor' forms of PSD; (2) in both groups of depressed stroke patients the depressive symptomatology seems due to the psychological reaction to the devastating consequences of stroke, since the motivated aspects of depression prevailed in depressed stroke patients, whereas the (biologically determined) unmotivated aspects prevailed in patients with a functional form of major depression; and (3) in stroke patients a DSM III-based diagnosis of major PSD could be in part inflated by symptoms (such as apathy and vegetative disorders) that are typical of major depression in a patient free from brain damage, but that could be due to the brain lesion per se in a stroke patient.",Remaining,0,0

They tested whether distinct measures of psychopathology and behavioral problems (i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, depression, and violence) assessed in early adolescence could prospectively predict level and change in alcohol and marijuana use. Higher levels of all of the types of psychopathology predicted higher levels of alcohol use, and higher levels of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and violence predicted higher levels of marijuana use. Only conduct disorder predicted linear growth in alcohol use, and none of the measures predicted growth in marijuana use.

This study examined, in a convenience sample, the relationship between novelty-seeking behaviors, as determined by Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), and attendance variables during participation in a buprenorphine-based treatment program for 21 heroin-dependent cocaine users that took place in the late 1990s. Approximately two-thirds of the participants were male and primarily African-American. About half of them were employed and had at least a high school education. Approximately one-third of them were married or cohabitating and they all resided in the greater Detroit, Michigan area of the United States. The Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) was administered to the participants prior to entering the treatment program. Demographic variables, psychiatric distress, and substance use severity were also evaluated. Variables with significant bivariate relationships with poor attendance measures were entered into a regression analysis predicting attendance measures. Participants who scored high on the TPQ Novelty Seeking Scale attended significantly fewer regularly scheduled visits, had a greater overall number of missed visits, and shorter treatment retention times. Demographics, substance use severity, and psychiatric distress did not have significant relationships with these attendance measures.",Remaining,0,0

We examined within-trial spatial memory by using a relocation search paradigm introduced by Kristjansson (2000) (modified from Horowitz & Wolfe, 1998), in which the display items traded places every 110ms so that the target was never to be found in the same location from one moment to the next (the relocation condition), as compared with a static condition where the display items remained in place for the whole trial duration. To equate appearance between the two conditions, all items changed orientation every 110ms in both conditions, and were masked after each of the briefly presented visual arrays. The results showed that search was disrupted by item relocation for both patients and controls, but importantly this disruption was only seen in the right visual field for the patients, not the left, indicating that their spatial working memory in left visual space is already severely disrupted, and to a greater degree than for their right visual space, in contrast to what has been previously argued.",Remaining,0,0

All patients received a 1.5 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Sensitivity, specificity and the corrected predictive values of DST nonsuppression (50 or more ng/ml at 0800 hr, 1600 hr, or 2300 hr), adjusted to a 50% prevalence of endogenous and nonendogenous depression, varied considerably depending on the diagnostic definition used. The highest predictive value (89.9%) was found with the Taylor-Abrams criteria (sensitivity = 43.9%, specificity = 95.0%), and the lowest predictive value (53.3%) with DSM-III (sensitivity = 37.7%, specificity = 68.1%). Eliminating the patients with dexamethasone levels of less than 2000 pg/ml improved the diagnostic specificity of the DST for most of the eight definitions of endogenous depression. This further indicates that plasma dexamethasone levels should be analyzed in studies designed to explore the diagnostic utility of the DST. A significant, chance-corrected association between DST nonsuppression and the diagnosis of endogenous depression was found with clinical diagnosis (according to the International Classification of Diseases), and for four out of eight operational diagnoses (Newcastle Scale I, Newcastle Scale II, Taylor-Abrams Criteria, and Vienna Research Criteria). For the other diagnoses (Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, Michigan Discriminant Index, and Hamilton Endogenomorphy Index), no significant association was found. The RDC criterion 'early or intermittent awakening' was the only one out of 28 diagnostic criteria tested which was significantly associated with DST nonsuppression.",Remaining,0,0

Data were from approximately 1200 adults from 465 families assessed as part of a large family and genetic study of OCD. The association of three parenting factors, for fathers and mothers, with offspring OCD status were examined; analyses were stratified by parental OCD status and family loading for OCD (multiplex versus sporadic).	Three factors were derived by principal components factor analysis of the PBI (maternal and paternal care, overprotection and control). Maternal overprotection was associated with OCD in offspring with familial OCD (familial cases) but only if neither parent was affected with OCD, which suggests independent but additive environmental and genetic risk (OR = 5.9, 95% CI 1.2, 29.9, p = 0.031). Paternal care was a protective factor in those not at high genetic risk (sporadic cases) (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 0.8, p = 0.027). Maternal overprotection was also associated with offspring OCD in sporadic families (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3, 6.6, p = 0.012). The finding that parental overprotection and care were not associated with offspring OCD when at least one parent had OCD addressed directly the hypothesis of maternal or paternal OCD adversely impacting parenting.	This study provides evidence that aspects of parenting may contribute to the development of OCD among offspring. Prospective studies of children at risk for OCD are needed to explore the direction of causality.",Remaining,0,0
683,30468246,Headache,Clinical Features Contributing to Cortical Thickness Changes in Chronic Migraine - A Pilot Study.,"The objectives of this cross-sectional pilot study were threefold: to identify regions of cortical thickness that differentiate chronic migraine (CM) from controls, to assess group differences in interregional cortical thickness covariance, and to determine group differences in associations between clinical variables and cortical thickness.	Cortical thickness alterations in relation to clinical features have not been adequately explored in CM. Assessment of this relationship can be useful to describe cortical substrates for disease progression in migraine and to identify clinical variables that warrant management emphasis.	Thirty CM cases (mean age 40 years; male-to-female 1:4) and 30 sex-matched healthy controls (mean age 40 years) were enrolled. Participants completed self-administered and standardized questionnaires assessing headache-related clinical features and common psychological comorbidities. T1-weighted brain images were acquired on a 3T MRI. A whole-brain cortical thickness analysis was performed. Additionally, correlations between all brain regions were assessed to examine interregional cortical thickness covariance. Interactions were analyzed to identify clinical variables that were significantly associated with cortical thickness.	The whole brain cortical thickness analysis revealed no significant differences between CM patients and controls. However, significant associations between clinical features and cortical thickness were observed for the patients only. These associations included the right superior temporal sulcus (R[2]  = 0.72, P = .001) and the right insula (R[2]  = 0.71, P = .002) with distinct clinical variables ie, longer history of CM, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep quality, pain self-efficacy, and somatic symptoms. Higher interregional cortical covariance was found in CM compared to controls (OR = 3.1, CI 2.10-4.56, P < .0001), such that cortical thickness between regions tended to be more correlated in patients, particularly in the temporal and frontal lobes.	CM patients have significantly greater cortical covariance compared to controls. Cortical thickness in CM patients was predominantly accounted for by CM duration, PTSD, and poor sleep quality, while improved pain self-efficacy buffered cortical thickness. While it is important to address all CM features and comorbidities, it may be useful to emphasize optimizing the management of certain clinical features that contribute to cortical abnormalities including managing PTSD, early management to shorten duration of CM, and improving pain self-efficacy and sleep quality.",Remaining,0,0

Adult,Executive Function Index (EFI) performance in nonclinical individuals with high levels of autistic traits.,"This study examined the ability of the Executive Function Index (EFI) to detect differences in executive functioning amongst participants with varying levels of subclinical autistic symptoms as quantified by the Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ). Participants were a nonclinical college subject sample classified as displaying either Low (0-15 ASQ score, n = 182) ASQ traits or High (16 or higher ASQ score, n = 91) ASQ traits. Participants were given the ASQ (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) and the EFI (Spinella, 2005). High ASQ subjects were significantly impaired (p's < .04) on the Motivation/Drive (EFI-1) and Organization (EFI-4) subscales of the EFI, as compared to the Low ASQ subjects. However, no High/Low ASQ group differences were observed for EFI-2 (Impulse Control), EFI-3 (Empathy), EFI-5 (Planning) subscales or the EFI-Total Score (p's > .12), although these differences were in the predicted direction (High ASQ < Low ASQ). Use of the EFI as a measure of executive function performance in nonclinical ASQ trait individuals requires further study and may not be sensitive enough of an instrument to assess EF in nonclinical populations with autistic traits.",Remaining,0,0

The mutations of the CYP2D6 gene associated with the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype of the debrisoquine/sparteine polymorphism were analyzed in DNA of 130 IPD patients by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA amplification combined with Xba I restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in 105 patients. Another mutation located in exon 6 was analyzed by Hha I RFLP in 94 IPD patients. The frequencies of the different CYP2D6 gene mutations were compared to the frequencies in sex- and age-matched white control population with chronic bronchitis. The rate of genotypically defined PM and the frequencies of the different mutations were not significantly different in IPD patients and controls. These results fail to confirm the previously reported results concerning CYP2D6 gene mutations in IPD. These equivocal results might be related to methodologic problems. However, other hypotheses have been suggested: impairment of neuronal CYP 2D6 expression, transient modification of CYP 2D6 phenotype, or linkage of CYP2D6 gene to the candidate gene locus directly involved in IPD.",Remaining,0,0

687,32072183,Schizophrenia bulletin,Reduced Auditory Mismatch Negativity Reflects Impaired Deviance Detection in Schizophrenia.,"The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) is a translatable electroencephalographic biomarker automatically evoked in response to unattended sounds that is robustly associated with cognitive and psychosocial disability in patients with schizophrenia. Although recent animal studies have tried to clarify the neural substrates of the MMN, the nature of schizophrenia-related deficits is unknown. In this study, we applied a novel paradigm developed from translational animal model studies to carefully deconstruct the constituent neurophysiological processes underlying MMN generation. Patients with schizophrenia (N = 25) and healthy comparison subjects (HCS; N = 27) underwent MMN testing using both a conventional auditory oddball paradigm and a 'many-standards paradigm' that was specifically developed to deconstruct the subcomponent adaptation and deviance detection processes that are presumed to underlie the MMN. Using a conventional oddball paradigm, patients with schizophrenia exhibited large effect size deficits of both duration and frequency MMN, consistent with many previous studies. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia showed selective impairments in deviance detection but no impairment in adaptation to repeated tones. These findings support the use of the many-standards paradigm for deconstructing the constituent processes underlying the MMN, with implications for the use of these translational measures to accelerate the development of new treatments that target perceptual and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia and related disorders.",Remaining,0,0

We estimated the population-weighted exposure level (PWEL) of PM10 concentrations in Malaysia for 2000, 2008, and 2013 using aerosol optical density (AOD) data from publicly available remote sensing satellite data (MODIS Terra). The PWEL was then converted to PM2.5 using Malaysia's WHO ambient air conversion factor. We used AirQ+ 2.0 software to calculate all-cause (natural), ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer (LC), and acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) excess deaths from the National Burden of Disease data for 2000, 2008 and 2013. The average PWELs for annual PM2.5 for 2000, 2008, and 2013 were 22 μg m-3, 18 μg m-3 and 24 μg m-3, respectively. Using the WHO 2005 Air Quality Guideline cut-off point of PM2.5 of 10 μg m-3, the estimated excess deaths for 2000, 2008, and 2013 from all-cause (natural) mortality were between 5893 and 9781 (95 % CI: 3347-12,791), COPD was between 164 and 957 (95 % CI: 95-1411), lung cancer was between 109 and 307 (95 % CI: 63-437), IHD was between 3 and 163 deaths, according to age groups (95 % CI: 2-394) and stroke was between 6 and 155 deaths, according to age groups (95 % CI: 3-261). An increase in estimated health endpoints was associated with increased estimated PWEL PM2.5 for 2013 compared to 2000 and 2008. Adhering the ambient PM2.5 level to the Malaysian Air Quality Standard IT-2 would reduce the national health endpoints mortality.",Remaining,0,0
690,17979960,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",Which children receive grandparental care and what effect does it have?,"Grandparents are increasingly involved in the care of young children, but little is known about factors associated with this type of care, or its implications for children's behavioural development.	We used information collected from 8752 families in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) on grandparent involvement when the study children were aged 8, 15 and 24 months; potential maternal and family predictors of grandparent care; and behavioural outcomes at age 4 years.	Forty-four percent of children were regularly cared for by grandparents at each age. Throughout the sample, key correlates of grandparent care were maternal age and education. In families without access to paid help with childcare, the child's ordinal position, maternal employment, the mother's recall of parenting by her own mother and the reasons for choosing the type of childcare were also associated with variations in grandparent care. Grandparent care was associated with some elevated rates of hyperactivity and peer difficulties at age 4, but these were largely attributable to variations in the types of families using grandparent care.	The popular belief that the extended family is no longer an important part of British life is not borne out by this study. Grandparents played a significant role in the care of their young grandchildren. The modest behavioural sequelae of extensive grandparental care differ from those reported for group-based day care.",Remaining,0,0
691,16850255,Metabolic brain disease,Neurocircuitry of disgust and anxiety in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a positron emission tomography study.,"Disgust and fear are basic emotions that have different elicitors and expressions, and that appear to be mediated by different neurocircuits. Although obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is classified as an anxiety disorder, disgust may be involved in its pathogenesis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of disgust-inducing visual stimuli in OCD have suggested disorder specific alterations in brain activation during these tasks.	Subjects with OCD and healthy controls (HC) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) brain scanning after injection of H(2) (15)O. During PET, subjects either watched slides designed to evoke feelings of disgust (OCD = 5, HC = 11), expected the delivery of an electrical shock (OCD = 11, HC = 13), or rested (OCD = 11, HC = 14). After the anticipatory anxiety and resting tasks, anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal measures were obtained. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to analyze regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data.	Comparison of OCD subjects with controls on differences in rCBF across the disgust-inducing and resting tasks showed that OCD was characterized by greater rCBF in the left insula. In OCD the disgust-inducing task increased right lateral orbitofrontal cortex rCBF compared to resting, whereas in controls there was no difference in rCBF between these tasks. Anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal activity increased during anticipatory anxiety in both groups, and comparison of rCBF in OCD subjects with controls in anticipatory anxiety versus resting state also found no significant differences.	OCD may be characterized by a disruption in disgust processing, such that there is a decrease in appropriate disgust (such as that evoked by observing disgust in others) and an increase in inappropriate disgust (such as that evoked by contamination stimuli). The insula may play a particularly important role in mediating such putative disruptions. The sample studied here was small, and further work is required to determine whether disgust-induced activation patterns in OCD are more apparent in specific subtypes of this disorder, whether they are specific to OCD, and whether they are normalized by treatment.",Remaining,0,0

We assessed the validity of a screening questionnaire developed by Duarte et al. [1995: Mov Disord 10:643-649] with reported high specificity and sensitivity for Parkinson's disease (PD). We applied the questionnaire to 78 asymptomatic members of families that had at least two people diagnosed with PD. These families were participating in a linkage study of Parkinson's disease. Examination of these 78 revealed that 53 were normal (normal controls) and 25 were classified ('undiagnosed' PD defined) as possible, probable, or clinically definite PD based on standardized criteria. We compared these results with 123 patients with clinically definite PD ('diagnosed' PD). There were significant differences among the mean scores on the questionnaire for normal controls (4.4), subjects with undiagnosed PD (9.8), and patients with diagnosed PD (42.1; p<0.000001) and a significant difference between undiagnosed PD and normals (p<0.01). The questionnaire had only 4% sensitivity for detection of parkinsonism in undiagnosed PD using the original criteria [Duarte et al., 1995]. Revising the criteria increased the sensitivity from 4 to 48% in the undiagnosed group. The positive predictive value was 39% and the negative predictive value was 72%. Prospective application of these revised criteria is necessary to confirm the improved sensitivity. However, we conclude that this screening questionnaire has inadequate sensitivity for detection of mild parkinsonism and direct examination is still critical for accurate classification for genetic studies.",Remaining,0,0

The combination of stressors and family adjustment difficulties can cause distress which may develop into a crisis. Understanding crisis in the family is important to mental health practice since it can serve as a guide in delivering service to at-risk families. This study investigated the subjective experience of crisis in 155 mothers of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Thematic analysis revealed that crisis is characterized by factors influencing four major areas: demands, internal capabilities, external resources, and subjective appraisal. Understanding what crisis means to families of individuals with autism spectrum disorder can help inform effective preventative and crisis services.",Remaining,0,0

Few studies have examined psychiatric morbidity before MS onset.	In this nationwide study, detailed case ascertainment was performed in all children with pediatric MS, including chart review. For each MS patient, we selected five controls using density sampling from the entire Danish population, matching controls to children with MS by sex and birthdate. We analyzed data as a nested case-control study with psychiatric morbidity as exposure and MS as outcome, and a matched cohort study with MS as exposure and psychiatric co-morbidity as outcome. Hazard ratios (HR) including 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox regression.	We identified 212 children with MS and 1060 controls. No association between psychiatric morbidity and the rate of MS was found before MS onset. After MS onset, children with MS had two times higher hazard for psychiatric co-morbidity compared with children without MS (HR=2.0; 95% CI=1.3-3.1; p<0.001).	Psychiatric morbidity seems to commence after MS onset, making screening for neuropsychiatric conditions pertinent in newly-diagnosed children with MS.",Remaining,0,0

A baseline sample of 1195 13-year-old pupils was from 22 randomly selected schools in the Hordaland County in western Norway. Latent class growth analysis revealed three developmental trajectories. The first trajectory was a conventional trajectory, comprising 36.3% of participants, who showed changes in smoking, physical exercise, fruit intake, and drunkenness consistent with the prevailing age specific norms of these behaviors in the Norwegian society at the time. The second trajectory was a passive trajectory, comprising 25.5% of participants, who reported low levels of both healthy and unhealthy behaviors during the 17-year period. The third trajectory was an unhealthy trajectory, comprising 38.2% of participants, who had high levels of unhealthy behaviors over time. Several covariates were examined, but only sex and mother's and father's educational levels were found to be significantly associated with the identified trajectories. While these findings need to be replicated in future studies, the identification of the different trajectories suggests the need to tailor intervention according to specific needs.",Remaining,0,0

We have investigated the effect of the Eating Disorder Awareness Week and Wake Up Weight Watchers campaigns on Twitter.	We aimed to examine whether the Eating Disorder Awareness Week and Wake Up Weight Watchers initiatives increased the volume and dissemination of Twitter conversations related to eating disorders and investigate what content generates the most interest on Twitter.	Over a period of 12 consecutive days in 2018, we collected tweets containing the hashtag #wakeupweightwatchers and hashtags related to Eating Disorder Awareness Week (#eatingdisorderawarenessweek, #eatingdisorderawareness, or #EDAW), with the hashtag #eatingdisorder as a control. The content of each tweet was rated as medical, testimony, help offer, awareness, pro-ana, or anti-ana. We analyzed the number of retweets and favorites generated, as well as the potential reach and impact of the hashtags and the characteristics of contributors.	The number of #wakeupweightwatchers tweets was higher than that of Eating Disorder Awareness Week and #eatingdisorder tweets (3900, 2056, and 1057, respectively). The content of tweets was significantly different between the hashtags analyzed (P<.001). Medical content was lower in the awareness campaigns. Awareness and help offer content were lower in #wakeupweightwatchers tweets. Retweet and favorite ratios were highest in #wakeupweightwatchers tweets. Eating Disorder Awareness Week achieved the highest impact, and very influential contributors participated.	Both awareness campaigns effectively promoted tweeting about eating disorders.

701,21185742,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,Variations of blood pressure in stroke unit patients may result from alternating body positions.,"Blood pressure (BP) is one of the major vital parameters monitored in the stroke unit. The accuracy of indirect BP measurement is strongly influenced by the position of both patient and arm during the measurement. Acute stroke patients are often nursed in lateral decubitus positions. The effect of these alternating body positions in relation to affected body side on the outcome and reliability of BP readings in acute stroke patients is unknown.	An automatic oscillometric BP device was used. BP was measured in both arms in the (back) supine and both lateral decubitus positions.	In total, 54 consecutive acute stroke patients were included. Thirty-five patients had right-sided deficits and 19 patients had left-sided deficits. Supine BP readings were similar in the right and left arms regardless of side of deficit. Measurements of BP in the lateral decubitus positions resulted in significantly lower BP readings in the uppermost arm (around 12 mm Hg in both arms) and significantly higher readings in the right lowermost arm (around 6 mm Hg) compared to the supine position. This effect seemed less pronounced when the left lowermost arm was measured. There was no relation between change of BP readings in various lateral positions and side of stroke.	Alternating lateral decubitus positions according to nursing standards in acute stroke patients lead to a mean 18 mm Hg BP fluctuation. This may largely be explained by hydrostatic pressure effects, partly by anatomic factors in the left lowermost arm, but not by the side of stroke.",Remaining,0,0

Next, they provided their opinions about the information. Two coders analyzed the data using grounded theory.	Pre-video knowledge about why people smoke cigarettes and what genetic risk means informed beliefs about the relationship between genes and addiction. These beliefs were not always consistent with biomedical explanations, but formed the context through which participants processed the video's information. This, in turn, led to information acceptance or skepticism. Participants explained their reactions in terms of the scientific merits of the research and used their existing knowledge and beliefs to explain their acceptance of or skepticism about the information.

703,37660045,Translational psychiatry,Brain mediators of biased social learning of self-perception in social anxiety disorder.,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by an excessive fear of social evaluation and a persistently negative view of the self. Here we test the hypothesis that negative biases in brain responses and in social learning of self-related information contribute to the negative self-image and low self-esteem characteristic of SAD. Adult participants diagnosed with social anxiety (N = 21) and matched controls (N = 23) rated their performance and received social feedback following a stressful public speaking task. We investigated how positive versus negative social feedback altered self-evaluation and state self-esteem and used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to characterize brain responses to positive versus negative feedback. Compared to controls, participants with SAD updated their self-evaluation and state self-esteem significantly more based on negative compared to positive social feedback. Responses in the frontoparietal network correlated with and mirrored these behavioral effects, with greater responses to positive than negative feedback in non-anxious controls but not in participants with SAD. Responses to social feedback in the anterior insula and other areas mediated the effects of negative versus positive feedback on changes in self-evaluation. In non-anxious participants, frontoparietal brain areas may contribute to a positive social learning bias. In SAD, frontoparietal areas are less recruited overall and less attuned to positive feedback, possibly reflecting differences in attention allocation and cognitive regulation. More negatively biased brain responses and social learning could contribute to maintaining a negative self-image in SAD and other internalizing disorders, thereby offering important new targets for interventions.",Remaining,0,0

The case material embodied those psychiatric problems known to be common in medical populations, namely depression, delirium, dementia, and 'psychogenic' pain. The standardized simulations were punctuated by standardized 'open' questions with followup probes. A panel of experienced clinicians developed rating criteria for each question such that responses could be categorized ad 'good,' 'adequate,' 'inadequate,' or 'poor,' in terms of 'what an internist needs to know.' Blind raters of the exam achieved an interrater reliability of 0.08. The results indicate major deficits in the knowledge needed for assessment and treatment of these common problems. Only 16% of answers were 'good,' where as 42% were 'inadequate' or 'poor'. For example, 88% of the doctors could not name three factors that help distinguish organic from 'functional' psychosis, and 88% could not list three side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants. The doctors' level of experience was not correlated with test scores, either overall or question by question.

Yet this information is essential for the management of sleep bruxism and to plan appropriate dental treatment. The objective of this study was to clinically test a device that could be used to record bruxism events in a home environment. Pressure sensors were developed for use under the surface of an occlusal splint, and circuitry was designed to facilitate the recording and wireless transmission of the pressure sensor signal to a computer. Controlled mandibular movements were carried out in vivo to simulate bruxism and non-bruxism patterns. These patterns of force application were graphically presented to two examiners who were asked to identify the type of activity represented by the force curves. Examiners were largely able to distinguish bruxism from non-bruxism activity; the sensitivity ranged from 80% to 100% and the specificity from 75% to 100%. Using sensors in an occlusal splint, it is possible to recognise the typical tooth contact patterns seen in sleep bruxism. Such a device may be useful for monitoring sleep bruxism over an extended period at home.",Remaining,0,0

A validation study.,"Sixty-two hemiplegic subjects were treated with the Bobath approach for a period of three months. During this time they were evaluated on three occasions. The testing battery consisted of a Bobath evaluation, the Brunnstrom scale, the Fugl-Meyer test, the Upper Extremity Functional Test (UEFT) and the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) of the McGill pain questionnaire. A Friedman analysis of variance showed that, except for pain, all the protocols used disclosed significant progress (p less than 0.001) over time in terms of motor recovery. Except for pain, the results of the Bobath evaluation were significantly correlated (Spearman's Rho, p less than 0.001) with the results of the other testing procedures. It is concluded that the new Bobath evaluation proposed in a previous paper is as sensitive in depicting progress in motor recovery over time as are the other testing procedures used. Furthermore, this new evaluation seems to be measuring similar properties to the other tests. However, pain (PPI) appears not to be an important dependent variable.",Remaining,0,0

Malaria pigment, recognizable within the cytoplasm of phagocytic cells by light microscopy may represent a peripheral marker for parasite biomass.

The presence of polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) and monocyte pigment was strongly associated with severe disease compared with uncomplicated malaria. Total PMN pigment burden in children with severe malaria was higher in those with cerebral manifestations and with combined cerebral manifestations and severe anemia (hemoglobin < or = 5 g/dL) but was not associated with hyperparasitemia (> 500,000 asexual forms/mm3).

708,2441955,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,Effects of sleep loss on delta (0.3-3 Hz) EEG and eye movement density: new observations and hypotheses.,"One night's sleep loss in young adults increased delta (0.3-3 Hz) EEG only in the first non-REM period of recovery sleep. The delta increase was limited to frequencies 0.3-4 Hz; within this range, the effects on wave form periods and amplitudes differed by frequency band. These results illustrate the value of computer analysis applied to the physiological units of sleep (the successive non-REM and REM periods of each sleep cycle). The finding that all of the delta increase occurred in the first sleep cycle appears inconsistent with the exponential decline of delta across cycles predicted by 'recovery' models of sleep. The fact that wave periods and amplitudes are differentially affected by sleep loss indicates that it is premature to adopt any single wave form characteristic (e.g., power spectral density) to index delta sleep. Our data also confirm a recent report that eye movement density decreases after sleep loss; we hypothesize that this change results from greater depth of sleep; an inverse relation of depth of sleep to eye movement density provides a coherent explanation for a range of otherwise disparate observations. Lastly, we propose a new hypothesis to account for the presence of eye movement during REM sleep.",Remaining,0,0

711,32149692,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,Quantitative Assessment of Upper-Limb Motor Function for Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Based on Motor Synergy Analysis and Multi-Modality Fusion.,"Functional assessment is an essential part of rehabilitation protocols after stroke. Conventionally, the assessment process relies heavily on clinical experience and lacks quantitative analysis. In order to objectively quantify the upper-limb motor impairments in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis, this study proposes a novel assessment approach based on motor synergy quantification and multi-modality fusion. Fifteen post-stroke hemiparetic patients and fifteen age-matched healthy persons participated in this study. During different goal-directed tasks, kinematic data and surface electromyography(sEMG) signals were synchronously collected from these participants, and then motor features extracted from each modal data could be fed into the respective local classifiers. In addition, kinematic synergies and muscle synergies were quantified by principal component analysis (PCA) and k weighted angular similarity (k WAS) algorithm to provide in-depth analysis of the coactivated features responsible for observable movement impairments. By integrating the outputs of local classifiers and the quantification results of motor synergies, ensemble classifiers can be created to generate quantitative assessment for different modalities separately. In order to further exploit the complementarity between the evaluation results at kinematic and muscular levels, a multi-modal fusion scheme was developed to comprehensively analyze the upper-limb motor function and generate a probability-based function score. Under the proposed assessment framework, three types of machine learning methods were employed to search the optimal performance of each classifier. Experimental results demonstrated that the classification accuracy was respectively improved by 4.86% and 2.78% when the analysis of kinematic and muscle synergies was embedded in the assessment system, and could be further enhanced to 96.06% by fusing the characteristics derived from different modalities. Furthermore, the assessment result of multi-modality fusion framework exhibited a significant correlation with the score of standard clinical tests (R = - 0.87, P = 1.98e - 5). These promising results show the feasibility of applying the proposed method to clinical assessments for post-stroke hemiparetic patients.",Remaining,0,0

Design Cross-sectional studies of carotid artery atherosclerosis in 24,822 Chinese adults from the China Kadoorie Biobank and 2579 Europeans from the UK Biobank. Methods Mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries and presence of carotid artery plaque were examined in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) findings in Chinese (mean age 59 years) were compared with a European population (mean age 62 years). Results Overall, the mean cIMT in Chinese was 0.70 mm (SD 0.16) and increased with age by 0.08 mm (SE 0.008) per 10-years older age. About 31% of the Chinese had carotid plaques and the prevalence varied 10-fold with age (6% at 40-49 to 63% at 70-89 years) and four-fold by region (range, 14%-57%). After adjustment for age, sex and region, plaque prevalence was higher in smokers than in non-smokers (36% vs. 28%) and two-fold higher in individuals with systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg than those with systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg (44% vs. 22%) in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Mean cIMT was similar in the younger Chinese and European adults, but increased more steeply with age in the Chinese (p = 0.002). Conclusions About one-third of Chinese adults had carotid plaques.

In addition, we have conducted allelic association studies using 60 patients with schizophrenia and 60 controls with polymorphisms at D9S55 and D9S15 markers. No evidence for linkage or association was found. The results indicate that susceptibility genes for schizophrenia are less likely to be located at the pericentric region of chromosome 9, assuming genetic homogeneity of the pedigrees.",Remaining,0,0
715,22954836,Studies in health technology and informatics,Assessment of executive functions in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder by NeuroVR.,"Executive functions are often impaired in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We used a Virtual Reality version of the Multiple Errand Test (VMET) - developed dusing the free NeuroVR software (http://www.neurovr.org) - to evaluate the executive functions in daily life in 10 OCD patients and 10 controls. It is performed in a shopping setting where there are items to be bought and information to be obtained. The execution time for the whole task was higher in patients with OCD compared to controls, suggesting that patients with OCD need more time in planning than controls. The same difference was found in the partial errors during the task. Furthermore, the mean rank for and for interpretation failures is higher for controls, while the values of divided attention and the of self correction seems to be lower in controls. We think that obsessive patients tend to work with greater diligence and observance of rules than controls. In conclusion, these results provide initial support for the feasibility of VMET as assessment tool of executive functions. Specifically, the significant correlation found between the VMET and the neuropsychological battery support the ecological validity of VMET as an instrument for the evaluation of executive functions in patients with OCD.",Remaining,0,0

To investigate the extent, context, experience and preferences for participation in out-of-school activities among children with disability in Victoria, Australia.	Two-hundred and eighty-six children (177 boys, 109 girls; mean age 11.5 years) with physical (n=77), intellectual (n=67), multiple (n=93), and other disabilities (n=49) took part. Data were collected using the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) and Preferences for Activities of Children (PAC) questionnaires.	Children with disability participated in 28 out of 55 activities (SD 6 activities), 2-3 times per month, on average. Preference was the most important predictor of participation diversity for all activity types. Disability type was a predictor of participation diversity in active-physical activities only. Severity was a predictor of participation diversity overall, and of participation in formal and informal activities. Age, severity and preference accounted for almost 50% of the variance of diversity of recreational activities.	These results underscore the importance of taking a child's activity preferences into account when implementing interventions to increase participation in out-of-school activities.",Remaining,0,0

It has been proposed that patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have larger motor units (MUs) than normals by MU number estimation and macro electromyography techniques. In this study, an experimental setup for scanning electromyography was built to investigate electrophysiologic cross-sections of the MU territories in 9 patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, 3 patients with spinal muscular atrophy, and 10 healthy volunteers. Scanning electromyography was performed on the biceps brachii muscle. For each MU, three-dimensional maps of the MU territories were plotted. The length of MU cross-section and the maximum amplitude of each MU were measured from these maps and compared among the three groups of subjects. Like spinal muscular atrophy patients, patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy had significantly larger MU territories than normal controls.",Remaining,0,0

In order to investigate olfactory perception in different depressive states, we carried out olfactory testing during a depressive episode (n=37) and in a remitted state (n=17). As expected, patients were significantly less depressed (p<0.001) and less anhedonic (p=0.001) in the remitted state. A comparison of olfactory perception between age- and gender-matched patients and healthy volunteers (n=37) controlled for intrinsic olfactory deficits in major depression. In the depressive episode, we applied regression analyses to investigate the relation of olfactory hedonics, severity of depression and anhedonia. The Sniffin' Sticks Test extended by analogue rating scales for intensity and hedonic estimates was employed for olfactory testing. Depression severity was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), anhedonia with the Snaith-Hamilton-Pleasure-Scale (SHAPS). Odour identification ability was significantly reduced during the depressive state. In contrast, no significant differences in hedonic and intensity estimates could be found between the depressive and the remitted state and healthy controls. During the depressive episode, we found a significant relation only between anhedonia and olfactory hedonics. We concluded that anhedonia has potential impact on olfactory hedonics in major depression. Our results indicate the need for (1) confirmatory studies in severe melancholic depression and (2) investigation of the impact of anhedonia on olfactory hedonics in psychiatric diseases other than major depression.",Remaining,0,0

723,28627925,Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology,Will delay discounting predict intention to quit smoking?,"Intention to quit cigarette smoking is significantly associated with making quitting attempts and actual quitting. Delay discounting is significantly associated with smoking initiation and success in quitting. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the relationship between delay discounting and intention to quit smoking. In 2 separate observational, cross-sectional studies, the current investigation examines the relationship between delay discounting and intention to quit smoking within groups of smokers. Experiment 1 used data collected online and an adjusting-delay discounting task; Experiment 2 used data collected in the laboratory and an adjusting-amount discounting task. A total of 242 participants and 142 participants completed the online and on laboratory experiments, respectively. In both studies, participants with higher intention to quit smoking had significantly lower rates of discounting. These associations between intention to quit smoking and rates of delay discounting further support recent characterizations of delay discounting as a candidate behavioral marker of addiction. Understanding cognitive factors affecting treatment initiation such as intention to change, and the effects of delay discounting on these factors, in addition to the mechanisms by which they influence treatment outcomes might be essential to developing, disseminating, and implementing treatment interventions.

Data on perceived parental burden and specific effects on daily life is scarce. We performed a structured interview, consecutively talking to all parents of pediatric outpatients of our university hospital diagnosed with seizure or developmental disorder. Three hundred seven parents (of 317 affected children: 53 with seizure disorder, 44 with specific developmental disorder, 35 with learning disorder, 71 with intellectual disability, 15 with seizure + specific developmental disorder, 23 with seizure + learning disorder, 76 with seizure disorder + intellectual disability) were interviewed. Parents of children with both seizure disorder and intellectual disability stated the highest constraints in daily life, regarding friends, hobbies, emotional pressure, occupation, partnership, habitation, and financial burden. Due to diagnosis of seizure or developmental disorder, 155/307 (51%) parents reduced their working hours/stopped working, 62/307 (20%) changed their habitation, and 46/307 (15%) broke up. As judged by parents, 148/317 (47%) children are being discriminated against, even own family/friends and educators are held responsible.	Parents perceive changes in their daily life and discrimination of their children due to their children's seizure and developmental disorders. An intellectual disability combined with seizure disorder caused the highest constraint. What is Known: • Seizure and/or developmental disorders of children may adversely influence quality of life for affected parents. • Caring for a child with special health care needs can take complete attention and own parental needs may therefore be difficult to meet. What is New: • Two out of three parents stated changes of their daily life such as quitting work, change of habitation, or breakup of partnership due to their child's diagnosis. • As judged by the parents, one in two children with developmental disorder of any kind is being discriminated against, even teachers and own family are held responsible.",Remaining,0,0

In this study, we investigated whether DJ-1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and function in neuronal cells. Confocal and electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that M17 human neuroblastoma cells over-expressing wild-type DJ-1 (WT DJ-1 cells) displayed elongated mitochondria while M17 cells over-expressing PD-associated DJ-1 mutants (R98Q, D149A and L166P) (mutant DJ-1 cells) showed significant increase of fragmented mitochondria. Similar mitochondrial fragmentation was also noted in primary hippocampal neurons over-expressing PD-associated mutant forms of DJ-1. Functional analysis revealed that over-expression of PD-associated DJ-1 mutants resulted in mitochondria dysfunction and increased neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress (H(2) O(2)) or neurotoxin. Further immunoblot studies demonstrated that levels of dynamin-like protein (DLP1), also known as Drp1, a regulator of mitochondrial fission, was significantly decreased in WT DJ-1 cells but increased in mutant DJ-1 cells. Importantly, DLP1 knockdown in these mutant DJ-1 cells rescued the abnormal mitochondria morphology and all associated mitochondria/neuronal dysfunction. Taken together, these studies suggest that DJ-1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics through modulation of DLP1 expression and PD-associated DJ-1 mutations may cause PD by impairing mitochondrial dynamics and function.",Remaining,0,0

Other measures included the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, the LABS-2 Psychiatric and Emotional Test Survey, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12, the Short Form-36 Health Survey, and Impact of Weight Quality of Life-Lite Survey.	The majority (92.1%) of participants reported eating dinner regularly, whereas just over half (54.0%) reported eating breakfast regularly. Half of the participants reported eating at least four meals/week at restaurants; two meals/week were fast food. Loss of control eating was reported by 43.4%, night eating syndrome by 17.7%; 15.7% satisfied criteria for binge eating disorder (BED), 2% for bulimia nervosa. Factors that independently increased the odds of BED were being a college graduate, eating more times per day, taking medication for psychiatric or emotional problems, and having symptoms of alcohol use disorder, lower self-esteem and greater depressive symptoms.	Before undergoing bariatric surgery a substantial proportion of patients report problematic eating behaviors. Several factors associated with BED were identified, most suggesting other mental health problems, including higher levels of depressive symptomotology. The strengths of this study include the large sample size, the multi-center design and use of standardized assessment practices.",Remaining,0,0
727,11781147,Biochimica et biophysica acta,Characterization of a missense mutation at histidine-44 in a pyruvate dehydrogenase-deficient patient.,"Genetic defects in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) cause lactic acidosis, neurological deficits, and often early death. Most mutations of PDC are localized in the alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. We have kinetically characterized a patient's missense mutation alphaH44R in E1alpha by creating and purifying three recombinant human E1s (alphaH44R, alphaH44Q, and alphaH44A). Substitutions at histidine-15 resulted in decreased V(max) values (6% alphaH44R; 30% alphaH44Q; 90% alphaH44A) while increasing K(m) values for thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) compared to wild-type (alphaH44R, 3-fold; alphaH44Q, 7-fold; alphaH44A, 10-fold). This suggests that the volume of the residue at site 15 is important for TPP binding and substitution by a residue with a longer side chain disrupts the active site more than the TPP binding site. The rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of alphaH44R E1 by E1-kinase and phospho-E1 phosphatase, respectively, were similar to that of the wild-type E1 protein. These results provide a biochemical basis for altered E1 function in the alphaH44R E1 patient.",Remaining,0,0

729,25637797,Neuroscience,Enhanced angiogenesis promoted by human umbilical mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in stroked mouse is Notch1 signaling associated.,"Cellular therapy has provided hope for restoring neurological function post stroke through promoting endogenous neurogenesis, angiogenesis and synaptogenesis. The current study was based on the observation that transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) promoted the neurological function improvement in stroked mice and meanwhile enhanced angiogenesis in the stroked hemisphere. Grafted hUCMSCs secreted human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Notch1 signaling was activated after stroke and also in the grafted hUCMSCs. To address the potential mechanism that might mediate such pro-angiogenic effect, we established a hUCMSC-neuron co-culture system. Neurons were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) injury before co-culturing to mimic the in vivo cell transplantation. Consistent with the in vivo data, co-culture medium claimed from hUCMSC-OGD neuron co-culture system significantly promoted the capillary-like tube formation of brain-derived endothelial cells. Moreover, coincident with our in vivo data, Notch 1 signaling activation was detected in hUCMSCs after co-cultured with OGD neurons as demonstrated by the up-regulation of key Notch1 signaling components Notch1 and Notch1 intercellular domain (NICD). In addition, OGD-neuron co-culture also increased the VEGF-A production by hUCMSCs. To verify whether Notch1 activation was involved in the pro-angiogenic effect, γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) was added into the co-culture medium before co-culture. It turned out that DAPT significantly prevented the Notch1 activation in hUCMSCs after co-culture with OGD neurons. More importantly, the pro-angiogenic effect of hUCMSCs was remarkably abolished by DAPT addition as demonstrated by inhibited capillary-like tube formation and less VEGF-A production. Regarding how Notch1 signaling was linked with VEGF-A secretion, we provided some clue that Notch1 effector Hes1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated by OGD-neuron co-culturing and down-regulated after additional treatment of DAPT. In summary, our data provided evidence that the VEGF-A secretion from hUCMSCs after being triggered by OGD neurons is Notch1 signaling associated. This might be a possible mechanism that contributes to the angiogenic effect of hUCMSC transplantation in stroked brain.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Understanding the molecular interaction of these compounds with various anti-Parkinsonian drug targets is of interest. The present study is intended to explore binding modes of catechins with molecular targets having potential role in PD. Lamarckian genetic algorithm methodology was adopted for molecular docking simulations employing AutoDock 4.2 program. Toxicity potential and molecular properties responsible for good pharmacokinetic profile were calculated by Osiris property explorer and Molinspiration online toolkit, respectively. A strong correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.893) was obtained between experimentally reported and docking predicted activities of native co-crystallized ligands of the 18 target receptors used in current study. Analysis of docked conformations revealed monoamine oxidase-B as most promising, while N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor was recognized as the least favorable target for catechins. Benzopyran skeleton with a phenyl group substituted at the 2-position and a hydroxyl (or ester) function at the 3-position has been identified as common structural requirements at majority of the targets.

731,11494030,International journal of oncology,Elevated levels of cathepsin B in human glioblastoma cell lines.,"Degradation of the extracellular matrix is a prerequisite for the invasive phenotype in glioma cells. Several proteases released by invading tumor cells seem to participate in the focal degradation of extracellular matrix proteins. Using enzymatic assays, Western blotting, and Northern blotting techniques, we investigated whether cathepsin B level was associated with malignant grade in seven human glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B activity and protein content levels were higher in glioblastoma cell lines than in anaplastic astrocytoma or low-grade glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B transcripts were overexpressed in glioblastoma cell lines relative to their expression in anaplastic astrocytoma and low-grade glioma cell lines. Cathepsin B promoter activity and amount of SP-1 complexes were much higher in glioblastoma cell lines than in anaplastic astrocytoma or low-grade glioma cell lines. Finally, E-64, an inhibitor of cathepsin B, inhibited both cathepsin B enzymatic activity and the invasiveness of glioblastoma cell lines. These results strongly support a role for cathepsin B in glioblastoma cell lines and suggest that inhibition of cathepsin B activity may be proven useful in cancer therapy.",In-vitro-study,8,0
732,18375019,Neurobiology of aging,Interferon-gamma-dependent cytotoxic activation of human astrocytes and astrocytoma cells.,"Astrocytes and microglia become activated in a broad spectrum of inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases. Activated microglia are widely believed to be the principal source of inflammation-induced neuronal degeneration in these disorders. To investigate the neurotoxic potential of human astrocytes, we exposed them and human astrocytic U-373 MG cells to a variety of inflammatory stimulants. We then assessed the effects of their supernatants on human SH-SY5 cells. When astrocytes and U-373 MG cells were stimulated with interferon (IFN)-gamma (150U/ml), their supernatants significantly reduced SH-SY5Y cell viability. Other powerful inflammatory stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide (0.5mug/ml), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (10ng/ml) and interleukin-1beta (10ng/ml), alone or in combination, were without effect. These combinations were also unable to enhance the IFN-gamma effect. The induced cytotoxicities were reversed by JAK inhibitor I, a potent and specific inhibitor of JAKs. This result indicates that the neurotoxic effect was proceeding through the IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR)-JAK-STAT intracellular pathway. To establish that the IFNGR is expressed on both cultured astrocytes and U-373 MG cells, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA extracts to identify a specific IFNGR product. We showed the protein product on these cultured cells by immunocytochemistry using an antibody to IFNGR. Finally, using human postmortem material, we showed sharp upregulation of the IFNGR on activated astrocytes in affected areas in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. These findings suggest that activated astrocytes may become neurotoxic when stimulated by IFN-gamma and may therefore exacerbate the pathology in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Moreover, α-synuclein content in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents a PD biomarker candidate. However, capture-based assays for α-synuclein quantification in CSF (such as by ELISA) have shown discrepancies and have limited suitability for high-throughput screening. Here, we describe two sensitive, in-solution, time-resolved Förster's resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based immunoassays for total and oligomeric α-synuclein quantification. CSF analysis showed strong concordance for total α-synuclein content between two TR-FRET assays and, in agreement with a previously characterized 36 h protocol-based ELISA, demonstrated lower α-synuclein levels in PD donors. Critically, the assay suitability for high-throughput screening of siRNA constructs and small molecules aimed at reducing endogenous α-synuclein levels was established and validated. In a small-scale proof of concept compound screen using 384 well plates, signals ranged from <30 to >120% of the mean of vehicle-treated cells for molecules known to lower and increase cellular α-synuclein, respectively. Furthermore, a reverse genetic screen of a kinase-directed siRNA library identified seven genes that modulated α-synuclein protein levels (five whose knockdown increased and two that decreased cellular α-synuclein protein). This provides critical new biological insight into cellular pathways regulating α-synuclein steady-state expression that may help guide further drug discovery efforts. Moreover, we describe an inherent limitation in current α-synuclein oligomer detection methodology, a finding that will direct improvement of future assay design. Our one-step TR-FRET-based platform for α-synuclein quantification provides a novel platform with superior performance parameters for the rapid screening of large biomarker cohorts and of compound and genetic libraries, both of which are essential to the development of PD therapies.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Three clinical forms of Gaucher disease have been described: type 1 as non-neuronopathic, type 2 as acute neuronopathic, and type 3 as subacute neuronopathic. We recently identified a rare mutation (G-->A at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1604) [Choy et al., 1994a, Am J Med Genet 51:156-160] and a novel mutation (T-->G at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1366) in two type 1 Gaucher patients by sequence analysis of the entire glucocerebrosidase coding region [Choy et al., 1994a, 1994b, Hum Mol Genet 3:821-823]. To demonstrate that these are deleterious and not neutral mutations, we cloned the full-length glucocerebrosidase cDNA of patients and of a normal control in the plasmid vector pAcUW1, recombined the human gene into the Baculovirus genome downstream of its polyhedron p10 promoter, and expressed the inserted gene in cultured cells of Spodoptera frugiperda transfected by recombinant Baculovirus. The levels of residual glucocerebrosidase activity determined in transfected cells with the Gaucher G1604A and T1366G alleles are 6.9% and 2.9% of that expressed by the normal allele (normal = 352.0 nmol/hr/mg protein or 100%). By comparison, the enzyme-specific activity expressed in transfected cells by 2 known Gaucher alleles, A1226G and T1448C, that are prevalent in type 1 and type 2 Gaucher disease are 23.4% and 3.3% of normal. No endogeneous glucocerebrosidase activity was detected in cultured cells transfected by either the wild-type Baculovirus or Baculovirus with the pAcUW1 plasmid vector without the glucocerebrosidase cDNA insert. These findings show that the Baculovirus expression system in cultured Spodoptera frugiperda cells is a suitable system for the functional expression and characterization of the normal and mutant glucocerebrosidase alleles. Moreover, the use of this expression system demonstrates that the G1604A and T1366G mutations are both deleterious mutations resulting in profoundly deficient glucocerebrosidase activity and subsequent Gaucher disease.",In-vitro-study,8,0
736,27628239,Scientific reports,α-Synuclein is a Novel Microtubule Dynamase.,"α-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein associated to Parkinson's disease, which is unstructured when free in the cytoplasm and adopts α helical conformation when bound to vesicles. After decades of intense studies, α-Synuclein physiology is still difficult to clear up due to its interaction with multiple partners and its involvement in a pletora of neuronal functions. Here, we looked at the remarkably neglected interplay between α-Synuclein and microtubules, which potentially impacts on synaptic functionality. In order to identify the mechanisms underlying these actions, we investigated the interaction between purified α-Synuclein and tubulin. We demonstrated that α-Synuclein binds to microtubules and tubulin α2β2 tetramer; the latter interaction inducing the formation of helical segment(s) in the α-Synuclein polypeptide. This structural change seems to enable α-Synuclein to promote microtubule nucleation and to enhance microtubule growth rate and catastrophe frequency, both in vitro and in cell. We also showed that Parkinson's disease-linked α-Synuclein variants do not undergo tubulin-induced folding and cause tubulin aggregation rather than polymerization. Our data enable us to propose α-Synuclein as a novel, foldable, microtubule-dynamase, which influences microtubule organisation through its binding to tubulin and its regulating effects on microtubule nucleation and dynamics.",In-vitro-study,8,0
737,19222703,Journal of neurochemistry,In vitro glutaminase regulation and mechanisms of glutamate generation in HIV-1-infected macrophage.,"Mononuclear phagocyte (MP, macrophages and microglia) dysfunction plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD) through the production and release of soluble neurotoxic factors including glutamate. Glutamate production is greatly increased following HIV-1 infection of cultured MP, a process dependent upon the glutamate-generating enzyme glutaminase. Glutaminase inhibition was previously found to significantly decrease macrophage-mediated neurotoxicity. Potential mechanisms of glutaminase-mediated excitotoxicity including enzyme up-regulation, increased enzyme activity and glutaminase localization were investigated in this report. RNA and protein analysis of HIV-infected human primary macrophage revealed up-regulation of the glutaminase isoform GAC, yet identified no changes in the kidney-type glutaminase isoform over the course of infection. Glutaminase is a mitochondrial protein, but was found to be released into the cytosol and extracellular space following infection. This released enzyme is capable of rapidly converting the abundant extracellular amino acid glutamine into excitotoxic levels of glutamate in an energetically favorable process. These findings support glutaminase as a potential component of the HAD pathogenic process and identify a possible therapeutic avenue for the treatment of neuroinflammatory states such as HAD.",In-vitro-study,8,0
738,26757674,Scientific reports,Interaction of RNA with a C-terminal fragment of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated TDP43 reduces cytotoxicity.,"A hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disease, is formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) from misfolded proteins in neuronal cells. TAR RNA/DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP43) is an ALS-causative protein forming IBs in ALS patients. The relation between localization of the IBs and neurotoxicity remains largely unknown. We characterized aggregation of fluorescently tagged TDP43 and its carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) by analytical fluorescence imaging techniques. Quantitative time-lapse analysis in individual live cells showed that fluorescent-protein-tagged TDP43 was cleaved and a 35 kDa TDP43 CTF (TDP35) formed ubiquitin (Ub)-negative cytoplasmic IBs. Although TDP35 formed mildly toxic Ub-negative IBs in the cytoplasm, TDP25, another type of a TDP43 CTF, efficiently formed sufficiently toxic Ub-positive IBs. One- or two-color fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) revealed that coaggregation of TDP25 with TDP43 was initiated by depletion of the RNA that binds to TDP25. Moreover, nuclear localization tagging TDP25 reduced the rate of neuronal cell death. These observations point to the need to elucidate the novel sequestration mechanism and details of the toxicity of the misfolded and aggregation-prone TDP43 CTFs (as well as the RNA binding and nuclear retention) in order to identify possible preventive interventions against ALS.",In-vitro-study,8,0

In recent years, many studies have focused on the mechanism(s) of PQ neurotoxicity. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of manganese (III) meso-tetrakis (N,N'-diethylimidazolium) porphyrin (MnTDM), a superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic, on PQ-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in 1RB3AN27 (N27) cells, a dopaminergic neuronal cell line. The results indicated that MnTDM significantly attenuated PQ-induced loss of cell viability, glutathione depletion, and reactive oxygen species production. MnTDM also ameliorated PQ-induced morphological nuclear changes of apoptosis and increased rates of apoptosis. In addition, our data provide direct evidence that MnTDM suppressed PQ-induced caspase-3 cleavage, possibly a key event of PQ neurotoxicity. These observations suggested that oxidative stress and apoptosis are implicated in PQ-induced neurotoxicity and this toxicity could be prevented by MnTDM. These findings also proposed a novel therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease and other disorders associated with oxidative stress.",In-vitro-study,8,0

We investigated this issue using cell lines from Friedreich's ataxia patients, homozygous for a GAA-repeat expansion in intron 1 of the Frataxin gene. By interphase, FISH we found that in comparison to the normal Frataxin sequence the replication of expanded alleles is slowed or delayed. According to molecular combing, origins never fired within the normal Frataxin allele. In contrast, in mutant alleles dormant origins are recruited within the gene, causing a switch of the prevalent fork direction through the expanded repeat. Furthermore, a global modification of the replication profile, involving origin choice and a differential distribution of unidirectional forks, was observed in the surrounding 850 kb region. These data provide a wide-view of the interplay of events occurring during replication of genes carrying an expanded repeat.",In-vitro-study,8,0
742,2991303,The Journal of cell biology,The exocrine protein trypsinogen is targeted into the secretory granules of an endocrine cell line: studies by gene transfer.,"The exocrine protein rat anionic trypsinogen has been expressed and is secreted from the murine anterior pituitary tumor cell line AtT-20. We examined which secretory pathway trypsinogen takes to the surface of this endocrine-derived cell line. The 'constitutive' pathway externalizes proteins rapidly and in the absence of an external stimulus. In the alternate, 'regulated' pathway, proteins are stored in secretory granules until the cells are stimulated to secrete with 8-Br-cAMP. On the basis of indirect immunofluorescence localization, stimulation of release, and subcellular fractionation, we find that trypsinogen is targeted into the regulated secretory pathway in AtT-20 cells. In contrast, laminin, an endogenous secretory glycoprotein, is shown to be secreted constitutively. Thus it appears that the transport apparatus for the regulated secretory pathway in endocrine cells can recognize not only endocrine prohormones, but also the exocrine protein trypsinogen, which suggests that a similar sorting mechanism is used by endocrine and exocrine cells.",In-vitro-study,8,0

In the present study, the delivery efficiency of cationic bovine serum albumin-conjugated tanshinone IIA PEGylated nanoparticles (CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs) in rat brain was investigated. We further explored whether the protective mechanism of CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs in cerebral ischemia was associated with modulating neuronal signaling pathways. The experimental cerebral ischemia model was established to evaluate the treatment efficacy of CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs. The pharmacokinetics demonstrated that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs could obviously prolong circulation time and increase plasma concentration compared with intravenously administrated TIIA solution. The biodistribution and brain uptake study confirmed that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs possessed better brain delivery efficacy with a high drug accumulation and fluorescence quantitative level in brain. CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs effectively reduced infarction volume, neurological dysfunctions, neutrophils infiltration and neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-8; upregulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and increase TGF-β1 level in the ischemic brain. In addition, treatment with CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs markedly inhibited the mRNA expressions of GFAP, MMP-9, COX-2, p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK, downregulated the protein levels of GFAP, MMP-9 and COX-2, as well as decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK and JNK. These results demonstrated that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs displayed remarkable neuroprotective effects on ischemic stroke through modulation of MAPK signal pathways involved in the cascades of neuroinflammation.",In-vitro-study,8,0

The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has been ascribed to neurodegenerative disorder, neural oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurotransmitter disorder. In the present study, we explored the influence of Sirt1/PGC1α pathway in regulating BV-2 cells viability under TNFα treatment. Our results demonstrated that the activity of Sirt1/PGC1α pathway was significantly downregulated in response to TNFα treatment. Reactivation of Sirt1/PGC1α pathway through supplementation of SRT1720 significantly elevated the viability of BV-2 cells under an in vitro neuroinflammation model. Therefore, our results report a novel signaling pathway responsible for the survival of neuron under neuroinflammation.

745,37308987,Acta neuropathologica communications,Mass cytometric analysis of the immune cell landscape after traumatic brain injury elucidates the role of complement and complement receptors in neurologic outcomes.,"Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), a neuroinflammatory response can persist for years and contribute to the development of chronic neurological manifestations. Complement plays a central role in post-TBI neuroinflammation, and C3 opsonins and the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) have been implicated in promoting secondary injury. We used single cell mass cytometry to characterize the immune cell landscape of the brain at different time points after TBI. To specifically investigate how complement shapes the post-TBI immune cell landscape, we analyzed TBI brains in the context of CR2-Crry treatment, an inhibitor of C3 activation. We analyzed 13 immune cell types, including peripheral and brain resident cells, and assessed expression of various receptors. TBI modulated the expression of phagocytic and complement receptors on both brain resident and infiltrating peripheral immune cells, and distinct functional clusters were identified within same cell populations that emerge at different phases after TBI. In particular, a CD11c+ (CR4) microglia subpopulation continued to expand over 28 days after injury, and was the only receptor to show continuous increase over time. Complement inhibition affected the abundance of brain resident immune cells in the injured hemisphere and impacted the expression of functional receptors on infiltrating cells. A role for C5a has also been indicated in models of brain injury, and we found significant upregulation of C5aR1 on many immune cell types after TBI. However, we demonstrated experimentally that while C5aR1 is involved in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain after injury, it does not alone affect histological or behavioral outcomes. However, CR2-Crry improved post-TBI outcomes and reduced resident immune cell populations, as well as complement and phagocytic receptor expression, indicating that its neuroprotective effects are mediated upstream of C5a generation, likely via modulating C3 opsonization and complement receptor expression.",In-vitro-study,8,0
746,8558175,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,Transfection of an invasive human astrocytoma cell line with a TIMP-1 cDNA: modulation of astrocytoma invasive potential.,"Malignant astrocytomas are highly invasive tumors which infiltrate diffusely into regions of normal brain. The degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases is thought to be one of the most important steps in the process of tumor invasion. However, the activity of most matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can be modulated by simultaneously secreted inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs). We have previously shown that an imbalance between the levels of MMPs and TIMPs may be essential in the determination of the invasiveness of certain human malignant astrocytoma cell lines. To determine if the up-regulation of TIMP genes and gene products could modulate the invasiveness of human malignant astrocytoma cells, in the present study we have transfected a highly invasive astrocytoma cell line, SF-188, with an expression vector carrying a full-length TIMP-1 cDNA. The parental SF-188 astrocytoma cell line overexpresses the 72-kDa and 92-kDa type IV collagenases with little expression of TIMPs-1 and -2. Following transfection with TIMP-1, SF-188 astrocytoma clones expressed the 0.9 kb TIMP-1 message by northern analysis, and produced a 21 kDa metalloproteinase inhibitor by reverse zymography. The stable TIMP-1 SF-188 transformants demonstrated morphological changes and diminished growth rates in soft agar when compared to controls. The invasion of successfully TIMP-1 transfected astrocytoma cells across matrigel-coated filters was significantly decreased over controls. These results suggest that upregulation of TIMP-1 expression in SF-188 astrocytoma cells has decreased their in vitro invasive potential.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Sodium alginate, a natural polysaccharide, was used as matrix-forming agent in the optimization of transdermal films. Propylene glycol and dl-limonene was added into films as a plasticizer and permeation enhancer, respectively. As well as mechanical strength and bioadhesiveness of optimized transdermal films of DNP, the impact of dl-limonene concentration in films on DNP in vitro permeation across pig skin was assessed. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) measurements were carried out to examine the effects of enhancer on in vitro conformational order of the stratum corneum intercellular lipids following permeation study. Results showed that transdermal formulations of DNP were suitable due to both mechanical and bioadhesive features of the films. In vitro skin permeation study indicated that dl-limonene at a concentration of 3% was optimum with high drug flux. ATR-FTIR results confirmed a more fluidized stratum corneum lipid state in the presence of dl-limonene, indicating its permeation enhancement effect. Regarding to achieve therapeutic levels of DNP, it seems to be feasible deliver DNP with transdermal films for the management of Alzheimer disease.",In-vitro-study,8,0
750,9514820,Experimental neurology,Selective neuronal vulnerability and specific glial reactions in hippocampal and neocortical organotypic cultures submitted to ischemia.,"Neurons from cerebral neocortex and hippocampus exhibit a striking difference in vulnerability to transient global ischemia. In order to study the contribution of neuronal connections and neuron-glia interactions to this variation in neuronal vulnerability, we used hippocampal and neocortical cultures submitted to various periods of histotoxic ischemia. Organotypic cultures were exposed at 37 degrees C for 0, 7, 30 and 60 min to a glucose-free NaCN-containing medium. Histological analysis using thionin staining and MAP2 immunostaining showed differences in the temporal profile of neuronal damage in hippocampal and neocortical structures, i.e., in decreasing order, CA1 (7 min) > CA3 and neocortical layers II, III, V, VI (30 min) > DG and neocortical layer IV (60 min). In parallel to the neurodegeneration study, the time course and the regional pattern of microglial and astroglial changes were also examined using GS-B4 isolectin and GFAP as immunohistochemical markers, respectively. The GS-B4 isolectin staining revealed an early (at 7 min for the hippocampus) and a specific microglial activation located in areas undergoing neuronal damage. For both organotypic cultures, astrogliosis occurred later (after 30 min of stress) with no specific regional distribution. Both hippocampal and neocortical cultures submitted to histotoxic ischemia allowed the replication of many of the cellular events observed in response to global ischemia in vivo. These findings support the hypothesis that neuron-neuron connections as well as interactions between neurons and glial cells are essential to reproduce in vitro the selective neuronal vulnerability described in vivo.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of cellular dysfunction associated with the expression of faulty PD genes.	We developed a yeast model for full-length LRRK2 studies. We expressed wild-type (wt) LRRK2 and mutations and evaluated their role during oxidative stress conditions. The involvement of mitochondria was assessed by using rho-zero mutants and by evaluating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry. The involvement of endocytosis was also studied by testing several endocytic mutants and by following the vacuolar delivery of the probe FM4-64.	Expression of LRRK2 in yeast was associated to increased hydrogen peroxide resistance. This phenotype, which was dependent on mitochondrial function, was not observed for PD-mutants G2019S and R1441C or in the absence of the kinase activity and the WD40 repeat domain. Expression of the pathogenic mutants stimulated ROS production and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. For the PD-mutants, but not for wild-type LRRK2, endocytic defects were also observed. Additionally, several endocytic proteins were required for LRRK2-mediated protection against hydrogen peroxide.	Our results indicate that LRRK2 confers cellular protection during oxidative stress depending on mitochondrial function and endocytosis.	Both the loss of capacity of LRRK2 pathogenic mutants to protect against oxidative stress and their enhancement of dysfunction may be important for the development of PD during the aging process.",In-vitro-study,8,0
752,10762371,The European journal of neuroscience,Free radical production correlates with cell death in an in vitro model of epilepsy.,"Free radical (FR) production, a major step in calcium-dependent neurodegeneration, has been linked to the generation of epileptiform activity and seizure-induced cell death. However, direct evidence of FR production in neurons during seizures has never been presented. Using hippocampal cultured slices we demonstrate that FRs are produced in CA3 but not CA1 pyramidal neurons during the rhythmic synchronous activity induced by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. The production of FRs (measured as changes in the fluorescence emission of dihydrorhodamine 123) was correlated with an increase in the baseline levels of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) estimated by fluo-3 injected into individual neurons via a patch pipette. [Ca2+]i increased during spike bursting and returned to baseline levels after the burst termination in CA1, but not in CA3, pyramidal neurons where 'interburst' calcium concentrations progressively increased. Measurement of cell death, performed with propidium iodide 48 h after a 30-min exposure to bicuculline, revealed most prominent degeneration of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 pyramidal layer. The FR scavengers vitamin E and glutathione significantly reduced the seizure-induced neurodegeneration without supressing spontaneous epileptiform activity. These observations indicate that FR overproduction is related to seizure-induced neuronal death.",In-vitro-study,8,0
753,32542379,Nucleic acids research,Full length RTEL1 is required for the elongation of the single-stranded telomeric overhang by telomerase.,"Telomeres cap the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and distinguish them from broken DNA ends to suppress DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest and genomic instability. Telomeres are elongated by telomerase to compensate for incomplete replication and nuclease degradation and to extend the proliferation potential of germ and stem cells and most cancers. However, telomeres in somatic cells gradually shorten with age, ultimately leading to cellular senescence. Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HHS) is characterized by accelerated telomere shortening and diverse symptoms including bone marrow failure, immunodeficiency, and neurodevelopmental defects. HHS is caused by germline mutations in telomerase subunits, factors essential for its biogenesis and recruitment to telomeres, and in the helicase RTEL1. While diverse phenotypes were associated with RTEL1 deficiency, the telomeric role of RTEL1 affected in HHS is yet unknown. Inducible ectopic expression of wild-type RTEL1 in patient fibroblasts rescued the cells, enabled telomerase-dependent telomere elongation and suppressed the abnormal cellular phenotypes, while silencing its expression resulted in gradual telomere shortening. Our observations reveal an essential role of the RTEL1 C-terminus in facilitating telomerase action at the telomeric 3' overhang. Thus, the common etiology for HHS is the compromised telomerase action, resulting in telomere shortening and reduced lifespan of telomerase positive cells.",In-vitro-study,8,0

It is a progressive and well recognized complex disease; therefore, it is very urgent to develop novel and effective anti-AD drugs. In this study, a series of novel isochroman-4-one derivatives from natural (±)-7,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-isochroman-4-one [(±)-XJP] were designed and synthesized, and their anti-AD potential was evaluated. Among them, compound 10a [(Z)-3-acetyl-1-benzyl-4-((6,7-dimethoxy-4-oxoisochroman-3-ylidene)methyl)pyridin-1-ium bromide] possessed potent anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as well as modest antioxidant activity.

In addition, compound 10a exhibited low cytotoxicity and moderate anti-Aβ aggregation efficacy.

755,8544909,Neurobiology of aging,Constitutive Alzheimer's-type tau epitopes in a neuritogenic rat CNS cell line.,"Paired helical filaments (PHFs) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) largely comprise hyperphosphorylated forms of the cytoskeletal protein tau. AD-type tau phosphoepitopes, detected by various monoclonal antibodies, are absent from normal adult neurons, but recent studies have shown that their expression may contribute to neuritogenesis and axon differentiation in the developing nervous system. Therefore, we have examined a brain nerve cell line that is spontaneously neuritogenic for possible expression of AD-type tau epitopes. The neuritogenic rat brain cell line B103 was found to constitutively produce two-AD related epitopes of tau, detected by cellular immunofluorescence studies with the PHF-1 and Alz-50 monoclonal antibodies. Biochemical studies showed that the antibodies bound to proteins within the molecular, weight range expected for phosphorylated tau isoforms. Further verification was established by use of tau antisense oligomers, which eliminated cellular immunofluorescence due to the AD-related monoclonals and polyclonal anti-tau but did not eliminate fluorescence due to anti-tubulin. Cells treated with tau antisense were not neurite-free. Neurites that remained, however, were abnormal, generally short and wavy in appearance. Cellular distribution of the tau epitopes was found to be particularly interesting. Alz-50 recognized only cytoplasmic tau whereas PHF-1 recognized nuclear tau as well as cytoplasmic. Thus, the two epitopes, are morphologically segregated within the cell. Because subcellular segregation of tau is compromised in Alzheimer's disease, mechanisms that segregate AD-type phosphotau epitopes in B103 cells may have relevance to this neurodegenerative disorder.",In-vitro-study,8,0

The molecular underpinnings of PD are still obscure, but nutrition may play an important role in the prevention, onset, and disease progression. Dietary (poly)phenols revert and prevent age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in model systems. However, only limited attempts were made to evaluate the impact of digestion on the bioactivities of (poly)phenols and determine their mechanisms of action. This constitutes a challenge for the development of (poly)phenol-based nutritional therapies. Here, we subjected (poly)phenols from Arbutus unedo to in vitro digestion and tested the products in cell models of PD based on the cytotoxicity of aSyn. The (poly)phenol-digested metabolites from A. unedo leaves (LPDMs) effectively counteracted aSyn and H2O2 toxicity in yeast and human cells, improving viability by reducing aSyn aggregation and inducing its clearance. In addition, LPDMs modulated pathways associated with aSyn toxicity, such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial impairment, and SIR2 expression. Overall, LPDMs reduced aSyn toxicity, enhanced the efficiency of ER-associated protein degradation by the proteasome and autophagy, and reduced oxidative stress. In total, our study opens novel avenues for the exploitation of (poly)phenols in nutrition and health.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Postmortem brain tissue from 9 cases with delirium was compared to 6 age-matched controls without delirium. Human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) and CD68 cell count and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6,β-amyloid, and tau protein immunoreactivity were determined in hippocampus, frontal cortex, and white matter.	There were no significant differences in the patients with delirium compared to the controls with respect to age 73 versus 70.5 years (p=0.72) or dementia (22% versus 0%, p=0.22). Both markers for microglial activity showed significantly higher scores in delirium brain specimens than controls in the total brain score (HLA-DR 129 vs. 20 and CD68 30 vs. 8.5) as well as in the various brain areas separately. The immunoreactivity of astrocyte activity (GFAP) was higher in the total brain score in patients with delirium (5.2 vs. 4.0, p=0.05), but in the various brain areas this was only significant in the dentate gyrus. IL-6 immunoreactivity was higher in patients with delirium in all brain areas and IL-1β was not detectable. Coexisting infectious disease or dementia did not influence the overall results.	These preliminary study results show an association between human brain activity of microglia, astrocytes, and IL-6 and delirium in elderly patients and add to the accumulating evidence that inflammatory mechanisms are involved in delirium.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Conditioning of inflammatory cells reflects, at least in part, soluble mediators (such as transforming growth factor β and IL-4) that are released by cancer cells and alter the phenotype of cells of the innate immune system. Signaling pathways in cancer cells that potentiate this activity are incompletely understood. The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is a cell-signaling receptor known to promote cancer cell survival, proliferation, metastasis, and cancer stem cell-like properties. The present findings show that uPAR expression in diverse cancer cells, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma cells, promotes the ability of these cells to condition co-cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages so that the macrophages express significantly increased levels of arginase 1, a biomarker of the alternatively activated M2 macrophage phenotype. Expression of transforming growth factor β was substantially increased in uPAR-expressing cancer cells via a mechanism that requires uPA-initiated cell signaling. uPAR also controlled expression of IL-4 in cancer cells via a mechanism that involves activation of ERK1/2. The ability of uPAR to induce expression of factors that condition macrophages in the tumor microenvironment may constitute an important mechanism by which uPAR promotes cancer progression.",In-vitro-study,8,0

High voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents were measured in whole-cell recordings from acutely isolated hippocampal CA1 neurons after a 1-week flurazepam (FZP) treatment that results in withdrawal-anxiety. An approximately 1.8-fold increase in Ca(2+) current density was detected immediately after and up to 2 days but not 3 or 4 days after drug withdrawal. Current density was unchanged after acute desalkyl-FZP treatment. A significant negative shift of the half-maximal potential of activation of HVA currents was also observed but steady-state inactivation remained unchanged. FZP and diazepam showed use- and concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca(2+) currents in hippocampal cultured cells following depolarizing trains (FZP, IC(50) = 1.8 microM; diazepam, IC(50) = 36 microM), pointing to an additional mechanism by which benzodiazepines modulate HVA Ca(2+) channels. Systemic preinjection of nimodipine (10 mg/kg), an L-type (L)-VGCC antagonist, prevented the benzodiazepine-induced increase in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxasole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current in CA1 neurons 2 days after FZP withdrawal, suggesting that AMPAR potentiation, previously linked to withdrawal-anxiety may require enhanced L-VGCC-mediated Ca(2+) influx. Taken together with prior work, these findings suggest that enhanced Ca(2+) entry through HVA Ca(2+) channels may contribute to hippocampal AMPAR plasticity and serve as a potential mechanism underlying benzodiazepine physical dependence.",In-vitro-study,8,0
760,19155310,Cancer research,ADP-ribosylation factor 6 regulates glioma cell invasion through the IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein 1-Rac1-mediated pathway.,"A common pathobiological feature of malignant gliomas is the insidious infiltration of single tumor cells into the brain parenchyma, rendering these deadly tumors virtually incurable with available therapies. In this study, we report that ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a Ras superfamily small GTPase, is abundantly expressed in invasive human glioma cells. Cellular depletion of ARF6 by small interfering RNA decreased Rac1 activation, impaired HGF-stimulated and serum-stimulated glioma cell migration in vitro, and markedly decreased the invasive capacity of invasive glioma in the brain. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ARF6 in glioma cells promoted cell migration via the activation of Rac1. Upon stimulation of glioma cells with HGF, we show that IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) is recruited and overlaps with ARF6 at the leading edge of migrating cells. However, cellular depletion of ARF6 abrogated this recruitment of IQGAP1 and attenuated the formation of surface protrusions. ARF6 forms complexes with Rac1 and IQGAP1 in glioma cells upon HGF stimulation, and knockdown of IQGAP1 significantly inhibits ARF6-induced Rac1 activation and cell migration. Taken together, these data suggest that ARF6-mediated Rac1 activation is essential for glioma cell invasion via a signaling pathway that requires IQGAP1.",In-vitro-study,8,0
761,36897426,Archives of sexual behavior,Prevalence of Intoxicating Substance Use Before or During Sex Among Young Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Drug use before or during sex is a high-risk sexual behavior associated with adverse health risks and outcomes, such as increasing the likelihood of overdoses and of acquiring sexually-transmitted diseases. This systematic review and meta-analysis of three scientific databases examined the prevalence of the use of intoxicating substances, those tending to excite or stupefy the user on a psychoactive level, before or during sex, among young adults (18-29 years old). A total of 55 unique empirical studies met the inclusion criteria (48,145 individuals; 39% males), were assessed for risk of bias using the tools of Hoy et al. (2012), and were analyzed via a generalized linear mixed-effects model. The results produced a global mean prevalence of this sexual risk behavior of 36.98% (95% CI: 28.28%, 46.63%). Nonetheless, significant differences were identified between different intoxicating substances, with the use of alcohol (35.10%; 95% CI: 27.68%, 43.31%), marijuana (27.80%; 95% CI: 18.24%, 39.92%), and ecstasy (20.90%; 95% CI: 14.34%, 29.45%) significantly more prevalent than that of cocaine (4.32%; 95% CI: 3.64%, 5.11%), heroin (.67%; 95% CI: .09%, 4.65%), methamphetamine (7.10%; 95% CI: 4.57%, 10.88%), and GHB (6.55%; 95% CI: 4.21%, 10.05%). Moderator analyses showed that the prevalence of alcohol use before or during sex differed according to geographical sample origin, and increased as the proportion of ethnic whites in samples increased. The remaining demographic (e.g., gender, age, reference population), sexual (e.g., sexual orientation, sexual activity), health (e.g., drug consumption, STI/STD status), methodological (e.g., sampling technique), and measurement (e.g., timeframe) variables that were examined did not moderate prevalence estimates.

762,29107460,The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,Electroconvulsive Therapy for Agitation and Aggression in Dementia: A Systematic Review.,"Many patients with dementia develop agitation or aggression in the course of their disease. In some severe cases, behavioral, environmental, and pharmacological interventions are not sufficient to alleviate these potentially life-threatening symptoms. It has been suggested that in those cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) could be an option. This review summarizes the scientific literature on ECT for agitation and aggression in dementia.	We performed a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Two reviewers extracted the following data from the retrieved articles: number of patients and their age, gender, diagnoses, types of problem behavior, treatments tried before ECT, specifications of the ECT treatment, use of rating scales, treatment results, follow-up data, and adverse effects.	The initial search yielded 264 articles, 17 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, one was a prospective cohort study, one was a case-control study, and the others were retrospective chart reviews, case series, or case reports. Clinically significant improvement was observed in the majority (88%) of the 122 patients described, often early in the treatment course. Adverse effects were most commonly mild, transient, or not reported.	The reviewed articles suggest that ECT could be an effective treatment for severe and treatment-refractory agitation and aggression in dementia, with few adverse consequences. Nevertheless, because of the substantial risk of selection bias, the designs of the studies reviewed, and their small number, further prospective studies are needed to substantiate these preliminary positive results.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

All selected studies were assessed for risk of bias. Owing to the heterogeneity of studies in terms of study design and analysis and the use of overlapping datasets across studies, studies were analysed thematically per outcome, and the evidence was synthesised on different health outcomes without formal meta-analysis.	 41 studies met the inclusion criteria, and focused on suicide, mental health, self rated health, mortality, and other health outcomes. Of those studies, 30 (73%) were deemed to be at high risk of bias, nine (22%) at moderate risk of bias, and only two (5%) at low risk of bias, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Although there were differences across countries and groups, there was some indication that suicides increased and mental health deteriorated during the crisis. The crisis did not seem to reverse the trend of decreasing overall mortality. Evidence on self rated health and other indicators was mixed.	 Most published studies on the impact of financial crisis on health in Europe had a substantial risk of bias; therefore, results need to be cautiously interpreted. Overall, the financial crisis in Europe seemed to have had heterogeneous effects on health outcomes, with the evidence being most consistent for suicides and mental health. There is a need for better empirical studies, especially those focused on identifying mechanisms that can mitigate the adverse effects of the crisis.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
764,31276598,"Child: care, health and development",Interventions for management of respiratory disease in young people with cerebral palsy: A systematic review.,"Respiratory disease is a leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths in young people with cerebral palsy (CP). It is insidious and multifactorial. Clinical management can be complex. This systematic review describes effects of interventions for the prevention and management of respiratory disease in young people with CP.	Nine databases (Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, EMCare, MEDLINE, PEDro, OpenGrey, ScienceDirect, and SpeechBITE) were searched. Eligibility criteria were as follows: the population included at least 50% individuals with CP aged under 26 years, the intervention was for chronic respiratory illness, the outcomes were any measurable indicators of respiratory health or morbidity; the study design could be any original study reporting effects of an intervention on measurable outcomes, and the study was published January 1998 or later. The American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine methodology guided study appraisal and synthesis. The review was registered with PROSPERO (reference number CRD42018086314).	The search yielded 3,347 papers; 37 papers (reporting 34 studies) of these met the eligibility criteria. They included 582 participants with CP (ranging from 1 to 77 across studies) with ages from 5 months to 25 years. Interventions were diverse and included: airway clearance techniques, exercise, positioning, mealtime management, salivary management, upper airway interventions, antibiotics, gastro-intestinal interventions, and spinal surgery. There were no interventions aimed at prevention of respiratory disease in this population. Research designs were classified as Levels 2 (n = 3), 3 (n = 2), 4 (n = 25), and 5 (n = 4).	Evidence for most respiratory interventions for young people with CP is absent or weak. No controlled trials demonstrated significant effects on respiratory morbidity, owing to their scarcity, weak designs, and inadequate power. There is an urgent need for well-designed prospective controlled studies investigating prevention and management of respiratory disease in young people with CP.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

Nine electronic databases (including PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched from their inception through June 2016. Seventeen studies were included in this meta-analysis. Data on 1479 eligible patients were extracted, and the relative risk (RR) and standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for the effective rate (ER), swallowing function assessment (SFA), individual activity (IA), eg., modified Barthel Index (MBI) and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated.	The pooled ER (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.34, P<0.001, 14 studies) and SFA (SMD 1.06, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.32, P<0.001, five studies) suggested that combination therapy yielded a significantly higher ER and improved the SFA scores to a greater degree than swallowing training alone in patients with poststroke dysphagia. The pooled QOL score (SMD 1.06; 95% CI -0.04 to 2.17, P=0.06, two studies) did not differ between groups. The MBI data (SMD 1.47, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.87, P<0.001, one study) showed significant improvement in IA. Some evidence of publication bias was observed for the ER, although the trim-and-fill analysis and fail-safe number indicated no influence of publication bias on its pooled effect size. There was no evidence of publication bias of any other outcome measures.	This study showed that acupuncture combined with swallowing training may improve the ER, swallowing function and activities of daily life of patients with poststroke dysphagia compared with conventional swallowing training alone.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
766,36976794,PLoS medicine,Prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Depression is the most frequent psychiatric condition after stroke and is associated with negative health outcomes. We aim to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke.	Studies published up to 4 November 2022 on Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched. We included studies of adults with stroke, where depression was assessed at a prespecified time point. Studies excluding people with aphasia and history of depression are excluded. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme(CASP) cohort study tool was used to assess risk of bias. A total of 77 studies were included in the pooled estimates of the prevalence of poststroke depression (PSD). The overall prevalence of depression was 27% (95% CI 25 to 30). Prevalence of depression was 24% (95% CI 21 to 28) by clinical interview and 29% (95% CI 25 to 32) by rating scales. Twenty-four studies with more than one assessment time point reported the natural history of PSD. Among people who were depressed within 3 months of stroke, 53% (95% CI 47 to 59) experienced persistent depression, while 44% (95% CI 38 to 50) recovered. The incidence of later depression (3 to 12 months after stroke) was 9% (95% CI 7 to 12). The cumulative incidence during 1 year after stroke was 38% (95% CI 33 to 43), and the majority (71% (95% CI 65 to 76)) of depression had onset within 3 months after stroke. The main limitation of the present study is that excluding people in source studies with severe impairments may produce imprecise estimates of the prevalence of PSD.	In this study, we observed that stroke survivors with early-onset depression (within 3 months after stroke) are at high risks for remaining depressed and make up two-thirds of the incident cases during 1 year after stroke. This highlights the need for ongoing clinical monitoring of patients depressed shortly after stroke.	PROSPERO CRD42022314146.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
767,22309074,Physical & occupational therapy in pediatrics,Reproducibility of tactile assessments for children with unilateral cerebral palsy.,"A systematic review identified tactile assessments used in children with cerebral palsy (CP), but their reproducibility is unknown. Sixteen children with unilateral CP and 31 typically developing children (TDC) were assessed 2-4 weeks apart. Test-retest percent agreements within one point for children with unilateral CP (and TDC) were Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments: 75% (90%); single-point localization: 69% (97%); static two-point discrimination: 93% (97%); and moving two-point discrimination: 87% (97%). Test-retest reliability for registration and unilateral spatial tactile perception tests was high in children with CP (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.79-0.96). Two tests demonstrated a learning effect for children with CP, double simultaneous and tactile texture perception. Stereognosis had a ceiling effect for TDC (ICC = 0) and variability for children with CP (% exact agreement = 47%-50%). The Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, single-point localization, and both static and moving two-point discrimination are recommended for use in practice and research. Although recommended to provide a comprehensive assessment, the measures of double simultaneous, stereognosis, and tactile texture perception may not be responsive to change over time in children with unilateral CP.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

We conducted a meta-analysis of studies on expression and cellular distribution of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) in IE patients to evaluate the contribution of this protein to AED resistance. In addition, we summarize experiments examining MRP1 expression and substrates in animal models of IE.	The literature search based on pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as quality assessment, data extraction and statistical analyses were conducted concurrently by two independent researchers. We identified nine high-quality studies (Jadad score ≥3) published between 2000 and 2014 on the expression and cellular distribution of MRP1 in IE patients. A fixed effect model was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Forest and funnel plots were constructed to assess study heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively.	MRP1 expression was significantly higher in both astrocytes (OR = 17.04, 95% CI: 7.69-37.76, P < 0.00001) and neurons (OR = 22.13, 95% CI: 8.52-57.46, P < 0.00001) of IE patients compared to controls, while there was no significant difference in endothelial cell MRP1 expression (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.09-1.79, P = 0.48). Funnel plot symmetry indicated no substantial publication bias. Most relevant preclinical studies from 2000 to 2014 found higher MRP1 expression in IE model rodents. Furthermore, MRP1 overexpression reduced the extracellular concentration of AEDs in brain, while MRP1 inhibitors enhanced brain AED concentrations.	Pooled results strongly suggest that MRP1 is overexpressed in both neurons and astrocytes of IE patients. Inhibition of MRP1 may enhance AED efficacy by increasing local drug availability.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

Embase, PubMed, Wiley/Cochrane Library, and Ebsco/CINAHL were searched from inception up to May 16, 2018.	We included randomized controlled trials comparing upper limb BoNT injections with a control intervention in patients with a history of stroke. A total of 1212 unique records were screened by 2 independent reviewers. Forty trials were identified, including 2718 patients with history of stroke.	Outcome data were pooled according to assessment timing (ie, 4-8wk and 12wk after injection), and categorized into 6 main clinical goals (ie, spasticity-related pain, involuntary movements, passive joint motion, care ability, arm and hand use, and standing and walking performance). Sensitivity analyses were performed for the influence of study and intervention characteristics, involvement of pharmaceutical industry, and publication bias.	Robust evidence is shown for the effectiveness of BoNT in reducing resistance to passive movement, as measured with the (Modified) Ashworth Score, and improving self-care ability for the affected hand and arm after intervention (P<.005) and at follow-up (P<.005). In addition, robust evidence is shown for the absence of effect on arm-hand capacity at follow-up. BoNT was found to significantly reduce involuntary movements, spasticity-related pain, and caregiver burden, and improve passive range of motion, while no evidence was found for arm and hand use after intervention.	In view of the robustness of current evidence, no further trials are needed to investigate BoNT for its favorable effects on resistance to passive movement of the spastic wrist and fingers, and on self-care. No trials are needed to further confirm the lack of effects of BoNT on arm-hand capacity, whereas additional trials are needed to establish the suggested favorable effects of BoNT on other body functions, which may result in clinically meaningful outcomes at activity and participation levels.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

However, the same test may be used for measuring QoL, well-being or health status in different studies. QoL has been defined as the subjective appraisal of one's current life based primarily on psychological function. The most important in the appraisal of well-being is mental function and concerning health status patients evaluate physical function as most important. To differentiate the effects of GH replacement on psychological variables in patients with GHD we carried out a number of meta-analyses, classifying questionnaires into instruments measuring QoL, psychological well-being and health status.	We searched the electronic databases PUBMED and PiCarta from 1985 to 2004. Studies were included that evaluated the effect of GH on patient-reported outcomes in adults with GHD (aged 18 years and above). According to generally accepted definitions we classified the questionnaires as instruments measuring QoL, well-being and health status. By means of meta-analyses the average effect size (d) for QoL, well-being and health status was calculated.	Based on open studies GH replacement is found to improve QoL with a small effect size (d = 0.18), well-being with a medium effect size (d = 0.47) and health status with a small effect size (d = 0.26). As the effect size of well-being is most pronounced the generally reported effects of GH replacement on QoL may be overestimated and actually reflect the effect on well-being.	To get more insight in the specific psychological effects of GH treatment it is recommended that instruments selected for these studies should be more consistently classified as instruments measuring QoL, well-being or health status.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

This article reviews the evidence supporting pharmacotherapy of aggression in youth, with a primary focus on impulsive aggression (the primary indication for this intervention). Relevant diagnostic considerations and consensus guidelines are discussed.	Articles examining the role of medications in the treatment of aggression in youth with pathological aggression were identified using PubMed and MEDLINE® databases over the past 15 years (2000-2015); selected articles published prior to 2000 and deemed to be of high relevance were searched and also included. Search terms included: Aggression, aggressive, disruptive behavior, conduct, youth, children, and adolescents. Cited references were also searched for relevant articles.	There are a number of evidence-based medication treatments for aggression, which are generally best considered in the context of differential diagnosis and ongoing evidence-based psychosocial interventions. Impulsive aggression is generally considered the type of aggression most amenable to medication, but other aggression subtypes may also possibly respond to treatment. Medication classes with positive evidence include the psychostimulants and α-2 agonists (in the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and/or disruptive behavior disorders), mood stabilizing agents, and atypical antipsychotics. Published guidelines recommend systematic and adequate trials of medications in sequential order, to optimize response and minimize polypharmacy. Guidelines for safety monitoring are available for many of the medications used for aggression in youth, and are also discussed.	Aggression in children carries a high risk of poor outcomes, and, therefore, a better understanding of treatment options is a high priority. The available literature points to the importance of identifying the underlying disorder, when possible, and using this information to guide treatment selection. Future studies are needed to better inform the treatment of aggression across disorders, and the treatment of different aggression subtypes.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

American volume,Thromboprophylaxis in patients with acute spinal injuries: an evidence-based analysis.,"The increased risk for venous thromboembolic events following spinal trauma is well established. The purpose of the present study was to examine the literature in order to determine the optimum thromboprophylaxis regimen for patients with acute spinal injuries with or without spinal cord injury.	EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched from the earliest available date to April 2008 for clinical trials comparing different methods of thromboprophylaxis in adult patients following acute spinal injuries (with or without spinal cord injury). Outcome measures included the prevalences of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treatment-related adverse events.	The search yielded 489 studies, but only twenty-one of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis was significantly lower in patients without spinal cord injury as compared with patients with spinal cord injury (odds ratio = 6.0; 95% confidence interval = 2.9 to 12.7). Patients with an acute spinal cord injury who were receiving oral anticoagulants had significantly fewer episodes of pulmonary embolism (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.01 to 0.63) than those who were not receiving oral anticoagulants (either untreated controls or patients managed with low-molecular-weight heparin). The start of thromboprophylaxis within the first two weeks after the injury resulted in significantly fewer deep-vein-thrombosis events than delayed initiation did (odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1 to 0.4). With regard to heparin-based pharmacoprophylaxis in patients with spinal trauma, low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduced the rates of deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding episodes in comparison with the findings in patients who received unfractionated heparin, with odds ratios of 2.6 (95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 5.6) and 7.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 58.4) for deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding, respectively.	The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis following a spine injury is higher among patients who have a spinal cord injury than among those who do not have a spinal cord injury. Therefore, thromboprophylaxis in these patients should start as early as possible once it is deemed safe in terms of potential bleeding complications. Within this population, low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis, with fewer bleeding complications, than unfractionated heparin is. The use of vitamin K antagonists appeared to be effective for the prevention of pulmonary embolism.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

Electronic literature searches and email contacts were used to identify literature relevant to the impact of health checks for people with intellectual disabilities published from 1989 to 2013. Forty-eight publications were identified, of which eight articles and two reports were newly identified and not included in the previous review. These involved checking the health of people with intellectual disabilities from a range of countries including a full range of people with intellectual disabilities. Health checks consistently led to detection of unmet health needs and targeted actions to address health needs. Health checks also had the potential to increase knowledge of the health needs of people with intellectual disabilities amongst health professionals and support staff, and to identify gaps in health services. Health checks are effective in identifying previously unrecognised health needs, including life threatening conditions. Future research should consider strategies for optimising the cost effectiveness or efficiency of health checks.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

Preoperative to postoperative change in patient-reported outcomes (visual analog scales for arm pain and neck pain, Neck Disability Index, Japanese Orthopaedic Association [JOA] score, modified JOA score, and Nurick pain scale) and rates of fusion, revision, and complications or adverse events.	This study was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and a preapproved protocol. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for articles published from January 2001 through July 2018. Statistical analyses for patient-reported outcomes were performed on the outcomes' raw mean differences, calculated as postoperative value minus preoperative value from each study. Pooled rates of successful fusion, revision surgery, and complications or adverse events, and their 95% confidence intervals, were also calculated. Two subgroup analyses were performed: one for studies in which only myelopathy or radiculopathy (or both) were stated as surgical indications and the other for studies in which only myelopathy or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (or both) were stated as surgical indications. This study was funded by Providence Medical Technology, Inc. ($32,000).	Thirty-three articles were included in the systematic review, and 31 articles were included in the meta-analysis. For all surgical indications and for the 2 subgroup analyses, every cumulative change in patient-reported outcome improved. Many of the reported changes in patient-reported outcome also exceeded the minimal clinically important differences. Pooled outcome rates with all surgical indications were 98.25% for successful fusion, 1.09% for revision, and 9.02% for complications or adverse events. Commonly reported complications or adverse events were axial pain, C5 palsy, transient neurological worsening, and wound infection.	Posterior cervical fusion with decompression resulted in significant clinical improvement, as indicated by the changes in patient-reported outcomes. Additionally, high fusion rates and low rates of revision and of complications and adverse events were found.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
778,35288967,The International journal of eating disorders,A systematic review of sociodemographic reporting and representation in eating disorder psychotherapy treatment trials in the United States.,"Eating disorders (EDs) were once conceptualized as primarily affecting affluent, White women, a misconception that informed research and practice for many years. Abundant evidence now discredits this stereotype, but it is unclear if prevailing 'evidence-based' treatments have been evaluated in samples representative of the diversity of individuals affected by EDs. Our goal was to evaluate the reporting, inclusion, and analysis of sociodemographic variables in ED psychotherapeutic treatment randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the US through 2020.	We conducted a systematic review of ED psychotherapeutic treatment RCTs in the US and examined the reporting and inclusion of gender identity, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status (SES) of enrolled participants, as well as recruitment methods, power analyses, and discussion of limitations and generalizability.	Our search yielded 58 studies meeting inclusion criteria dating back to 1985. Reporting was at times incomplete, absent, or centered on the racial/gender majority group. No studies reported gender diverse participants, and men and people of color were underrepresented generally, with differences noted across diagnoses. A minority of papers considered sociodemographic variables in analyses or acknowledged limitations related to sample characteristics. Some progress was made across the decades, with studies increasingly providing full racial and ethnic data, and more men included over time. Although racial and ethnic diversity improved somewhat, progress appeared to stall in the last decade.	We summarize findings, consider context and challenges for RCT researchers, and offer suggestions for researchers, journal editors, and reviewers on improving representation, reporting, and analytic practices.	Randomized controlled trials of eating disorder psychotherapeutic treatment in the US are increasingly reporting full race/ethnicity data, but information on SES is inconsistent and sexual orientation absent. White women still comprise the overwhelming majority of participants, with few men and people of color, and no gender-diverse individuals. Findings underscore the need to improve reporting and increase representation to ensure evidence-based treatments are effective across and within diverse groups.	Los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) alguna vez se conceptualizaron como enfermedades que afectaban principalmente a las mujeres blancas, adineradas, un concepto erróneo que informó la investigación y la práctica clínica durante muchos años. Abundante evidencia ahora desacredita este estereotipo, pero no está claro si los tratamientos prevalecientes 'basados en la evidencia' se han evaluado en muestras representativas de la diversidad de individuos afectados por los TCA. Nuestro objetivo fue evaluar el informe, la inclusión y el análisis de las variables sociodemográficas en los ensayos controlados aleatorios (ECA) del tratamiento psicoterapéutico para TCA en los Estados Unidos hasta 2020. MÉTODOS: Se realizó una revisión sistemática de los ECA de tratamiento psicoterapéutico de los TCA en los Estados Unidos y se examinó el informe y la inclusión de la identidad de género, la edad, la raza/etnia, la orientación sexual y el estado socioeconómico (ESE) de los participantes inscritos, así como los métodos de reclutamiento, los análisis de poder y la discusión de las limitaciones y la generalización.	La búsqueda arrojó 58 estudios que cumplieron los criterios de inclusión que datan de 1985. Los informes a veces eran incompletos, ausentes o centrados en el grupo mayoritario racial / de género. Ningún estudio informó participantes con diversidad de género, y los hombres y las personas de color estuvieron subrepresentados en general, con diferencias observadas entre los diagnósticos. Una minoría de los artículos consideró variables sociodemográficas en los análisis o reconoció limitaciones relacionadas con las características de la muestra. Se lograron algunos avances a lo largo de las décadas, con estudios que proporcionan cada vez más datos raciales y étnicos completos, y más hombres incluidos con el tiempo. Aunque la diversidad racial y étnica mejoró un poco, el progreso pareció estancarse en la última década. DISCUSIÓN: Resumimos los hallazgos, consideramos el contexto y los desafíos para los investigadores de ECA, y ofrecemos sugerencias para investigadores, editores de revistas y revisores sobre cómo mejorar la representación, el informe y las prácticas analíticas.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
779,27343888,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,Transported Versus Homegrown Parenting Interventions for Reducing Disruptive Child Behavior: A Multilevel Meta-Regression Study.,"Children's disruptive behavior problems place children at high risk for oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, and carry a high burden for individuals and society. Policy makers and service providers aiming to reduce children's disruptive behavior problems must often choose between importing an intervention developed abroad or instead developing or using a 'homegrown' (i.e., local) intervention. No comprehensive comparison of these interventions exists.	We performed a multilevel meta-regression of 129 randomized trials (374 effect sizes) of transported and homegrown parenting interventions. We identified trials by searching the included trials lists of systematic reviews, found through searches in 6 databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE). Trials that had not yet been reviewed were found by searching the same databases. Primary outcome was the mean difference in effectiveness between transported and homegrown interventions to reduce disruptive child behavior. We also compared this differential effectiveness for various intervention 'brands' (e.g., Incredible Years and Triple P Positive Parenting Program) and geographical regions (e.g., North America and Europe).	Transported and homegrown interventions did not differ in their effectiveness to reduce disruptive child behavior (d = 0.10, not significant). Results were robust across intervention brands and geographical regions. Six trials on transported interventions in Hong Kong, Iran, and Panama suggest promising results for transporting interventions to 'nonwestern' countries, whereas one trial in Indonesia does not.	Parenting interventions based on the same principles led to similar outcomes, whether transported or homegrown. This finding supports the selection of interventions based on their evidence base rather than on cultural specificity.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
780,37271132,Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,The Utility of Visual and Spatial Perception Tests in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Visual and spatial perception (VSP) are cognitive domains frequently assessed in the screening and neuropsychological assessment of dementia. Evidence suggests that VSP impairment is common in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite this evidence, the ability of VSP tests to discriminate between healthy older adults and people with AD remains mixed. The purpose of this literature review was to employ a systematic search strategy to identify empirical evidence supporting the diagnostic utility of VSP tests which may be used in the screening and diagnosis of AD.	Specified criteria were used to perform a systematic literature search of the PsycINFO and PubMed databases with no date restrictions. Relevant data from the selected studies were extracted, and a published appraisal tool (the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) was used to evaluate methodological quality.	Of the 144 articles returned, six studies and 11 VSP tests met review inclusion criteria. Four tests demonstrated both sensitivity and specificity values above 80%. A computerised 3D Visual Task demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity values (90% and 95%, respectively). The quality of the identified studies was considered to be satisfactory. Identified limitations and the implications of issues relating to study methodology are discussed, and recommendations for future research are suggested.	The evidence from this review suggests that certain tests of VSP may be a useful addition to the routine screening of AD.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
781,30094499,Neurosurgical review,"Depression and glioblastoma, complicated concomitant diseases: a systemic review of published literature.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer. Depression is a common co-morbidity of this condition. Despite this common interaction, relatively little research has been performed on the development of GBM-associated depression. We performed a literary search of the PubMed database for articles published relating to GBM and depression. A total of 85 articles were identified with 46 meeting inclusion criteria. Depression significantly impacts care, decreasing medication compliance, and patient survival. Diagnostically, because depression and GBM share intricate neuro-connectivity in a way that effect functionality, these diseases can be mistaken for alternative psychological or pathological disorders, complicating care. Therapeutically, anti-depressants have anti-tumor properties; yet, some have been shown to interfere with GBM treatment. One reason for this is that the pathophysiological development of depression and GBM share several pathways including altered regulation of the 5-HT receptor, norepinephrine, and 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. Over time, depression can persist after GBM treatment, affecting patient quality of life. Together, depression and GBM are complicated concomitant diseases. Clinicians must be aware of their co-existence. Because of overlapping molecular pathways involved in both diseases, careful medication selection is imperative to avoid potential adverse interactions. Since GBMs are the most common primary brain cancer, physicians dealing with this disease should be prepared for the development of depression as a potential sequela of this condition, given the related pathophysiology and the known poor outcomes.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

The purpose of this scoping review was to understand the type and amount of physical activity interventions performed in this population as well as their effect.	PubMed, Cochran and CINAHL Complete were systematically searched for articles describing physical activity interventions in people with a chronic, stable central nervous system lesion. The outcome measures needed to include physiological or psychological variables, measures of general health or quality of life.	Of the initial 7554 articles, 34 were included after the title, abstract, and full-text screening. Only six studies were designed as randomized-controlled trials. Most interventions were supported by technologies, mainly functional electrical stimulation (cycling or rowing). The duration of the intervention ranged from four to 52 weeks. Endurance and strength training interventions (and a combination of both) were performed and over 70% of studies resulted in health improvements.	Non-ambulatory people with severe motor impairments may benefit from physical activity interventions. However, the number of studies and their comparability is very limited. This indicates the need for future research with standard measures to develop evidence-based, specific recommendations for physical activity in this population.Key messagesPhysical activity interventions can have health benefits in non-ambulatory people with severe motor impairments.Even simple, low-tech interventions allow for health-enhancing training.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

Introducción: Las guías clínicas para el tratamiento de la disociación se centran principalmente en la psicoterapia. Sin embargo, diferentes sustancias psicoactivas se usan en la práctica clínica. El uso de antagonistas opioides se ha propuesto como una opción terapéutica basada en la teoría de que la disociación podría ser un fenómeno mediado por la desregulación del sistema opioide endógeno.

784,32967293,Genes,Unveiling Sex-Based Differences in the Effects of Alcohol Abuse: A Comprehensive Functional Meta-Analysis of Transcriptomic Studies.,"The abuse of alcohol, one of the most popular psychoactive substances, can cause several pathological and psychological consequences, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). An impaired ability to stop or control alcohol intake despite adverse health or social consequences characterize AUD. While AUDs predominantly occur in men, growing evidence suggests the existence of distinct cognitive and biological consequences of alcohol dependence in women. The molecular and physiological mechanisms participating in these differential effects remain unknown. Transcriptomic technology permits the detection of the biological mechanisms responsible for such sex-based differences, which supports the subsequent development of novel personalized therapeutics to treat AUD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of transcriptomics studies regarding alcohol dependence in humans with representation from both sexes. For each study, we processed and analyzed transcriptomic data to obtain a functional profile of pathways and biological functions and then integrated the resulting data by meta-analysis to characterize any sex-based transcriptomic differences associated with AUD. Global results of the transcriptomic analysis revealed the association of decreased tissue regeneration, embryo malformations, altered intracellular transport, and increased rate of RNA and protein replacement with female AUD patients. Meanwhile, our analysis indicated that increased inflammatory response and blood pressure and a reduction in DNA repair capabilities are associated with male AUD patients. In summary, our functional meta-analysis of transcriptomic studies provides evidence for differential biological mechanisms of AUD patients of differing sex.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

A systematic search of databases PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO through April 2011 was performed.	Two independent raters identified and examined studies that reported laboratory- or field-based measures of maximal aerobic or anaerobic capacity in children with CP aged 5 to 14 years.	The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was used by 2 independent raters to evaluate the methodologic quality of the included clinimetric studies and to identify measures used in these studies.	Twenty-four studies that used a maximal aerobic or anaerobic capacity measure were identified. Five studies reported clinimetric properties for 5 measures (2 aerobic and 3 anaerobic measures). Methodologic quality was excellent in 3 studies, showing good validity and reliability of field-based aerobic (Shuttle Run Test) and anaerobic (Muscle Power Sprint Test) measures. The studies on laboratory-based measures were rated fair, mainly because of inadequate statistics. The level of evidence was strong for good validity and reliability of the field-based tests. The level of evidence was unknown for validity and low to moderate for good reliability of laboratory-based tests.	There is a paucity of research on the clinimetric properties of measurement instruments to assess aerobic and anaerobic capacity for children with CP.

The objective of this study is to assess the relationship of IL-10 -1082G/A polymorphism and AD risk by using meta-analysis.	All eligible case-control studies were searched in Pubmed and Embase. Odds ratios (OR) with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the association.	A total of 2158 cases and 2088 controls in 12 case-control studies were included. The results indicated that the A allele carriers (AA+AG) had a 27% increased risk of AD, when compared with the homozygote GG (OR=1.27, 95%CI=1.02-1.58 for AA+AG vs. GG). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant elevated risks were associated with A allele carriers in Europeans (OR=1.27 and 95%CI=1.01-1.59 for AA+AG vs. GG), but not in Asians (OR=1.37 and 95%CI=0.32-5.88 for AA+AG vs. GG).	This meta-analysis suggested that the -1082G/A polymorphism of IL-10 gene would be a risk factor for AD.

Considering possible risks of intrauterine drug exposure of the child, the role of psychopharmacological treatment is ambiguous and various negative obstetric outcomes were inconsistently associated with medication. Consequently, a critical examination of peri- and postnatal phenomena associated with intrauterine exposure to antidepressants based on serotonin reuptake inhibition (SRI) and subsumed under the term 'poor neonatal adaptation syndrome' (PNAS) is urgently called for.	A comprehensive literature search was conducted, revealing a total number of 33 relevant studies and 69 individual outcomes among 3025 screened studies. Seventeen outcomes allowed meta-analytic evaluation (random effects model). Measures for heterogeneity (I[2]) and contour-enhanced funnel plots were generated.	Single studies showed increased risks for deficits in neurological functioning and autonomous adaptation in SRI exposed infants. Meta-analytical evaluation showed increased symptom occurrence or severity in exposed neonates for low APGAR scores, birth weight, size for gestational age, preterm delivery, neuromuscular and autonomous regulation, and higher rates of admission to specialized care. Mostly, increased risk after SRI exposure was supported by comparison to unexposed infants born to mothers diagnosed with depression.	Whereas statistically significant evidence for various effects of intrauterine exposure to SRI was found, the clinical relevance remains unresolved because of inherently low data quality in this research domain and insufficiently defined samples and outcomes. More systematic research under ethical considerations is required to improve multiprofessional counseling in the many women dealing with MDD during pregnancy and the peripartum.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

A systematic review of approaches to benzodiazepine discontinuation in general practice and out-patient settings was undertaken. Routine care was compared with three treatment approaches: brief interventions, gradual dose reduction (GDR) and psychological interventions. GDR was compared with GDR plus psychological interventions or substitutive pharmacotherapies.	Inclusion criteria were met by 24 studies, and a further eight were identified by future search. GDR [odds ratio (OR) = 5.96, confidence interval (CI) = 2.08-17.11] and brief interventions (OR = 4.37, CI = 2.28-8.40) provided superior cessation rates at post-treatment to routine care. Psychological treatment plus GDR were superior to both routine care (OR = 3.38, CI = 1.86-6.12) and GDR alone (OR = 1.82, CI = 1.25-2.67). However, substitutive pharmacotherapies did not add to the impact of GDR (OR = 1.30, CI = 0.97-1.73), and abrupt substitution of benzodiazepines by other pharmacotherapy was less effective than GDR alone (OR = 0.30, CI = 0.14-0.64). Few studies on any technique had significantly greater benzodiazepine discontinuation than controls at follow-up.	Providing an intervention is more effective than routine care. Psychological interventions may improve discontinuation above GDR alone.

Cerebral vessels are nearly adult size by 5 years of age but the technical feasibility of achieving recanalization in younger and smaller children with current endovascular tools remains unclear.	To systematically review the literature on mechanical thrombectomy for stroke in children less than 5 years of age.	Mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke has been reported in 11 children under the age of 5 years (range 9 months to 4 years). The mean time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 12 hours (range 4-50 hours). Complete recanalization was achieved in 7/12 (58%) vessels attempted, and partial recanalization in 4/12 (33%). Two procedure related complications were reported, with small vessel size felt to be contributory to basilar vasospasm in one case. Favorable neurological outcomes were reported in 7 cases (64%).	Our review of the literature demonstrates that mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke may be feasible in carefully selected infants and young children less than 5 years of age using currently available devices. Efficacy in promoting better neurologic outcomes remains unproven, and other questions persist, including whether complications such as vasospasm occur more frequently in young children compared with adults.

A systematic search conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) identified 25 studies that assessed the usability of health information websites. Adolescent feedback was collected by a mixture of surveys, focus groups, interviews, and think-aloud procedures.	A majority of the information websites were developed for specific health issues that may be relevant to adolescents. The most preferred website features were interactive content such as games and quizzes, as well as videos, images, audio clips, and animations. Participants also preferred communicating with other adolescents with similar conditions or learning about their experience through real stories and testimonials. Adolescents found it difficult to use health information websites if they contained too much text, were too cluttered, or had features that made it difficult to access. The findings are considered in the context of adolescent social processes, low tolerance of delayed gratification, and attraction to novelty and mapped onto a neurodevelopmental model of adolescence.	Young people's feedback can determine usability and content that make a health information website easy or informative to use. Neurodevelopmental profiles and the users' specific preferences and skills should be addressed in future development of health information websites for adolescents.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
795,28103414,Journal of traumatic stress,A Meta-Analysis of the Association Between Appraisals of Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress in Children and Adolescents.,"Cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) place an emphasis on the role of negative appraisals of traumatic events. It is suggested that the way in which the event is appraised determines the extent to which posttraumatic stress symptoms will be experienced. Therefore, a strong relationship between trauma appraisals and symptoms of PTSD might be expected. However, this relationship is not as firmly established in the child and adolescent literature. A systematic literature review of this relationship returned 467 publications, of which 11 met full eligibility criteria. A random effects meta-analysis revealed a large effect size for the relationship between appraisals and PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents, r = .63, 95% CI [.58, .68], Z = 17.32, p < .001, with significant heterogeneity present. A sensitivity analysis suggested that this relationship was not contingent on 1 specific measure of appraisals. Results were consistent with the cognitive behavioral theory of PTSD, demonstrating that appraisals of trauma are strongly related to posttraumatic stress in children and adolescents. However, this relationship was not observed in a sample of 4- to 6-year-olds, indicating that further research is required to explicate cognitive processing of trauma in very young children.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
796,31317281,Journal of medical systems,A Systematic Review and Implementation of IoT-Based Pervasive Sensor-Enabled Tracking System for Dementia Patients.,"In today's world, 46.8 million people suffer from brain related diseases. Dementia is most prevalent of all. In general scenario, a dementia patient lacks proper guidance in searching out the way to return back at his/her home. Thus, increasing the risk of getting damaged at individual-health level. Therefore, it is important to track their movement in more sophisticated manner as possible. With emergence of wearables, GPS sensors and Internet of Things (IoT), such devices have become available in public domain. Smartphone apps support caregiver to locate the dementia patients in real-time. RF, GSM, 3G, Wi-Fi and 4G technology fill the communication gap between patient and caregiver to bring them closer. In this paper, we incorporated 7 most popular wearables for investigation to seek appropriateness for dementia tracking in recent times in systematic manners. We performed an in-depth review of these wearables as per the cost, technology wise and application wise characteristics. A case novel study i.e. IoT-based Force Sensor Resistance enabled System-FSRIoT, has been proposed and implemented to validate the effectiveness of IoT in the domain of smarter dementia patient tracking in wearable form factor. The results show promising aspect of a whole new notion to leverage efficient assistive physio-medical healthcare to the dementia patients and the affected family members to reduce life risks and achieve a better social life.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

798,29138078,World neurosurgery,Is There an Indication for Intraoperative MRI in Subtotal Resection of Glioblastoma? A Multicenter Retrospective Comparative Analysis.,"Surgery in patients with highly eloquent glioblastoma (GB) remains challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate influence of use of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) on extent of resection (EOR), clinical outcome, and survival in patients with preoperatively intended subtotal resection of GB.	Retrospective assessment was performed in 3 neurosurgical centers (2008-2013). All patients with primary GB, unilocular growth, and adjuvant radiochemotherapy in whom subtotal resection was intended were included. Imaging data were pseudonymized and volumetrically assessed by a central reviewer. Clinical outcome was evaluated based on complications, new permanent neurologic deficits, and survival. Based on subtraction of potential EOR (as defined by reviewer) from effective EOR, EOR change (ΔEOR) was calculated for each case. We calculated multivariate linear regressions to assess influence on effective EOR and ΔEOR, binary regressions to assess influence on complications and new permanent neurologic deficits, and Cox regression models to assess survival.	Assessment included 70 patients. In iMRI group, a significantly lower ΔEOR (4% vs. 22%, P = 0.008) was found. In linear regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, only iMRI influenced ΔEOR significantly (P = 0.03, odds ratio 0.27). In binary regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, effective EOR, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, none of the variables showed a significant difference concerning complications and new permanent neurologic deficits. Overall survival was significantly influenced by age (P = 0.03, odds ratio 1.02) and iMRI (P = 0.026, odds ratio 0.51).	Maximum safe resection is an important prognostic factor for patients with eloquent GBs. iMRI seems to be a relevant tool to achieve this goal.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
799,9141543,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Circulating non-22-kilodalton growth hormone isoforms in acromegalic men before and after transsphenoidal surgery.,"GH represents several molecular isoforms in addition to the main 22-kDa (22K) GH. There have been reports suggesting that circulating non-22K GH isoforms are increased in acromegaly, but the possible implications of such observations in the management of the disease have not been addressed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proportion of circulating non-22K GH isoforms in acromegaly. In addition, the relationships between the amount of non-22K GH and tumor size, biochemical measurements, and body composition also were investigated. Samples with different GH levels were selected from 24-h GH profiles from 15 acromegalic men evaluated before and 1 yr after transsphenoidal surgery and from 13 healthy men. The serum non-22K GH levels, expressed as percentage of total GH concentration, were determined by the 22K GH exclusion assay, which is based on immunomagnetic extraction of 22K GH from serum and quantitation of non-22K GH using a polyclonal GH assay. The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was fairly constant in different samples from the same patient, regardless of the GH level. However, a wide variation of values was observed among acromegalics, both before (14-51%) and after surgery (8-62%). The proportion of non-22K GH isoforms was increased in untreated patients, compared with controls (26.6 vs. 17.4%; P < 0.01), and the values correlated significantly to tumor size, mean 24-h GH concentration, serum PRL, and extracellular water. After surgery, patients not truly cured, with mean 24-h GH concentration of 1 microg/L or more, had an increased proportion of non-22K GH, compared with those with levels less than 1 microg/L (P < 0.01). In the former group, the median values were similar than those in untreated acromegalics (34 vs. 26.6%, respectively), whereas in the latter, they were comparable with those in the controls (15.2 vs. 17.4%, respectively). We conclude that acromegalics have an increased proportion of circulating non-22K GH isoforms. The values are fairly constant in different samples from an individual, regardless of GH level, but a large spectrum can be observed among patients. This variability suggests that different pituitary adenomas secrete GH isoforms in variable amounts. Our observation that a higher proportion of non-22K GH isoforms is present in patients not truly cured after surgery suggests that the evaluation of non-22K GH isoforms can be useful in the follow-up of acromegalic patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
800,25929206,Spine,A Comparison of Anterior Cervical Corpectomy and Fusion Combined With Artificial Disc Replacement and Cage Fusion in Patients With Multilevel Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy.,"A retrospective study.	The aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes of anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) combined with artificial disc replacement (C-ADR) and ACCF combined with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in patients with consecutive 3-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).	The optimal surgical strategy for multilevel CSM (MCSM) remains undefined. C-ADR maintains motion at the level of the surgical procedure and decreases strain on the adjacent segments. The clinical results of multilevel C-ADR have not yet been elucidated. ACCF combined with 1-level C-ADR for the treatment of consecutive 3-level CSM may be a reasonable alternative to 3-level fusion.	We retrospectively reviewed the histories of patients who underwent surgery for consecutive 3-level CSM between C3-4 and C6-7 from June 2007 to August 2011. A total of 42 patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 19) underwent ACCF combined with 1-level C-ADR; group B (n = 23) underwent ACCF combined with 1-level ACDF. We compared perioperative parameters, clinical parameters, and radiological parameters.	There were no significant differences in the average age, sex ratio, the preoperative heights of the disc space or average blood loss between the 2 groups. Group A had longer operation times than group B (P < 0.05). During the follow-up period, group A showed a better Neck Dysfunction Index recovery (P < 0.05) at 24 months postoperatively, and less visual analogue scale scores at 12 and 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, group A exhibited better C2-C7 range of motion recovery at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.05, respectively).	Group A was superior to Group B in terms of better Neck Dysfunction Index recovery, less intermediate term pain, and better C2-C7 ROM recovery. ACCF hybrid 1-level C-ADR may be a suitable choice for the management of 3-level CSM in appropriate patients.	3.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Participants were 266 students (ages 10-18), all referred for emotional, social, and behavioral difficulties; of these, 123 were identified with LD and 143 were not. There were 40 groups in all--20 with LD children and 20 with NLD. Outcome variables included adjustment, social competence, and academic achievements. Process variables included bonding, group functioning, and client behavior. Analyses were nested using mixed models. Results indicated no differences in outcomes or process variables between populations except for academic achievements; some between-group differences were found in the effect of processes on outcomes. It was concluded that children with LD may be successfully treated in expressive-supportive counseling groups for their emotional and social difficulties.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

A single center experience.,"Information about extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (EPSCC) is limited and the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is unknown.	Disease presentation and outcome of all EPSCC at our hospital between 1990 and 2009 were retrospectively analyzed.	Of 30 EPSCC, the male:female ratio was 58%:42%; 83% had a performance status of 0-2. Median age was 71 years (32-80). Seventeen (57%) had limited stage (LS), 13 (43%) extensive stage (ES). The location of the primary tumor was gastrointestinal (n = 8), unknown (6), gynecological (6), urogenital (5), and ear nose throat (5). Four (13%) developed brain metastases (2 ES, 2 LS). In ES, first line chemotherapy (CT) was given in 85%, mostly platinum-etoposide (64%). Response rate was 90%. In LS, CT and radiotherapy (RT) ± resection resulted in persistent remissions in 67% of patients. Median survival was 16 months (1-107 months), 18 months (1-107 months), and 9 months (0.4-25 months) for LS + ES, LS, and ES, respectively. Weight loss ≥5 % and ECOG performance status 3 + 4 were associated with poorer survival (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively).	The incidence of brain metastases was relatively low (13%). More studies are necessary, before routinely offering PCI to patients with EPSCC. Best survival outcomes in LS were achieved with multimodality treatment including CT and RT.

804,31778847,Addictive behaviors,Voices of hope: A feasibility study of telephone recovery support.,"Substance use disorders (SUDs) are chronic disorders frequently managed with crisis stabilization or short-term treatment. To improve rates of sustained remission from SUD, there is a need to shift the existing treatment paradigm away from an acute care model and toward a model of ongoing recovery management. Telephone recovery support (TRS) is a promising recovery management tool, consisting of weekly calls from volunteers, including peer workers, to people in recovery to offer support and connect participants with resources. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of a TRS program in Central Kentucky, United States.	Participants (n = 506) were recruited for the program from a variety of settings, such as sober living/halfway houses, drug court, residential treatment transitional living, and outpatient and intensive outpatient treatment. For each call, participant status (e.g., experiencing psychosocial stressors, concerned about relapse) was recorded. To assess acceptability, we performed semi-structured interviews with participants (n = 7), which were subsequently transcribed and analyzed via content analysis.	Volunteers completed 35.7% of calls (a completed call was defined as either answered or returned) with 88% of participants reporting being okay, 9% reporting psychosocial stressors, and 3% reporting relapse or concerns about relapse. Participants reported that TRS provided a felt sense of support and consistent recovery engagement, and appreciated that volunteers took the initiative to reach out to them. Multiple participants reported a desire to increase the frequency of TRS contact.	TRS holds promise as a resource to promote long-term recovery support. More research is needed to determine the efficacy and adequate dosing of TRS calls.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Five males with tetraplegia (TP) and four males with paraplegia (PR) exercised 1) sitting, 2) supine, and 3) sitting with the addition of a) an anti-gravity suit (anti-G), b) elastic stockings and abdominal binder, and c) functional electrical stimulation of the leg muscles. Compared to sitting, the following significant changes were observed: in the supine position, heart rate (HR) decreased (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 76 vs 92 b/min) and stroke volume (SV) increased (PR: 132 vs 116 ml, TP: 96 vs 83 ml). The anti-G suit induced a decrease in heart rate (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 87 vs 92 b/min) and a decrease in oxygen uptake (VO2) in PR. Stockings only affected TP, i.e. a decrease in heart rate with 5 b/min and an increase in stroke volume with 13 ml/beat. Functional electrical stimulation produced an increase in VO2 (PR: 1.00 vs 0.95 l/min, TP: 0.68 vs 0.53 l/min) and a rise in stroke volume in TP. Results indicate that the methods employed to support the circulatory redistribution have different working mechanisms and, in addition, that the effects are different for TP and PR probably because of differences in active muscle mass, sympathetic impairment and blood pressure values.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
806,21156345,Epilepsy research,Epilepsy surgery in children under 3 years.,"Resective epilepsy surgery in early childhood has become an important treatment option for selected infants and children with epilepsy. We describe experience and clinical outcomes of children under 3 years undergoing epilepsy surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH).	All children under 36 months of age who had resective surgery for the purpose of treating epilepsy within the GOSH epilepsy surgery programme were ascertained using a departmental database. Aetiology, post-operative seizure frequency, pre and post-operative cognitive function, long-term complications and re-operation rates were analysed by retrospective examination of clinical records.	Forty-two children were included in our cohort with a median age at surgery of 20 months (range 3-36 months). Surgical procedures comprised 25 functional hemispherectomies, two anatomical hemispherectomies, four multilobar resections, seven lobar resections and four focal resections. 7/42 (17%, 95% CI 8-31%) children underwent re-operation. 20/42 (48%, 95% CI 33-62%) children achieved seizure freedom. 18/42 (43%, 95% CI 29-58) demonstrated an improvement in seizure frequency and no children had an increase in seizure frequency. Post-operative complications included subsequent shunt procedure in 5/25 (20%, 95% CI 9-39%) children undergoing hemispherectomy. There were no mortalities. In 23 children pre- and post-operative DQ or IQ was determinable allowing longitudinal comparison. Five children had a decrease in DQ/IQ >15 and two children had an increase DQ/IQ >15.

EVT records in 2010-2019 were screened. Exclusion criteria included the occurrence of immediate post-procedural intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). Hyperdense areas on iodine overlay maps were scored according to the Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS), thus forming a CE-ASPECTS. Maximum parenchymal iodine concentration and maximum iodine concentration relative to the torcula were recorded. Follow-up imaging was reviewed for ICH. The primary outcome measure was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days.	Out of 651 records, 402 patients were included. CE was found in 318 patients (79%). Thirty-five patients developed ICH on follow-up imaging. Fourteen ICHs were symptomatic. Stroke progression occurred in 59 patients. Multivariable regression showed a significant association between decreasing CE-ASPECTS and the mRS at 90 days (adjusted (a)cOR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.18), NIHSS at 24-48 h (aβ: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.29-0.84), stroke progression (aOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.26) and ICH (aOR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06-1.39), but not symptomatic ICH (aOR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.95-1.38). Iodine concentration was significantly associated with the mRS (acOR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.06-1.32), NIHSS (aβ: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.30-1.06), ICH (aOR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.81) and symptomatic ICH (aOR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38), but not stroke progression (aOR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.86-1.15). Results of the analyses with relative iodine concentration were similar and did not improve prediction.	CE-ASPECTS and iodine concentration are both associated with short- and long-term stroke outcomes.

A technical description and initial results.,"This study aimed to propose an alternative treatment for carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) using the balloon-assisted sinus coiling (BASC) technique and to describe this procedure in detail. Under general anesthesia, we performed the BASC procedure to treat five patients with traumatic CCF. Percutaneous access was obtained via the right femoral artery, and a 7F sheath was inserted, or alternatively, a bifemoral 6F approach was accomplished. A microcatheter was inserted into the cavernous sinus over a 0.014-inch microwire through the fistulous point; the microcatheter was placed distal from the fistula point, and a 'U-turn' maneuver was performed. Through the same carotid access, a compliant balloon was advanced to cross the point of the fistula and cover the whole carotid tear. Large coils were inserted using the microcatheter in the cavernous sinus. Coils filled the adjacent cavernous sinus, respecting the balloon. Immediate complete angiographic resolution was achieved, and an early angiographic control (mean = 2.6 months) indicated complete stability without recanalization. The clinical follow-up has been uneventful without any recurrence (mean = 15.2 months). An endovascular approach is optimal for direct CCF. Because the detachable balloon has been withdrawn from the market, covered stenting requires antiplatelet therapy and its patency is unconfirmed, but cavernous sinus coiling remains an excellent treatment option. Currently, there is no detailed description of the BASC procedure. We provide detailed angiograms with suitable descriptions of the exact fistula point, and venous drainage pathways. Familiarity with these devices makes this technique effective, easy and safe.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
809,33689536,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",Survival impact of incidental subventricular zone irradiation in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.,"The subventricular zone (SVZ) is an important niche for neural stem cells but probably also for brain tumor propagating cells, including the glioblastoma stem cell. The SVZ may become a target for radiation therapy in glioblastoma patients. However, reports studying the effect of irradiation of the SVZ on glioblastoma patient survival show conflicting results. We studied the correlation between incidental SVZ radiation dose and survival in a cohort of isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDHwt) glioblastoma patients with inclusion of important survival prognosticators.	In this retrospective analysis, only adult patients with supratentorial IDHwt glioblastoma were included who were treated with temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy after surgery. The SVZ was contoured on the radiotherapy planning imaging. Cox proportional regression overall survival (OS) analysis was used to study the correlation between SVZ dose and survival. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score, extent of resection and O[6]-methylguanine-methyl-DNA-transferase gene promoter (MGMTp) methylation were used as covariates in multivariate analysis.	In total, 137 patients were included. Median OS was 13.3 months. The MGMTp methylation was present in 40% of cases. Ipsilateral SVZ (iSVZ) mean dose was 44.4 Gy and 27.2 Gy for the contralateral SVZ (cSVZ). Univariate survival analysis showed an inverse relationship between cSVZ mean dose and OS (HR 1.029 (1.003-1.057); p= .032). However, there was no correlation between cSVZ mean dose and OS in multivariate analysis. iSVZ dose did not correlate with survival.	In this cohort of 137 IDHwt glioblastoma patients, iSVZ did not correlate with OS. Higher cSVZ dose was inversely correlated with OS in univariate survival analysis but lost its significance in multivariate analysis, including MGMTp-methylation. Hence, the correlation between SVZ radiation and glioblastoma patient survival remains unclear. Carefully designed prospective studies are needed to provide unequivocal results on this controversial topic.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Supplement,Some factors relating to intelligence in treated children with spina bifida cystica.,"The 83 survivors of a consecutive series of children with spina bifida cystica, born between 1963 and 1971 and treated non-selectively since birth, were assessed by intelligence and developmental testing. In nine of the children who had not required shunts the distribution of intelligence was within the normal range. The need for a shunt was significantly related to the presence of craniolacunae and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Seven of the 74 shunt-treated children had suffered ventriculitis, meningitis or septicaemia, and their intelligence was significantly worse than the others. In the 67 shunt-treated children who had not suffered infection, intelligence was significantly related to the thickness of the pallium when the shunt was inserted during the first four weeks of life, and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Intelligence was not related to the function of the shunt at time of assessment, to the number of revisions of the shunt, or to the rate of increase in head size during the first four weeks of life. It is concluded that the best indication of later intelligence can be gained at birth from the thickness of the pallium and the sensory level of the lesion.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Most studies have focused on anterior circulation strokes; therefore, little is known regarding the optimal anesthesia type for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes.	To compare clinical and angiographic outcomes between monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and general anesthesia (GA) in patients presenting with vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes.	Retrospective, matched, case-control study of consecutive vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes treated with endovascular therapy at 2 academic institutions. The study took place between September 2005 and September 2015 at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and between September 2010 and September 2015 at the Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia. Patients requiring emergent intubation prior to endovascular therapy were excluded. The remaining patients were categorized into (1) MAC and (2) elective intubation for the procedure (elective GA). Patients who converted from MAC to GA during the procedure were included in the MAC group. The 2 groups were matched for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and glucose levels. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared.	The primary outcome measure was the shift in the degree of disability among the 2 groups as measured by the modified Rankin scale at 90 days.	A total of 215 patients underwent endovascular therapy for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes during the study period. Thirty-nine patients were excluded owing to emergent pre-endovascular therapy intubation. Sixty-three patients had MAC (36%) and 113 patients had GA (64%). The conversion rate from MAC to GA was 13% (n = 8). After matching, 61 pairs of patients (n = 122) underwent primary analysis. The 2 groups were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. Median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 60-75 years) in the MAC group vs 67 years (interquartile range, 55.5-78.5 years) in the GA group (P = .83). Fifty-four percent of the patients in the MAC group were men vs 41% in the GA group (P = .44). When compared with the elective GA group, patients who underwent the procedure with MAC had similar rates of successful reperfusion, good clinical outcomes, hemorrhagic complications, and mortality. The modality of anesthesia was not associated with any significant changes in the modified Rankin scale score distribution (MAC: OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.80-2.90; P = .19).	In endovascular therapy for acute posterior circulation stroke, MAC is feasible and appears to be as safe and effective as GA. Future clinical trials are warranted to confirm our findings.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
814,25226962,Bio-medical materials and engineering,Pilot study of vibration stimulation on neurological rehabilitation.,"Robot-assisted therapy has been proved effective for dyskinesia, and has many unique advantages compared with traditional treatment, such as repeatability, accuracy, objectivity. But some studies show that the effect of the robot-assisted rehabilitation for improving patients' activities of daily life (ADLs) is not obvious. This study introduces a novel auxiliary method-vibration stimulation combined with robots which may improve patients' ADLs. In controlled trials, two kinds of feedback-vibration and visual feedback are applied to prompt subjects for rehabilitation, and electromyographic signals (EMGs) and motion parameters are recorded in real time. Experimental results show that subjects' EMGs using vibration feedback are similar to healthy people, and characteristics of motion are closer to the theoretical value compared with control group. Vibration stimulation may serve as a kind of efficient auxiliary means to improve the efficiency of neurological rehabilitation.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
815,24673616,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,Role of sleep apnea and continuous positive airway pressure therapy in the incidence of stroke or coronary heart disease in women.,"It is unknown whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be a risk factor for incident cardiovascular events in women.	We sought to investigate whether OSA increases the incidence of a composite of stroke or coronary heart disease (CHD) in women, and the role of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on this association.	This was a prospective, observational study conducted in two Spanish teaching hospitals between 1998 and 2007. Consecutive women referred for suspected OSA and free of previous stroke and CHD were analyzed. Women with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) less than 10 comprised the control group, and those with an AHI greater than or equal to 10 were diagnosed with OSA and classified as CPAP-treated (adherence ≥ 4 h/d) or untreated (adherence < 4 h/d or not prescribed). The follow-up ended in December 2010.	A total of 967 women were studied (median follow-up, 6.8 yr; interquartile range, 5.2-8.2). The untreated OSA group showed a greater incidence rate of the composite outcome than the control group (2.19 vs. 0.54 per 100 person-years; P < 0.0005). Compared with the control group, the fully adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome incidence were 2.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-5.62) for the untreated OSA group, and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.43-1.95) for the CPAP-treated group. When the type of cardiovascular event was separately assessed, untreated OSA showed a stronger association with incident stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.44; 95% CI, 1.46-28.3) than with CHD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 0.76-4.09).	In women, untreated OSA is associated with increased incidence of serious cardiovascular outcomes, particularly incident stroke. Adequate CPAP treatment seems to reduce this risk.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
816,33054545,Journal of neurotrauma,Predicting the Individual Treatment Effect of Neurosurgery for Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury in the Low-Resource Setting: A Machine Learning Approach in Uganda.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In these low-resource settings, effective triage of patients with TBI-including the decision of whether or not to perform neurosurgery-is critical in optimizing patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. Machine learning may allow for effective predictions of patient outcomes both with and without surgery. Data from patients with TBI was collected prospectively at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, from 2016 to 2019. One linear and six non-linear machine learning models were designed to predict good versus poor outcome near hospital discharge and internally validated using nested five-fold cross-validation. The 13 predictors included clinical variables easily acquired on admission and whether or not the patient received surgery. Using an elastic-net regularized logistic regression model (GLMnet), with predictions calibrated using Platt scaling, the probability of poor outcome was calculated for each patient both with and without surgery (with the difference quantifying the 'individual treatment effect,' ITE). Relative ITE represents the percent reduction in chance of poor outcome, equaling this ITE divided by the probability of poor outcome with no surgery. Ultimately, 1766 patients were included. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) ranged from 83.1% (single C5.0 ruleset) to 88.5% (random forest), with the GLMnet at 87.5%. The two variables promoting good outcomes in the GLMnet model were high Glasgow Coma Scale score and receiving surgery. For the subgroup not receiving surgery, the median relative ITE was 42.9% (interquartile range [IQR], 32.7% to 53.5%); similarly, in those receiving surgery, it was 43.2% (IQR, 32.9% to 54.3%). We provide the first machine learning-based model to predict TBI outcomes with and without surgery in LMICs, thus enabling more effective surgical decision making in the resource-limited setting. Predicted ITE similarity between surgical and non-surgical groups suggests that, currently, patients are not being chosen optimally for neurosurgical intervention. Our clinical decision aid has the potential to improve outcomes.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Fifteen boys ranging between 5 and 15 years old consulted our clinics for nocturnal and diurnal enuresis which had not been improved by medication and behavioral therapy. Among them, voiding cystography revealed bulbar narrowing (Cobb's Collar) in 10 cases and vesico-ureteral reflux was found in four cases (seven ureters). Endoscopically, this lesion was recognized as a ring-form stenosis just distal to the urethral sphincter. It was incised with infantile urethrotome.	Vesico-ureteral reflux was resolved in four ureters and improved in one. In all cases, daytime enuresis resolved dramatically and night enuresis became controllable.	Boys who suffer from diurnal enuresis should immediately be explored for the existence of congenital urethral stenosis.

Pre-post nonrandomized controlled trial.	Rehabilitation center and gait laboratory of a university hospital.	Community-dwelling ambulatory volunteers (N=22) with chronic hemiparesis caused by a unilateral stroke.	Study subjects participated in a gait training program using either a below-knee prosthesis or a treadmill. Treadmill gait training was performed at a speed approximating the maximum gait velocity for each patient. The 3-week program consisted of a 5-minute gait training session 2 to 3 times a day.	The ground reaction forces, stance time, step length and cadence during walking at a comfortable speed, and maximum gait speed, as well as the Berg Balance Score, were estimated before and after each training program.	In comparison with changes after the treadmill gait training, analyses of covariance demonstrated a significant increase of the fore-aft ground reaction forces during the paretic propulsion phase and a significant increase in the relative durations of the paretic and nonparetic single stance involved in a gait cycle after the prosthetic gait training (P<.05).	Prosthetic gait training would have different effects on a hemiparetic gait than treadmill gait training. The gait-related task inducing the dominant use of the paretic leg to support the body may be useful as a rehabilitative treatment to improve the kinetic abilities in the paretic stance period.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Between April 1994 and August 2000, 450 patients (270 men; mean age 70.2 years, range 27-89) had stents implanted to treat 472 cervical carotid artery stenoses. Over half (257, 57%) of the patients were symptomatic. A variety of stents were implanted percutaneously after predilation of the lesion; a third of the patients received glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa inhibitors intraprocedurally in addition to a standard oral antiplatelet regimen (aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel). Occurrence and management of neurological complications within the 30-day periprocedural period were reviewed.	There were 14 (3.1%) transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), 10 (2.2%) minor strokes, and 3 (0.7%) major strokes. Among 6 (1.3%) procedure-related deaths, 4 had neurological causes. The total stroke and death rate was 4.2% (n = 19). All the TIAs, 4 of which occurred between 1 and 14 days poststenting, were treated medically, as were the minor strokes, 3 of which occurred >24 hours after stenting. Only 2 minor stroke patients had mild residual upper extremity motor deficits. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy was administered in 5 cases (2 major strokes survivors and 3 patients who suffered a neurologically-related death); occlusions were identified in the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 3 and the distal MCA in 2. Angiographic improvement was noted in 4 (80%), but only the 2 (40%) with distal MCA occlusions did well clinically.	Neurological complications following carotid artery stenting are inevitable. The occurrence of minor strokes >24 hours following stenting may indicate a possible late embolic phenomenon, which warrants investigation. Likewise, the marginal efficacy of intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy demonstrates an inability to lyse embolic plaque and underscores the need for effective distal protection.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Although systemic and local factors in combination with genetic abnormality have been considered in its etiopathogenesis, OPLL remains a poorly understood pathology. Surgical management of OPLL and the choice of the most appropriate treatment are still controversial issues. Here the authors report a series of OPLL-affected patients treated by 'only-fixation' technique.	Between June 2012 and June 2019, 52 patients having OPLL were treated by a surgical strategy involving only spinal fixation without any form of bone or soft tissue decompression. Facetal fixation for both the atlantoaxial and subaxial spine formed the basis of the surgical treatment. Clinical parameters, analysis of video recordings before and after surgery, and patient self-assessment were included in the analysis of outcome.	During the mean follow-up period there was an immediate postoperative and progressive recovery in symptoms in 51 patients. Of 14 patients who were wheelchair bound before surgery, 12 walked independently on follow-up assessment of 6 months. All patients had successful arthrodesis in the surgically treated segments. There were no infective- or implant-related complications.	Decision making in the surgical management of cervical OPLL is still controversial. The concept of spinal instability has been shown to be a nodal point in the pathogenesis of OPLL, and 'only-spinal fixation' can be considered a rationale for an appropriate surgical treatment.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

A multiple baseline design was used with 4 chronic insomniac subjects, ages 59, 65, 65, and 72. Sleep diaries and an objective behavioral measure of sleep were used to monitor improvement. Results revealed clinically significant reductions in time awake after sleep onset in 3 subjects, coincident with the initiation of treatment. These improvements were maintained at 2- and 6-month follow-ups. The 4th subject showed little improvement; however, a polysomnogram conducted on this subject at the end of the study revealed a fragmented sleep pattern secondary to periodic movements of sleep (nocturnal myoclonus).

How patients talk about change is an alternative measure of motivation, with potential value in predicting treatment outcome. This study had two aims: (1) to examine if change talk and sustain talk (including its subcategories) predicted reduction in worry levels at post-treatment and 2-year follow-up, and (2) if there were differences between the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and metacognitive therapy (MCT) conditions with respect to change talk.	This study investigated 24 patients receiving CBT and 27 patients receiving MCT for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and coded patients' utterances in sessions 1 and 4.	Change talk was significantly associated with lower worry levels at post-treatment and 2-year follow-up, beyond initial worry severity and treatment condition. Change talk in session 4, and reduction in sustain talk from session 1 to 4, was positively associated with improvement, whilst sustain talk in session 4 showed a negative relationship. More specifically, commitment statements in session 1 and expressing signs of taking steps at session 4 were associated with reduction in worry levels. Moreover, patients in the MCT condition argued more both for and against change during session 1, but not session 4.	The sample size was relatively small.

We examined whether negative age stereotypes, which older individuals tend to assimilate from the environment across their lifespan, contributed to an increased risk of developing four psychiatric conditions, and, if so, whether this risk was reduced through active coping.	The sample consisted of participants aged 55 years and older, free of the psychiatric conditions at baseline, drawn from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative sample. New cases of posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder were assessed during three waves spanning a four-year period.	As predicted, participants holding more-negative age stereotypes were more likely to develop the psychiatric conditions, and their engagement in active coping reduced the risk of their developing these conditions.	Our findings suggest that prevention and treatment efforts designed to reduce psychiatric conditions in later life may benefit from bolstering active coping as well as positive age stereotypes.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Several types of stem cells have been investigated to ensure the safety and efficacy in clinical trials.Cryopreserved umbilical cord blood (UCB) mononuclear cells (MNCs) obtained from healthy donors have a more stabilized quality, thereby ensuring a successful therapy. A phase I study was conducted on patients aged 45-80 years who sustained acute ischemic stroke. An UCB unit was obtained from a public cord blood bank based on ABO/Rh blood type, HLA matching score (6/6), and cell dose (total MNC count of 0.5-5 × 10[7] cells/kg). In addition, to facilitate blood brain barrier penetration of UCB, 4 doses of 100 mL mannitol was administered intravenously after 30 min after UCB transplantation and every 4 h thereafter. The primary outcomes were the number of disease (GVHD) within 100 days after transfusion. The secondary outcomes were changes in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel index, and Berg Balance Scale scores. A 46-year-old male patient with identical ABO/Rh blood type, HLA matching score of 6/6, and MNC count of 2.63 × 10[8] cells/kg was enrolled.

This study must use an objective method to reliably estimate hemodynamic brain ischemia. We devised a method of objectively classifying the severity of hemodynamic ischemia using quantitatively analytical and display software, stereotactic extraction estimation for stereotactic brain coordinates and three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP). We analyzed data from 16 patients registered in the JET study. Our method offers quantitative information and 3-dimensional displays of the CBF at rest and after Diamox challenge, vascular reserve and the severity of the hemodynamic brain ischemia. We compared the maximal projection counts with ROI data from tomographic images in the anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane. The maximal counts data correlated closely with the ROI data of rest and with Diamox SPECT images (both p < 0.0001). The slopes of the linear regression line were 1.15 and 1.12, respectively. The results of this study indicated that our method could simply and objectively evaluate the severity of impaired brain circulation.

Aneurysm excision, ligation, and radical debridement along with revascularization by axial reanastomosis were performed for all patients except one with chronic degenerative fusiform aneurysm, who received aneurysm resection and interposition reverse saphenous vein graft. Upper limb arterial flow was evaluated clinically and with hand-held Doppler in the perioperative period and during subsequent follow-up. During the study period, nine consecutive patients presented with cubital fossa swelling following deliberate drug arterial injections. Two of them suffered from thromboembolic complications and were managed conservatively by heparinization. Seven patients (six male, one female), aged 32-53, were confirmed to have brachial artery pseudoaneurysms by duplex scan and recruited for data analysis. Pseudoaneurysms ranged 10-40 mm in size. One ex-heroin abuser, who presented with median nerve palsy, underwent aneurysm resection and reversed saphenous vein interposition. The other six patients presented with painful pulsatile cubital fossa swellings. They underwent aneurysm resection, extensive debridement, and primary axial reanastomosis. There were no perioperative procedure-related complications. With an average follow-up of 38.7 months, no recurrences or neurovascular complications were detected.

The potential value of TADs during the process of alliance rupture and resolution has not yet been documented. We selected patients (n = 17) undertaking a short-term dynamic psychotherapy in which the therapeutic alliance, measured with the Helping Alliance Questionnaire and monitored after each session, showed a pattern of rupture and resolution. Two control sessions (5 and 15) were also selected. Presence of TADs was examined in each therapist interpretation. Compared with control sessions, rupture sessions were characterized by fewer TADs and especially fewer TADs addressing specifically intermediate-essentially neurotic-defenses. Resolution sessions were characterized by more TADs addressing specifically intermediate defenses.

The aim of this study was to investigate urinary incontinence (UI) and sexual dysfunction (SD) two years after treatment for localized prostate cancer (PC).	This study followed all cases of localized PC diagnosed between 2008 and 2009 in men aged≤65years old and still alive two years after treatment. In total, 437 men were recruited. Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and by cross-checking with data from the cancer registry. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed to evaluate persisting UI and SD at 2years.	At two years after treatment, UI was persistent in 48.8%; 41.2% had used urinary protections, and 39.2% had used at least 1 pad/day; 55.2% reported financial difficulties for purchasing protective pads. In total, 22.7% did not consult a specialist for UI. SD was persistent in 82.8%; 30.4% did not consult a specialist for SD. SD had a negative impact on the sex life of patients and their partners. After adjustment for cancer stage, prostatectomy was significantly associated with persisting UI and SD at two years.	Two years after treatment, rates of persisting UI and/or SD remain high. Treatment by prostatectomy was significantly associated with an increased risk of persisting adverse effects at two years. The different toxicities between treatments should be presented to patients before initiating therapy in order to encourage the patient to contributed to shared treatment decision-making.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
839,36482852,Turkish neurosurgery,Comparative Analysis of Clipping and Endovascular Therapy Outcomes in the Treatment of Ruptured Distal Anterior Cerebral Artery Aneurysms.,"To compare the outcomes of distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) aneurysm treatment using endovascular therapy (EVT) and surgical clipping, and to assess their risk factors.	We retrospectively sampled and analyzed 31 patients treated for ruptured Distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) aneurysms from a larger sample of 250 patients treated for ruptured aneurysms between July 2018 and July 2021. The outcomes of patients who underwent clipping and EVT were compared using chi-square tests. T-tests were used for univariate analysis and a logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors affecting outcomes.	Of the 31 patients, 20 were treated with clipping and 11 with EVT. Patients treated with EVT had a mean age of 35.45 ± 6.66. The mean age of the clipping group was 44.4 ± 6.94 years (p=0.002). Intraoperative rupture was significantly more common in the clipping group (p=0.025). There were no significant differences in the postoperative incidence of vasospasm or hydrocephalus (p=0.12). Modified Rankin Scale scores (p=0.017) and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores (p=0.02) both at discharge and 6-month follow-ups were significantly better in the EVT group than in the clipping group. Length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was 9.27 ± 2.6 days following EVT and 23.60 ± 6.29 following clipping (p=0.001). Age (p=0.0136), Hunt and Hess grade (p=0.02), and the occurrence of intraprocedural rupture (p=0.009) were found to significantly affect outcomes.	The outcomes of EVT were better than those for clipping and required a shorter stay in the ICU and the hospital. This may be partially attributable to the dual-trained neurovascular surgeon who performed the procedures. Older age, poorer Hunt and Hess grades, and intraoperative aneurysm rupture adversely affected outcomes.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

We evaluated the impact of supportive housing on SUD-related ED visits and hospitalizations among active substance users experiencing chronic homelessness.	We matched 1558 homeless adults eligible for a New York City supportive housing program who had a SUD (2007-2012) to Medicaid claims data. We examined SUD-related hospitalizations and ED visits 2 years posteligibility. We calculated stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights using baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and used doubly robust estimators to compare rates between persons placed into supportive housing and those eligible but not placed. We also examined outpatient SUD treatment.	Placed persons were hospitalized and visited EDs for substance use at significantly lower rates than persons not placed into housing (adjusted rate ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.88 and adjusted rate ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.68, respectively) 2 years posteligibility.

A total of 14 patients with pituitary adenomas were enrolled in this neurocognitive study. Nine patients had Cushing disease, and five had nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Five patients underwent GKRS for their pituitary adenomas. Other treatment modalities included transsphenoidal resection and conservative management. Comparisons were made between treatment groups and between those with Cushing disease versus those with a nonfunctioning adenoma by the use of psychometric tests of general intellectual functioning, memory, and current mood state. These tests were the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised, Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, Wechsler Memory Scale-third edition, selected subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-third edition, and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System.	When analyzed collectively, the patient group showed deficits in immediate memory (t=-2.70, P=0.02) and high levels of psychological distress (46% of patients) in the presence of intact general intellectual functioning. No neurocognitive differences were found between the GKRS treated group versus participants not treated with GKRS (t≤0.70, P≥0.39). Similarly, no appreciable neurocognitive differences were demonstrated between those with nonfunctioning adenomas as compared with those with Cushing disease (t≤1.56, P≥0.15).	We found no evidence that GKRS impairs the neurocognitive functioning of patients with pituitary disease above any impairment caused by the disease itself.

Optical Express, London, United Kingdom.	Retrospective case series.	The study analyzed data from 5 years of follow-up of amblyopic eyes that were implanted with iris-fixated pIOLs and had a preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 6/15 or worse. Visual acuity, refraction, endothelial cell count, and complications were assessed.	Data for 103 eyes were analyzed as 2 groups. Group 1 comprised 82 eyes with myopia or myopic astigmatism, and Group 2 contained 21 eyes with hyperopia or hyperopic astigmatism. The mean preoperative sphere in Group 1 was -13.42 diopters (D) ± 5.62 (SD) with a mean cylinder of -2.35 ± 1.75 D. In Group 2, the mean sphere and cylinder were +6.77 ± 1.91 D and -2.63 ± 2.43 D, respectively. The mean CDVA improved from 0.51 ± 0.15 logMAR to 0.34 ± 0.16 logMAR (P<.001) in Group 1 and from 0.54 ± 0.17 logMAR to 0.46 ± 0.14 logMAR in Group 2 (P<.005). The safety index was 1.48 in Group 1 and 1.19 in Group 2. The efficacy index was 1.21 in Group 1 and 1.00 in Group 2. The mean gain in CDVA was statistically significantly greater in Group 1 (0.17 ± 0.14 logMAR) than in Group 2 (0.08 ± 0.11 logMAR). Two or more lines of CDVA were gained by 48.8% of eyes in Group 1 and by 19.0% of eyes in Group 2.

Treatment strategies, survival, patterns of failure, and prognostic factors for patients with EPSCC were analyzed retrospectively at a large cancer center. SCLC was excluded by thoracic computed tomography (75%) or chest radiography (25%).	Of 120 eligible patients, 70% had limited disease (LD). Treatment modalities included chemotherapy (n = 82; 68%), radiotherapy (RT) (n = 80; 67%), and surgery (n = 41, 34%). The median survival for patients with LD and extensive disease was 1.4 years and 0.7 years, respectively. Gynecologic (n = 31) and gastrointestinal (n = 28) were the most common primary tumor sites. Gynecologic and head and neck primary tumor sites had better 1-year survival than other sites (P = .019 and 0.005, respectively). Brain metastasis was the site of first distant failure in 4.1% of patients versus 35% for soft tissue metastases. The lifetime risk of brain metastasis was 13%. Definitive RT (P = .004), LD (P = .028), and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) (P = .022) were found to be positive prognostic factors and weight loss (P < .001) was a negative prognostic factor on multivariate analysis.	Patients with EPSCC usually experienced short survival, often with early distant metastasis. Although PCI was associated with improved overall survival, brain metastasis was less frequent than in patients with SCLC, and therefore the potential benefit of PCI was less than in patients with SCLC. Definitive chemoradiotherapy was associated with better outcomes and should be delivered whenever feasible.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

We evaluated the outcomes of re-irradiation combined with bevacizumab for patients refractory to bevacizumab.	Between January 2015 and September 2019, patients with progression after bevacizumab treatment were treated with re-irradiation combined with bevacizumab (25 Gy in five fractions).	Fourteen patients [glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type (N = 6), glioblastoma, IDH mutant (N = 4), anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH wild type (N = 1), anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH mutant (N = 1), glioblastoma, not otherwise specified (N = 1) and radiologically diagnosed brainstem glioma (N = 1)] were included in this study. The median survival and progression-free survival times after re-irradiation combined with bevacizumab were 6.1 and 3.8 months, respectively. The 6-month survival and progression-free survival rates were 54.5 and 15.7%, respectively. Patients with a Karnofsky performance status of ≥70 tended to have longer median survival time (9.3 vs. 5.4 months, respectively; P = 0.058) and had a significantly longer median progression-free survival time (4.2 vs. 3.7 months, respectively; P = 0.046) than those with a Karnofsky performance status of <70. Four patients (28.6%) achieved a complete or partial radiological response, and three patients (21.4%) had an improved Karnofsky performance status after re-irradiation combined with bevacizumab. Grade 3/4 toxicities included leukopenia in four patients (28.6%), hypertension in three (21.4%), proteinuria in one (7.1%) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in one (7.1%).	Re-irradiation combined with bevacizumab for patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas who progress after bevacizumab treatment was feasible.

845,11482695,Acta neurochirurgica,Carotid endarterectomy: a new technique replacing internal shunts.,"Carotid endarterectomy has been reported to increase the time free from cerebral ischemic events in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a high grade of stenosis of the internal carotid artery. In cases in whom the compensatory circulation during the carotid clamp time is not sufficient, the use of intraluminal shunts has been proposed. However, the use of intraluminal shunts present several problems, such as the technical difficulties in positioning the shunt, the variability of time requested for the placement, the inconstancy of the blood flow during surgery, and the need to clamp off the carotid to introduce and remove the shunt. For these reasons, most operators prefer not to employ intraluminal shunts, while others do use them only in selected cases. The purpose of this work is to present, for the first time, a new type of temporary extraluminal shunt, connecting the femoral to the internal carotid artery with the interposition of a roller pump to regulate the blood flow. This method allows one to perform carotid endarterectomy without interrupting the blood flow to the brain.	407 consecutive patients, who underwent carotid endarterectomy between August 1992 and April 2000, were considered. 35 patients presented an absolutely insufficient collateral circulation, demonstrated by important modifications of the electroencephalographic monitoring during the carotid clamp time. In these patients the endarterectomy was performed using a new femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt.	In all the cases in whom the femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt was positioned, the normalisation of electroencephalographic monitoring was achieved by regulating the blood flow with the interposed roller pump. The use and the placement of the shunt was simple and easy. None of the patients showed postoperative complications, except for one who had a stroke two days after surgery.	The results obtained, although to be confirmed by further studies, seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of our femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt, which was simple to use and safe.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
846,23909246,Journal of neurosurgery,"Transsylvian hippocampal transection for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: surgical indications, procedure, and postoperative seizure and memory outcomes.","Amygdalohippocampectomy is a well-established, standard surgery for medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). However, in the case of MTLE without hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis, amygdalohippocampectomy is associated with decreased postoperative memory function. Hippocampal transection (HT) has been developed to overcome this problem. In HT the hippocampus is not removed; rather, the longitudinal hippocampal circuits of epileptic activities are disrupted by transection of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus. The present study describes a less invasive modification of HT (transsylvian HT) and presents the seizure and memory outcomes for this procedure.	Thirty-seven patients with MTLE (18 men and 19 women; age range 9-63 years; 19 with surgery on the right side and 18 with surgery on the left side; seizure onset from 3 to 34 years) who were treated with transsylvian HT were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had left-side language dominance, and follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 94 months (median 49 months). Seizure outcomes were evaluated for all patients by using the Engel classification. Memory function was evaluated for 22 patients based on 3 indices (verbal memory, nonverbal memory, and delayed recall), with those scores obtained using the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Patients underwent evaluation of the memory function before and after surgery (6 months-1 year).	Engel Class I (completely seizure free) was achieved in 25 patients (67.6%). Class II and Class III designation was achieved in 10 (27%) and 2 patients (5.4%), respectively. There were differences in memory outcome between the sides of operation. On the right side, verbal memory significantly increased postoperatively (p = 0.003) but nonverbal memory and delayed recall showed no significant change after the operation (p = 0.718 and p = 0.210, respectively). On the left side, all 3 indices (verbal memory, nonverbal memory, and delayed recall) showed no significant change (p = 0.331, p = 0.458, and p = 0.366, respectively).	Favorable seizure outcome and preservation of verbal memory were achieved with transsylvian HT for the treatment of MTLE without hippocampal atrophy or sclerosis.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Due to the complexities of cognition–emotion interactions during ongoing CBT, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, which hinders treatment optimization.	We created a laboratory analogue by combining reappraisal, a key ingredient of cognitive restructuring, with Pavlovian conditioning, a key ingredient in behavioral treatments. The novel differential Pavlovian acquisition and extinction task featured social stimuli as conditioned and unconditioned stimuli under unregulated and reappraisal instructions.	Findings indicated that reappraising the conditioned stimuli attenuated acquisition (Study 1) and facilitated extinction (Study 2) of conditioned negative valence. In Study 3, highly socially anxious individuals showed deficient extinction learning relative to low socially anxious individuals but compensated for this by using reappraisal.	Diagnostic status of participants was not assessed in structured clinical interviews.

848,30760172,Psychological reports,Effects of Psychoeducation and Stress Coping Techniques on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms.,"This study examined the effects of psychoeducation and stress management techniques on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms in Libya. The 41 Libyan patients who volunteered to take part in the study were first assessed using the PTSD Checklist. They attended workshops on PTSD symptoms, stress management techniques, and communication skills on three successive days after which they were asked to answer the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations two weeks after they completed the workshops. Among the 39% of the participants who were diagnosed with PTSD prior to the intervention, 15% met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD after the intervention. The preintervention scores were consistently higher than the postintervention scores, and there were significant differences in the PTSD Checklist total score and the re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptom scores. This study concluded that in mass-trauma events such as war and natural disasters, PTSD education can reduce the PTSD symptoms of those affected. Whether the benefits of psychoeducation on the participants are long term or short term is recommended for further study due to the limitations imposed by the willingness of the participants to participate, the amount of time they are willing to stay with the program, and the duration of the psychoeducation program itself.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

850,18982754,Collegium antropologicum,Influence of the Monitored Youth Mentoring Program for adolescents with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders.,"This aimed to measure the influence of the Monitored Youth Mentoring Program (MYMP) for adolescents with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders. The MYMP commenced in 1997 and was completed in 2003. The model of the program was for one university student of Pedagogy to mentor one pupil between the ages of 13 and 17 years, demonstrating risk seeking behaviours for a whole school year. The specimen group was made up of 141 pupils, approximately 20 pupils from each year level. The short-term goal was to influence positive change in participants demonstrating risk seeking behaviour. The long-term goal was to enhance the respective school's programs to enable preventative approaches to lessen negative and risk seeking behaviours amongst pupils with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders. The research results demonstrate statistically significant success of the applied program in two measured variables. Firstly, learning success (p < 0.05), and secondly a decrease in truancy and disciplinary misdemeanours (p < 0.05). Both of which were observed in participants with behavioural problems. The program was not as successful for participants with behavioural disorders, but not without some effect. Although the program can be generally described as achieving a medium level of success, the fact that there was a lack of progressive worsening in participant's behaviour is a substantial bi-product of the program. The mentors involved in the program made it extremely clear by their feedback that, MYMP positively enhanced their formal Pedagogy training, through hands-on practise that they otherwise would not have received through their academic programs. They were provided with vital exposure to a preventative program and managed to gain insight into the possibilities of introducing early intervention and prevention into Croatian schools.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Therefore, they would benefit from teaching procedures that minimize their difficulties in acquiring these relations. This study compared two teaching procedures, an error prevention procedure and an error correction procedure, for teaching relations between objects and pictures.	Participants were two groups of children with autism, aged between 3 and 7 years. In the context of picture-to-object requesting, one group was taught using an error correction method and the other group with an error prevention method. The measures for each child were accuracy of correspondences between taught picture and object pairs and accuracy of delayed correspondences in learning outcome tests with all combinations of object and picture pairs presented to them throughout the study.	The group receiving the error prevention-based teaching made significantly fewer errors during the teaching phases and in their learning outcome test for correspondences between all combinations of pictures and objects.	The error prevention teaching procedure would seem to provide a more efficient and ecologically valid method than the error correction procedure for teaching relations between objects and their graphic-based referents. Improvements in the methodology were suggested for providing a stronger basis for comparison between error correction and error prevention teaching methods.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The British Columbia Cancer Agency provincial database identified 2268 patients presenting with stage III NSCLC between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2000. Of these, 120 patients received radical CRT, forming the study cohort. Variables analyzed included gender, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, stage, histology, sites of metastasis, and survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.	The study cohort comprised 59 men and 61 women, median age 54.5 years. There were 74 stage IIIA and 46 stage IIIB cases. Histologic subtypes were squamous cell carcinoma (n = 29), adenocarcinoma (n = 53), and other non-squamous histologies (n = 38). Median follow-up time was 17.7 months. Median overall survival time was 19.2 months. Thirty-two patients (27%) developed brain metastasis. Non-brain metastases occurred in 51 patients (42%). No variables were statistically significantly associated with the risk of developing brain metastasis. Trends for higher risks of brain metastasis were observed with younger age (P = 0.09), and poor performance status (P = 0.07). Brain metastasis risk was highest during the first 10 months, progressively declining thereafter.	Stage III NSCLC patients treated with CRT have high risks of brain metastasis which persist during the first 10 months after diagnosis. Studies evaluating cranial prophylaxis will be relevant for these patients, particularly during this early period. Novel systemic therapies continue to be needed because non-brain metastases still represent the majority of distant recurrences.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

This analysis included 165 patients, mean ± SD age of 72.5 ± 6.1 years, with median (IQR) years of education of 13 (12-16), and baseline Modified Mini-Mental Status (3MS) Exam score of 95 (92-98). Prolapse repair type was vaginal for 70% (n=115) and laparoscopic for 30% (n=50) of patients; most under general anesthesia, 151 (92.1%). The incidence of positive delirium screen during the first week after surgery was 12.1% (n=20). Most of these participants screened positive on postoperative day 0, 8.4% (n=14). In univariate analyses, a positive screen was associated with older age and fewer education years, lower 3MS exam score, greater baseline geriatric depression scale score, and greater frailty score. Lower 3MS score was the only variable that remained significant in the final model (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.95).	One in 12 women ≥60 years deemed eligible for discharge on the day of prolapse surgery screens positive for delirium.

Neurological and cognitive functions were examined by several scales, including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Mini-Mental Status Examination. The depressive state was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Depression Scale. The state of clipping was assessed 1 yr and then every few years after the operation by 3-dimensional computed tomography angiography.	Complete neck clipping was confirmed in 62 aneurysms (98.4%). Perioperative complications occurred in 5 patients (5/63; mild frontalis muscle weakness in 3, anosmia in 1, and meningitis in 1). The mean clinical follow-up period was 5.2 ± 2.1 yr.

The patient's intolerance of the analyst's efforts to think (reflect upon and interpret) renders the usual psychoanalytic maneuvers employed to stimulate reflective thought ineffective with such patients. Such patients have to learn to tolerate multiple perspectives before they can allow the analyst, or themselves, to think in the other's presence. The author presents two clinical vignettes that illustrate how the analyst's efforts to think about the patient were experienced by the patient as both intolerably distancing and as rejecting of an aspect of the patient's subjective reality. Working psychoanalytically with such patients requires the analyst to forego the use of narrow interpretations that elucidate unconscious meanings and motives in favor of alternate technical maneuvers capable of facilitating the development of symbolic thinking and reflective thought (insightfulness). These maneuvers include a demonstration of the analyst's willingness and ability to withstand (rather than 'interpret away') how he is being psychically represented by the patient, without becoming destroyed by, or lost within, the patient's characterization of him. Beside modeling a tolerance of alternate perspectives of one's self, other non-interpretive maneuvers that help facilitate the development of self-reflective thought include: stimulating the patient's curiosity about the workings of his own mind by identifying incompletely understood behaviors or reactions worthy of greater psychological understanding, and insinuating doubt about the adequacy of the patient's explanations of such phenomena.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
859,19482236,Journal of substance abuse treatment,How are addicted physicians treated? A national survey of Physician Health Programs.,"Physicians with substance use disorders receive care that is qualitatively different from and reputedly more effective than that offered to the general population, yet there has been no national study of this distinctive approach. To learn more about the national system of Physician Health Programs (PHPs) that manage the care of addicted physicians, we surveyed all 49 state PHP medical directors (86% responded) to characterize their treatment, support, and monitoring regimens.	PHPs do not provide substance abuse treatment. Under authority from state licensing boards, state laws, and contractual agreements, they promote early detection, assessment, evaluation, and referral to abstinence-oriented (usually) residential treatment for 60 to 90 days. This is followed by 12-step-oriented outpatient treatment. Physicians then receive randomly scheduled urine monitoring, with status reports issued to employers, insurers, and state licensing boards for (usually) 5 or more years. Outcomes are very positive, with only 22% of physicians testing positive at any time during the 5 years and 71% still licensed and employed at the 5-year point.	Addicted physicians receive an intensity, duration, and quality of care that is rarely available in most standard addiction treatments: (a) intensive and prolonged residential and outpatient treatment, (b) 5 years of extended support and monitoring with significant consequences, and (c) involvement of family, colleagues, and employers in support and monitoring. Although not available to the general public now, several aspects of this continuing care model could be adapted and used for the general population.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Twenty patients were electively hyperventilated to maintain PaCO2 between 3.5 and 5 kPa. In the other 35 patients mechanical ventilation was instituted only if severe hypoxia or hypercapnia occurred. Cerebral oedema, diagnosed clinically or by a rise in intracranial pressure to greater than 30 mm Hg, occurred in 85% of hyperventilated patients and in 86% of those not so treated. Although there was no significant reduction in the number of episodes of cerebral oedema in the hyperventilated patients (4.8 episodes/24 h) as compared with the controls (5.3 episodes/24 h), hyperventilation did appear to delay the onset of coning but on the basis of these results could not be recommended to be used routinely as a prophylactic measure in the prevention of cerebral oedema in this condition.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

A concomitant effect of multilevel fusion is a restriction of cervical spine mobility. This retrospective study on DCM-patients with at least 4 laminectomy and fusion levels, compares data between objective and subjective restriction of the postoperative cervical spine mobility. The patient-reported restriction of cervical spine mobility was acquired by a five-step score. Measurements of cervical range of motion were performed using the CROM device and were correlated with the subjective scores. Fusion was performed over 6 levels in most of the 36 patients. For the subjective cervical spine mobility, 52.8% reported none to medium, 38.9% severe and 8.3% complete restriction. Mean objective cervical range of motion was 45.0° for flexion-extension, 26.3° for total lateral flexion and 51.4° for total rotation and therefore evidently reduced compared to non-operated patient cohorts in literature. There was a significant medium, negative correlation between the objective measurements and the patient-reported general restriction of cervical spine mobility, and with the physical component summary of SF-8. The significant objective reduction of cervical range of motion after laminectomy and multilevel fusion correlates with the patient-reported assessment for general restriction.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Medical inclusion criteria: patients (M/F) ≥ 18 years ≤ 75 with symptomatic seizures due to primary brain tumors or brain metastases in stable treatment with antiepileptic drugs; previous surgical resection or biopsy; >70 Karnofsky Performance Status; stable oncological disease. Eligible patients recruited from 100 consecutive patients with BTRE at first visit to our Center from 2011 to 2012. All recruited patients were administered battery of neuropsychological tests exploring various cognitive domains. Patients considered to have a neuropsychological deficit were those with at least one test score for a given domain indicative of impairment. Thirty patients out of 100 showed cognitive deficits, and were offered participation in RehabTr, of which 16 accepted (5 low grade glioma, 4 high grade glioma, 2 glioblastoma, 2 meningioma and 3 metastases) and 14 declined for various reasons. The RehabTr consisted of one weekly individual session of 1 h, for a total of 10 weeks, carried out by a trained psychologist. The functions trained were: memory, attention, visuo-spatial functions, language and reasoning by means of Training NeuroPsicologico (TNP(®)) software. To evaluate the effect of the RehabTr, the same battery of tests was administered directly after cognitive rehabilitation (T1), and at six-month follow-up (T2). Statistical analysis with Student T test for paired data showed that short-term verbal memory, episodic memory, fluency and long term visuo-spatial memory improved immediately after the T1 and remained stable at T2. At final follow-up all patients showed an improvement in at least one domain that had been lower than normal at baseline. Our results demonstrated a positive effect of rehabilitative training at different times, and, for these reasons, should encourage future research in this area with large, randomized clinical trials that evaluate the impact of a cognitive rehabilitation in patients with BTRE and cognitive deficits.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Patients undergoing TMVR have a high incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). The co-morbidities which qualify them to undergo TMVR also increase their risk of stroke and bleeding, making stroke prophylaxis problematic.	We conducted a single-center retrospective study, in which the bleeding and stroke risk of all patients undergoing TMVR for degenerative mitral valve disease were reviewed to determine candidacy for a LAAC device for stroke prevention as an alternative to chronic anticoagulation.	AF was present in 122 (62%) of TMVR patients with an average CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3.99. 23% of TMVR patients had a history of prior major bleeding event, predominately gastrointestinal bleed. Fifty-three and 47% of TMVR patients were at high or intermediate risk of bleeding, respectively, according to their HAS-BLED score. 50% of patients undergoing TMVR would qualify for LAAC device based on risk assessments.

866,21046068,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,Experiences of acute mental health care in an ethnically diverse inner city: qualitative interview study.,"Ethnic inequalities in experiences of mental health care persist in the UK, although most evidence derives from in-patient settings. We aimed to explore service users' and carers' accounts of recent episodes of severe mental illness and of the care received in a multi-cultural inner city. We sought to examine factors impacting on these experiences, including whether and how users and carers felt that their experiences were mediated by ethnicity.	Forty service users and thirteen carers were recruited following an acute psychotic episode using typical case sampling. In-depth interviews explored illness and treatment experiences. Ethnicity was allowed to emerge in participants' narratives and was prompted if necessary.	Ethnicity was not perceived to impact significantly on therapeutic relationships, and nor were there ethnic differences in care pathways, or in the roles of families and friends. Ethnic diversity was commonplace among both service users and mental health professionals. This was tolerated in community settings if efforts were made to ensure high-quality care. Home Treatment was rated highly, irrespective of service users' ethnicity. In-patient care was equally unpopular and was the one setting where ethnicity appeared to mediate unsatisfactory care experiences. These findings highlight the risks of generalising from reports of (dis)satisfaction with care based predominantly on in-patient experiences.	Home treatment was popular but hard to deliver in deprived surroundings and placed a strain on carers. Interventions to enhance community treatments in deprived areas are needed, along with remedial interventions to improve therapeutic relationships in hospital settings.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
867,29408857,PloS one,Intra-aneurysmal flow disruption after implantation of the Medina® Embolization Device depends on aneurysm neck coverage.,"Flow disruption achieved by braided intrasaccular implants is a novel treatment strategy for cerebrovascular aneurysms. We hypothesized that the degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption can be quantified in vitro and is influenced by device position across the aneurysm neck. We tested this hypothesis using the Medina® Embolization Device (MED).	Ten different patient-specific elastic vascular models were manufactured. Models were connected to a pulsatile flow circuit, filled with a blood-mimicking fluid and treated by two operators using a single MED. Intra-aneurysmal flow velocity was measured using conventional and high-frequency digital subtraction angiography (HF-DSA) before and after each deployment. Aneurysm neck coverage by the implanted devices was assessed with flat detector computed tomography on a three-point Likert scale.	A total of 80 individual MED deployments were performed by the two operators. The mean intra-aneurysmal flow velocity reduction after MED implantation was 33.6% (27.5-39.7%). No significant differences in neck coverage (p = 0.99) or flow disruption (p = 0.84) were observed between operators. The degree of flow disruption significantly correlated with neck coverage (ρ = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21-0.59, p = 0.002) as well as with neck area (ρ = -0,35, 95% CI: -0.54 --0.13, p = 0.024). On multiple regression analysis, both neck coverage and total neck area were independent predictors of flow disruption.	The degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption after MED implantation can be quantified in vitro and varies considerably between different aneurysms and different device configurations. Optimal device coverage across the aneurysm neck improves flow disruption and may thus contribute to aneurysm occlusion.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Burdenko,[Evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in acromegaly using different remission criteria].,"For a long time, surgical removal of somatotropinoma using the transsphenoidal approach has been the first stage of treatment in most acromegaly patients. For the past decades, the efficacy criteria for surgical treatment of acromegaly have significantly changed, which requires appropriate correction.	We aimed to evaluate the results of transsphenoidal adenomectomy in acromegaly patients using various criteria for disease remission.	The study included patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly who underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic adenomectomy performed by a single neurosurgeon. The surgical treatment outcomes were evaluated 6 months after operative intervention based on levels of IGF-1, OGTT, and GH. The obtained data were analyzed using different threshold values for the level of GH nadir during OGTT: criteria A <2.0 ng/ml, criteria B <1.0 ng/ml, and criteria C <0.4 ng/ml to assess acromegaly remission, along with matching of the IGF-1 level to the reference range for a given gender and age.	The study included 70 patients (52 females and 18 males) with a mean age of 52.2±11.5 years (29 to 73 years). The baseline IGF-1 level exceeded the upper limit of the reference range 3.3±1.4 (1.1-7.3)-fold, on average. The baseline mean basal GH level was 34.2±41.7 (1.2-192.0) ng/ml. The mean pituitary adenoma size was 16.7±8.6 (4.3-46.0) mm; 18 (26%) out of 70 patients had pituitary microadenoma, and 52 (74%) patients had macroadenoma. Six months after surgery, acromegaly remission met criteria A in 47 (67%) patients, criteria B in 28 (40%) patients, and criteria C in 18 (26%) patients.	Our findings demonstrate that evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in treatment of acromegaly patients depends on the criteria chosen for assessing remission. This feature should be considered when comparing outcomes of surgical treatment for acromegaly in different years. Probably, introduction of the 2010 criteria should be accompanied by revision of the previous remission indicators.	Уже давно первым этапом лечения пациентов с акромегалией в подавляющем большинстве случаев является хирургическое удаление соматотропиномы транссфеноидальным доступом.

Цель исследования - оценить результаты транссфеноидальной аденомэктомии у пациентов с акромегалией с использованием различных критериев ремиссии заболевания. Материал и методы. В исследование включили пациентов с впервые выявленной акромегалией, которым была выполнена трансназальная транссфеноидальная эндоскопическая аденомэктомия одним нейрохирургом. Результаты хирургического лечения оценили через 6 мес после оперативного вмешательства путем определения уровня ИФР-1 и ОГТТ с определением ГР. Полученные данные проанализировали, используя различные пороговые значения уровня ГР в ОГТТ: критерии А <2,0 нг/мл, критерии В <1,0 нг/мл, критерии С <0,4 нг/мл для оценки ремиссии акромегалии наряду с соответствием уровня ИФР-1 референсному диапазону для данного пола и возраста. Результаты. В исследование включены 70 пациентов (52 женщины и 18 мужчин), средний возраст которых составил 52,2±11,5 года (от 29 до 73 лет). Исходный уровень ИФР-1 превышал верхнюю границу референсного диапазона в среднем в 3,3±1,4 (1,1-7,3) раза. Исходно средний базальный уровень ГР составил 34,2±41,7 (1,2-192,0) нг/мл. Размер аденомы гипофиза - 16,7±8,6 (4,3-46,0) мм; 18 (26%) из 70 пациентов имели микроаденому гипофиза, 52 (74%) пациента - макроаденому. Через 6 мес после хирургического лечения критериям А ремиссии акромегалии соответствовали 47 (67%) пациентов, критериям В - 28 (40%) пациентов, критериям С - 18 (26%) пациентов. Выводы. Согласно данным нашего исследования, оценка результатов транссфеноидальной аденомэктомии при лечении больных акромегалией зависит от выбранных критериев оценки ремиссии.

Seven patients with refractory chronic cluster headache underwent high spatial and angular resolution diffusion MRI preoperatively. MRI-guided and MRI-verified electrode implantation was performed unilaterally in 5 patients and bilaterally in 2. Volumes of tissue activation were generated around active lead contacts with a finite-element model. Twelve months after surgery, voxel-based morphometry was used to identify voxels associated with higher reduction in headache load. Probabilistic tractography was used to identify the brain connectivity of the activation volumes in responders, defined as patients with a reduction of ≥30% in headache load.	There was no surgical morbidity. Average follow-up was 34 ± 14 months. Patients showed reductions of 76 ± 33% in headache load, 46 ± 41% in attack severity, 58 ± 41% in headache frequency, and 51 ± 46% in attack duration at the last follow-up. Six patients responded to treatment. Greatest reduction in headache load was associated with activation in an area cantered at 6 mm lateral, 2 mm posterior, and 1 mm inferior to the midcommissural point of the third ventricle. Average responders' activation volume lay on the trigeminohypothalamic tract, connecting the trigeminal system and other brainstem nuclei associated with nociception and pain modulation with the hypothalamus, and the prefrontal and mesial temporal areas.

Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) describes the developmental origins and maintenance of a client's problems in both written (reformulation letter) and diagrammatic form (sequential diagrammatic reformulation). This study aimed to investigate the effects of these reformulation tools on insight and symptom change. A small-N repeated measures design was employed with quantitative and qualitative measures collected from six therapist/client dyads. Participating therapists kept a record of their delivery of CAT reformulation tools. Participating clients completed the insight subscale of the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale every fourth session and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-10 every session. Qualitative data from client change interviews regarding their experiences of CAT and attributions of change was explored using template analysis. Participants demonstrated improvements (symptom reduction and insight increases) over the course of the intervention. Administration of reformulation tools did not consistently result in significant changes on insight and symptom measures. However, the tools were identified by participants as leading to insight and emotional change within the context of a good therapeutic relationship. These findings suggest that a genuine therapeutic relationship is an important change mechanism operating through, and strengthened by, CAT-specific tools.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

However, considerably less attention is devoted to the impact of exercise on health outcomes for people experiencing a mental illness. In response to the recognized paucity, a structured exercise program was developed and implemented for residents of a Community Care Unit in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Six residents participated in the program over a period of three months. This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study. A focus group interview was conducted with the resident participants (n=6), the exercise physiologists who developed and implemented the program (n=2), and nursing staff involved in implementing and supporting the program (n=4). Analysis of the data collected revealed that four main themes had emerged: the individual nature of the program, physical improvement, group dynamics, and future plans. The findings of this study suggest that involvement in the program produced very positive outcomes, most notably in the physical fitness of residents. The individual nature of the program which enabled gradual participation, and the cohesive approach of the group as a whole were considered very important factors contributing to the overall success. Furthermore, the participants planned to continue with some form of physical activity in the future. The potential value of regular exercise for patients experiencing a mental illness has significant implications for nursing and requires further research exploration.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

But the impact of intensive rehabilitation on the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of intensive rehabilitation on the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke using data from the National Health Insurance Service database. This is a register-based, retrospective cohort study. Using data from the National Health Insurance Service database, we included the patients who received rehabilitation for stroke from 2006 to 2013. Of the 14,984 patients diagnosed with stroke, 2483 died within 1 year, and 2866 did not receive rehabilitation; hence, they were also excluded. The final sample included 9635 (49.2% men, 50.8% women) patients. After correcting for covariates, the Cox model was used to evaluate the effects of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) on survival. We estimated the independent contribution of each factor to the risk of death from the initiation of rehabilitation. Significant differences in mortality were observed according to age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), income level, and stroke type. Patients with stroke who received both PT and OT had a better long-term prognosis than those who received either treatment alone. Therapy performed by a physical therapist with more than 120 hours of training effectively improved the patients' long-term prognosis. Intensive PT and OT will help improve the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke. This study emphasizes the importance of intensive rehabilitation in these patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

This study explores individuals' experiences of a work-directed rehabilitation, provided by occupational therapists and physiotherapists, aiming to promote work capacity in persons with common mental disorders.	A qualitative content analysis was used, and 11 women and 8 men with depression or anxiety disorder were interviewed. They were 25-66 years old, had different occupations and were working full or part-time.	The participants experienced a process interpreted as Increasing belief in one's capacity through supported reflection and practice. This theme reflects the shifting between 'reflecting' and 'doing' through rehabilitation and the growing hope for change. The increasing belief in one's capacity was developed through three stages, comprised of the categories To be supported by a professional, To realise things about oneself and To try new strategies for change.	Strategies suggested by occupational therapists and physiotherapists have the potential to promote work capacity in people who are working while depressed and anxious. The results may deepen the understanding among rehabilitation professionals about the importance of a person-centred approach to people with common mental disorders, and to combine reflection and practical exercises to support the development of work-related strategies.Implications for rehabilitationWork-directed rehabilitation provided by occupational therapists and/or physiotherapists is beneficial to people with common mental disorders.Rehabilitation professionals should focus on facilitating self-efficacy among people with common mental disorders.An individualised person-centred approach seems important in order to initiate change.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Surgical resection of medullary hemangioblastomas is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. We present a unique institutional experience over a 12-year period.	Between 1987 to 1998, 47 hemangioblastomas were surgically resected and analyzed retrospectively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to 136 months with an average of 35 months.	Thirty-nine single hemangioblastomas were distributed in 3 anatomical areas: pontomedullary, medullary, and cervico-medullary. They were either focal intramedullary or dorsal exophytic. There were cyst formations in 97.4% of the single hemangioblastomas. The major feeding arteries and the tumor blush could be clearly visualized on angiogram, sometimes even on MRA. All medullary hemangioblastomas were radically removed. Postoperatively, 61.5% patients had clinical improvement, two patients' symptoms remained unchanged and 11 patients deteriorated; of the latter, 8 patients improved later with proper therapy, and 2 patients died.	Preoperative diagnosis of medullary hemangioblastoma is possible with MRI. With improved microsurgical technique and better understanding of the vascular pattern of the tumor, total surgical resection can be performed with <5% mortality. The surgical strategy is en bloc excision, as piecemeal resection can lead to uncontrollable hemorrhage. Removal of large solid hemangioblastomas may result in severe postoperative edema and/or hemorrhage in the medulla affecting the respiratory and vagal centers. Preoperative embolization through the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) can be helpful in this situation.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

They averaged 41 +/- 12.06 years and had a BMI of 31.4 +/- 6.35. There were significant differences at baseline between groups for weight, SWN total score and other factors. Stepwise logistic models controlling for baseline covariates yielded an adjusted non-significant association between SfW program participation and response in subjective well-being (SWN increase). However, statistically significant associations were found between program participation and weight-response (weight loss or gain < 1 kg) OR = 2; 95% CI [1.1; 3.7] and between program participation and WC-response (WC decrease or increase < 2 cm) OR = 5; 95% CI [2.4; 10.3]), at 3 months after baseline.	SfW program participation was associated with maintaining or decreasing weight and WC but not with improved subjective well-being as measured with the SWN scale.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The mean duration of drainage for this group was 20.7 days. Although two patients died before shunting was considered, no morbidity or mortality was observed to result from this technique. Seven patients required a shunt after stabilization of their medical problems. Two patients, followed for 24 and 40 months, have not required shunting procedures. External ventricular drainage via a subcutaneously tunneled catheter has been found to be a safe and reliable initial method of treating posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in premature infants.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

A retrospective analysis was performed of 20 patients who underwent laryngotracheal separation (LTS) or the tracheal flap method (TFM) between 2003 and 2012 at Gunma Children's Medical Center.	All patients were bedridden and fed either through a naso-gastric or naso-esophageal tube or via a gastric fistula. Of the 20 participants, 60% underwent surgical treatment before 3 years of age. The incidence of aspiration pneumonia decreased after surgery, and 8 of 10 patients, who were previously hospitalized for a long duration, were discharged. The most frequent complications observed were granulation around the tracheostomy stoma and endotracheal granuloma. Two patients presented with a tracheal fistula.	LTS and TFM can be used as treatment modalities for patients with intractable aspiration along with SMID and NMD.

The present study investigated whether optimism can be increased by imagining a best possible self (BPS). Effects were compared to a control group in which participants imagined their daily activities (DA).	In order to minimize inter-individual differences in content of imagery, participants constructed their BPS according to 3 domains, namely a personal, relational, and professional domain. All participants were instructed to practice their imagery exercise for 5 min per day over a period of two weeks. Effects on optimism and mood were measured after one session, after one week and after two weeks.	Results indicated that BPS imagery led to significantly larger increases in optimism as compared to DA imagery, after one session and over a two week period. Effects on optimism remained after controlling for possible mediation by the change in positive mood.	In order to test the effectiveness of our BPS imagery intervention we relied exclusively on self-report measures.	The present study confirmed that imagining a BPS enhances levels of optimism, independent of the mood effect.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The infections included meningitis (31 patients), brain abscesses (four patients), septicaemia (three patients), pleuro-pneumonia (two patients), septic arthritis and soft tissue phlegmona (three patients). No other antibacterial agents were used except in four patients with brain abscesses, in whom ceftriaxone was combined with ornidazole. The overall bacteriological cure rate was 98%, and sterilisation of the cerebrospinal fluid occurred in 27 of 28 patients (96%) with proven bacterial meningitis. Two patients died, three survived with severe neurological sequelae; one neonate required partial gut resection. A complete clinical cure was achieved in the remaining 37 patients. Only one treatment failure was directly related to the drug therapy. The only side effect noted were sterilisation of the gut with overgrowth of Candida albicans in 35% of neonates and infants, an prolonged fever in 13% of all patients.

Two-hundred-thirty-four patients, who verbally self-reported they were preoperatively fully potent and strongly motivated to maintain postoperative EF, underwent a BNSRRP. A comprehensive medical and sexual history was obtained on hospital admission the day prior to surgery. Subjectively reported potency rate was compared with the scores of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF).	The EF domain of the IIEF showed a baseline normal EF in only 43% of the subjects. In contrast, 13% had a mild erectile dysfunction (ED), 8% had a mild to moderate ED, 8% complained of a moderate ED, and as many as 28% reported severe EF impairment. Interestingly, 38% of the patients with severe ED did not attempt any intercourse during the last 4 weeks prior to surgery.	A significant proportion of patients with clinically localized pCa and self-reported total potency already had suffered from ED preoperatively. Incorrect timing of questionnaires administration, the potential influence of preoperative patient's psychological distress, and the implication of the patient's partner's psychological and sexual health may be contributing factors to the contradictory finding.

We conducted a 3-year retrospective chart audit on the use of our secure room/security guard system at a rural hospital in a town of 3500, located 220 km from our psychiatric referral centre.	Use of our secure room/security guard system occurred at the rate of 1.1 uses/1000 emergency department visits, with the most common indication being physician perception of risk of patient suicide or self-harm. Concern for staff safety was a factor in 10% of uses. Eighty percent of patients were treated locally, with most being released from the secure room after 2 days or less. Fourteen percent of patients required ultimate transfer to our psychiatric referral centre and 6% to a detoxification centre. The average annual cost of security was $16 259.61.	A secure room can provide the opportunity for close observation of a potentially self-harming patient, additional security for staff and early warning if a patient flees the hospital. Most admissions were handled locally, obviating the need for transfer to distant psychiatric referral centres. Most patients who were admitted were already known as having a psychiatric illness and 80% of the patients required the use of the secure room/security guard system for less than a 2-night stay, suggesting that most rural mental health crises pass quickly.

The cAMP analogs were delivered via osmotic minipumps at 1-250 mM through an indwelling cortical cannula or by intrathecal infusion for up to 4 weeks after either a T8 unilateral over-hemisection or a C2-3 dorsolateral quadrant lesion, respectively. In both SCI models, continuous db-cAMP delivery was associated with histopathological changes that included sporadic micro-hemorrhage formation and cavitation, enhanced macrophage infiltration and tissue damage at regions beyond the immediate application site; no deleterious or beneficial effect of agent delivery was observed at the spinal injury site. Furthermore, these changes were accompanied by pronounced behavioral deficits that included an absence of progressive locomotor recovery, increased extensor tone, paralysis, and sensory abnormalities. These deleterious effects were not observed in saline-treated animals, in animals in which the db-cAMP dose did not exceed 1 mM, or in those animals that received a high dose (250 mM) of the alternative cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP. These results demonstrate that, for continuous intraparenchymal or intrathecal administration of cAMP analogs for the study of biological or therapeutic effects within the central nervous system (CNS), consideration of the effective concentration applied as well as the potential toxicity of chemical moieties on the parent molecule and/or their activity needs to be taken into account.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

At present, cognitive impairment after HIE has received increasing attention. Synaptic plasticity determines the development of cognitive function, so it is urgent to develop new drugs that can improve HIE-induced cognitive impairment. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced neuroinflammation affects synaptic plasticity. As a SIRT1 agonist, resveratrol has a powerful anti-inflammatory effect, but whether it has an effect on impaired synaptic plasticity in HIE and the potential mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, resveratrol was used to intervene in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) mice, and the effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and further mechanisms were explored through performing neurobehavioral, morphological observations, Golgi sliver staining, western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments. We first found that resveratrol improves HI-induced long-term cognitive and memory deficits, and then we found that resveratrol reduces hippocampal neuronal damage and increases dendritic spine density and the expression of synaptic proteins. Finally, we found that this effect may be exerted by regulating the neuroinflammatory response mediated by the SIRT1/NF-κB axis. This study provides a new theoretical basis for resveratrol to prevent long-term neurological dysfunction following HIBI.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Cerebral ischemia was induced in swiss albino mice by performing BCCAO surgery. Morris water-maze test was utilized to assess the learning ability and memory of the animals. The whole brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, TBARS, GSH levels and MPO activity were evaluated as the biochemical parameters. For histopathological evaluation of the cerebral infarct size, TTC staining was employed.	Administration of L-carnosine (500   mg/kg, i.p.) successfully attenuated the manifestations of cerebral ischemia. Higher levels of AChE, TBARS, and MPO were observed in BCCAO treated animals, which were successfully attenuated by treatment with L-carnosine and ischemic postconditioning. Whereas administration of L-carnosine and ischemic postconditioning significantly increased the level of GSH in BCCAO treated animals. Moreover, treatment with ranitidine, an H2 blocker (30 NMol, i.c.v) antagonized the neuroprotective actions of L-carnosine evidenced by decrease in MWM performance, increase in the level of AChE and oxidative stress, while decrease in GSH level in brain. The cerebral infarct size was found to be more in BCCAO inflicted animals, which was improved by the administration of L-carnosine, while the cerebral infarct size worsened by treatment with ranitidine (3   nmol, i.c.v.).	It is concluded that L-carnosine exerts neuroprotective effect via involvement of histidine-histamine pathway since the beneficial effects of L-carnosine were abolished by the H2-blocker.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The biological significance of FGL2 expression was assessed using the The Cancer Genome Atlast (TCGA) glioma database and tumor lysates analysis. The therapeutic effects of an anti-Fgl2 antibody and the role of immune suppression regulation by Fgl2 were determined in immune-competent, NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG), and FcɣRIIB-/- mice (n = 3-18 per group). Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance, log-rank survival analysis, and Pearson correlation. All statistical tests were two-sided.	In low-grade gliomas, 72.5% of patients maintained two copies of the FGL2 gene, whereas 83.8% of GBM patients had gene amplification or copy gain. Patients with high levels of FGL2 mRNA in glioma tissues had a lower overall survival (P = .009). Protein levels of FGL2 in GBM lysates were higher relative to low-grade glioma lysates (11.48±5.75ng/mg vs 3.96±1.01ng/mg, P = .003). In GL261 mice treated with an anti-FGL2 antibody, median survival was 27 days compared with only 17 days for mice treated with an isotype control antibody (P = .01). The anti-FGL2 antibody treatment reduced CD39(+) Tregs, M2 macrophages, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). FGL2-induced increases in M2, CD39, and PD-1 were ablated in FcɣRIIB-/- mice.	FGL2 augments glioma immunosuppression by increasing the expression levels of PD-1 and CD39, expanding the frequency of tumor-supportive M2 macrophages via the FcγRIIB pathway, and enhancing the number of MDSCs and CD39(+) regulatory T cells. Collectively, these results show that FGL2 functions as a key immune-suppressive modulator and has potential as an immunotherapeutic target for treating GBM.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Possible role for ACE in SCZ was also suggested by ACE activity interaction with dopaminergic mechanisms to modulate abnormalities of sensorimotor gating. In addition, we have demonstrated higher ACE activity in blood of SCZ subjects, its implication in cognitive performance in SCZ and its power as a predictor for SCZ diagnosis.Methods: ACE activity was determined in the serum and in selected brain regions of an animal model presenting SCZ-like behaviour, before and after the treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotics, and also in the serum of animals receiving the psychostimulants amphetamine/lisdexamphetamine.Results: Dopaminergic manipulations with antipsychotics and psychostimulants influenced the ACE activity, but with no correlation with the animal blood pressure.Conclusions: The validity of measuring ACE activity in animal blood to predict activity in the CNS, as well as the lack of correlation between the activity and blood pressure, before and after the treatment with antipsychotics, were confirmed here. Correlations of the present findings with data from clinical studies also strengthen the value of this animal model for studying several aspects of SCZ.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The Folts model was used in 60 rabbits. After anesthesia, the carotid artery was exposed and a 75% stenosis was induced. A compression injury of the artery triggered a series of cyclic flow reductions (CFRs). After counting baseline CFRs, animals were assigned randomly to one of four groups (n = 15 in each): control, PRP, rFVIIa and placebo. Control animals received 10 mL.kg(-1) of saline while 10 mL.kg(-1) of a hydroxyethyl starch solution (200,000/6%/0.5) were infused in the three other groups. CFRs were measured again, followed by treatment with PRP, rFVIIa or placebo and by a final measurement of CFRs. At the end of each observation period, an ear immersion bleeding time (BT) was measured and a blood sample was drawn for the evaluation of hematological variables. Microvascular bleeding was evaluated at the end of the experiment in grams of blood shed from liver and spleen sections.

C3H/HeJ mice primed with V-LSGPC developed neither circulating antibodies nor CD8+ cytotoxic T cells specific for LCMV, yet they resisted a normally lethal LCMV challenge. Spleen cells from such mice gave a proliferative response to LCMV in vitro that was inhibitable by anti-CD4 antibody. Synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted T-cell sites common to the envelope glycoprotein precursor (GP-C) of LV and that of LCMV were used to map the specificity of the proliferative response to an epitope located between amino acids 403 and 417 of LV GP-C. Several CD4+ T-cell clones specific for the 403-417 peptide were isolated and found to produce gamma interferon in response to both the peptide and LCMV. One of these clones, C9, was selected for further study. C9 lysed I-AK-bearing target cells, and when adoptively transferred to C3H/HeJ mice, it was capable of mediating both a peptide-specific delayed hypersensitivity reaction and resistance to lethal LCMV challenge. These collective findings demonstrate, for the first time, that CD4+ T cells can play a major role in arenavirus-specific cross-protective immunity.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Folia pharmacologica Japonica,[Assessment of morphine-type physical dependence liability in mice using the drug-admixed food method].,"Physical dependence on morphine-type drugs (morphine, codeine and pethidine) in mice were examined by the drug-admixed food method. Mice were treated with drug-admixed food of increasing concentration (1, 2 and 3 mg/g food) every third day for 9 days. Morphine- and codeine-treated mice showed withdrawal signs when they were given naloxone (5 mg/kg, s.c.), while pethidine-treated mice did not show the withdrawal signs. However, mice treated with pethidine-admixed food (1-6 mg/g food) for 28 days showed naloxone precipitated withdrawal signs. Thus, the data obtained with mice indicate that pethidine produces a weak physical dependence. On the other hand, codeine (40 mg/kg, s.c.) and pethidine (100 mg/kg, s.c.) administration suppressed the abrupt withdrawal signs of morphine-dependent mice that were treated with morphine-admixed food, while the withdrawal signs were completely suppressed in mice administered only 5 mg/kg morphine.

898,32938453,BMC biology,Genetic modifiers ameliorate endocytic and neuromuscular defects in a model of spinal muscular atrophy.,"Understanding the genetic modifiers of neurodegenerative diseases can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying these disorders. Here, we examine the relationship between the motor neuron disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is caused by reduced levels of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein, and the actin-bundling protein Plastin 3 (PLS3). Increased PLS3 levels suppress symptoms in a subset of SMA patients and ameliorate defects in SMA disease models, but the functional connection between PLS3 and SMN is poorly understood.	We provide immunohistochemical and biochemical evidence for large protein complexes localized in vertebrate motor neuron processes that contain PLS3, SMN, and members of the hnRNP F/H family of proteins. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) SMA model, we determine that overexpression of PLS3 or loss of the C. elegans hnRNP F/H ortholog SYM-2 enhances endocytic function and ameliorates neuromuscular defects caused by decreased SMN-1 levels. Furthermore, either increasing PLS3 or decreasing SYM-2 levels suppresses defects in a C. elegans ALS model.	We propose that hnRNP F/H act in the same protein complex as PLS3 and SMN and that the function of this complex is critical for endocytic pathways, suggesting that hnRNP F/H proteins could be potential targets for therapy development.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Transient global ischemia was produced by four vessel-occlusion, the occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries following the electrocautherization of the vertebral arteries. 3mg/kg of PPS or 300IU/kg of dalteparin was administered i.v. immediately after 7min-occlusion/reperfusion. Seven days after the operation, the animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and paraffinized coronal brain sections measuring 6microm in thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Neuronal damage was then estimated as a ratio of the number of degenerated neurons to that of both the surviving and degenerated neurons in three distinct area of the CA1 subfield. The ratio of neuronal death increased with the length of the occlusion-time, at 5, 7 and 10min. Both PPS and dalteparin significantly inhibited the neuronal damage induced by 7min-occlusion. These results demonstrated that both PPS and dalteparin could thus protect brain neurons against ischemia/reperfusion-induced damage thus suggesting that they may be potentially useful therapeutic agents for acute ischemic stroke.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
900,36789825,Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,Inhibition of drug induced Parkinsonism by chronic supplementation of quercetin in haloperidol-treated wistars.,"Haloperidol is a neuroleptic medication that is used to treat a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions. It has been shown to produce medicinal effects against hyperactivity, agitation and mania, as well as schizophrenia. Long-term usage of haloperidol raises the risk of acquiring a neurological condition like Parkinson's disease. Haloperidol causes drug-induced Parkinsonism (DIP) by blocking central dopamine receptors and causing extrapyramidal symptoms during long-term treatment. Quercetin has been shown to reduce the loss of striatal neurons, which may enhance motor capabilities and protect against agents that cause the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a result, present study intended to evaluate the efficacy of quercetin on haloperidol-related motor abnormalities. To develop behavioral impairments, rats (n=24) randomly divided to control and haloperidol group for four weeks. The animals were split into four groups after four weeks: Control, quercetin, haloperidol and haloperidol + quercetin. Animals were administered haloperidol i.p injections of 5mg/kg and quercetin (100mg/kg) orally for 21 days. The treatment of haloperidol-treated rats with quercetin was successful in reversing the haloperidol alterations. It decreased animal food intake and alleviated anxiogenic behavior.

Our results showed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of scopolamine leads to learning and memory dysfunction, whereas the administration of apigenin (synthetic compound, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) improved cognitive ability, which was confirmed by behavioral tests such as the T-maze test, novel objective recognition test, and Morris water maze test in mice. In addition, scopolamine-induced lipid peroxidation in the brain was attenuated by administration of apigenin. To further evaluate the protective mechanisms of apigenin on cognitive and memory function, Western blot analysis was carried out. Administration of apigenin decreased the B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio and suppressed caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. Furthermore, apigenin down-regulated the β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme, along with presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 protein levels. Apigenin-administered mice showed lower protein levels of a receptor for advanced glycation end-products, whereas insulin-degrading enzyme, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression were promoted by treatment with apigenin.

The effect of the triglyceride form of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (TG-DHA) was assayed in vitro and in vivo to assess the protective and anti-inflammatory activity of this compound. In the in vitro study, BV-2 microglia cells were previously treated with TG-DHA and then activated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). TG-DHA treatment protected BV-2 microglia cells from oxidative stress toxicity attenuating NO production and suppressing the induction of inflammatory cytokines. When compared with DHA in the ethyl-ester form, a significant difference in the ability to inhibit NO production in favor of TG-DHA was observed. TG-DHA inhibited significantly splenocyte proliferation but isolated CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation was unaffected. In a mice model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 250 mg/kg/day oral TG-DHA treatment was associated with a significant amelioration of the course and severity of the disease as compared to untreated animals. TG-DHA-treated EAE mice showed a better weight profile, which is a symptom related to a better course of encephalomyelitis. TG-DHA may be a promising therapeutic agent in neuroinflammatory processes and merit to be more extensively studied in human neurodegenerative disorders.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
903,6324347,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Anatomically distinct opiate receptor fields mediate reward and physical dependence.,Rats never before exposed to opioids rapidly learned to press a lever for microinjections of morphine into the ventral tegmental area. Challenge by a narcotic antagonist produced no signs of physical dependence. Dependence was not seen after long-term morphine infusions into the ventral tegmentum but was seen after similar infusions into the periventricular gray region. Thus a major rewarding property of morphine is independent of the drug's ability to produce physical dependence. These data challenge models of drug addiction that propose physical dependence as necessary for the rewarding effects of opioids.,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In this study, we explored the effects of urate on dopaminergic neurons in nigrostriatal pathway in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilaterally lesioned rats. Uric acid (UA), when given twice daily at 200 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 10 consecutive days, elevated urate (the anionic form of UA) in plasma and striatum by 55% and 36.8%, respectively, as compared with vehicle group. This regimen of UA was found to ameliorate the behavioral deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss as well as dopamine depletion in the nigrostriatal system. Moreover, UA administration was capable of increasing glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity while decreasing malondialdehyde accumulation in striatum. In addition, the phosphorylation of both protein kinase B (Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) in the lesioned striata of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was dramatically reduced as compared with sham-operated rats. This reduction was attenuated in the Parkinsonian rats receiving UA treatment. Similarly, in vitro findings showed that UA alleviated the decrease in Akt activation and the increase in GSK3β activity caused by 6-OHDA. Furthermore, neuroprotection by urate and its regulation on GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9 was found to be abolished in the presence of PI3K inhibitor. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that urate was able to protect dopaminergic neurons in rat nigrostriatal pathway against the neurotoxicity of 6-OHDA, and showed that its beneficial effects may be related to its regulation on Akt/GSK3β signaling.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In this study, rats harboring RG-2 tumors were given 15-minute intracarotid infusions of LTC4 at concentrations ranging from 0.5 microgram to 50.0 micrograms (seven rats in each dose group). Blood-tumor and blood-brain barrier permeability were determined by quantitative autoradiography using 14C aminoisobutyric acid. The transfer constant for permeability (Ki) within the tumors was increased twofold by LTC4 doses of 2.5, 5.0, and 50.0 micrograms compared to vehicle alone (90.00 +/- 21.14, 92.68 +/- 15.04, and 80.17 +/- 16.15 vs. 39.37 +/- 6.45 microliters/gm/min, respectively; mean +/- standard deviation; p less than 0.01). No significant change in Ki within the tumors was observed at the 0.5-microgram LTC4 dose. Blood-brain barrier permeability was selectively increased within the tumors. At no dose in this study did leukotrienes increase permeability within normal brain. To determine the duration of increased opening of the blood-tumor barrier by LTC4 administration, Ki was measured at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after termination of a 15-minute LTC4 infusion (seven rats at each time point). The mean Ki value was still high at 15 minutes (92.68 +/- 15.04 microliters/gm/min), but declined at 30 minutes (56.58 +/- 12.50 microliters/gm/min) and 60 minutes (55.40 +/- 8.10 microliters/gm/min) after the end of LTC4 infusion. Sulfidopeptide leukotrienes LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 and LTF4 were infused to compare their potency in opening the blood-tumor barrier. The mean leukotriene E4 was the most potent, increasing the permeability value 3 1/2-fold compared with vehicle alone (139.86 +/- 23.95 vs. 39.37 +/- 6.45 microliters/gm/min).",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Wistar rats were subjected to BCCAo procedure under anaesthesia to induce VaD. The rats were subjected to Morris water maze (MWM) test (6th day onwards post-surgery). MWM test was employed to assess learning and memory of the animals whereby escape latency time, time spent in target quadrant and Path length (distance travelled) taken as important parameters. Serum nitrite level; Brain thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels; Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; brain Myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and neutrophil count were estimated as per standard procedures. BCCAo in rats produced a significant vascular endothelial dysfunction, as reflected by decrease in serum nitrite levels. Further, these animals showed poor performance on MWM, depicting impairment of learning and memory. There was a significant rise in brain oxidative stress level as indicated by increase in TBARS and decrease in GSH levels. An increase in brain AChE activity was also observed. Moreover, these rats also exhibited an increase in MPO activity and neutrophil infiltration in brain (as marker of inflammation). Treatment of Carnosine (200 and 400 mg/kg, i.p.)/Donepezil (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) ameliorated BCCAo-induced memory deficits; endothelial dysfunction; biochemical and histopathological changes. It is concluded that Carnosine has shown efficacy in rat model of BCCAo-induced VaD and can be considered as an important therapeutic agent for the treatment of VaD.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

AWD 140-190 was active at nontoxic doses after oral and intraperitoneal administration in rats and mice in a range of anticonvulsant tests. The compound was active against electrically-induced seizures (MES, ED50 rat p.o. = 2.47 mg/kg), in a genetic animal model the DBA/2 mouse, and in corneally kindled rats. It was not active against seizures induced chemically by pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline and strychnine. Effective doses in mice following both oral and intraperitoneal administration are similar indicating good oral absorption. During 14 days chronic oral treatment of mice with 10 mg/kg, no development of tolerance was observed. The protective indices (TD50/MES ED50) in rats and mice following oral administration are favorable when compared to phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. No motor impairment, evaluated with the rotarod test and by observation in the open field test, was observable following oral administration of doses up to 500 mg/kg. There was no influence on spontaneous motility and learning performance in rats and no interaction with ethanol in mice after administration of doses which are above anticonvulsant effective doses indicating the absence of central side effects. AWD 140-190 thus presents an orally active and safe anticonvulsant agent, which is structurally unrelated to anticonvulsants currently used.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Stress factors play an important role in the etiopathology of both diseases, since increased corticosteroid levels caused by chronic stress indirectly induce neuronal damage. The aim of our experiments was to evaluate the changes induced by stress in the transcription of amyloid precursor protein (APP), mitogen activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1) and beta-actin, of which the latest plays a leading role in synaptic plasticity. Additionally we intended to examine how duloxetine - a serotonin-norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor type antidepressant - would modify the stress-induced changes. Wistar rats were exposed to immobilization stress for five hours daily through 21 days, while part of the animals received 45 mg/bwkg of duloxetine. At the end of the third week total RNA was purified from the cortex and hippocampus. The amount of beta-actin, APP and MAPK-1 mRNA was determined by real time PCR method. On protein level, semiquantitative measurement was performed by Western blot. The expression of beta-actin mRNA in the animals exposed to stress was four times as intense as in the control group. The increase in the beta-actin mRNA levels was repressed by the duloxetine treatment. In the case of APP and MAPK-1 no changes were detected. According to the Western blot results, the antidepressant treatment slightly, the drug along with the stress treatment strongly decreased the amount of the beta-actin protein. Our findings indicate that antidepressant treatment with duloxetine could play a protective role against the chronic stress-induced changes in the nervous system, such as disorders of synaptic plasticity, and the consequent cognitive dysfunctions in case of both affective disorders and AD.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

When chronically abused, ketamine users display deficits in cognition and information processing, even following long-term abstinence from the drug. While animal studies have shown evidence of behavioral changes and cognitive deficits that mimic those seen in humans within the period immediately following subchronic ketamine, a few animal studies have assessed long-term changes following cessation of ketamine exposure. To this end, the present study assessed event related potentials (ERPs) and EEG oscillations in mice exposed to subchronic ketamine following a 6month period of abstinence from the drug. Ketamine-treated mice showed no change in P20, but did show marked reductions in amplitude of the later N40 and P80 components, consistent with previous studies of acute ketamine exposure. Additionally, ketamine-treated animals showed a significant reduction in stimulus evoked theta oscillations. To assess the functional significance of these changes, mice were also assessed on a series of behavioral and cognitive tests, including progressive ratio (motivation), extinction (behavioral flexibility) and win-shift radial maze (spatial memory). Subchronic ketamine produced marked disruptions in reversal learning and spatial memory. Analysis of brains from ketamine-treated mice failed to show evidence of neuronal degeneration as determined by NueN immunohistochemistry, but did show increased astrocyte proliferation and decreased expression of the glial specific glutamate transporter, GLT-1. These results strongly suggest: 1) that subchronic ketamine induces significant changes in brain function that long exceed exposure to the drug; 2) that ketamine exposure in mice induces lasting cognitive impairments closely resembling those observed in human ketamine abusers; 3) that ERP and EEG measures are highly sensitive to alterations in brain function associated with reduced cognitive function; and 4) that the brain changes induced by chronic ketamine treatment are suggestive of long-term adaptive or plastic, rather than degenerative, changes.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Although most studies have focused on the pathology of the injured brain, we have noted that the liver plays an important role in TBI. Using two mouse models of TBI, we found that the enzymatic activity of hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) was rapidly decreased and then returned to normal levels following TBI, whereas such changes were not observed in the kidney, heart, spleen, or lung. Interestingly, genetic downregulation of hepatic Ephx2 (which encodes sEH) ameliorates TBI-induced neurological deficits and promotes neurological function recovery, whereas overexpression of hepatic sEH exacerbates TBI-associated neurological impairments. Furthermore, hepatic sEH ablation was found to promote the generation of A2 phenotype astrocytes and facilitate the production of various neuroprotective factors associated with astrocytes following TBI. We also observed an inverted V-shaped alteration in the plasma levels of four EET (epoxyeicosatrienoic acid) isoforms (5,6-, 8,9-,11,12-, and 14,15-EET) following TBI which were negatively correlated with hepatic sEH activity. However, hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally regulates the plasma levels of 14,15-EET, which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, we found that the application of 14,15-EET mimicked the neuroprotective effect of hepatic sEH ablation, while 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid blocked this effect, indicating that the increased plasma levels of 14,15-EET mediated the neuroprotective effect observed after hepatic sEH ablation. These results highlight the neuroprotective role of the liver in TBI and suggest that targeting hepatic EET signaling could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating TBI.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

We gave the transgenic (Tg) mice either atorvastatin or pitavastatin from 5-20 months (M) of age, and performed immunohistological analysis [4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE)-positive, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R)-positive neurons, apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-positive senile plaque (SP), and insulin receptor (IR)-positive endothelium], and biochemistry analysis (adiponectin and leptin).	The numbers of 4-HNE- and AGE-positive neurons and the sum of ApoE-positive SP size progressively increased with age in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-Tg mice, while the amount of IR-positive endothelium and the number of LDL-R-positive neurons decreased. Adiponectin and leptin serum levels were lower in APP-Tg mice than in non-Tg mice. Treatment with statins reduced the number of AGE-positive neurons from as early as 10 M, preserved the numbers of 4-HNE- and LDL-R-positive neurons and the amount of IR-positive endothelium at 15 M, and reduced the sum of ApoE-positive SP size and adiponectin serum level at 20 M.	Atorvastatin and pitavastatin reduced the level of oxidative stress, as revealed by the presence of 4-HNE and AGE, in AD mouse brains, and that treatment with statins improves insulin signaling and LDL-R/ApoE systems.

This study investigated whether LEV can modify induction of dyskinesia by l-dopa or the process of priming.	Drug-naive MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) -lesioned marmosets were treated for 21 days with l-dopa/LEV or l-dopa alone. Subsequently, the animals were left untreated for 1 week and then both groups were challenged with a single dose of l-dopa alone on day 29. Behavior was assessed by automated activity counts and by post hoc analysis of videotapes using validated rating scales.	LEV had no significant effect on the appearance of dyskinesia when administered de novo in combination with l-dopa. However, after a week of drug holiday, the 2 groups exhibited a different response to an acute l-dopa challenge. Thus, animals previously treated with l-dopa alone exhibited a similar level of dyskinesia to that seen on day 21 of the repeated treatment phase of the study. However, animals previously treated with l-dopa/LEV demonstrated significantly reduced dyskinesia compared with day 21 of the repeated treatment phase of the study.	LEV does not modify the onset of dyskinesia following de novo treatment with l-dopa. However, concomitant treatment with l-dopa/LEV reduces the level of dyskinesia induced by l-dopa following a drug holiday. Thus, prior treatment with LEV appears to modify the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of l-dopa-induced dyskinesia.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of magnolol on the proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and neointima formation in vivo, as well as the related cell signaling mechanisms.	Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induced proliferation ofVSMCs was assessed using colorimetric assay. Cell cycle progression and mRNA expression of cell cycle associated molecules were determined by flow cytometry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respectively. The signaling molecules such as ERK1/2,JNK, P38 and NF-kappaB were determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, rat carotid artery balloon injury model was performed to assess the effect of magnolol on neointima formation in vivo.	Oral administration of magnolol significantly inhibited intimal area and intimal/medial ratio (I/M). Our in vitro assays revealed magnolol dose dependently induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. Also, magnolol inhibited mRNA and protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK2 in vitro and in vivo. The cell cycle arrest was associated with inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB translocation.	Magnolol suppressed proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and attenuated neointima formation in vivo by inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 through modulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK2 expression.

The convulsant beta-carbolines, DMCM and beta-CCM, have proconvulsant and convulsant activity in the same animal models. DMCM and beta-CCM are similar in potency as convulsants in DBA/2 mice (ED50 value for DMCM: 1.3 mg/kg; ED50 value for beta-CCM; 0.8 mg/kg), but differ with respect to their profiles for protection by anticonvulsant drugs. The anticonvulsant potencies of diazepam and clobazam are similar against both types of beta-carboline-induced seizures, whereas quazepam protects better against beta-CCM seizures (4 fold elevation in ED50 value at 1 mg/kg quazepam IP) than against DMCM seizures (1.7 fold elevation in ED50 value), supporting a preferential action of beta-CCM on BZ1 receptors. Valproate (400 mg/kg) and gamma-vinyl-GABA (1.5 g/kg) protect better against beta-CCM seizures (9.5 and 5.9 fold elevations in ED50 values respectively) than against DMCM seizures (1.8 and 2.7 fold elevations in ED50 values respectively). The excitatory amino acid antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, has significant anticonvulsant activity against DMCM seizures.

Histone acetylation has been shown to be a key process in sevoflurane-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities. Here, we investigated whether histone acetylation regulates the interaction between autophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome in models of sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Aged C57BL/6 J mice and cultured primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 2 h. Hippocampal tissue samples and hippocampal neurons were harvested. The processes of histone acetylation and autophagy and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome were observed using western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in both the mouse hippocampus and primary neurons. Concomitantly, sevoflurane upregulated components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and IL-1β) by promoting autophagic degradation in the aging brain. Cognitive deficits and inadequate autophagy induced by sevoflurane were reversed and NLRP3 inflammasome activation was inhibited by SAHA. Treatment with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, eliminated the neuroprotective effects of SAHA on improving cognition in mice, activating autophagy and downregulating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Based on these results, histone acetylation activates autophagy plays an important role in inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome to protect the host from excessive neuroinflammation and sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction in the aging brain.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
923,16086036,British journal of pharmacology,Neuroprotective effect of paeoniflorin on cerebral ischemic rat by activating adenosine A1 receptor in a manner different from its classical agonists.,"The effects of paeoniflorin (PF), a compound isolated from Paeony radix, on neurological impairment and histologically measured infarction volume following transient and permanent focal ischemia were examined in Sprague-Dawley rats. In transient ischemia model, rats were subjected to a 1.5-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The administration of PF (2.5 and 5 mg kg(-1), s.c.) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both neurological impairment and the histologically measured infarction volume. Similar results were also obtained when PF (2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was given in permanent ischemia model. The neuroprotective effect of PF (10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was abolished by pretreatment of DPCPX (0.25 mg kg(-1), s.c.), a selective adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) antagonist. PF (10, 40, and 160 mg kg(-1), i.v.) had no effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rates (HR) in the conscious rat. Additionally, PF (10(-3) mol l(-1)) had no effect on noradrenaline- (NA-) or high K+ concentration-induced contractions of isolated rabbit primary artery. In competitive binding experiments, PF did not compete with the binding of [3H]DPCPX, but displaced the binding of [3H]NECA to the membrane preparation of rat cerebral cortex. This binding manner was distinguished from the classical A1R agonists. The results demonstrated that activation of A1R might be involved in PF-induced neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia in rat. However, PF had no 'well-known' cardiovascular side effects of classical A1R agonists. The results suggest that PF might have the potential therapeutic value as an anti-stroke drug.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
924,11593032,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Specific treatment of autoimmunity with recombinant invariant chains in which CLIP is replaced by self-epitopes.,"The invariant chain (Ii) binds to newly synthesized MHC class II molecules with the CLIP region of Ii occupying the peptide-binding groove. Here we demonstrate that recombinant Ii proteins with the CLIP region replaced by antigenic self-epitopes are highly efficient in activating and silencing specific T cells in vitro and in vivo. The Ii proteins require endogenous processing by antigen-presenting cells for efficient T cell activation. An Ii protein encompassing the epitope myelin basic protein amino acids 84-96 (Ii-MBP84-96) induced the model autoimmune disease experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) with a higher severity and earlier onset than the peptide. When applied in a tolerogenic manner, Ii-MBP84-96 abolished antigen-specific T cell proliferation and suppressed peptide-induced EAE more effectively than peptide alone. Importantly, i.v. administration of Ii proteins after EAE induction completely abrogated the disease, whereas peptides only marginally suppressed disease symptoms. Ii fusion proteins are thus more efficient than peptide in modulating CD4(+) T cell-mediated autoimmunity, documenting their superior qualities for therapeutic antigen delivery in vivo.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

This study investigated the vasodilator and neuroprotective effects of darbepoetin alpha on an experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage model and compared it with erythropoietin.	Forty adult male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups of ten rabbits each: group 1 (control), group 2 (subarachnoid hemorrhage), group 3 (erythropoietin), and group 4 (darbepoetin alpha). Recombinant human erythropoietin was administered at a dose of 1,000 U/kg intraperitoneally after the induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage and continued every 8 h up to 72 h. Darbepoetin alpha was administered at a single intraperitoneal dose of 30 μg/kg. Animals were killed 72 h after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Basilar artery cross-sectional areas, arterial wall thicknesses, hippocampal degeneration scores and biochemical analyses were measured in all groups.	Both erythropoietin and darbepoetin alpha treatments were found to attenuate cerebral vasospasm and provide neuroprotection after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbits. Darbepoetin alpha revealed better morphometric and histopathological results than erythropoietin among experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm.	Our findings, for the first time, showed that darbepoetin alpha can prevent vasospasm and provides neuroprotection following experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Moreover, darbepoetin alpha showed better results when compared with erythropoietin.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
926,19782718,Neuroscience letters,Nandrolone decanoate administration elevates hippocampal prodynorphin mRNA expression and impairs Morris water maze performance in male rats.,"The misuse of anabolic androgenic steroids has in several reports been associated with effects resulting in altered behavior. This study used the Morris water maze task to investigate the effect of high doses of the anabolic androgenic steroid nandrolone on spatial learning and memory in male rats. During the experiment, we observed a significantly impaired Morris water maze performance in the nandrolone-treated rats compared with controls. The hippocampus, a brain region associated with cognitive function, was analyzed for mRNA expression of prodynorphin, the precursor of dynorphinergic peptides. The results indicated that the transcription levels of prodynorphin were significantly elevated in the animals treated with nandrolone compared with controls. Thus, the findings suggest that administration of nandrolone to male rats impairs memory function, possibly via dynorphinergic actions.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In this study, we developed Bo-TSA-NP, a novel tanshinone IIA (TSA) loaded nanoparticles modified by borneol, which has long been proved with the ability to enhance other drugs' transport across the BBB. The Bo-TSA-NP, with a particle size of about 160 nm, drug loading of 3.6%, showed sustained release and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition property. It demonstrated a significantly higher uptake by 16HBE cells in vitro through the clathrin/caveolae-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis. Following intranasal (IN) administration, Bo-TSA-NP significantly improved the preventive effect on a rat model of CIRI with improved neurological scores, decreased cerebral infarction areas and a reduced content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rat brain. In conclusion, these results indicate that Bo-TSA-NP is a promising nose-to-brain delivery system that can enhance the prevention effect of TSA on CIRI.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
928,27520275,Molecular neurobiology,Intranasal Delivery of a Caspase-1 Inhibitor in the Treatment of Global Cerebral Ischemia.,"Caspase-1 is an enzyme implicated in neuroinflammation, a critical component of many diseases that affect neuronal degeneration. However, it is unknown whether a caspase-1 inhibitor can modify apoptotic neuronal damage incurred during transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) and whether intranasal administration of a caspase-1 inhibitor is an effective treatment following GCI. The present study was conducted to examine the potential efficiency of post-ischemic intranasal administration of the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK in a 4-vessel occlusion model of GCI in the rat. Herein, we show that intranasal Boc-D-CMK readily penetrated the central nervous system, subsequently inhibiting caspase-1 activity, decreasing mitochondrial dysfunction, and attenuating caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway in ischemia-vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region. Further investigation regarding the mechanisms underlying Boc-D-CMK's neuroprotective effects revealed marked inhibition of reactive gliosis, as well as reduction of the neuroinflammatory response via inhibition of the downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal Boc-D-CMK post-treatment also significantly enhanced the numbers of NeuN-positive cells while simultaneously decreasing the numbers of TUNEL-positive and PARP1-positive cells in hippocampal CA1. Correspondingly, behavioral tests showed that deteriorations in spatial learning and memory performance, and long-term recognition memory following GCI were significantly improved in the Boc-D-CMK post-treated animals. In summary, the current study demonstrates that the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK coordinates anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions to attenuate neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region following GCI. Furthermore, our data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 is a promising neuroprotective strategy to target ischemic neuronal injury and functional deficits following transient GCI.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of dietary supplementation with different selenium (Se) compounds on the dynamics of brain metastasis development in a novel mouse model. Mice were fed experimental diets enriched (1 mg/kg) with sodium selenite (Se-S), seleno-1-methionine (Se-Meth), a yeast-derived organic form of selenium (Se-Yeast), or a control diet (Se < 0.05 mg/kg) for 20 wk. At the end of the feeding period, animals were injected with luciferase-tagged K1735 (K1735-Luc) melanoma cells into the brain vasculature. The development of brain metastatic tumors was monitored for 2 wk following injection. Mice bearing brain metastatic tumors and fed Se-Yeast- or Se-S-enriched diets displayed a higher survival rate compared with other experimental and control groups. Importantly, Se-Yeast supplementation decreased the growth of brain metastatic tumors as determined by the measurement of the intensity of the bioluminescent signal emitted by K1735-Luc cells upon reaction with luciferin. Different chemical forms of Se have distinct effects on the development of brain metastases. Organic Se in the form of Se-Yeast may be a valuable agent in suppression of brain metastatic disease.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
930,27768761,PloS one,Effects of Neurotrophic Support and Amyloid-Targeted Combined Therapy on Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in a Transgenic Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Although it is recognized that multi-drug therapies may be necessary to combat AD, there is a paucity of preclinical proof of concept studies. We present a combination treatment paradigm, which temporally affects different aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology, specifically Aβ-toxicity and neurogenesis. At early stages of AD-like pathology, in TgCRND8 mice, we found that combating Aβ pathology with scyllo-inositol ameliorated deficits in neurogenesis. Older TgCRND8 mice with established amyloid load had decreased progenitor cell proliferation and survival compared to non-transgenic mice, regardless of scyllo-inositol treatment. The prolonged exposure to Aβ-pathology leads to deficits in the neurogenic niche, thus targeting Aβ alone is insufficient to rescue neurogenesis. To support the neurogenic niche, we combined scyllo-inositol treatment with leteprinim potassium (neotrofin), the latter of which stimulates neurotrophin expression. We show that the combination treatment of scyllo-inositol and neotrofin enhances neuronal survival and differentiation. We propose this proof of concept combination therapy of targeting Aβ-pathology and neurotrophin deficits as a potential treatment for AD.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

932,9130303,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",Correlation between hippocampal neuronal damage and spatial learning deficit due to global ischemia.,"Global cerebral ischemia leads to selective neuronal damage in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus and in the striatum. This ischemia leads to a deficit in spatial learning and memory in the water maze. The results of earlier studies that have examined the relationship between neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze were not clear-cut. It has been observed that neuroprotection reduces both the deficit in the water maze and the neuronal damage. The present study therefore approached the relationship between the neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze by pharmacological means. Global cerebral ischemia was induced in male Wistar rats by four-vessel occlusion for 20 min. Ischemic rats were then treated with the noncompetitive non-NMDA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 (30 mg/kg), the radical scavenger LY 231617 (20 mg/kg), the inhibitor of protein kinase C staurosporine (0.1 mg/kg), or solvent. Treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial learning by limiting the increase in swim distance due to ischemia. In addition, LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial memory as demonstrated by minimizing the ischemia-induced reduction in time spent in the quadrant of the former platform position during the probe trial. Staurosporine had no influence on the ischemia-induced behavioural changes. Histological examination revealed neuronal damage in the hippocampus and in the striatum in all of the ischemic rats. However, treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the hippocampal damage. Correlation analysis demonstrated a correlation between hippocampal damage and total swim distance (r = 0.88, P < 0.001). No correlation was found between hippocampal damage and quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.24, p > 0.1). No correlation was observed between striatal damage and either total swim distance of the escape trials (r = 0.28. p > 0.1) or quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.08, p > 0.6). It is concluded that a correlation exists between hippocampal damage and the deficit in spatial learning following global cerebral ischemia.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Xenon (Xe) is a general anesthetic with neuroprotective effects.	Here, we investigate the neuroprotective role of Xe in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced white matter damage (WMD) model.	Three-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham group (group A, n = 24), an LPS + HI group (group B, n = 24), and an LPS + HI + Xe group (group C, n = 72). The onset of Xe inhalation started at 0, 2, and 5 h in subgroups C1, C2, and C3, respectively. Next, we performed TUNEL and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining; and examined the expression of CLIC4 and Bcl-2 in brain tissues.	HE staining revealed distorted cytoarchitecture, tangled nerve fibers, and pyknosis in group B, while Xe treatment improved these histological alterations in the group C pups. Following LPS and HI insult, the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased in group B at 48 and 72 h (p < 0.05), and Xe significantly alleviated apoptosis (p < 0.001) at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Similarly, CLIC4 mRNA expression was significantly increased in group B (p < 0.05), and Xe produced a marked reduction in CLIC4 mRNA expression in group C subgroups (p < 0.05). Western blotting demonstrated enhanced Bcl-2 expression in group C when compared to group B (p < 0.05).	These results demonstrate that LPS and HI successfully induced WMD, and Xe decreased neuronal apoptosis via Bcl-2- and CLIC4-mediated pathways. Moreover, the therapeutic time window of Xe extended for up to 5 h. These findings suggest that Xe can be used as a protective treatment for WMD in premature infants.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In this study, the interaction between the opioid receptor antagonist and NO was investigated on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced HE in cirrhotic rats. Male rats were divided in the sham- and bile duct ligation (BDL)-operated groups. Animals were treated with saline; naltrexone (10 mg/kg, i.p.); or L-NAME (3 mg/kg, i.p.), alone or in combination with naltrexone. To induce HE, LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 1 h after the final drug treatment. HE scoring, hepatic histology, and plasma NO metabolites levels and mortality rate were recorded. Deteriorated level of consciousness and mortality after LPS administration significantly ameliorated following both acute and chronic treatment with naltrexone in cirrhotic rats. However, acute and chronic administration of L-NAME did not change HE scores in cirrhotic rats. The effects of acute but not chronic treatment of naltrexone on HE parameters were reversed by L-NAME. Plasma NOx concentrations elevated in BDL rats, which were decreased after acute and chronic treatment by naltrexone or L-NAME, significantly. We suggest both acute and chronic treatment with naltrexone improved LPS-induced HE. But, only acute treatment with naltrexone may affect through NO pathway.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

936,16267375,Biological research for nursing,Effects of estrogen on platelet reactivity after transient forebrain ischemia in rats.,"Estrogen's prothrombotic effects are of increasing concern, particularly in stroke risk and recovery. Using an ischemic rodent model, the authors sought to determine (a) if estrogen replacement increases postischemic platelet reactivity, (b) if changes in estrogen status alter intraplatelet endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) synthesis, and (c) if estrogen-mediated effects on platelets alter cerebral blood flow during reperfusion. Intact (I), ovariectomized (OVX), and OVX + 17 beta-estradiol (E50) rats were subjected to 30 min of forebrain ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. Using the platelet activation marker P-selectin, postischemic platelet reactivity was quantified by flow cytometry. In a separate cohort (I, OVX, E50), the authors quantified platelet eNOS by Western blot. Another cohort (OVX, E50) was subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, and cerebral blood flow was determined using the iodoantipyrine technique. Collagen-stimulated platelet P-selectin expression was increased in the OVX rats at 60 min of reperfusion, and this effect was reversed by estrogen treatment. No differences in platelet eNOS expression were detected among groups. Cerebral blood flow at 60 min reperfusion was comparable between the OVX and the E50 rats. The authors conclude that during reper-fusion, estrogen deficiency increases postischemic platelet sensitivity to stimuli in estrogen-deficient rats. Estrogen treatment mitigates effects of estrogen loss on platelets, but this early effect is apparently not caused by intraplatelet eNOS depression. Neither estrogen deficiency nor estrogen treatment changes early postischemic regional brain blood flow. In this rodent global cerebral ischemic model, physiologic doses of estrogen are not deleterious to platelet reactivity and may initially reduce postischemic platelet reactivity.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

We developed a methodology to evaluate the repeated intranasal delivery of neuroactive compounds on the non-human primate (NHP) brain, without the need for sedation. We evaluated the effects of the neuroactive peptide, DNSP-11 following repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation over the course of 10-weeks in Rhesus macaques. This approach allowed us to examine striatal target engagement, safety and tolerability, and brain distribution following a single [125]I-labeled DNSP-11 dose.	Our initial data support that repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation of DNSP-11 resulted in bilateral, striatal target engagement based on neurochemical changes in dopamine (DA) metabolites-without observable, adverse behavioral effects or weight loss in NHPs. Furthermore, a [125]I-labeled DNSP-11 study illustrates diffuse rostral to caudal distribution in the brain including the striatum-our target region of interest.	The results of this study are compared to our experiments in normal and 6-OHDA lesioned rats, where DNSP-11 was repeatedly delivered intranasally using a micropipette with animals under light sedation.	The results from this proof-of-concept study support the utility of our repeated intranasal dosing methodology in awake Rhesus macaques, to evaluate the effects of neuroactive compounds on the NHP brain. Additionally, results indicate that DNSP-11 can be safely and effectively delivered intranasally in MPTP-treated NHPs, while engaging the DA system.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The present study investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of YC‑1 in cultured neurons exposed to glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity and in an animal model of stroke. In a cortical neuronal culture model, YC‑1 demonstrated neurotoxicity at a concentration >100 µM, and YC‑1 (10‑30 µM) achieved potent cytoprotection against glutamate‑induced neuronal damage. Additionally, YC‑1 (30 µM) effectively attenuated the increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Delayed treatment of YC‑1 (30 µM) also protected against glutamate‑induced neuronal damage and cell swelling in cultured neurons, though only at 4 h post‑treatment. In addition, immediate treatment of YC‑1 (30 µM) following the exposure of cortical neurons to glutamate (300 µM) produced a marked reduction in intracellular pH. Delayed treatment of YC‑1 (25 mg/kg) protected against ischemic brain damage in vivo, though only when administered at 3 h post‑insult. Thus, YC‑1 exhibited neuroprotection against glutamate-induced neuronal damage and in mice subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia. This neuroprotection may be mediated via its ability to limit the glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity. However, the neuroprotective therapeutic window of YC‑1 is only at 3 h in vivo and 4 h in vitro, which may, at least in part, be attributed to its ability to reduce the intracellular pH in the early phase of ischemic stroke. Although YC‑1 provided the potential for clinical therapy, the treatment time point must be carefully evaluated following ischemia.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
940,18346734,Experimental neurology,AAV2-mediated gene transfer of GDNF to the striatum of MPTP monkeys enhances the survival and outgrowth of co-implanted fetal dopamine neurons.,"Neural transplantation offers the potential of treating Parkinson's disease by grafting fetal dopamine neurons to depleted regions of the brain. However, clinical studies of neural grafting in Parkinson's disease have produced only modest improvements. One of the main reasons for this is the low survival rate of transplanted neurons. The inadequate supply of critical neurotrophic factors in the adult brain is likely to be a major cause of early cell death and restricted outgrowth of fetal grafts placed into the mature striatum. Glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor that is crucial to the survival, outgrowth and maintenance of dopamine neurons, and so is a candidate for protecting grafted fetal dopamine neurons in the adult brain. We found that implantation of adeno-associated virus type 2 encoding GDNF (AAV2-GDNF) in the normal monkey caudate nucleus induced overexpression of GDNF that persisted for at least 6 months after injection. In a 6-month within-animal controlled study, AAV2-GDNF enhanced the survival of fetal dopamine neurons by 4-fold, and increased the outgrowth of grafted fetal dopamine neurons by almost 3-fold in the caudate nucleus of MPTP-treated monkeys, compared with control grafts in the other caudate nucleus. Thus, the addition of GDNF gene therapy to neural transplantation may be a useful strategy to improve treatment for Parkinson's disease.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Male rats were randomly divided into blank control (C), SD, DEX, and SD+DEX groups. The SD model was established through intraperitoneal injection of DEX. The escape latency was detected through Morris water maze test daily, and the mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency were detected for 8 d. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in hippocampus homogenate were determined, and the morphological changes in neurons were detected through Nissl staining. The concentration of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-6 in the hippocampus was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the Rac1/protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) expressions were detected by Western blotting. The changes in immunofluorescence localization of NF-κB were observed by confocal microscopy. Compared with SD group, the escape latency was shortened, original platform-crossing times increased, MDA content declined, SOD activity rose, neurons were arranged orderly and number of Nissl bodies increased in the hippocampal CA1 region, levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the hippocampus decreased, Rac1/AKT/NF-κB expressions were down-regulated, and proportion of NF-κB entering the nucleus declined in SD+DEX group (P < 0.05). DEX can effectively alleviate postoperative hippocampal inflammation and improve cognitive function of SD rats. The ability of DEX to relieve oxidative stress of hippocampal neurons, restore damaged cells, and reduce hippocampal inflammation in SD rats may be related to the Rac1/AKT/NF-κB pathway.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

944,23262119,Experimental neurology,Serotonergic pharmacotherapy promotes cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury.,"Cortical reorganization plays a significant role in recovery of function after injury of the central nervous system. The neural mechanisms that underlie this reorganization may be the same as those normally responsible for skilled behaviors that accompany extended sensory experience and, if better understood, could provide a basis for further promoting recovery of function after injury. The work presented here extends studies of spontaneous cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury to the role of rehabilitative strategies on cortical reorganization. We use a complete spinal transection model to focus on cortical reorganization in response to serotonergic (5-HT) pharmacotherapy without any confounding effects from spared fibers left after partial lesions. 5-HT pharmacotherapy has previously been shown to improve behavioral outcome after SCI but the effect on cortical organization is unknown. After a complete spinal transection in the adult rat, 5-HT pharmacotherapy produced more reorganization in the sensorimotor cortex than would be expected by transection alone. This reorganization was dose dependent, extended into intact (forelimb) motor cortex, and, at least in the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex, followed a somatotopic arrangement. Animals with the greatest behavioral outcome showed the greatest extent of cortical reorganization suggesting that the reorganization is likely to be in response to both direct effects of 5-HT on cortical circuits and indirect effects in response to the behavioral improvement below the level of the lesion.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
945,17459424,Microvascular research,"Effects of L-arginine on cerebral blood flow, microvascular permeability, number of perfused capillaries, and brain water content in the traumatized mouse brain.","It is has been suggested that decreased production of the vasodilatory and anti-aggregative substance NO (nitric oxide) may result in lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) in injured areas of the traumatized brain. The NO-precursor L-arginine has been shown to counteract CBF decreases early after trauma, but microcirculatory and more long-term effects on CBF of L-arginine have not been investigated. In an attempt to analyze effects of L-arginine on the microcirculation in the traumatized brain, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of L-arginine compared to vehicle (0.9% saline) following a standardized controlled cortical-impact brain trauma in mice. Cerebral blood flow (autoradiography [(14)C]-iodoantipyrine), number of perfused capillaries (FITC-dextran fluorescence technique), brain water content (wet vs. dry weight) and the blood to brain transfer constant K(i) for [(51)Cr]-EDTA were analyzed in the injured and the contralateral cortex. Cortical blood flow in the injured cortex was 0.43+/-0.3 mL/g/min and 0.81+/-0.3 mL/g/min 3 h after trauma in the vehicle and L-arginine groups, respectively (p<0.05), and no treatment effect was seen 24 h after trauma. The number of perfused capillaries decreased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. K(i) increased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. Brain water content was lower in the L-arginine group than in the vehicle group 3 h after trauma and there was no difference between the groups 24 h after trauma. We conclude that L-arginine reduces brain edema formation and improves cortical blood flow in the early phase after a brain trauma, whereas no circulatory effects can be seen after prolonged treatment.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
946,1691458,Neuropharmacology,Chronic administration of benzodiazepines--V. Rapid onset of behavioral and neurochemical alterations after discontinuation of alprazolam.,"Discontinuation of chronic treatment with alprazolam may cause a characteristic clinical syndrome. To assess the basis of this syndrome, mice were treated with alprazolam, 2 mg/kg, for 7 days, a regimen associated with the development of tolerance and downregulation of receptors. Effects on motor activity and the binding and function of GABA receptors were evaluated 1, 2, 4 and 7 days after discontinuation. Motor activity was similar to controls 1 day after cessation of alprazolam, increased from days 2 to 4 after-alprazolam, and returned to control values by 7 days. The binding of benzodiazepines in vivo and in vitro was increased in the cortex 2 and 4 days after alprazolam and in the hypothalamus at 4 days after alprazolam. Binding returned to control values in all areas by 7 days. Binding at the chloride channel, using [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, was not significantly altered after discontinuation. Muscimol-stimulated uptake of [36Cl-] in cortical synaptoneurosomes was increased at 4 days after alprazolam, compared to days 1, 2 and 7. Thus, behavioral and neurochemical alterations was associated with the discontinuation of alprazolam. These alterations were qualitatively similar to those observed following discontinuation of lorazepam but occurred more rapidly and with differing regional specificity.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
947,12854756,Journal of neurosurgery,Neuroprotective activity of tamoxifen in permanent focal ischemia.,"The authors have previously shown that tamoxifen is effective in protecting brain tissue from ischemic injury in a rat model of reversible focal ischemia. In this study the authors tested whether similar protective effects are found in a rat model of permanent focal ischemia (permanent middle cerebral artery [MCA] occlusion).	Tamoxifen (20 mg/kg) was given either before or at 1, 3, or 6 hours after permanent MCA occlusion in rats, with sustaining doses given every 12 hours thereafter. The median infarct volume measured after 72 hours was 113 mm3 for the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) groups, compared with 31 mm3 for pretreatment, and 14, 27, and 98 mm3 for treatment beginning at 1, 3, and 6 hours, respectively, after permanent MCA occlusion. The infarct reductions in the pretreated and 1- and 3-hour post-MCA occlusion treatment groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). At 3 hours after permanent MCA occlusion, tamoxifen also significantly reduced the infarct size at a lower dose of 5 mg/kg but not at 1 mg/kg; the same sustaining doses of 5 and 1 mg/kg were given every 12 hours.	Tamoxifen is as effective in a permanent model of focal ischemia as it is in the reversible model, and the therapeutic window of 3 hours after initiation of ischemia is identical. This effectiveness is likely due to several properties of the drug, including its known ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Because tamoxifen has been administered safely in humans for treatment of gliomas at similarly high doses to those used in this study, it may be clinically useful as a treatment for ischemic stroke.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Choroideremia has been mapped to Xq13-21 by tight linkage to restriction fragment length polymorphism loci. We have recently identified two families in which choroideremia is inherited with mental retardation and deafness. In family XL-62, an interstitial deletion in Xq21 is visible by cytogenetic analysis and two linked anonymous DNA markers, DXYS1 and DXS72, are deleted. In the second family, XL-45, an interstitial deletion was suspected on phenotypic grounds but could not be confirmed by high-resolution cytogenetic analysis. We used phenol-enhanced reassociation of 48,XXXX DNA in competition with excess XL-45 DNA to generate a library of cloned DNA enriched for sequences that might be deleted in XL-45. Two of the first 83 sequences characterized from the library were found to be deleted in probands from family XL-45 as well as from family XL-62. Isolation of these sequences proves that XL-45 does contain a submicroscopic deletion and provides a starting point for identifying overlapping genomic sequences that span the XL-45 deletion. Each overlapping sequence will be studied to identify exons from the choroideremia locus.",Human-case-report,4,0

A 51-year-old Japanese woman, who was diagnosed with multiple brain metastatic tumors, was placed on oral phenytoin at a maintenance dose of 200 mg/d (3.8 mg/kg/d) to prevent seizures. The serum concentration of phenytoin was well controlled within the therapeutic range; no seizures occurred. Four months later, combination therapy with doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) 800 mg/d, cyclophosphamide 100 mg/d, and medroxyprogesterone acetate 800 mg/d was initiated because of further metastasis. Approximately 1 month after the start of concurrent treatment with the antineoplastic agents, the serum phenytoin concentration was elevated to fourfold of the original concentration. Staggering was observed at that time, but toxic symptoms gradually subsided with the decline in the serum phenytoin concentration after its withdrawal.	A probable explanation for the marked elevation of serum phenytoin concentration is a reduction of the capacity of CYP2C-dependent phenytoin metabolism, and the antineoplastic agents could be involved in this event. The interaction of fluorouracil and phenytoin is known in clinical practice, and it is reported that the expression of hepatic CYP2C enzymes is depressed by exposure of rats to fluorouracil. 5'-DFUR, a prodrug of fluorouracil, was considered the likeliest candidate responsible for the interaction. This interaction was of clinical significance because of the great extent of changes in the serum phenytoin concentration.	Clinicians should be aware of the elevation of serum phenytoin concentrations when phenytoin is given in combination with fluorouracil derivatives, including 5'-DFUR.",Human-case-report,4,0

Some associations, although sporadic, can be particularly challenging both in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management and in terms of theoretical perspective. Here, we report a child affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). The child was diagnosed with classical T1DM at 15 months of age, with a tendency toward hypoglycemia. A few months later, during an acute intercurrent infective episode, the child displayed acute hypotonia of the lower limbs and limbs dystonia. A brain MRI showed bilateral striatal necrosis, suggesting GA1 diagnosis. Treatment with a low-lysine dietary regimen and carnitine supplementation was started and resulted in an improvement in metabolic control and a reduction of hypoglycemic episodes along with an increasing in insulin daily dose. After 2 years, the neurological outcome consisted of a reduction in dystonic movements and a metabolic stability of both diseases.	This case provides some insight into the reciprocal interconnections between the two metabolic disorders. Similar pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the neuronal injury might have impacted each other, and a strict relationship between a specific aspect of GA1-impaired metabolism and glucose homeostasis might explain how the tailored management of GA1 was not only effective in controlling the disease, but it also resulted in an improvement in the control of the glycemic profile. What in known: • Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) usually presents in childhood with severe and possibly irreversible neuronal damage, triggered by a catabolic stress • The association of GA1 with other diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), is a rare event, complicating the treatment management What is new: • Insulin treatment has a role in preventing GA1 metabolic decompensation, even in the catabolic condition of hypoglycemia • Promoting GA1 metabolic equilibrium by tailoring drug and dietary treatment in our patient affect by T1DM has a positive impact also in improving glycemic balance.",Human-case-report,4,0

HLH affecting the CNS mimics several neurological disorders and may be misdiagnosed. The diagnostic and therapeutic problems of this disease are discussed.	We report a case of a 5-year-old girl with a 2-month history of right hemiparesis. The initial magnetic resonance imaging scan mimicked the appearance of malignant glioma or cerebral infarction. By use of neuroimaging alone, it was extremely difficult to reach an appropriate diagnosis.	Pathological examination of a surgical specimen of the lesion revealed histological characteristics typical of HLH. Because of the absence of both physical and blood chemical findings of systemic HLH, the patient was diagnosed as having HLH isolated in the CNS without systemic HLH. Radiotherapy with corticosteroid administration led to complete resolution of the CNS lesions, but the duration of remission was only 3 months. The patient died secondary to refractory progression of the CNS lesion.	Radiotherapy with corticosteroid administration led to a complete resolution of the lesions, although for only a transitory remission. Although HLH is extremely rare, the existence of this disease isolated in the CNS should be documented, and further case accumulation and therapeutic investigations are needed to clarify the pathophysiological characteristics of this disease.",Human-case-report,4,0

Forty percent to 60% of patients with OCD fail to respond to available treatments. Neuroimaging studies have highlighted an association between the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms and an increased activity of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in patients with OCD. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a powerful and easy-to-use tool to modulate brain activity. Cathodal tDCS (c-tDCS) is assumed to decrease cortical excitability in the targeted brain region. We hypothesized that c-tDCS applied over the left OFC alleviates symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. We report here the case of a patient who received 10 sessions (2 mA, 20 minutes) of c-tDCS. The tDCS sessions were delivered twice a day with a 2-hour interval, with the cathode (35 cm[2]) placed over the left OFC and the anode (100 cm[2]) placed over the contralateral occipital region. No adverse event was reported. One month after the completion of the tDCS sessions, we observed a 26% reduction in severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores. These findings are consistent with a previous study reporting a similar reduction in obsessive and compulsive symptoms after a low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was given to the left OFC.

However, any focal hyperperfusion in the striatum or its related structures has not been demonstrated in previous single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging studies, which raised a concern about the pathogenesis of the striatal hypermetabolism.	To investigate the cerebral perfusion patterns of the subcortical structures by using serial technetium Tc 99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer SPECT in a case of SC, which may provide a clue for the pathophysiological mechanisms.	A case report and serial SPECT studies.	A girl aged 4 years 3 months showed severe generalized choreic movements with concomitant signs of acute pharyngitis. Results of a laboratory study taken 7 days after the onset of chorea showed elevated antistreptolysin O titer, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Other laboratory data, throat culture, echocardiography, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalography did not reveal any abnormalities. Five days after treatment with haloperidol and penicillin, the chorea began to improve slowly, and completely resolved in 2 months.	Three serial SPECT images and semiquantitative analysis of cerebral perfusion were obtained. Cerebral perfusion in the striatum and thalamus was markedly increased bilaterally during the stage of active chorea and then returned nearly to its baseline level during the convalescent phase. These cerebral perfusion patterns were concordant with semiquantitative analysis.	Hyperperfusion in both the striatum and thalamus in our patient may reflect the subcortical inflammatory processes in SC.

967,28566233,Molecular genetics and metabolism,Expanding the genetic cause of multiple sulfatase deficiency: A novel SUMF1 variant in a patient displaying a severe late infantile form of the disease.,"Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by defective cellular sulfatases. Activity of sulfatases depends on post-translational modification catalyzed by formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), encoded by the SUMF1 gene. SUMF1 pathologic variants cause MSD, a syndrome presenting with a complex phenotype. We describe the first Polish patient with MSD caused by a yet undescribed pathologic variant c.337G>A [p.Glu113Lys] (i.e. p.E113K) in heterozygous combination with the known deletion allele c.519+5_519+8del [p.Ala149_Ala173del]. The clinical picture of the patient initially suggested late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy, with developmental delay followed by regression of visual, hearing and motor abilities as the most apparent clinical symptoms. Transient signs of ichthyosis and minor dysmorphic features guided the laboratory workup towards MSD. Since MSD is a rare disease and there is a variable clinical spectrum, we thoroughly describe the clinical outcome of our patient. The FGE-E113K variant, expressed in cell culture, correctly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum but was retained intracellularly in contrast to the wild type FGE. Analysis of FGE-mediated activation of steroid sulfatase in immortalized MSD cells revealed that FGE-E113K exhibited only approx. 15% of the activity of wild type FGE. Based on the crystal structure we predict that the exchange of glutamate-113 against lysine should induce a strong destabilization of the secondary structure, possibly affecting the folding for correct disulfide bridging between C235-C346 as well as distortion of the active site groove that could affect both the intracellular stability as well as the activity of FGE. Thus, the novel variant of the SUMF1 gene obviously results in functionally impaired FGE protein leading to a severe late infantile type of MSD.",Human-case-report,4,0

We report the case of a 40-year-old man who was a known case of HIV and presented with cerebral toxoplasmosis. His Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan showed multiple ring enhancing lesions with extensive surrounding oedema in supratentorial as well as infratentorial region. Lesions were mainly located in the periventricular region as well as at the grey-white matter junction and showed enhancement in the periphery as well as a tiny nodular enhancement in the centre. Patient was started on Septran DS, empirically for toxoplasmosis and steroids to reduce intracranial pressure. On follow up MRI scan after 10 days there was a reduction in size, number and enhancement of the masses with decrease in the surrounding oedema.

976,27669997,Disability and rehabilitation,Motor skill changes and neurophysiologic adaptation to recovery-oriented virtual rehabilitation of hand function in a person with subacute stroke: a case study.,"The complexity of upper extremity (UE) behavior requires recovery of near normal neuromuscular function to minimize residual disability following a stroke. This requirement places a premium on spontaneous recovery and neuroplastic adaptation to rehabilitation by the lesioned hemisphere. Motor skill learning is frequently cited as a requirement for neuroplasticity. Studies examining the links between training, motor learning, neuroplasticity, and improvements in hand motor function are indicated.	This case study describes a patient with slow recovering hand and finger movement (Total Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer examination score = 25/66, Wrist and Hand items = 2/24 on poststroke day 37) following a stroke. The patient received an intensive eight-session intervention utilizing simulated activities that focused on the recovery of finger extension, finger individuation, and pinch-grasp force modulation.	Over the eight sessions, the patient demonstrated improvements on untrained transfer tasks, which suggest that motor learning had occurred, as well a dramatic increase in hand function and corresponding expansion of the cortical motor map area representing several key muscles of the paretic hand. Recovery of hand function and motor map expansion continued after discharge through the three-month retention testing.	This case study describes a neuroplasticity based intervention for UE hemiparesis and a model for examining the relationship between training, motor skill acquisition, neuroplasticity, and motor function changes. Implications for rehabilitation Intensive hand and finger rehabilitation activities can be added to an in-patient rehabilitation program for persons with subacute stroke. Targeted training of the thumb may have an impact on activity level function in persons with upper extremity hemiparesis. Untrained transfer tasks can be utilized to confirm that training tasks have elicited motor learning. Changes in cortical motor maps can be used to document changes in brain function which can be used to evaluate changes in motor behavior persons with subacute stroke.",Human-case-report,4,0

Takotsubo syndrome and its peculiar clinical presentation is not commonly reported in the paediatric population, yet the high likelihood of this diagnosis joining the dots up for this case invites our curiosity and reflection through the clinical management of this case.	A previously healthy 9-month-old local Chinese boy presented with generalised seizures secondary to acute severe brain injury, with signs of sympathetic overdrive, followed by rapidly progressive cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure, eventually requiring ECMO support. Neuroimaging at presentation revealed bilateral subdural haemorrhages. His cardiac function recovered within the next 24 h revealing the reversibility nature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.	This is a captivating case depicting a series of unfortunate and unpredictable clinical events occurring in a previously well infant, which at initial presentation challenged the managing team with regards to its exact aetiology of acute brain injury and acute cardiorespiratory failure. Consideration of various differential diagnoses and finally narrowing down to that of stress-induced reversible cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome) following his intracranial bleed, versus that of coexisting dual pathology - acute brain injury with concomitant acute viral myocarditis, deepened our understanding of the pathophysiology of each disease process, and how it possibly interlinks between different organ systems.",Human-case-report,4,0

MSA is a degenerative neurological condition that includes olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Shy-Drager syndrome and striatonigral degeneration. The usual predominant features of MSA are cerebellar ataxia, autonomic dysfunction and Parkinsonism. Stridor is present in over one third of patients and has been reported previously as a presenting symptom in MSA: however previously reported patients have always gone on to develop other neurological symptoms. The usual investigations of bilateral abductor vocal fold paralysis caused by MSA will not reveal the pathological process and we believe that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the medulla and brain stem and autonomic function tests are probably the investigations of choice. It is a worthwhile exercise attempting to identify MSA as the cause of stridor as the prognosis is good in the medium term if appropriate support is offered.",Human-case-report,4,0

A 53-year-old female had developed slowly progressive dementia and atactic gait since the age of 45. No myoclonic jerks and periodic synchronous discharges were observed throughout the illness. The neuropathological study revealed that many amyloid plaques and widespread Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) appeared in the cerebral cortex. Characteristically, the plaques reacted with anti-prion protein and none of them reacted with anti-beta protein, and they were made of many components, including amyloid cores, macrophages laden with lipid granules and/or degenerated neurites. Neuropil threads were seen mainly in amyloid plaques. Moreover, plaques appeared which were confluent and laminar in arrangement in the fifth and sixth cortical layers and had a close relationship to the neuronal loss. There was no spongiform change in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. The cerebellum was almost intact except for a few amyloid plaques. Ultrastructurally, some of the plaques simulated kuru plaques and others had many degenerated neurites possessing paired helical filaments and other accumulated organelles. GSS has been proposed to include cases with progressive ataxia, dementia and massive multifocal plaques in the brain with or without cerebral spongiform changes. The case presented here is a very peculiar case of GSS. Recently, similar cases have been reported in some large families, diagnosed as familial Alzheimer's disease.

Interestingly, some lymphoma cells form characteristic spindle shapes; these cells are found in some variants of malignant lymphoma, such as primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma, but they have not been reported in PCNSL or LC. Here, we provide an autopsy case report of LC in a 69-year-old immunocompetent man who developed rapidly progressive cognitive decline and died on day 68 after the episode despite treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone administration. MRI revealed high signal intensities on T2-weighted images of the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord without gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted images. On autopsy, diffuse infiltrative atypical cells were seen; these cells were positive for CD20 and CD79a and negative for GFAP, CD3, and CD5 on immunohistochemistry, resulting in a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, specifically LC. We found characteristic spindle-shaped cells, especially in the cerebral cortex. This is the first report showing that lymphoma cells in PCNSL can take on a spindle-shaped form. It is difficult to recognize these spindle-shaped cells as lymphoma cells on hematoxylin and eosin staining and diagnose them correctly with small biopsy specimens without immunohistochemistry.

1010,20625692,Clinical neuroradiology,[Intracerebral hemorrhage misjudged as tumor].,"Report of a 33-year-old woman who had sudden vision problems and homonymous hemianopia on the left. A cranial computed tomography (CCT) was carried out in a radiologic practice. A native homogeneous, smooth-edged hyperdense intracerebral mass of about 5.5 cm diameter on the right parietooccipital region with density values of +50 HU was found. Only a small proportion of about 2 cm diameter was more hyperdense with density values of +65 HU. Following intravenous administration of contrast medium, a patchy increase in density of about 1 cm was seen. The mass had only a thin hypodense rim. The patient was informed that she had a tumor. Three days later, magnetic resonance imaging was to be done for further evaluation. After the patient had returned home, she had headaches, nausea and vomiting in the evening. At night, she was admitted to a hospital as emergency case. With further increase of intracranial pressure, a craniotomy was done and a hemorrhage was removed. Histologically, a bleeding of a cavernous hemangioma was found. The patient appealed to the fact-finding board for medical liability questions because she had not been admitted to a hospital immediately after the CCT. Therefore, surgery was done delayed. The board found that the behavior of the radiologist was wrong. However, it cannot be proven that this medical malpractice is of importance for the existing postoperative complaints.",Human-case-report,4,0
1011,11965850,Medicina,[Cadasil: a case with molecular diagnosis].,"CADASIL disease (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) was described in 1991 by Tourmier-Lasserve. Two years later the same authors described its association with chromosome 19; nonetheless, the mutations in gene Notch3 were not described until 1996. Clinical findings depend on the age at onset. The early form of the illness is found in young patients, generally less than 30 years old, and the main clinical manifestation is a migraine headache with subcortical lesions in the white matter, while in the later form ischemic events and behavioral symptoms are predominant. Anatomo-pathological findings in CADASIL include the presence of osmophilic granular deposits in vessel walls, skin, muscles and cerebral arteries. We present a patient with CADASIL and cavernous angioma. We studied a 40-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a left temporal-parietal cavernous angioma, with aphasia as the only symptom, two years before admission. Her family history showed that her father had suffered from vascular dementia. She was admitted to our hospital with right-side hemiparesis and dysarthria. A CT scan showed the presence of ischemic vascular lesions and former surgery sequelae. The duplex scan of the neck vessels and a transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out an embolic source. Laboratory tests including VDRL, HIV, prothrombotic profile and rheumatologic screening tests were normal. An MRI in T2W and FLAIR showed the presence of multiple subcortical cerebral lesions and hyperintensity in the white matter (leukoencephalopaty). We found a left acute putaminal-capsular infarct in the diffusion-MRI. The MRA was normal. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid was unremarkable. A molecular DNA test was performed, and a nucleotide substitution in position 583 in exon 4 of gene Notch3 was detected. This mutation was found only in CADASIL patients. The association with cavernous angioma has not been previously reported, and we believe that it was unrelated to CADASIL, either clinically or genetically. To our knowledge, this is the first case of CADASIL diagnosed by molecular DNA test in our country.",Human-case-report,4,0
1012,23240849,Journal of neurosurgery. Pediatrics,Malignant glioma with angiocentric features.,"Angiocentric glioma is a recently recognized benign brain tumor with unknown histogenesis. Most of these tumors are mitotically low in activity in accord with their benign clinical course. However, increased mitotic activity has been noted in several cases, one of which had an ultimately fatal outcome. Here, the authors present a tumor showing angiocentric glioma and glioblastoma-like features, with recurrence of the lower-grade component after radiotherapy. A 15-year-old boy presented with a 3-month history of progressive left-sided weakness and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large heterogeneous mass in the right frontal lobe, with mild post-Gd enhancement. A gross-total resection was obtained. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue revealed a tumor with 2 distinct appearances: 1) a mildly to moderately cellular infiltrating tumor with angiocentric glioma characteristics, and 2) a markedly cellular glioblastoma-like tissue with necrosis and microvascular proliferation. The patient received a course of postoperative radiotherapy to 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions administered over the course of 6.5 weeks, but his tumor recurred 4 months after resection. A second resection was then performed. The recurrent tumor exhibited radiation-induced changes and persistent characteristics of angiocentric glioma, but it had fewer malignant features; the mitotic activity was lower, and there was no necrosis or microvascular proliferation. The findings in this case, along with those in several previously reported cases, suggest that angiocentric gliomas may have a malignant variant or malignant transformation. Angiocentric gliomas with malignant features tend to recur, for which surgical intervention followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be offered as a therapeutic option.",Human-case-report,4,0

Prodromal AD was consistently diagnosed with four among amyloidosis and neurodegeneration biomarkers about 1 year after onset of seizures. Genetic assessment demonstrated apolipoprotein E ε2/ε3 genotype and three intronic single nucleotide substitutions, two in presenilin 1 and one in amyloid-β protein precursor genes.

Despite the prevalence of this clinical entity, it is our impression that the management strategies for these patients vary significantly amongst pediatric neurosurgeons. In an effort to better understand how varied these practices are, we surveyed 261 neurosurgeons with an expressed interest in pediatric neurosurgery, of whom 149 (57%) responded. The survey contained questions pertaining to preoperative and intraoperative management, choice of shunt valve, treatment philosophies with respect to shunt revision, evaluation process for potential shunt malfunction, treatment strategies for shunt infections and routine follow-up care.

1021,32594193,Experimental brain research,Dopamine boosts intention and action awareness in Parkinson's disease.,"Dopaminergic deficiency in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with underactivation of the supplementary motor area and a reduction of voluntary actions. In these patients, awareness of intention to act has been shown to be delayed. However, delayed awareness of intention to act has also been shown in patients with hyperdopaminergic states and an excess of unwilled movements, as in Tourette's, and in patients with functional movement disorders. Hence, the role of dopamine in the awareness of intention and action remains unclear. 36 PD patients were tested ON and OFF dopaminergic medication and compared with 35 healthy age-matched controls. In addition, 17 PD patients with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) were tested ON medication and ON and OFF stimulation. Participants judged either the moment a self-generated action was performed, or the moment the urge to perform the action was felt, using the 'Libet method'. Temporal judgments of intention and action awareness were comparable between unmedicated PD patients and controls. Dopaminergic medication boosted anticipatory awareness of both intentions and actions in PD patients, relative to an unmedicated condition. The difference between ON/OFF DBS was not statistically reliable. Functional improvement of motor ability in PD through dopaminergic supplementation leads to earlier awareness of both intention, and of voluntary action.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1022,8895943,Pharmacopsychiatry,Low plasma thyroid indices of depressed patients are attenuated by antidepressant drugs and influence treatment outcome.,"Decreased turnover of thyroid indices and blunting of TSH release after TRH administration has been associated with depressive disorder. A further decrease in plasma thyroid hormone; during antidepressant treatment has been reported. However, the putative association between the plasma thyroid indices' concentration and response has not been addressed. In the present study 21 depressed inpatients underwent a four-week double blind antidepressant with amitriptyline and mianserin; their plasma thyroid hormone indices (total thyroxine [TT4], free thyroxine [FT4], total triiodothyronine [TT3], free triiodothyronine [FT3], thyrotropin [TSH], and thyroglobulin [TBG]) were quantified to elucidate their involvement in depression and during antidepressant drug treatment. Depressed patients' plasma TSH, when corrected for age, was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects. During antidepressant treatment the entire patient cohort showed a significant decrease in plasma TT4 and FT4 concentrations. Responders showed a significant drop in TT4 FT4, FT3, and T4/TBG, but nonresponders only a decrease in FT4. During mianserin treatment, a decrease was observed in TT4, FT4, FT3, and T4/TBG. FT4 and FT3 baseline levels correlated positively with the improvement in the Hamilton Depression Rating Score (HDRS). These findings show that depressed inpatients' serum TSH levels are within the reference range, but significantly lower than those of healthy subjects, and those patients who turn out to be nonresponders have potentially lower availability of thyroid hormones than responders. Therefore, we hypothesize that in order to assure clinical improvement in depression, an adequate capacity of the thyroid hormone pool is necessary to compensate for the additional antidepressant-provoked decrease in serum thyroid hormone availability.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The Liberal belgian opiate medical substitution process authorizes untill now de facto any doctor to prescribe methadone and pharmacists are supported to dispense it. Results show the regional, provincial and county numbers of professionals and patients prevalence in the population.

Subutex or Suboxone have been dispensed to 11,1% of substitution patients with 7,4% receiving only buprenorphine on a yearly basis. Number of substitution patients by MD and prevalence by gender, age group and region are presented. Important variations are observed locally, possibly mirroring heroin addiction due to widespread access to substitution treatment. Younger patients are more prevalent in semi rural or border areas. The exhaustivity of available data enables also to observe patients quitting substitution altogether and a strong difference of maintenance rate is observed favoring methadone over buprenorphine.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The present investigation followed prospectively long-term BZD users over 1 year following graded BZD withdrawal in terms of clinical and withdrawal symptoms.	Clinical symptoms were measured by the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) and by the Newcastle Anxiety and Depression Diagnostic Index (NADDI) in a sample of BZD users over a 50-week period following graded BZD withdrawal.	The results showed that the frequency and severity of clinical symptomatology measured by both scales significantly decreased over time. A detailed analysis of possible patterns of symptoms on both scales revealed four patterns: 1) a gradual decrease over the 50-week time period; 2) an increase in the severity of symptoms at the onset of tapering and a decrease in severity post-tapering; 3) an increase in the severity of symptoms 4 weeks after the cessation of BZD tapering; and 4) no change over the 50-week time period. Rate of BZD withdrawal was associated with CPRS ratings of global illness at admission and at end of treatment, but was not associated with duration or dosage of BZDs, type of BZD, prescriptive and/or non-prescriptive drug use prior to admission, marital status, sex or age.

In a 16-week follow-up, SR-VF daily dose could be modified on the basis of the therapeutic response and of the side effect profile. Symptomatological modifications were explored by means of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). SR-VF was well tolerated and only 2 patients interrupted the treatment before 24 weeks; the mean final dose +/- SD was 135.5 +/- 71.8 mg (range 75-225); in 26 (81.2%) patients, a statistically significant response was observed in depressive symptomatology within the first 8 weeks. The mean total score of HAM-D showed a significant reduction during the first 8 weeks of treatment, while the mean total score of HAM-A did not present a significant reduction until week 24. In patients with MD, a statistically significant response was observed after the first 8 weeks, while the reduction of the anxiety scores required more time and, in some cases, did not appear at all. Conversely, in patients with GAD and dysthymia, anxious and depressive symptomatology improved simultaneously. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that the improvement of depression is negatively related to a high score of CGI anxiety severity, and the improvement of anxiety is related to the presence of dysthymia and, to a lesser extent, to a short duration of the illness. Our data confirm the effectiveness and tolerability of SR-VF in mixed anxiety-depressive states.

Access to preventive health care services, including genital human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations, may mitigate the impact of ACEs on adverse health outcomes. Our objective was to assess associations between ACEs and HPV vaccination coverage among young adults.	We included 3415 respondents aged 18 to 29 years to the 2019-2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ACE and HPV vaccination modules. Adverse childhood experiences included emotional, physical, and sexual abuse; household intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and mental illness; and parental separation/divorce and incarcerated household member. We used log-binomial regression models to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between ACEs and self-reported HPV vaccination and completion. Secondary outcomes included influenza vaccination uptake, time since routine checkup, HIV testing history, and HIV-related risk behavior.	Several ACEs were positively associated with HPV vaccination initiation, including emotional abuse (PR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.43), intimate partner violence (PR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30), substance abuse (PR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.33), and mental illness (PR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.22-1.50). Similar associations were observed for completion. Conversely, most ACEs were negatively associated with influenza vaccination (PRs from 0.72 to 1.00) and with recent checkup (PRs from 0.92 to 1.00). Adverse childhood experiences were positively associated with having had an HIV test (PRs from 1.19 to 1.56) and HIV-related risk behavior (PRs from 1.19 to 2.07).	The unexpected positive associations between ACEs and HPV vaccination coverage could be due to opportunities to receive HPV vaccination in late adolescence or early adulthood while accessing STI/HIV prevention or treatment services. Future studies should evaluate associations between ACEs and timely HPV vaccination in early adolescence.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Using a nationwide insurance claims database, Clinformatics DataMart Database, we identified opioid-naïve patients who underwent surgical treatment of unstable ankle fracture patterns between January 2009 and June 2016. Patients who underwent closed treatment of a distal fibula fracture served as a comparative group. We evaluated peritreatment and posttreatment opioid prescription fills. The primary outcome, new persistent opioid use, was defined as opioid prescription fulfillment between 91 and 180 days after the procedure. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of patient factors, and the differences of the effect were tested using Wald statistics. The adjusted persistent use rates were calculated. A total of 13 088 patients underwent treatment of an ankle fracture and filled a peritreatment opioid prescription.	When compared with closed treatment of a distal fibula fracture, only 2 surgical treatment subtypes demonstrated significantly increased rates of persistent use compared with the closed treatment group: open treatment of bimalleolar ankle fracture (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.58; P = .002) and open treatment of trimalleolar ankle fracture with fixation of posterior lip (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04-2.07; P = .027). Rates were significantly increased (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.34-1.82; P < .001) among patients who received a total peritreatment opioid dose that was in the top 25th percentile of total oral morphine equivalents. Factors independently associated with new persistent opioid use included mental health disorders, comorbid conditions, tobacco use, and female sex.	All ankle fracture treatment groups demonstrated high rates of new persistent opioid use, and persistent use was not directly linked to injury severity. Instead, we identified patient factors that demonstrated increased risk of persistent opioid use. Limiting the peritreatment opioid dose was the largest modifiable risk factor related to new persistent opioid use in this privately insured cohort.

1032,37178103,Annals of emergency medicine,Tenecteplase Versus Alteplase for Acute Stroke: Mortality and Bleeding Complications.,"Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase has been the foundation of initial treatment of acute ischemic stroke for several decades. Tenecteplase is a thrombolytic agent that offers logistical advantages in cost and administration relative to alteplase. There is evidence that tenecteplase has at least similar efficacy and safety outcomes compared with alteplase for stroke. In this study, we compared tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute stroke in a large retrospective US database (TriNetX) regarding the following 3 outcomes: (1) mortality, (2) intracranial hemorrhage, and (3) the need for acute blood transfusions.	In this retrospective study using the US cohort of 54 academic medical centers/health care organizations in the TriNetX database, we identified 3,432 patients treated with tenecteplase and 55,894 patients treated with alteplase for stroke after January 1, 2012. Propensity score matching was performed on basic demographic information and 7 previous clinical diagnostic groups, resulting in a total of 6,864 patients with acute stroke evenly matched between groups. Mortality rates, the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage, and blood transfusions (as a marker of significant blood loss) were recorded for each group over the ensuing 7- and 30-day periods. Secondary subgroup analyses were conducted on a cohort treated from 2021 to 2022 in an attempt to determine whether temporal differences in acute ischemic stroke treatment would alter the results.	Patients treated with tenecteplase had a significantly lower mortality rate (8.2% versus 9.8%; risk ratio [RR], 0.832) and lower risk of major bleeding as measured by the frequency of blood transfusions (0.3% versus 1.4%; RR, 0.207) than alteplase at 30 days after thrombolysis for stroke. In the larger 10-year data set of patients with stroke treated after January 1, 2012, patients receiving tenecteplase were not found to have a statistically different incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (3.5% versus 3.0%; RR, 1.185) at 30 days after the administration of the thrombolytic agents in patients. However, a subgroup analysis of 2,216 evenly matched patients with stroke treated from 2021 to 2022 demonstrated notably better survival and statistically lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage than the alteplase group.	In our large retrospective multicenter study using real-world evidence from large health care organizations, tenecteplase for the treatment of acute stroke demonstrated a lower mortality rate, decreased intracranial hemorrhage, and less significant blood loss. The favorable mortality and safety profiles observed in this large study, taken together with previous randomized controlled trial data and operational advantages in rapid dosing and cost-effectiveness, all support the preferential use of tenecteplase in patients with ischemic stroke.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

All patients and comparison participants (n = 9) completed baseline 31P-MRSI scans, and 9 patients completed posttherapy scans. The percentage changes for MADRS scores (Week 2, -23.8; Week 3, -34.9; Week 4, -42.5) and the time effects of TAU on MADRS scores (Week 2, z = -2.07, p = .039; Week 3, z = -4.28, p < .001; Week 4, z = -4.54, p < .001) may reflect TAU effects on early symptom improvement. TAU responders (patients who had a 50% or greater reduction in MADRS scores from baseline at any time) demonstrated a significant difference from nonresponders in pH changes from baseline (effect size = 150). These results suggest that TAU treatment may decrease symptoms of depression and improve mitochondrial functioning.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

We investigated whether response to the EBP was related to the distance of the injection site from the leakage site in patients with SIH.	We reviewed patients with SIH who underwent EBP at a single hospital. Patients were assigned to group R (response after EBP) or group N (no response after EBP). We then analyzed the demographics, clinical characteristics, leakage site, leakage length, EBP injection level and distance from leakage site, and injected EBP volume.	Sixty-two patients were included in the analysis. The overall response rate to EBP was 59.7% (37 patients). The leakage length and injection distance from the leakage site did not differ between the two groups. Age, gender, body mass index, leakage site, and EBP volume did not differ significantly between the two groups.	The clinical effect of EBP in SIH was not affected by leakage length or injection distance to leakage site. Further large studies must be conducted to investigate the efficacy of targeted EBP for SIH.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The International Collaboration on Endocarditis - Prospective Cohort Study database was used in this observational study. Multivariable analysis of the SA-IE cohort compared outcomes in patients with and without ASA use, adjusting for other predictive variables, including: age, diabetes, hemodialysis, cancer, pacemaker, intracardiac defibrillator and methicillin resistance.	Data were analysed from 670 patients, 132 of whom were taking ASA at the time of SA-IE diagnosis. On multivariable analysis, ASA usage was associated with a significantly decreased overall rate of acute valve replacement surgery (OR 0.58 [95% CI 0.35-0.97]; p<0.04), particularly where valvular regurgitation, congestive heart failure or periannular abscess was the indication for such surgery (OR 0.46 [0.25-0.86]; p<0.02). There was no reduction in the overall rates of clinically apparent embolism with prior ASA usage, and no increase in hemorrhagic strokes in ASA-treated patients.	In this multinational prospective observational cohort, recent ASA usage was associated with a reduced occurrence of acute valve replacement surgery in SA-IE patients. Future investigations should focus on ASA's prophylactic and therapeutic use in high-risk and newly diagnosed patients with SA bacteremia and SA-IE, respectively.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This retrospective chart review included veterans who had an active order of lithium during their non-psychiatric or psychiatric inpatient stay over the time period of January 2000 to September 2011. Chi-square tests were used for data analysis. Frequency of appropriate lithium monitoring was assessed using standards set by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines for bipolar disorder.	A total of 200 patients (100 for each group) were included in the final analysis. Psychiatric inpatients had more frequent serum lithium levels measured during inpatient stay (p = 0.0002), whereas nonpsychiatric patients had more frequent renal monitoring (p = 0.0001). Non-psychiatric patients were significantly more likely to have action taken upon abnormal safety assessments (p = 0.0075).	Our results demonstrate significant differences between the non-psychiatric and psychiatric inpatient settings in respect to monitoring lithium. The frequency of serum lithium level monitoring in both groups was below the level set by both the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines. Additionally, frequency of corrective measures in both settings was low, indicating a need for improvement in this area.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of aminocaproic acid (AMICAR), an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, on all hemorrhagic complications of ECMO including intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In 1990, 49 neonates and 5 older children received ECMO therapy. None of these patients received AMICAR. In 1991, 51 neonates and 5 older children received ECMO. Forty-two of these patients who were considered to be at high risk for bleeding complications (preexisting or anticipated surgical procedures, preexisting ICH, or profound hypoxia, acidosis, coagulopathy, or prematurity) were given AMICAR. The remaining 14 low-risk neonates did not receive AMICAR, and for purposes of analysis were combined with the 1990 group. AMICAR was administered just prior to or after cannulation (100 mg/kg, intravenously) and was infused continuously at 30 mg/kg/h until decannulation. Except for the addition of AMICAR, the ECMO protocol was identical for these two patient groups. Patients who received AMICAR had significantly less bleeding while on ECMO (P = .03) and required fewer blood transfusions (P = .01) than patients not receiving AMICAR. This difference was most significant in the congenital diaphragmatic hernia and cardiac subgroups (P = .0001) and was not significant in the meconium aspiration subgroup (P = .1). The incidence of ICH in the neonatal subgroup was also significantly reduced with no patient on AMICAR developing a new or extending a preexisting ICH (P = .007). Reexploration of the cannulation site for bleeding was also reduced in the AMICAR-treated group but the difference failed to reach statistical significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Cardioembolic stroke patients were treated with drip intravenous infusion of edaravone (ED group, n=141) for 7 days, and were retrospectively compared with a historical-controlled cohort of similar patients (control group, n=114).	Early improvement (between day 0 and day 10), defined as change in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), was seen more frequently in mild patients (NIHSS on admission < or = 7) among the ED group than in the control group (change in NIHSS +2 vs. -2, respectively, p=0.013). Similar efficacy was not seen in the moderate to severe (NIHSS >7) patients. Independent patients (modified Rankin Scale < or = 2) 6 months after the onset were likely to be less frequent in the ED than the control group (28% versus 41%; p=0.066).

1041,15642876,Archives of internal medicine,Statin use and survival outcomes in elderly patients with heart failure.,"Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of heart failure. Statins are efficacious drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, but their value in persons with heart failure remains unknown.	We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study involving the entire province of Ontario, Canada, restricting participants to those aged 66 to 85 years who were free of cancer and who survived at least 90 days following hospitalization for newly diagnosed heart failure. The primary study outcome was the risk of death from all causes, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke among persons newly dispensed statins (n = 1,146) relative to those who were not (n = 27,682).	The mean age of all participants was 76.5 years, and half were women. During the 7-year study period, death, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 217 statin recipients (13.6 per 100 person-years) vs 12,299 nonrecipients (21.8 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.83). Most of the benefit from statins was related to a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78). No significant reduction was seen for subsequent myocardial infarction (adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63-1.03) or stroke (adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.53-1.25).	Statin use is associated with a lower risk of death among seniors newly diagnosed as having congestive heart failure. While statin use has been previously shown to be efficacious in patients with coronary heart disease and stroke, we could not control for all prognostic risk factors in the present study, including left ventricular ejection fraction and serum lipid levels. Better evidence can direct clinicians about which patients with heart failure might benefit from these drugs.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This population-based study was based on an analysis of data collected by the Neonatal Research Network of Japan from 2003 to 2015 of neonates weighing 1,500 g or less at birth, from gestational ages of 24 0/7 to 31 6/7 weeks of gestation. After propensity score matching, univariate logistic and interaction analyses were performed to compare short-term (neonatal period) and medium-term (3 years of age) outcomes of the children of mothers who received antenatal corticosteroids with those of children of mothers who did not receive antenatal corticosteroids. We focused on differences between singletons and twins, between monochorionic and dichorionic twins and between the first and second twin.	The study comprised 23,502 singletons and 6,546 twins. Antenatal corticosteroid treatment was associated with significant decreased short-term neurologic outcomes in both singletons and twins. However, antenatal corticosteroid treatment was associated with significantly decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.53-0.70), respiratory distress syndrome (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67-0.76), and cerebral palsy (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) in singletons but not in twins (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68-1.17; OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87-1.12; and OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61-1.11, respectively). No association was found between chorionicity and the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on outcomes. Further, no association was found between birth order and the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on outcomes, except for periventricular leukomalacia and necrotizing enterocolitis (interaction: P=.02 and P=.04, respectively).	Antenatal corticosteroid treatment in twins was associated with a beneficial effect on short-term neurologic outcomes only, without improvement in other short-term and medium-term outcomes.

These pharmacogenetics findings have been reported from independent cohorts of patients mostly treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressant, and mirtazapine. Tianeptine, an atypical antidepressant, recently identified as a mu opioid receptor agonist, which prevents and reverses the stress induced by glucocorticoids, has been investigated in this present pharmacogenetics study. More than 3200 Caucasian outpatients with a major depressive episode (MDE) from real-life settings were herein analyzed for clinical response to tianeptine, a treatment initiated from 79.5% of the subjects, during 6-8 weeks follow-up, assessing polymorphisms targeting four genes involved in the HPA axis (NR3C1, FKPB5, CRHR1, and AVPR1B). We found a significant association (p < 0.001) between CRHR1 gene variants rs878886 and rs16940665, or haplotype rs878886*C-rs16940665*T, and tianeptine antidepressant response and remission according to the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Analyses, including a structural equation model with simple mediation, suggest a moderate effect of sociodemographic characteristics and depressive disorder features on treatment response in individuals carrying the antidepressant responder allele rs8788861 (allele C). These findings suggest direct pharmacological consequences of CRHR1 polymorphisms in the antidepressant tianeptine response and remission, in MDE patients. This study replicates the association of the CRHR1 gene, involved in the HPA axis, with (1) a specificity attributed to treatment response, (2) a lower risk of chance finding, and in (3) an ecological situation.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Retrospective clinical data from 81 adult and paediatric epileptic patients with one trough VPA serum concentration per patient were analysed using NONMEM to estimate drug CL and determine the influence of different covariates. A qualification group of 20 epileptic children (3-13 years old) was used to evaluate the final model.	The population CL as estimated by base model (no covariates) was 0.581 l h(-1) with inter-individual variability (C.V. %) of 17.4% and SD of residual error was 6.82 mg l(-1). Univariate selection and backward deletion of different covariates led to the development of the final regression model of CL as follows: CL(Lh-1) = 0.101 + 0.151 * CBZ + 0.000248 * VPADD + 0.0968 * age/20 + 0.0803 * INDI, in which CBZ indicates co-administration of carbamazepine, VPADD the daily dose of VPA and INDI uncontrolled epilepsy. The between-subject variability in CL was 23.6% while the standard deviation of the residual error was 5.24 mg l(-1). The model predictions in the qualification group were found to have no bias and satisfactory precision.	The population pharmacokinetic model for VPA could be used for a priori recommendation and dose optimisation of that drug in the Egyptian population of epileptic patients.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

A review of medical records was carried out to detect BRV administration in SE patients treated in Frankfurt and Greifswald during the period February 2016 to January 2017. The primary outcome question concerned SE resolution after BRV initiation.	During that period, BRV was started with eleven adult patients with SE. Five of these were female, and the median age was 64 (interquartile range [IQR] 21years). The median SE duration before BRV initiation was 5days (IQR 9days); the median number of previous anticonvulsants used was 4 (IQR 5). Initial BRV doses ranged between 50mg and 400mg (median 100mg), titrated to a daily dose of 100 to 400mg (median 200mg). There was a cessation of SE in the first 24h of BRV in three patients (27%). While taking BRV, no serious side effects were seen.	Based on these cases and previous data from animal experiments, BRV may prove useful in SE treatment, and trials would be warranted to examine BRV's efficacy in treating SE and how this efficacy might be influenced by co-administration with levetiracetam.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The aim of this study was to identify which factors are predictive of buprenorphine injection in patients receiving office-based buprenorphine.	Subazur is a survey consisting of two longitudinal assessments of 111 stabilized patients receiving office-based buprenorphine in southeastern France.	Patients were interviewed by phone at enrolment and 6 months later about social characteristics, addictive behaviors, treatment experiences, overdoses and suicide ideation or attempt. A logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to identify factors associated with buprenorphine injection at any interview.	Among the 111 patients (32% women, mean age 38 years), 36 reported buprenorphine injection after having started treatment initiation in 40 interviews. After adjustment for time since first injection, individuals perceiving their prescribed dosage as inadequate (OR=2.6 95%CI[1.2-5.7]) and those reporting a history of suicide ideation or attempt (OR=2.7 95%CI[1.1-7.0]) had approximately a three-fold higher risk of injecting buprenorphine.	Providing adequate care for both drug dependence and psychiatric comorbidities in primary care is a major issue. Like heroin use during methadone treatment, buprenorphine injection should be regarded more as a response to inadequate care than simply as a 'misuse'. A re-assessment of the treatment efficacy through a possible dosage increase or a switch to methadone could potentially reduce diversion and assure sustained adherence to OST.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This retrospective cohort study included patients who were medically admitted for pneumonia to a 2,059-bed academic medical center or its associated health system hospital. Medical records of 872 admissions from November 1, 2016 to December 15, 2018, were included for all adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder prescribed clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone prior to admission.	There was no significantly increased risk of pneumonia for patients taking olanzapine (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% CI, 0.48-2.41) or quetiapine (OR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.42-2.25) prior to admission compared to risperidone.

The findings of this study in combination with other published literature support an association of an increased risk of pneumonia with the use of clozapine, although this cannot be interpreted as causal. These data show that use of clozapine alone or in combination with other antipsychotics significantly increases risk of pneumonia, although this finding cannot be deemed causal due to study design.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

An open-label, conversion study was conducted, consisting of a 2-week LTG-IR Baseline Phase, followed by a 2-week LTG-XR Treatment Phase and a 1-week LTG-IR Phase. Forty-four subjects (> or =13 years of age) were enrolled and grouped as metabolically neutral (15), induced (15), or inhibited (14) based on the effects of the concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the clearance of LTG. The primary outcome was LTG PK parameters upon conversion. Secondary outcomes included seizure frequency, adverse events, and subject's preference.	LTG-XR and LTG-IR regimens were similar with respect to area under curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC (0-24)), apart from the induced group, where the AUC (0-24) of LTG-XR was on average 21% lower than for LTG-IR. A reduction in the LTG Cmax was observed for LTG-XR compared to LTG-IR resulting in a decrease in the peak-to-trough fluctuation in serum LTG concentrations. The steady-state, dose-normalized, trough concentrations for LTG-XR were similar to those of LTG-IR. The median time to peak concentration (Tmax) following administration of LTG-XR ranged from 4 to 6 h, 6 to 10 h, and 9 to 11 h in the induced, neutral, and inhibited groups, respectively. In comparison, the median Tmax following administration of LTG-IR was between 1 and 1.5 h.

1050,29580855,Journal of vascular surgery,Statin therapy is associated with higher long-term but not perioperative survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.,"Although preoperative and perioperative statin therapy improves postoperative outcomes in several populations, few data examine its association with survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. In addition, no data exist regarding the benefits of starting statins in patients with AAA not currently taking them.	We performed a registry-based study of all patients undergoing repair of AAAs in the Vascular Quality Initiative between 2003 and 2017 without documented statin intolerance. In our primary analysis, we evaluated the association between preoperative statin therapy and long-term mortality, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital myocardial infarction and stroke. As a secondary analysis, we studied the cohort of patients not taking a statin preoperatively and compared their long-term mortality on the basis of whether they were discharged on a statin. To account for nonrandom assignment to treatment, we constructed propensity scores and applied inverse probability weighting.	We identified 40,452 AAA repairs, of which 37,950 fit our entry criteria (29,257 endovascular and 8693 open). Overall, 25,997 patients (69%) were taking a statin preoperatively, with patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair more frequently taking a statin than those undergoing open repair (69% compared with 66%; P < .001). After propensity weighting, preoperative statin therapy was not associated with 30-day death or in-hospital stroke or myocardial infarction. However, patients taking statins preoperatively experienced higher adjusted 1-year (94% vs 90%) and 5-year (85% vs 81%) survival from the date of surgery compared with those who were not (P < .001 overall), although subgroup analysis showed that this applied only to intact or symptomatic aneurysms. Of the 11,941 patients not taking a statin preoperatively and discharged alive, 2910 (24%) started on a statin before discharge. In our secondary analysis of the subset of patients not taking statins preoperatively, those initiated on a statin before discharge experienced higher survival at 1 year (94% vs 91%) and 5 years (89% vs 81%; P < .001 overall) than those who remained off statin therapy, with the greatest absolute long-term survival difference in patients with rupture (87% vs 62%; P < .001 overall).	Preoperative statin therapy is associated with higher long-term survival but not perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing AAA repair, and initiating statin therapy in previously statin-naive patients is associated with markedly higher survival. All patients with AAAs without contraindications should receive statin therapy. In patients not taking a statin at the time of AAA repair, clinicians should consider initiating one before discharge.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Thirteen DSM-IV pure depressed-phase nonpsychotic bipolar outpatients received an open-label 8-week pilot trial of flexibly dosed nefazodone (mean±SD peak dose=462.5±164.0mg/day) with a concurrent mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic. Primary outcomes included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI-S).	All subjects completed at least 4 weeks of treatment, while 9 (69%) completed the 8-week protocol. Based on last observation point, 8 (62%) had at least a 50% reduction from baseline HAM-D scores. Significant improvement from baseline was observed in both HAM-D (z=2.05, p=.04) and CGI severity ratings (z=2.21, p=.03). Induction of mania occurred in 1 subject (7%). No subjects manifested clinical signs of hepatic failure, and none prematurely terminated the study due to other adverse events (most common side effects included fatigue, insomnia, nausea, or headache).	This was a small open-label pilot study with use of varied concomitant pharmacotherapies and no placebo comparator.	While nefazodone is seldom used in clinical practice due to concerns about rare but severe hepatotoxicity, it may represent a model for postsynaptic 5HT(2A) antagonism that mechanistically could help to inform the development of future treatments for bipolar depression.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The treatment results were evaluated by the ADHD Rating Scale-DSM-IV and The Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale - Parent Report (WFIRS-P). While the core symptoms of ADHD were according ADHD-DSM-IV diminished after 2 months, the improvement of WFIRS-P parameters required the longer duration of medical treatment. Only after 4 months of treatment, the improvement was achieved in selfesteem and social activities, and after 6 months in learning and behavior at school as well as in the level of life skills along with the decrease of risky activities. Thus, getting over psychosocial adaptation problems needs the longer treatment duration than the decrease of ADHD core symptoms.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Behavioral, psychological, and physiologic measures of the impact of sleep restriction were compared between groups at baseline, during sleep restriction, and following recovery sleep.	Two sleep research laboratories.	Thirty-eight healthy adults; 9 men and 10 women (mean age: 26.0 +/- 6.1 years) in the placebo group and 8 men and 11 women (mean age: 26.7 +/- 8.1 years) in the tiagabine 8 mg group	Both experimental groups underwent 4 nights of sleep restriction. Each group received either tiagabine 8 mg or placebo on all sleep-restriction nights, and both groups received placebo on baseline and recovery nights.	Polysomnography documented a SWS-enhancing effect of tiagabine. The placebo group displayed the predicted deficits due to sleep restriction on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Compared with placebo, the tiagabine group did not demonstrate impairment in sustained attention on the Psychomotor Vigilance Test, performed better on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, reported more restorative sleep, and had less of an increase in afternoon-evening salivary free cortisol. Multiple Sleep Latency Test, ratings of sleepiness, recovery sleep, and other measures did not differ between groups.	To our knowledge these findings are the first to be consistent with the hypothesis that pharmacologic SWS enhancement reduces selective aspects of the behavioral, psychological, and physiologic impact of sleep restriction.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

We enrolled Japanese spinal cord injury patients with cystometrically confirmed neurogenic detrusor overactivity who experienced urinary incontinence at least once a week either because they were refractory to anticholinergics or had to discontinue treatment because of adverse events. Patients received 200 units of onabotulinumtoxinA injected into the bladder wall after a 2-week washout of anticholinergics, and urodynamic variables were assessed before and 1 month after injection. Catheterization and urinary incontinence data, as well as International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form scores, were assessed before injection and every month thereafter until the cessation of treatment effects.	The study enrolled 19 patients (13 men, six women, age range 22-67 years). One month after injection, the mean number of urinary incontinence episodes decreased from 4.3 to 1.5 times/day (P = 0.004), and the maximum cystometric capacity increased from 100 mL to 296 mL (P = 0.0004). The rate of effective cases whose daily urinary incontinence frequency was decreased to less than 50% was 74%. The duration of efficacy without anticholinergic medication ranged from 3 to 12 months (median 8.5 months). Clinically significant adverse events were not observed.	The present findings show the efficacy and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA injection for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity in Japanese spinal cord injury patients.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The real-world CASSIOPEE study was thus conducted in elderly patients treated for metastatic CRC (mCRC).	This French prospective, multicenter, noninterventional study aimed to estimate 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and describe treatments, patient autonomy (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living; Balducci scale), and safety over 24 months, in patients older than 75 with mCRC, starting first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (NCT01555762).	From 2012 to 2014, 402 patients were included (safety population: n = 383, efficacy population: n = 358). Patient characteristics were as follows: mean age, 81 ± 4 years (<80 years, 46%; 80-85 years, 44%; >85 years, 10%); men, 52%; colon primary tumor, 80%; main metastatic site, liver 66%; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 0-1, 81%. Median PFS was 9.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.3-10.2). It was superior for patients ≤85 years (<80 years: 9.3 months; 80-85 years: 9.5 months) compared with patients >85 years (8.3 months). Median OS was 19.0 months (95% CI, 16.5-21.5) and decreased in the 2 oldest groups (20.6, 17.8, and 13.0 months). Autonomy assessments decreased over time leading to nonconclusive results. Twenty-six percent of patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs): 7% bevacizumab-related SAEs, and 6% bevacizumab-targeted SAEs. Two fatal bevacizumab-related adverse events were reported (hemorrhagic stroke and intestinal ischemia).	This large French real-world study showed that medically fit older patients with mCRC could have a benefit/risk balance similar to that of younger patients when treated with first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

This non-interventional study was conducted from August 2016 to April 2017. A total of 138 patients (aged 18-65 years) with an active episode of major depression were recruited from Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Vortioxetine was initiated on the first visit and patients were followed for 3 months. Depression severity was assessed using the PHQ-9 questionnaire (patient assessed) and CGI-S scale (physician assessed); cognitive function was assessed with the PDQ-D questionnaire; work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) was assessed with the WPAI questionnaire.	At baseline, 89.9% of patients were moderately to severely depressed (PHQ-9 score ≥10). During the 3 month treatment period, mean ± SD PHQ-9 score decreased from 18.7 ± 5.7 to 5.0 ± 5.3, mean ± SD CGI-S score decreased from 4.4 ± 0.7 to 2.2 ± 1.1 and mean ± SD PDQ-D score decreased from 42.1 ± 18.8 to 13.4 ± 13.0. By Month 3, response and remission rates reached 80.8% and 59.0%, respectively. Work productivity loss decreased from 73.6% to 30.5%, while activity impairment decreased from 71.5% to 24.6%. Positive correlations were observed between PHQ-9, PDQ-D, and WPAI work productivity loss and activity impairment. By Month 3, 82.0% of patients were either not depressed or only mildly depressed (PHQ-9 score ≤9).

Twenty female patients who underwent GONB with lidocaine were included in the study. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale (PSAS), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale (RLSSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and headache diary results before and after the treatment of the patients were compared.

1061,7599368,The Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,Medroxyprogesterone treatment for paraphiliacs.,"This study addresses the following questions: (1) what are the essential components of a medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) pretreatment evaluation?; (2) do paraphilic men treated with MPA (Depo-Provera) report a lowering of both deviant and nondeviant sexual drive and activities?; (3) is behavioral improvement associated with testosterone level reductions?; and (4) what significant side effects are associated with MPA treatment? A total of 29 paraphilic men who underwent a comprehensive psychiatric, medical, and legal evaluation and were eligible for treatment with MPA were followed naturalistically while receiving concurrent MPA and group therapy. The principal outcome measures were data obtained from a weekly self-reported psychosexual inventory that quantified five dimensions of deviant and nondeviant sexual activities and testosterone levels that were drawn pretreatment and after three and six months of MPA. Self-reported data were analyzed by nonparametric methods. Because MPA's effectiveness is evident early in treatment, we report on data from the first six months. Subjects reported a differential rate of suppression of sexual activities, a median of up to two weeks for deviant and 2 to 10 weeks for nondeviant behaviors (p < or = .01 for each of the five dimensions). Testosterone levels suppressed to less than 0.5 ng per milliliter for all but two subjects at three months and for all at six months. Recidivism was reported for one subject. Except for one subject who developed pulmonary emboli, no major medical problems were encountered. MPA safely and effectively reduced sex drive, controlled deviant sexual impulses and behavior, and lowered the testosterone levels of these paraphilic men during the first six months of treatment. However, the relative rapidity and completeness of the response raises questions regarding possible distortions in self-reported sexual activities. This should alert the practicing clinician to consider the use of collateral sources of information in interpreting treatment outcome for patients with paraphilic behaviors. Also, longer follow-up periods are required for monitoring treatment efficacy.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1062,28645717,Vaccine,Surveillance of pneumococcal colonization and invasive pneumococcal disease reveals shift in prevalent carriage serotypes in Massachusetts' children to relatively low invasiveness.,"Following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), overall nasopharyngeal colonization rates have not changed significantly, however a dramatic and sustained decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children was observed in every setting where the PCVs were implemented. We aimed to describe the differences in invasive disease potential of serotypes that are common colonizers in pre- and post-vaccine eras in order to provide further insight in our understanding of dynamic epidemiology of pneumococcal diseases.	Using data from surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage and enhanced surveillance for IPD, a serotype specific 'invasive capacity (IC)' was computed by dividing the incidence of IPD due to serotype x by the carriage prevalence of that same serotype in children <7years of age in Massachusetts. We have evaluated the serotype specific invasive capacity in two periods; pre-PCV13 (2001/02, 2003/04, 2006/07, 2008/09) and post-PCV13 (2010/11 and 2013/14), and by age groups; <24monthsvs. ≥24months.	An approximate 50-fold variation in the point estimate was observed between the serotypes having the highest (7F, 38, 19A, 3, 33F) and the lowest (6C, 35B, 21, 11A, 23B and 23A) computed serotype specific invasive disease potential. In the post-PCV13 era (6C, 35B, 11A, 23B and 23A), 5 of the 7 most common serotypes colonizing the nasopharynx were serotypes with the lowest invasive capacity. Serotype specific invasive capacity trended down in older children for majority of the serotypes, and serotypes 3, 10A and 19A had significantly lower invasive capacity in children older than 24months of age compared to younger children.	Invasive capacity differs among serotypes and likely by age. Point estimates of IC for most of the common serotypes colonizing children in Massachusetts in post-PCV13 era were low and likely explain the continued reduction in IPD from the pre-PCV era in the absence of specific protection against these serotypes.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This article describes a research collaborative of health service researchers, systems engineers, and clinicians seeking to improve processes for safer chronic opioid therapy management in an academic primary care center. We present implementation results and lessons learned along with an intervention toolkit that others may consider using within their organization.	Using iterative improvement lifecycles and systems engineering principles, we developed a risk-based workflow model for patients on chronic opioids. Two key safe opioid use process metrics-percent of patients with recent opioid treatment agreements and urine drug tests-were identified, and processes to improve these measures were designed, tested, and implemented. Focus groups were conducted after the conclusion of implementation, with barriers and lessons learned identified via thematic analysis.	Initial surveys revealed a lack of knowledge regarding resources available to patients and prescribers in the primary care clinic. In addition, 18 clinicians (69%) reported largely 'inheriting' (rather than initiating) their chronic opioid therapy patients. We tracked 68 patients over a 4-year period. Although process measures improved, full adherence was not achieved for the entire population. Barriers included team structure, the evolving opioid environment, and surveillance challenges, along with disruptions resulting from the 2019 novel coronavirus.	Safe primary care opioid prescribing requires ongoing monitoring and management in a complex environment. The application of a risk-based approach is possible but requires adaptability and redundancies to be reliable.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1064,29450954,Bipolar disorders,Initiation and long-term use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs in bipolar disorder.,"Increasing evidence points to the harmful effects of long-term benzodiazepine treatment. Our objective was to study the incidence of, and predictors for, long-term use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs in bipolar disorder.	We conducted a population-based cohort study, using data from Swedish national registers. Swedish residents aged 18-75 years with a recorded diagnosis of bipolar disorder or mania between July 2006 and December 2012, and no history of benzodiazepine/Z-drug use in the past year, were included. Patients were followed for 1 year with regard to prescription fills of benzodiazepines/Z-drugs. Initiators were followed for another year during which continuous use for >6 months was defined as 'long-term'. Patient and prescription characteristics were investigated as potential predictors for long-term use in multivariate logistic regression models.	Out of the 21 883 patients included, 29% started benzodiazepine/Z-drug treatment, of whom one in five became long-term users. Patients who were prescribed clonazepam or alprazolam had high odds for subsequent long-term use (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] 3.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24-6.38] and 2.03 [95% CI 1.30-3.18], respectively), compared to those prescribed diazepam. Polytherapy with benzodiazepines/Z-drugs also predicted long-term use (aOR 2.46, 95% CI 1.79-3.38), as did age ≥60 years (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.46-2.53, compared to age <30 years), and concomitant treatment with psychostimulants (aOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.33-2.39).	The incidence of subsequent long-term use among bipolar benzodiazepine initiators is high. Patients on clonazepam, alprazolam or benzodiazepine/Z-drug polytherapy have the highest risk of becoming long-term users, suggesting that these treatments should be used restrictively.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

1066,31911024,The International journal on drug policy,New psychoactive substance use as a survival strategy in rural marginalised communities in Hungary.,"New psychoactive substance (NPS) use has become a widespread phenomenon among marginalised communities in Hungary. Since 2010, a growing number of reports in grey literature and anecdotal information among professionals have become available on NPS use among previously unaffected groups, such as people living in rural, socioeconomically deprived communities. In our research, we aimed to explore NPS use among these communities.	We conducted a mixed method research with convergent parallel design. Data collection took place in 2017 in marginalised communities in villages in two regions in Hungary, where 150 questionnaires were recorded and 50 interviews were conducted with current NPS users.	According to the survey results, NPS is very easy to access, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist (SCRA) are easily bought in marginalised rural communities (79% found SCRA easy to obtain). Both SCRA and synthetic cathinones are used regularly; 57% of SCRA users and 37% of synthetic cathinone users used the respective substance at least once a week in the past 30 days. Besides NPS, sedative use (without prescription) and alcohol consumption are common among the respondents. 17% of the sample has already injected NPS. The overwhelming majority of the respondents rated regular consumption of NPS as 'very dangerous' (SCRA: 75%, synthetic cathinones 72%). NPS users have limited knowledge of consequences and the social and health treatment options available. Most themes in the interviews are associated with surviving stress, crisis and anxiety, as well as the wish to escape from insecurity and chaotic life. Positive effects of substance use (community, joy, energy) are rarely present.	People who use drugs (PWUD) living in these rural communities face the consequences of the rural risk environment: easy access to NPS, inadequate access to services, poor labour market situation and attributions of marginalised groups, for example disaffiliation. NPS use is not a recreational activity in this population; individuals mainly use NPS to get away from reality, problems, pain, poverty and marginalisation. NPS use is a survival strategy. Effective responses have to address substance use and social integration; we need complex interventions addressing structural factors.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

A retrospective cohort study using a Medicaid claims database was conducted. Patients hospitalized for an AMI and subsequently filling a prescription for an ACE inhibitor were followed longitudinally for the occurrence of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality. A subanalysis was also conducted to account for switching/discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy. Stepwise (forward conditional) Cox-proportional hazards models were used to analyze the effect of tissue selectivity on study outcomes.	The final study sample consisted of 689 AMI and the results indicated that tissue-selective ACE inhibitors had a protective effect against hospitalization due to stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.265; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.101-0.698). A similar lower rate in hospitalizations due to heart failure was observed in the group using tissue-selective ACE inhibitors; however, the results were not statistically significant (HR = 0.681; 95% CI = 0.436-1.063). A protective effect was also observed on the combined outcome of hospitalization due to any cardiovascular condition (HR = 0.712; 95% CI = 0.536-0.945). Hospitalizations due to recurrent AMI, need for coronary revascularization procedures, and mortality were not significantly different between patients using tissue-selective and non-tissue-selective ACE inhibitors. The completer subanalysis provided similar findings regarding the impact of tissue selectivity on study outcomes.	Tissue-selective ACE inhibitors may have a protective effect against hospitalization due to stroke/TIA or heart failure when compared to non-tissue-selective ACE inhibitors for patients following AMI.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Growth Hormone (GH) replacement therapy has beneficial effects entailing a chronic and expensive use. Therefore, entity, appropriateness and standardization of GHD treatment need to be accurately analysed. In Italy, the epidemiological surveillance on somatropin therapy is entrusted to the National Register of Growth Hormone Therapy (Registro Nazionale degli Assuntori dell'Ormone della Crescita-RNAOC) by the Italian Regulation, in accordance of which the RNAOC-database is collecting the notifications of somatropin prescriptions.	Aim of this study is to analyse data on somatropin-treated adult population communicated to the RNAOC by the specialist centres of 15 Italian regions and 2 autonomous provinces.	From 2011 to 2019, the somatropin-treated adults were 970 with 4061 examinations (1.21 ± 0.33 visits/year). The diagnoses were: hypopituitarism (n = 579); hypophysectomy (n = 383); and congenital GHD (n = 3). Five subjects were addressed with diagnoses not included in the regulation. The starting posology of somatropin was 0.320 (± 0.212) mg/day, 0.292 (± 0.167) mg/day in male and 0.360 (± 0.258) in female patients, with 7 administrations/week in 70.31% of the prescriptions. The differences in posology by gender persisted at 10th year of the follow-up. Starting dosage was higher in patients diagnosed with adult GHD before the age of 30 (0.420 ± 0.225 mg/day), with a progressive decrease of the dosage during the follow-up.

Latency to detection and certainty of a drug effect, as well as drug quality (intensity, euphoria, and dysphoria), were studied before and after 10 to 12 days of buprenorphine maintenance. Saline was accurately identified by all 26 patients during the drugfree baseline and by 25 patients during buprenorphine maintenance conditions. All patients accurately identified morphine during the drugfree period before treatment with buprenorphine, but 18 (69%) of 26 patients were unable to detect morphine during buprenorphine maintenance and 2 misidentified morphine as cocaine. Six men (23%) accurately identified morphine and reported that the intensity and quality of morphine's effects were equivalent to drugfree conditions. Cocaine levels in plasma 5 minutes after intravenous cocaine injection were equivalent before and during buprenorphine treatment and averaged 282.8 +/- 43.6 and 295.2 +/- 28.8 ng/ml during 4 and 8 mg/day of buprenorphine maintenance, respectively. All patients accurately identified cocaine before and during buprenorphine maintenance, and there were no significant changes in latency to detection and certainty of a drug effect or reports of cocaine-induced intensity or euphoria during buprenorphine treatment. The concordance between responses to morphine and cocaine during inpatient buprenorphine maintenance and drug use during the first 4 weeks of outpatient buprenorphine treatment was also examined in 16 men. The effects of buprenorphine on individual responses to an acute intravenous dose of morphine or cocaine during the inpatient study did not reliably predict the frequency of heroin or cocaine self-administration during the first 4 weeks of daily outpatient buprenorphine maintenance.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Routine laboratory tests are insufficient to evaluate platelet activity.	To profile the spectrum of platelet inhibition, as measured by aspirin and P2Y12 response unit assays, in a TBI population on antiplatelet therapy.	This single-center, prospective cohort study included patients presenting to our institution between November 2010 and January 2015 with a clinical history of TBI. Serum platelet reactivity levels were determined immediately on admission and analyzed using the aspirin and P2Y12 response unit assays; test results were reported as aspirin response units and P2Y12 response units. We report congruence between assay results and clinical history as well as differences in assay results between types of antiplatelet therapy.	A sample of 317 patients was available for analysis, of which 87% had experienced mild TBI, 7% moderate, and 6% severe; the mean age was 71.5 years. The mean aspirin response units in patients with a history of any aspirin use was 456 ± 67 (range, 350-659), with 88% demonstrating therapeutic platelet inhibition. For clopidogrel, the mean P2Y12 response unit was 191 ± 70 (range, 51-351); 77% showed therapeutic response.	Rapid measurement of antiplatelet function using the aspirin and P2Y12 response assays indicated as many as one fourth of patients on antiplatelet therapy do not have platelet dysfunction. Further research is required to develop guidelines for the use of these assays to guide platelet transfusion in the setting of TBI.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1071,6779335,Psychopharmacology,Drug preference and mood in humans: d-amphetamine.,"A total of 31 normal human volunteers participated in a nine-session experiment. During the first four sessions, they received alternately 5 mg d-amphetamine or placebo. During the next five sessions, they were given a choice between amphetamine and placebo. Subjective effects were assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) before the drug was taken and 1, 3, and 6 h later. Subjects chose amphetamine a mean of 4.03 times. Compared with placebo, amphetamine produced changes in mood on the POMS including increased Vigor, Elation, Friendliness, Arousal and Positive Mood and decreased Confusion. These differences were greatest 3 hr after ingestion. Mood changes produced by d-amphetamine were comparable in all subjects regardless of the actual number of times each chose the drug. These data suggest that that subjective effects do not predict drug choice. The results are discussed in terms of developing methods for predicting the abuse potential of psychotropic drugs.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

A prospective, open, multicentre trial based on observation involving 324 patients between 6 and 87 years of age with partial seizures who had not received prior treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AED) (n = 114) or in whom other monotherapies had failed (n = 210). These patients were administered OXC in the conditions usually found in clinical practice over a period of 52 weeks; effectiveness was evaluated by the reduction in the frequency of the seizures, tolerability was measured through the side effects related to the drug and quality of life was assessed by means of the changes reflected in the CAVE questionnaires, in the case of children, and the QOLIE-31 for adults.	At the end of the study, total control over the seizures was 73.7% in patients who had not been treated previously and 43.8% in those in whom other monotherapies had failed; at the same time there was an improvement in the quality of life parameters. 42.9% reported side effects, which were usually tolerable or transient since they led to the withdrawal of OXC in only 9.6% of the patients.	OXC is a very effective AED and is well tolerated as monotherapy in patients of all ages with partial seizures, either as the first choice therapy or as a substitution for other ineffective or poorly tolerated drugs.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Healthy subjects received venlafaxine 75 mg/day (Study 1; N = 38) or escitalopram 10 mg/ day (Study 2; N = 25) with the addition of aripiprazole 10-20 mg/day (10 mg/day fixed dose in Study 2) for 14 days. Patients with MDD (N = 498; Studies 3 and 4) received escitalopram (10-20 mg/day), fluoxetine (20-40 mg/day), paroxetine controlled-release (37.5-50 mg/day), sertraline (100-150 mg/day) or venlafaxine extended-release (150-225 mg/day) for 8 weeks plus placebo. Incomplete responders were randomised (1:1) to placebo or adjunctive aripiprazole 2-20 mg/day. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of ADTs.

Cognition was investigated by means of objective assessment of executive functions (EpiTrack®) and verbal memory and by subjective ratings of self-perceived side effects (cognition, mood, and vegetative). Quality of life was assessed using the QOLIE-10 questionnaire. Patients underwent assessment at baseline and after a median follow-up interval of 32 weeks. Forty-four patients were treated with LCM, 11 with LTG, and 15 with TPM. Treatment arms differed with regard to the age at onset of epilepsy (LTG>TPM) and to seizure control from baseline to follow-up, which was best in patients whose seizures were treated with LTG (55% vs. 16% in patients whose seizures were treated with LCM and 13% in patients whose seizures were treated with TPM). Groups did not differ in the type of epilepsy, daily drug load or drug load change, nor in baseline seizure frequency. Repeated measures statistics controlling for epilepsy onset and seizure outcome showed deteriorated executive functions with TPM (F=7.5, p=0.001). On an individual level (reliable change indices), 53% of the patients whose seizures were treated with TPM showed losses in this domain (LCM 14%, LTG 27%) and none of the patients showed improvement (LCM 23%, LTG 27%; χ(2)=11.8, p=0.019). No differences in memory, quality of life, or mood were noted among patients in the three treatment arms. Subjective cognitive complaints increased in 5 of the 9 patients whose seizures were treated with TPM (LCM 1/9, LTG 0/9; χ(2)=11.9, p=0.025). The findings of this study demonstrate for the first time that the cognitive side effect profile of LCM is comparable to that of LTG and superior to that of TPM. This is indicated by both subjective and objective measures. Given the naturalistic setting and the retrospective nature of the study, a follow-up prospective, randomized trial with larger sample sizes is required to confirm these findings.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

An interviewer-based questionnaire was used to obtain relevant clinical information from 50 WWE on CBZ and LEV monotherapy, respectively, and 50 age-matched controls. The diagnosis of epilepsy was clinical with electroencephalographic features taken into consideration and the seizures classified using the 2017 International League Against Epilepsy classification. The diagnosis of PCOS was based on the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine.	The frequency of PCOS and its subcomponent were higher among WWE compare to controls. PCOS was present in 22 (44%) of LEV group compare to 8 (16%) CBZ group. The frequency of its subcomponent was higher among those on LEV except for comparable effect with regard to oligomenorrhea. The levels of the sex steroid hormone were comparable in both groups of WWE except luteal phase luteinizing hormone, which was lower among the LEV group (P .001). The follicular phase estradiol level was lower (P .021), and follicle-stimulating hormone level was about 2-fold higher (P .03) among WWE compare to controls. The mean value testosterone was significantly lower among controls compared to WWE.	The increased frequency of PCOS and its subcomponent and the unsatisfactory effect of LEV compared to CBZ on reproductive endocrine function underscore the need for routine reproductive endocrine evaluation to improve overall quality of life.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

There was minimal or no toxicity. Twenty of 30 patients (66%) receiving at least twice weekly poly-ICLC showed regression or stabilization of gadolinium-enhancing tumor, as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (median = 65% volume decrease). All but one patient with anaplastic astrocytomas who received continuous poly-ICLC remain alive, with a median progression-free survival of 54 months from diagnosis. Median Kaplan-Meier survival is 19 months for patients with glioblastomas who receive at least twice weekly poly-ICLC treatments. Tumor response was associated with 2',5' -oligoadenylate synthetase activation (P = 0.03) but not with serum interferon. We hypothesize clinical activation by poly-ICLC of a basic host tumor suppressor system. Prolonged, quality survival with tumor stabilization or regression confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging for most patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas suggests that more extensive laboratory and controlled clinical studies are warranted. The concept of long-term, broad spectrum stimulation of host defenses with nontoxic, inexpensive double-stranded ribonucleic acids, such as low-dose poly-ICLC, may be applicable to the treatment of other malignancies.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1077,3625187,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,Antidepressant blood levels in Southeast Asians. Clinical and cultural implications.,"After long-term treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), the TCA blood levels of 41 depressed Southeast Asian patients were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. No detectable medicine level was found in 25 (61%) of the patients and a therapeutic level by American standards was found in only six (15%), indicating a high incidence of noncompliance. A Cambodian subgroup, however, was significantly more compliant than either the Vietnamese or Mein patients. After patient education and a discussion of problems and benefits of medicine, compliance improved with Vietnamese and Cambodians but not with the Mien. Cultural and educational factors influence compliance with medicine and responsiveness to education. Because the Cambodians also suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder, it is probable that the presence of this illness increased compliance. Preliminary data among these patients indicate that Asians probably need the same dose of imipramine as Americans to achieve a 'therapeutic' level. Reports that Asians need lower doses of TCA medicine are limited by the high noncompliance rates with Asians. These high rates probably reflect cultural beliefs about illness and medication usage. It is valuable to perform TCA blood levels on Asian patients for whom antidepressants have been prescribed to monitor compliance and to lead into a discussion of benefits and side effects of the medicine. Evidence of noncompliance can lead to a productive doctor-patient discussion about beliefs and effects of the medication.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

They spent four consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. Cognitive tests of attention, working memory, and verbal episodic memory were carried out after the baseline night, 25-h sleep deprivation, and recovery night.	Sleep deprivation impaired performance in all groups. It was manifested either as delayed practice effect or deteriorated performance (p < 0.05). In simple reaction time and 10-choice reaction time, non-users and young maintained their performance, whereas HT users suffered a minor impairment (p < 0.01). In other measurements, there was no interaction of group and condition. In 10-choice reaction time and vigilance, postmenopausal women made fewer errors and omissions than the young (p < 0.05).

1080,7850330,British journal of urology,The role of histamine in human penile erection.,"To investigate the relaxant action of histamine on human corpus cavernosum in vitro and the erectile response caused by the intracavernous injection of histamine in patients with psychogenic impotence.	Human corpus cavernosum (HCC) tissue was cut into strips of approximately 2 cm and suspended in a cascade bioassay. The strips were then superfused with oxygenated and warmed Krebs solution and precontracted with noradrenaline (3 microM). Glyceryl trinitrate, acetylcholine and histamine were injected as a single bolus in the absence or in the presence of mepyramine and cimetidine. For the in vivo studies, histamine (30-60 micrograms) was injected intracavernously as a single bolus into the right corpus cavernosum 1 cm from the balamo-preputial sulcus. Similar protocols were carried out for papaverine (50 mg). The erectile response was divided into four grades: no response, tumescence, partial and full erection.	In vitro studies demonstrated that histamine (3-100 micrograms) caused dose-dependent relaxation of the HCC strips which was significantly inhibited by cimetidine (5-10 microM). The histamine H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine (1 microM) potentiated histamine-induced relaxation. The co-infusion of both mepyramine and cimetidine did not abolish histamine-induced relaxation. When injected intracavernously in humans, histamine (30 micrograms) caused full erection in 13% of the patients, whereas 87% had partial erection or tumescence. A higher dose of histamine (60 micrograms) caused full erection in 26% of the patients and 74% had partial erection or tumescence. Papaverine induced full erection in the majority of patients (66%). In contrast to papaverine, the duration of erection induced by histamine was markedly shorter (mean 200 and 6.5 min, respectively). The penile erections induced by papaverine were associated with complications such as pain, haematoma and priapism. Histamine did not induce any complications. Treatment of eight male patients with psychogenic impotence with the histamine H1 receptor antagonist astemizol (10 mg orally once daily for 1 week) did not affect histamine-induced erectile responses.	These results indicate that histamine may play a role in human penile erection. The erection-promoting action of histamine is probably due to H2 receptor activation, although another histamine receptor, possibly H3, also seems to be involved. This study suggests that histamine could be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Felbamate is an investigational antiepileptic drug with a preclinical profile that suggests it would be effective in patients with multiple types of seizures. In controlled clinical trials, felbamate was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of refractory partial-onset seizures.	We studied the efficacy of felbamate in 73 patients ranging in age from 4 to 36 years who had the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. During a 28-day base-line phase, the patients received their usual antiepileptic therapies. At the end of this phase, felbamate or placebo was administered for 70 days in addition to the current antiepileptic medications. The dosage of felbamate was titrated during the first 14 days of the treatment phase to a maximum of 45 mg per kilogram of body weight per day or 3600 mg per day, whichever was less. The primary efficacy variables were the total number of seizures counted during a four-hour period of video recording, parents' or guardians' global evaluations of the patients' quality of life, and the total number of atonic seizures, as reported by parents or guardians.	The patients treated with felbamate had a 34 percent decrease in the frequency of atonic seizures, as compared with a 9 percent decrease in the patients who received placebo (P = 0.01). The felbamate-treated patients had a 19 percent decrease in the total frequency of seizures, as compared with a 4 percent increase in the placebo group (P = 0.002). The global-evaluation scores were significantly higher in the felbamate group than in the placebo group from day 49 to the end of the study. There were no significant differences in the frequency of seizures occurring during video monitoring, but there was a significant reduction (P = 0.017) in the number of tonic-clonic seizures during the maintenance period in the felbamate group. The types and frequency of side effects were similar in the two treatment groups.	Felbamate is beneficial in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The study is a retrospective observational cohort study.	The study retrieved data from electronic health record from Hospital Authority (HA), HK.	The study included patients aged 18 years old or above, who were admitted to seven institutions under HA with diagnosis of ACS during 2008-2017.	The primary outcome was the frequency of antiplatelet therapy prescription at the point of index hospitalisation discharge each year during 2008-2017. Association between demographics, baseline comorbidities, procedures and antiplatelet prescription were examined as secondary outcome using multivariate logistic regression model, with commonly used antiplatelet groups selected for comparison.	Among the included 14 716 patients, 5888 (40.0%) discharged with aspirin alone, 6888 (46.8%) discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel, and 973 (6.6%) discharged with DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor. Prescribing rate of aspirin alone decreased substantially from 56.8% in 2008 to 27.5% in 2017. Utilisation of DAPT with clopidogrel increased from 33.7% in 2008 to 52.7% in 2017. Use of DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor increased from 0.3% in 2010 to 15.3% in 2017. Compared with those prescribed with DAPT with clopidogrel, male patients (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.65), patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (aOR 2.50, 1.98 to 3.16) or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (aOR 3.26, 2.59 to 4.09), use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (aOR 3.03, 2.48 to 3.68) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (aOR 3.85, 3.24 to 4.58) or coronary artery bypass graft (aOR 6.52, 4.63 to 9.18) during index hospitalisation, concurrent use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (aOR 1.35, 1.10 to 1.65) or proton pump inhibitors (aOR 3.57, 2.93 to 4.36) during index hospitalisation discharge were more likely to be prescribed with DAPT with prasugrel/ticagrelor.

The study comprised 10 patients with primary enuresis and 10 normal comparable controls (age range 6-14 years). Nitrite was assayed in 'spot' morning urine samples in both the enuretics and normal controls. Enuretics were then given 50 mg indomethacin suppositories each night; urine volume, urinary osmolality and electrolytes, serum osmolality and electrolytes and urinary nitrite were assayed before indomethacin treatment and after 15 days of treatment.	The mean (sd) urinary nitrite excretion was 24.4 (19.6) micromol/L in normal children and 275.9 (111.2) micromol/L in enuretics (P<0.05). With indomethacin, the urinary nitrite concentration was significantly decreased to 141 (45.1) micromol/L (P<0.05) and associated with a significant reduction in bed-wetting episodes and voiding frequency. The functional bladder capacity was <70% of the predicted value for age in six of the patients; they had significant improvements on indomethacin, to values similar to those in patients with a nearly normal functional bladder capacity. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary volume by 41%, the night volume by 40%, clearance of free water by 46% and increased the day : night urinary volume ratio by 55%. The absolute amounts of urinary calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, urea, creatinine, and glucose were lower on indomethacin, although not statistically significantly so. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary and 'spot' morning osmolality and osmotic clearance. There were no significant changes in serum osmolality and electrolyte concentrations. Indomethacin also decreased the absolute amount of urinary sodium, chloride and potassium, fractional sodium and potassium excretion, and filtered sodium. Creatinine clearance was decreased by 20% (P>0.05) and normal 24-h urinary protein was significantly lower, by 47%, after indomethacin treatment (P<0.05).	Urinary nitrite excretion increased significantly in patients with primary nocturnal enuresis; indomethacin markedly reduced bed-wetting episodes and decreased the frequency of voiding in enuretics with small or normal functional bladder capacity, which was associated with a significant decrease in urinary nitrite excretion. Indomethacin reduced bed-wetting by decreasing the urine volume, clearance of free water and urinary electrolytes, and through possible effects on bladder and urethral contraction, by inhibiting NO and prostaglandin synthesis. NO and prostaglandins might be important in the pathogenesis of primary enuresis.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The secondary objective was to determine the effect of antidepressant use on measures of disease progression.	After retrospectively identifying motor-manifest HD participants with at least borderline depressive symptoms from the Enroll-HD database, 86 new users of antidepressant medication were exact matched with non-users on depression score, and matched on propensity scores developed using age, sex, CAG repeat length, anxiety scores, and disease progression measures. Linear mixed effect models were used to assess the change in depression scores, anxiety scores, and disease progression measures based on antidepressant use between two visits approximately one-year apart.	There was no significant difference in the change in depression score between antidepressant users and non-users (p = 0.46). There were also no significant differences in the change in total motor score (p = 0.88), total functional capacity score (p = 0.16), number correct on the symbol digit modality test (p = 0.49), or anxiety score (p = 0.68).	Initiation of antidepressant medication was not associated with a greater reduction in depressive symptoms or changes in other symptoms when compared to non-use.

Occurrence of medicamentous enzyme induction was clinically reflected in an accumulation of functional bleeding disorders, depending on the hormonal contraceptive used as well as on the additionally administered drug. Conclusions were drawn for contraceptive practice.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Participants with major depressive disorder (N = 2875) at primary and specialty care sites who received the first step treatment with citalopram in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression study were included. Patients were enrolled between July 2001 and April 2004. Melancholic features were ascribed by previously developed algorithms of telephone interview ratings prior to treatment. Demographics, clinical features, and treatment response were compared between those with and without melancholic features.	The 23.5% of participants with melancholic features were characterized by higher severity scores, greater rates of previous suicide attempts and ratings of current suicidal risk, and more concurrent psychiatric comorbidity. Unadjusted remission rates for those with melancholic features were statistically significantly reduced in absolute terms by up to 8.4% compared to those without melancholic features, which is a 24.1% decrease in relative chance of remission (p < .0001). Following adjustments for between-group baseline differences, remission rates were no longer different.	Melancholic features are associated with a significantly reduced remission rate with an SSRI. This effect appears to be accounted for by demographic and clinical features associated with melancholic features.	clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT0021528.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

All nine infants had markedly elevated peripheral renin values, 134.3 +/- 128.1 ng/mL/hr (mean +/- SD). Five infants had abnormal renal sonographic and perfusion scans with evidence of renal artery thrombosis, parenchymal disease, or both. Captopril therapy (0.3 mg/kg) was instituted at a postnatal age of 123 +/- 108 days. After the initial dose, the systolic BP decreased significantly in all infants, the decrease ranging from 21% to 58% of the pretreatment value. Dosage was subsequently halved in all infants. Seventeen episodes of unpredictable decreases in BP more than 40% from baseline occurred during the reduced maintenance therapy. Four infants had a total of seven episodes during which the BP decreased by 57 +/- 10% from baseline; this decrease persisted for 17 +/- 6 hours and was unresponsive to volume reexpansion and inotropic therapy. All seven episodes were accompanied by oliguria (urine output less than 1 mL/kg/hr) that persisted for 18 +/- 12 hours. These episodes were accompanied by neurologic signs (subtle seizures, lethargy, and/or apnea) within 18 +/- 6 hours after the onset of oliguria. The remaining five infants had a total of 13 episodes of decreased BP of 50 +/- 8% of baseline, which were of significantly shorter duration and responded to volume reexpanders, inotropic therapy, or both and were unaccompanied by oliguria. These data suggest the need for close observation of BP in infants receiving maintenance captopril therapy.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

In this 48-month, prospective, non-randomized, open-label study of the effect of enzyme replacement therapy on bone response, 33 imiglucerase-naïve patients (median age 43 years with one or more skeletal manifestations such as osteopenia, history of bone crisis, or other documented bone pathology) received imiglucerase 60 U/kg/2 weeks. Substantial improvements were observed in bone pain (BP), bone crises (BC), and bone mineral density (BMD). Improvements in BP were observed at 3 months (p < 0.001 vs baseline) and continued progressively throughout the study, with 39% of patients reporting pain at 48 months vs 73% at baseline. Eleven of the 13 patients with a pre-treatment history of BC had no recurrences. Biochemical markers for bone formation increased; markers for bone resorption decreased. Steady improvement of spine and femoral neck BMD, measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was noted. Mean Z score for spine increased from -0.72 +/- 1.302 at baseline to near-normal levels (-0.09 +/- 1.503) by month 48 (p = 0.042) and for femoral neck from -0.59 +/- 1.352 to -0.17 +/- 1.206 (p = 0.035) at month 36.

Participants were 1,019 older Catholic clergy followed up annually for up to 12 years (mean baseline age = 75.0 years, education = 18.1 years, Mini-Mental State Examination score = 28.5), enrolled in the Religious Orders Study, a longitudinal clinical-pathologic study of aging and AD. Clinical evaluations allowed for AD classification and assessment of global cognition and five cognitive domains. NSAIDs were identified by direct medication inspection at baseline and follow-up evaluations. Neuropathologic data were available on 328 deceased participants. AD pathology was summarized as a global measure and as measures of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. We used Cox proportional hazards models and mixed models for incident AD and cognitive decline, respectively, and logistic and linear regression for pathologic outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, and education.	Overall, we found no apparent relation of NSAIDs to incident AD (n = 209 cases), change in cognition, or AD pathology. The hazard ratio of incident AD was 1.19 (95% CI 0.87-1.62) comparing those using NSAIDs with those not using NSAIDs at baseline, and 0.84 (95% CI 0.63-1.11) for specific use of aspirin. Findings were similar in analyses in which we considered NSAID use during follow-up. NSAIDs were not related to change in cognition (all p values > 0.14). There was no relation of NSAIDs to global AD pathology or plaques or tangles.	These data do not support a strong relation between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Alzheimer disease or cognition. Consistent findings across clinical and pathologic outcomes provide additional confidence in these results.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

After repair of the urethral injury ED may be the most devastating long-term effect for the patient. Some patients with ED may regain normal erectile function. We prospectively studied the response to sildenafil and the erectile function of patients with ED due to PFUD.	The erectile function of patients referred to us with PFUD for urethroplasty were prospectively evaluated before surgery. Patients underwent nocturnal penile tumescence testing and, if results were abnormal, penile duplex ultrasonography with intracavernous injection and arteriography were performed to diagnose the etiology of ED. Patients were questioned about erectile function every 3 months after surgery and if they complained of ED they were offered 100 mg sildenafil. Patients were followed for at least 18 months after surgery.	A total of 29 consecutive patients were evaluated and 22 (76%) of them had ED before surgery. Sufficient followup was available for 15 of the patients. Overall 47% of these patients responded favorably to sildenafil. Of the patients 60% with neurogenic ED and 20% of those with arterial ED responded to this treatment. In 33% of the patients ED resolved within the followup period. All patients with spontaneous resolution of ED previously responded to sildenafil (71% of sildenafil responders).	In patients with ED due to PFUD, those with neurogenic ED are more likely to respond to sildenafil than those with arterial damage. Favorable response to sildenafil may predict spontaneous resumption of normal erectile function over time.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Klotho and IGF-1 levels in the model group were lower than those in other 2 groups. Morris water maze test showed that the model group had longer escape latency times and shorter step platform times compared to other groups. Line correlation model demonstrated that Klotho level was positively correlated with IGF-1 level in rats with dementia (P= 0. 029).

We analyzed herein the role of MIF in the host control of toxoplasmosis using MIF(-/-) mice backcrossed to either the BALB/c or the C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds. Both, wild-type (WT) BALB/c and MIF(-/-) BALB/c mice were susceptible to infection with highly virulent RH as well as moderately virulent ME49 strains of T. gondii. MIF(-/-) mice, however, showed greater liver damage and more brain cysts, produced less proinflammatory cytokines, and succumbed significantly faster than WT mice. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from MIF(-/-) mice produced less interleukin-1beta, interleukin-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha than WT BMDCs after stimulation with soluble Toxoplasma antigen (STAg). Similar observations were made in CD11c(+) low-density cells isolated from the spleens of MIF(-/-) mice challenged with STAg. MIF(-/-) C57BL/6 mice succumbed to ME49 infection faster than their WT counterparts. C57BL/6 mice that succumbed to infection with the ME49 strain produced less MIF than resistant BALB/c mice similarly infected. Interestingly, an analysis of brains from patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis showed low levels of MIF expression. Together, these findings demonstrate that MIF plays a critical role in mediating host resistance against T. gondii.",Animal-other,5,1

The cause and mechanisms underlying the demise of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons are ill-defined, but interactions between genes and environmental factors are recognized to play a critical role in modulating the vulnerability to PD. Current evidence points to reactive glia as a pivotal factor in PD pathophysiology, playing both protective and destructive roles. Here, the contribution of reactive astrocytes and their ability to modulate DAergic neurodegeneration, neuroprotection and neurorepair in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) rodent model of PD will be discussed in the light of novel emerging evidence implicating wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin signaling as a strong candidate in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic plasticity. In this work, we highlight an intrinsic Wnt1/frizzled-1/β-catenin tone that critically contributes to the survival and protection of adult midbrain DAergic neurons, with potential implications for drug design or drug action in PD. The dynamic interplay between astrocyte-derived factors and neurogenic signals in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic neurotoxicity and repair will be summarized, together with recent findings showing a critical role of glia-neural stem/progenitor cell (NPC) interactions aimed at overcoming neurodegeneration and inducing neurorestoration. Understanding the intrinsic plasticity of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons and deciphering the signals facilitating the crosstalk between astrocytes, microglia, DAergic neurons and NPCs may have major implications for the role of stem cell technology in PD, and for identifying potential therapeutic targets to induce endogenous neurorepair.",Animal-other,5,1

Amplification of chromosome 12q13-q15 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) amplicon) is frequently observed in numerous human cancers including GBM. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE) is a group of GTP-binding proteins that belong to the subgroup of centaurin GTPase family, encoded by CENTG1 located in CDK4 amplicon. However, the pathological significance of CDK4 amplicon in GBM formation remains incompletely understood. In the current study, we show that co-expression of PIKE-A and CDK4 in TP53/PTEN double knockout GBM mouse model additively shortens the latency of glioma onset and survival compared to overexpression of these genes alone. Consequently, p-mTOR, p-Akt and p-ERK pathways are highly upregulated in the brain tumors, in alignment with their oncogenic activities by CDK4 and PIKE-A stably transfected in GBM cell lines. Hence, our findings support that PIKE amplification or overexpression coordinately acts with CDK4 to drive GBM tumorigenesis.",Animal-other,5,1

Animal models of ethanol withdrawal have typically used forced consumption of an ethanol-containing liquid diet to induce dependence. Ethanol vapor inhalation offers an advantage over liquid diet consumption in that the onset of withdrawal can be temporally controlled more precisely, allowing studies of the development of withdrawal symptoms.	The purpose of the current study was to induce ethanol dependence in mice using an inhalation procedure and to assess withdrawal anxiety symptoms behaviorally in the elevated zero maze and in the light/dark box. Male and female mice were exposed to 3 days of ethanol vapors. Anxiety-like behavior was measured on the elevated zero maze and light/dark box at multiple time points during withdrawal.	Mice experiencing ethanol withdrawal demonstrated increased anxiety-like behaviors relative to control animals in both apparatuses. However, this finding was specific to the procedure used with the elevated zero maze and was strongly influenced by sex in the light/dark box.	Ethanol vapor inhalation appears to be a valid tool for the study of withdrawal-induced anxiety.",Animal-other,5,1

A closed diffuse brain injury model was successfully produced in rat by hit the parietal bone with a spring-droved steel stick. The auditory brainstem response evoked by click at 50Hz stimulating frequency were recorded at pre-trauma, 15 min and 1, 3, 6, 12 h and 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 d after brain injury. The pathological changes of brain were observed under light microscope and the brain edema was detected by wet weight/dry weight rations.	The I-V, III-V of BAEP wave inter peak latency (IPL) in MTBI group increased immediately in 15 minutes after injury. The III, V wave peak latency (PL) and I-V, III-V wave IPL became longer than the pre-trauma level in 6, 12 h post-injury (P<0.05). The III, V wave PL and I - III, I - V, III - V wave IPL became longer than the pre-trauma level in 1, 2 d after injury (P < 0.001), the BAEP retuned to normal level in 14 d after brain injury. At 15 minutes after injury, the water content in brain increased and met its peak in 1 d, decreased gradually in 4 d, then decreased slowly and returned to normal level in 10 d after injury.	The regular changes of BAEP could be an objective tool for evaluating hearing dysfunction after closed mild diffuse traumatic brain injury.",Animal-other,5,1

To obtain mechanistic insights about TBI, experimental animal models such as weight-drop-induced TBI in rats have been developed to mimic closed-head injury in humans. However, the relationship between the mechanical impact level and neurological severity following weight-drop-induced TBI remains uncertain. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the relationship between physical impact and graded severity at various weight-drop heights.	The acceleration, impact force, and displacement during the impact were accurately measured using an accelerometer, a pressure sensor, and a high-speed camera, respectively. In addition, the longitudinal changes in neurological deficits and balance function were investigated at 1, 4, and 7 days post TBI lesion. The inflammatory expression markers tested by Western blot analysis, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, beta-amyloid precursor protein, and bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X, in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were investigated at 1 and 7 days post-lesion.	Gradations in impact pressure produced progressive degrees of injury severity in the neurological score and balance function. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all inflammatory expression markers were increased at 1 and 7 days post-impact injury when compared to the sham control rats. The severity of neurologic dysfunction and induction in inflammatory markers strongly correlated with the graded mechanical impact levels.	We conclude that the weight-drop-induced TBI model can produce graded brain injury and induction of neurobehavioral deficits and may have translational relevance to developing therapeutic strategies for TBI.",Animal-other,5,1
1102,35036927,Nature aging,Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Preserves Neuron Survival and Cognition in Alzheimer's Disease Models.,"Amyloid-induced neurodegeneration plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, we show that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) haploinsufficiency decreases BDNF and increases amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor in murine brain. Moreover, prior to disease onset, the TERT locus sustains accumulation of repressive epigenetic marks in murine and human AD neurons, implicating TERT repression in amyloid-induced neurodegeneration. To test the impact of sustained TERT expression on AD pathobiology, AD mouse models were engineered to maintain physiological levels of TERT in adult neurons, resulting in reduced Aβ accumulation, improved spine morphology, and preserved cognitive function. Mechanistically, integrated profiling revealed that TERT interacts with β-catenin and RNA polymerase II at gene promoters and upregulates gene networks governing synaptic signaling and learning processes. These TERT-directed transcriptional activities do not require its catalytic activity nor telomerase RNA. These findings provide genetic proof-of-concept for somatic TERT gene activation therapy in attenuating AD progression including cognitive decline.",Animal-other,5,1

Its pathophysiology remains unclear. PANDAS has been proposed to result from cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against GABHS with brain antigens, but the targets of these antibodies are unclear and may be heterogeneous. We developed an in vivo assay in mice to characterize the cellular targets of antibodies in serum from individuals with PANDAS. We focus on striatal interneurons, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of tic disorders. Sera from children with well-characterized PANDAS (n = 5) from a previously described clinical trial (NCT01281969), and matched controls, were infused into the striatum of mice; antibody binding to interneurons was characterized using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Antibodies from children with PANDAS bound to ∼80% of cholinergic interneurons, significantly higher than the <50% binding seen with matched healthy controls. There was no elevated binding to two different populations of GABAergic interneurons (PV and nNOS-positive), confirming the specificity of this phenomenon. Elevated binding to cholinergic interneurons resolved in parallel with symptom improvement after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Antibody-mediated dysregulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons may be a locus of pathology in PANDAS. Future clarification of the functional consequences of this specific binding may identify new opportunities for intervention in children with this condition.",Animal-other,5,1

However, the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown since plasmatic cholesterol is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that cognitive impairments triggered by hypercholesterolemia during aging may be related to brain oxidative stress and altered brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. We also performed a neuropathological investigation in order to analyze whether the cognitive impairments may be associated with stroke-related features. To address these questions we used three- and fourteen-month-old low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (LDLr-/-). The current findings provide new evidence that aged LDLr-/- mice, exposed to over three-fold cholesterol levels from early life, show working, spatial reference, and procedural memory impairments, without alterations in motor function. Antioxidant imbalance and oxidative damage were evidenced by a marked increase in lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels) and glutathione metabolism (increase in glutathione levels, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase activities) together with a significant increase in the AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex of aged hypercholesterolemic LDLr-/- mice. Notably, hypercholesterolemia was not related to brain infarcts and neurodegeneration in mice, independent of their age. These observations provide new evidence that hypercholesterolemia during aging triggers cognitive impairments on different types of learning and memory, accompanied by antioxidant imbalance, oxidative damage, and alterations of cholinergic signaling in brain areas associated with learning and memory processes, particularly in the prefrontal cortex.",Animal-other,5,1
1105,20058555,Stapp car crash journal,A finite element model of region-specific response for mild diffuse brain injury.,"It is well known that rotational loading is responsible for a spectrum of diffuse brain injuries spanning from concussion to diffuse axonal trauma. Many experimental studies have been performed to understand the pathological and biomechanical factors associated with diffuse brain injuries. Finite element models have also been developed to correlate experimental findings with intrinsic variables such as strain. However, a paucity of studies exist examining the combined role of the strain-time parameter. Consequently, using the principles of finite element analysis, the present study introduced the concept of sustained maximum principal strain (SMPS) criterion and explored its potential applicability to diffuse brain injury. An algorithm was developed to determine if the principal strain in a finite element of the brain exceeded a specified magnitude over a specific time interval. The anatomical and geometrical details of the rat for the two-dimensional model were obtained from published data. Using material properties from literature and iterative techniques, the model was validated under three distinct rotational loading conditions indicative of non-injury, concussion, and diffuse axonal trauma. Validation results produced a set of material properties to define the model and were deemed appropriate to examine the role of sustained strain as an indicator of the mechanics of mild diffuse brain injury at the local level. Using a separate set of histological data obtained from graded mild diffuse brain injury experimental studies in rats, different formulations of SMPS criterion were evaluated. For the hippocampus and parietal cortex regions, 4-4 SMPS criterion was found to most closely match with the pattern of histological results. This was further verified by correlating the fractional areas to the time of unconsciousness for each animal group. Although not fully conclusive, these results are valuable in the understanding of diffuse brain injury pathologies following rotational loading.",Animal-other,5,1

Results were as follows. 1) Significant differences were not observed between the lead-exposed rats and the controls regarding the developmental landmarks in both the Wistar rats and THA rats. Body weight of the exposed rats, however, were significantly less than that of the controls of the two rat strains. 2) Low rate of avoidance, slow acquisition of learning and large individual variabilities were exhibited in both the controls and the exposed rats of the Wistar strain throughout the test sessions. No significant difference was indicated between the controls and the exposed rats of the Wistar strain. In the control THA rats, avoidance learning was acquired rapidly, and a high level and very small individual variabilities of avoidance were demonstrated during the latter sessions of the test. Meanwhile, in the exposed THA rats, slow learning acquisition and large individual variabilities were displayed. It is thought that the learning impairment appearing in the THA exposed rats was induced primarily by lead.",Animal-other,5,1

Here we show that gliomas can originate from differentiated cells in the central nervous system (CNS), including cortical neurons. Transduction by oncogenic lentiviral vectors of neural stem cells (NSCs), astrocytes, or even mature neurons in the brains of mice can give rise to malignant gliomas. All the tumors, irrespective of the site of lentiviral vector injection (the initiating population), shared common features of high expression of stem or progenitor markers and low expression of differentiation markers. Microarray analysis revealed that tumors of astrocytic and neuronal origin match the mesenchymal GBM subtype.

A total of 60 male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into four groups: Nourished/Control (NC, n=15), Nourished/Cerebral Palsy (NCP, n=15); Undernourished/Control (UC, n=15) and Undernourished/Cerebral Palsy (UCP, n=15). Animals of cerebral palsy (CP) group were subjected to an experimental model based on the combination of perinatal anoxia associated with sensorimotor restriction of the hindlimb. In the rats were evaluated body weight gain, intake of breast milk, feed post-weaning consumption, parameters of the chewing, intra-oral sensitivity and muscle properties (muscle weight and distribution of types of fibers) of the masseter and digastric. Animals from undernourished CP group showed greater reduction in most data evaluated including body weight (P<0.05), food intake post-weaning (P<0.05), frequency of chewing cycles (P<0.05), duration of the reactions of 'taste' (P<0.05), muscle weight and decrease of the proportion of type IIB fibers in the masseter muscle (P<0.05). These results demonstrated in rats submitted a cerebral palsy that perinatal undernutrition intensifies the damage in morphological and functional parameters of chewing.",Animal-other,5,1
1111,9042570,The European journal of neuroscience,Adult nestin-expressing subependymal cells differentiate to astrocytes in response to brain injury.,"The adult brain contains a small population of central nervous system (CNS) cells in the subependyma which, like embryonic CNS progenitor cells, express the intermediate filament nestin. In this report, the differentiation capacity in vivo of these cells was analysed following a standardized trauma. Before the trauma, the subependymal cells expressed nestin but not the astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament respectively. In response to injury, the majority of the subependymal cells coexpressed nestin and GFAP, but never nestin and neurofilament. Furthermore, cells coexpressing nestin and GFAP were found progressively further away from the subependyma and closer to the lesion at later time points after the injury, indicating that these cells migrate towards the lesion. Nestin was in addition re-expressed in reactive astrocytes near the lesion and in non-reactive astrocytes very far from the lesion throughout the ipsilateral cortex. In conclusion, our data indicate that the nestin-positive subependymal cells are an in vivo source for the generation of new astrocytes but not neurons after injury, and that nestin re-expression in astrocytes following traumatic stimuli can be used as a sensitive marker for astroglial activation.",Animal-other,5,1
1112,34312771,Molecular neurobiology,Genetic Depletion of Amylin/Calcitonin Receptors Improves Memory and Learning in Transgenic Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Models.,"Based upon its interactions with amyloid β peptide (Aβ), the amylin receptor, a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is a potential modulator of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, past pharmacological approaches have failed to resolve whether activation or blockade of this receptor would have greater therapeutic benefit. To address this issue, we generated compound mice expressing a human amyloid precursor protein gene with familial AD mutations in combination with deficiency of amylin receptors produced by hemizygosity for the critical calcitonin receptor subunit of this heterodimeric GPCR. These compound transgenic AD mice demonstrated attenuated responses to human amylin- and Aβ-induced depression of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in keeping with the genetic depletion of amylin receptors. Both the LTP responses and spatial memory (as measured with Morris water maze) in these mice were improved compared to AD mouse controls and, importantly, a reduction in both the amyloid plaque burden and markers of neuroinflammation was observed. Our data support the notion of further development of antagonists of the amylin receptor as AD-modifying therapies.",Animal-other,5,1
1113,28687401,Neurochemistry international,Pathophysiological role of prostaglandin E2-induced up-regulation of the EP2 receptor in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells and lumbar motor neurons in ALS model mice.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective degeneration of motor neurons. The primary triggers for motor neuronal death are still unknown, but inflammation is considered to be an important factor contributing to the pathophysiology of ALS both clinically and in ALS models. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its corresponding four E-prostanoid receptors play a pivotal role in the degeneration of motor neurons in human and transgenic models of ALS. It has also been shown that PGE2-EP2 signaling in glial cells (astrocytes or microglia) promotes motor neuronal death in G93A mice. The present study was designed to investigate the levels of expression of EP receptors in the spinal motor neurons of ALS model mice and to examine whether PGE2 alters the expression of EP receptors in differentiated NSC-34 cells, a motor neuron-like cell line. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that EP2 and EP3 immunoreactivity was localized in NeuN-positive large cells showing the typical morphology of motor neurons in mice. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that the immunoreactivity of EP2 in motor neurons was significantly increased in the early symptomatic stage in ALS model mice. In contrast, the level of EP3 expression remained constant, irrespective of age. In differentiated NSC-34 cells, bath application of PGE2 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease of MTT reduction. Although PGE2 had no effect on cell survival at concentrations of less than 10 μM, pretreatment with 10 μM PGE2 significantly up-regulated EP2 and concomitantly potentiated cell death induced by 30 μM PGE2. These results suggest that PGE2 is an important effector for induction of the EP2 subtype in differentiated NSC-34 cells, and that not only EP2 up-regulation in glial cells but also EP2 up-regulation in motor neurons plays a pivotal role in the vulnerability of motor neurons in ALS model mice.",Animal-other,5,1
1114,25540200,The Journal of biological chemistry,Tau monoclonal antibody generation based on humanized yeast models: impact on Tau oligomerization and diagnostics.,"A link between Tau phosphorylation and aggregation has been shown in different models for Alzheimer disease, including yeast. We used human Tau purified from yeast models to generate new monoclonal antibodies, of which three were further characterized. The first antibody, ADx201, binds the Tau proline-rich region independently of the phosphorylation status, whereas the second, ADx215, detects an epitope formed by the Tau N terminus when Tau is not phosphorylated at Tyr(18). For the third antibody, ADx210, the binding site could not be determined because its epitope is probably conformational. All three antibodies stained tangle-like structures in different brain sections of THY-Tau22 transgenic mice and Alzheimer patients, and ADx201 and ADx210 also detected neuritic plaques in the cortex of the patient brains. In hippocampal homogenates from THY-Tau22 mice and cortex homogenates obtained from Alzheimer patients, ADx215 consistently stained specific low order Tau oligomers in diseased brain, which in size correspond to Tau dimers. ADx201 and ADx210 additionally reacted to higher order Tau oligomers and presumed prefibrillar structures in the patient samples. Our data further suggest that formation of the low order Tau oligomers marks an early disease stage that is initiated by Tau phosphorylation at N-terminal sites. Formation of higher order oligomers appears to require additional phosphorylation in the C terminus of Tau. When used to assess Tau levels in human cerebrospinal fluid, the antibodies permitted us to discriminate patients with Alzheimer disease or other dementia like vascular dementia, indicative that these antibodies hold promising diagnostic potential.",Animal-other,5,1

Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) are aggressive tumours growing in the central nervous system (CNS). To evaluate the role and characteristics of this immune-privileged site in anti-tumour defences, we compared the cellular and molecular immune microenvironments of growing murine lymphoma B cells injected into the brain or the spleen. In the brain, immune cells, including dendritic cells and T lymphocytes with a large proportion of CD4(+) forkhead box P3 (FoxP3(+)) regulatory T cells, rapidly infiltrated the tumour microenvironment. These populations also increased in number in the spleen. The T cell cytokine profiles in tumour-bearing mice were similar in the two sites, with predominant T helper type 1 (Th1)/Th17 polarization after polyclonal stimulation, although some interleukin (IL)-4 could also be found. We demonstrated that these T cells have anti-tumour activity in the CNS, although less than in the spleen: nude mice that received lymphoma cells intracerebrally died significantly earlier than immunocompetent animals. These results demonstrate that the brain is able to recruit all the major actors to mount a specific anti-tumour immune response against lymphoma.",Animal-other,5,1

The present work studied the temporal variation of three key antioxidant enzymes in cortex and hippocampus during the development of behavioral and cognitive symptoms in 3xTg-AD mice, and as compared to age-matched controls. At 2 months of age, when no intraneuronal Aβ immunoreactivity has been reported, increased neophobia shown as a delayed and reduced rearing, evidenced the onset of BPSD-like symptoms at premorbid stages of disease. In these animals, NQO1 was found increased in both the hippocampus (800%) and cortex (400%) and progressively diminished at older ages. SOD1 was increased in the hippocampus at 4 months of age, when neuronal Aβ accumulation has been established. These hippocampal increases of antioxidants before the prodromal emergence of cognitive symptoms support their role as defense mechanisms. SIRT1 levels showed opposite age-dependent changes in cortex (increase) and hippocampus (decrease) relative to controls. Prodromal cognitive deficits emerged at 6 months of age, concomitantly to cortical overexpression of SIRT1 but down-regulation of NQO1 and SIRT1 in the hippocampus, suggesting inadequate antioxidative protection to prevent or delay the subjacent neuronal damage. The present data further support the link between oxidative status and the anxious profile. Their crosstalk may underline AD-pathological mechanisms that may lead to deranged physiology and selective neuronal degeneration. It also points out increased neophobia and high expression of NQO1 among the first indicators of disease in the 3xTg-AD mice.",Animal-other,5,1

The relationships between the initial changes of myocardial workload, hemodynamic deterioration, and myocardial histological changes caused by acute induction of brain death are unclear. Cats (n = 15) were submitted to brain death by rapid inflation of an intracranial balloon. A further 12 cats served as a sham-operated control group. The changes in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, left ventricular developed pressure, LV dP/dtmax, rate-pressure product (RPP), and circulating noradrenaline and adrenaline were studied during 240 min after the induction of brain death. Central venous pressure was kept constant. The hearts were histologically examined afterward. Electrocerebral activity disappeared within 30 sec after balloon inflation. At 3 min, noradrenaline and adrenaline levels had increased 75- and 40-fold, respectively, compared to pre-induction levels. The hemodynamic response was characterized by an early and rapid increase of hemodynamic variables at 2.9 +/- 0.2 min. This was followed by a second phase of normalization or deterioration. Two distinct subgroups (n = 9) became hemodynamically unstable (HDU), characterized by a systolic arterial blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, at 108 +/- 29 min, and progressively deteriorated to 67 +/- 8 mm Hg at 240 min after inflation of the balloon. The hemodynamic variables of the other, hemodynamically stable (HDS), subgroup (n = 6) normalized at 60 min after inflation. Hemodynamic deterioration of the HDU subgroup compared to the HDS subgroup was significant at 10 min after induction of brain death. The maximum values of RPP were similar in the two subgroups. Respiratory and metabolic variables at the end of the experiment were not different in both subgroups. Histological evidence of myocardial damage was present in 73% (11/15) of the brain dead cats and absent in the control group. The histological changes were identified both in hearts of HDU (6/9) and HDS (5/6) cats. In the cat, no relationships were demonstrated between the acute increase of myocardial workload, the occurrence of hemodynamic deterioration, and myocardial histological changes after rapid induction of brain death. These results may contribute to the discussion whether hemodynamic instability of the donor is an appropriate exclusion criterion for heart transplantation.",Animal-other,5,1
1119,15961528,"American journal of physiology. Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",Increased corpus cavernosum smooth muscle tone associated with partial bladder outlet obstruction is mediated via Rho-kinase.,"Numerous studies have now demonstrated that lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are associated with erectile dysfunction (ED) in men independent of age or general health. Because one-third of men over the age of 50 will develop LUTS and a recent study showed ED in 62% of patients presenting for LUTS, the importance of determining the mechanistic link between these two pathologies is clear. Using a rabbit model of partial bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO), a primary cause of LUTS, we have identified an increased basal corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM) tone associated with an elevated level of smooth muscle myosin (SMM) phosphorylation in PBOO compared with sham-operated control rabbits (sham). Results from in vitro kinase and phosphatase assays using purified smooth muscle myosin showed increased kinase and decreased phosphatase activities in cellular extracts from corpora cavernosa isolated from PBOO compared with sham rabbits. Increased Rho-kinase expression in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits was suggested by the observations that Rho-kinase inhibitors attenuated the increased kinase activity and were less effective in relaxing CCSM strips from PBOO vs. sham rabbits. This hypothesis was then confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, which demonstrated increased expression of both isoforms of Rho-kinase (ROKalpha and ROKbeta). Increased SMM basal phosphorylation (necessary for SM contraction) in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits, mediated via an increase in Rho-kinase expression/activity, would be expected to make the CCSM more difficult to relax (necessary for erection), which suggests that the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway as being involved in the mechanism for LUTS-associated ED.",Animal-other,5,1
1120,12511771,Stroke,Differential regulation of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.,"Angiogenesis occurs after cerebral ischemia, and the extent of angiogenesis has been correlated with survival in stroke patients. However, postischemic angiogenesis is short-lived and may be completely terminated within a few weeks after ischemic insult. The molecular mechanism underlying the dissolution of postischemic angiogenic processes is poorly understood. Although the expression of angiogenic genes has been studied in ischemic stroke models, the activation of angiostatic genes after cerebral ischemia has not been investigated. Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and TSP-2 are naturally occurring angiostatic factors, which inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. The aim of the present study was to explore the expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2 in relation to the evolution of angiogenic process in a focal ischemia model in rats.	Rats underwent cortical ischemia in the middle cerebral artery territory for 60 minutes and reperfusion for up to 2 weeks. Northern and Western blot analysis were used to study the temporal profile of TSP-1 and TSP-2 expression at the mRNA and protein level, respectively. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies were used to examine the spatial expression patterns. Double immunostaining was applied to define the cellular origins of TSP-1 and TSP-2.	A biphasic expression of TSP-1 was noted after ischemia, peaking at 1 and 72 hours. Endothelial cells in the leptomeninges were the only source of the first TSP-1 peak, whereas endothelial, glial, neuronal, and macrophage cells contributed to the second peak of TSP-1 expression. TSP-2 expression occurred much later and in a monophasic manner, peaking 2 weeks after ischemia. TSP-2 immunoreactivity was observed in endothelial, neuronal, and macrophage, but not glial, cells. TSP-1 was expressed before the peak of angiogenesis, whereas robust TSP-2 expression occurred at the peak of angiogenesis and continued into the period when angiogenesis had completely resolved.	Robust expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2, 2 major angiostatic factors, was noted in the ischemic brain with different temporal expression profiles from different cellular origins. The expression of these angiostatic factors, especially TSP-2, likely contributes to the spontaneous resolution of postischemic angiogenesis. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance of angiogenic and angiostatic factors in the ischemic brain.",Animal-other,5,1

The transcription network involved in regulating the size of the effector population, particularly for CD4 Th cells, is poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of Id2, an inhibitor of E protein transcription factors, in the generation of CD4 effectors. Using a T cell-specific conditional Id2 knockout mouse model, we show that inhibitor of DNA binding (Id)2 is essential for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Although Ag-specific and IL-17-producing CD4 T cells are produced in these mice, the activated CD4 T cells form a smaller pool of effector cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs, exhibit reduced proliferation and increased cell death, and are largely absent in the CNS. In the absence of Id2, E protein targets, including the proapoptotic protein Bim and SOCS3, are expressed at higher levels among activated CD4 T cells. This study reveals a critical role of Id2 in the control of effector CD4 T cell population size and the development of a Th17-mediated autoimmune disease.",Animal-other,5,1

Purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamics of T2* changes in ischemic tissue.	We investigated earliest temporo-spatial dynamics within ischemic tissue, measured with quantitative T2* imaging in the histologically defined infarct core and surrounding surviving tissue. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced by a filament model in mice. Serial multiple gradient-echo T2* sequences and diffusion-weighted images were acquired for 60min after MCAO and repeated for 60min after recanalization. T2* maps were co-registered with histology and T2* changes were compared to the contralateral hemisphere.	Within the histologically defined infarct core, relative T2* values decreased significantly by -10.8±2.8% (P=0.003) compared to the contralateral hemisphere within 3.5±0.7min after MCAO. Relative T2* values in volume exceeding the histologically determined infarct core were significantly less decreased (-6.7±2.1%; P=0.02) and increased after recanalization (+3.9±1.9%; P=0.045). Volume with T2* decrease showed continuous growth over 60min after MCAO (P=0.002) and decreased during 60min after recanalization (P=0.026), showing most significant correlations between infarct core volume and T2* abnormality volume (r=0.66; P=0.037) of the last image acquired after recanalization.	To our best knowledge, this is the first application of non-invasive quantitative T2* measurements to assess changes in levels of deoxyhemoglobin as an indirect biomarker for metabolic impairment in ischemic tissue.

Their roles in CNS integrity and functions under pathological conditions remain largely unknown. Until recently, BAMs and microglia could not be unequivocally distinguished due to expression of common macrophage markers. We investigated the transcriptional profiles of immunosorted BAMs from rat sham-operated and ischemic brains using RNA sequencing. We found that BAMs express the distinct transcriptional signature than microglia and infiltrating macrophages. The enrichment of functional groups associated with the cell cycle in CD163[+] cells isolated 3 days after the ischemic injury indicates the proliferative capacity of these cells. The increased number of CD163[+] cells 3 days post-ischemia was corroborated by flow cytometry and detecting the increased number of CD163[+] cells positive for a proliferation marker Ki67 at perivascular spaces. CD163[+] cells in the ischemic brains up-regulated many inflammatory genes and parenchymal CD163+ cells expressed iNOS, which indicates acquisition of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. In mice, BAMs typically express CD206 and we found a subset of these cells expressing CD169. Chimeric mice generated by transplanting bone marrow of donor Cx3cr1[gfp]CCR2[rfp] mice to wild type hosts showed an increased number of CX3CR1[+]CD169[+] perivascular macrophages 3 days post-ischemia. Furthermore, these cells accumulated in the brain parenchyma and we detected replacement of perivascular macrophages by peripheral monocytic cells in the sub-acute phase of stroke. In line with the animal results, post-mortem brain samples from human ischemic stroke cases showed time-dependent accumulation of CD163[+] cells in the ischemic parenchyma.

1127,31758600,Journal of neuroscience research,Parenchymal pericytes are not the major contributor of extracellular matrix in the fibrotic scar after stroke in male mice.,"Scar formation after injury of the brain or spinal cord is a common event. While glial scar formation by astrocytes has been extensively studied, much less is known about the fibrotic scar, in particular after stroke. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor ß-expressing (PDGFRß[+]) pericytes have been suggested as a source of the fibrotic scar depositing fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins after detaching from the vessel wall. However, to what extent these parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells contribute to the fibrotic scar and whether targeting these cells affects fibrotic scar formation in stroke is still unclear. Here, we utilize male transgenic mice that after a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model have a shift from a parenchymal to a perivascular location of PDGFRß[+] cells due to the loss of regulator of G-protein signaling 5 in pericytes. We find that only a small fraction of parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells co-label with type I collagen and fibronectin. Consequently, a reduction in parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells by ca. 50% did not affect the overall type I collagen or fibronectin deposition after stroke. The redistribution of PDGFRß[+] cells to a perivascular location, however, resulted in a reduced thickening of the vascular basement membrane and changed the temporal dynamics of glial scar maturation after stroke. We demonstrate that parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells are not the main contributor to the fibrotic ECM, and therefore targeting these cells might not impact on fibrotic scar formation after stroke.",Animal-other,5,1

The signals that regulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus following ischemic stroke insult are not well known. We have previously reported that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression is necessary for ischemia-stimulated neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus. Here, we show that mice subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) significantly increased the number of new neurons and up-regulated iNOS expression in the dentate gyrus. Blockade of the L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (L-VGCC) prevented neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone (SVZ), and down-regulated iNOS expression in the dentate gyrus after cerebral ischemia.

Besides motor impairment, PD patients exhibit non-motor symptoms that negatively impact their quality of life and often manifest prior to motor deficits. One such symptom is mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), which is comprised of deficits in executive function such as working memory, attention, cognitive flexibility, and spatial memory. The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced unilateral medial forebrain bundle (MFB) lesion animal model successfully recapitulates PD motor impairment but is also used to assess non-motor deficits. The present study utilizes a unilateral 6-OHDA induced MFB lesion rodent model to investigate prefrontal cortex (PFC)-mediated cognitive processes that are impaired in PD patients. In a test of attentional set shifting, PD rodents demonstrated deficits in simple discrimination, but not in rule reversal or extradimensional shifts. PD rodents also exhibited deficits in a temporal order memory task but had no deficits in novel/spatial object recognition or object-in-place tasks. These results reveal limitations of the 6-OHDA induced unilateral MFB lesion model to completely recapitulate PD-MCI symptoms suggesting a need for better lesion models to study PD-MCI.",Animal-other,5,1

Therefore, we investigated the influence of acute hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia induced by glucose or insulin infusion on neuronal and humoral control of vascular tone in rats. Euglycemic male Wistar rats were pithed under anesthesia and arterial blood pressure was measured. Changes in vascular responses to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and intravenous bolus injections of noradrenaline, angiotensin II, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were studied by infusing various concentrations of glucose or insulin. Continuous glucose infusion, which increased both blood glucose and serum insulin levels, significantly augmented adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses to SCS without affecting pressor responses to injection of noradrenaline or angiotensin II. In pithed rats with artificially increased blood pressure and blockade of autonomic outflow, glucose infusion attenuated CGRPergic nerve-depressor responses to SCS without affecting depressor responses to injection of CGRP, acetylcholine or SNP. In pithed rats treated with octreotide, which increased blood glucose without increasing serum insulin levels, glucose infusion caused only significant augmentation of adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses. Combined infusion of insulin and glucose, which resulted in increased serum insulin levels with euglycemia, significantly augmented adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses and attenuated CGRPergic nerve-mediated depressor responses. The present results suggest that acute hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia increase adrenergic nerve-mediated vasoconstriction, which in turn blunts CGRPergic nerve function, and that the increase in plasma insulin concentration associated with hyperglycemia may be responsible for the alteration of neuronal vascular regulation.",Animal-other,5,1

We used inducible Ube3a mouse models to investigate the maturation of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from dorsomedial striatum. MSNs of mutant mice matured properly till postnatal day 15 (P15) but remained hyperexcitable with fewer excitatory synaptic events at later ages, indicative of stalled striatal maturation in Ube3a mice. Reinstatement of UBE3A expression at P21 fully restored MSN excitability but only partially restored synaptic transmission and the operant conditioning behavioral phenotype. Gene reinstatement at P70 failed to rescue both electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. In contrast, deletion of Ube3a after normal brain development did not result in these electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. This study emphasizes the role of UBE3A in striatal maturation and the importance of early postnatal reinstatement of UBE3A expression to obtain a full rescue of behavioral phenotypes associated with striatal function in AS.",Animal-other,5,1
1133,11018077,The Journal of clinical investigation,Chronic alcohol ingestion induces osteoclastogenesis and bone loss through IL-6 in mice.,"To investigate the role of IL-6 in alcohol-mediated osteoporosis, we measured a variety of bone remodeling parameters in wild-type (il6(+/+)) or IL-6 gene knockout (il6(-/-)) mice that were fed either control or ethanol liquid diets for 4 months. In the il6(+/+) mice, ethanol ingestion decreased bone mineral density, as determined by dual-energy densitometry; decreased cancellous bone volume and trabecular width and increased trabecular spacing and osteoclast surface, as determined by histomorphometry of the femur; increased urinary deoxypyridinolines, as determined by ELISA; and increased CFU-GM formation and osteoclastogenesis as determined ex vivo in bone marrow cell cultures. In contrast, ethanol ingestion did not alter any of these parameters in the il6(-/-) mice. Ethanol increased receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) mRNA expression in the bone marrow of il6(+/+) but not il6(-/-) mice. Additionally, ethanol decreased several osteoblastic parameters including osteoblast perimeter and osteoblast culture calcium retention in both il6(+/+) and il6(-/-) mice. These findings demonstrate that ethanol induces bone loss through IL-6. Furthermore, they suggest that IL-6 achieves this effect by inducing RANKL and promoting CFU-GM formation and osteoclastogenesis.",Animal-other,5,1

To investigate a possible relationship among the grade of brachycephaly, ventricular dilatation, and skull dysmorphologies in Persian cats.	92 Persian-, 10 Domestic shorthair cats.	The grade of brachycephaly was determined on skull models based on CT datasets. Cranial measurements were examined with regard to a possible correlation with relative ventricular volume, and cranial capacity. Persians with high (peke-face Persians) and lower grades of brachycephaly (doll-face Persians) were investigated for the presence of skull dysmorphologies.	The mean cranial index of the peke-face Persians (0.97 ± 0.14) was significantly higher than the mean cranial index of doll-face Persians (0.66 ± 0.04; P < 0.001). Peke-face Persians had a lower relative nasal bone length (0.15 ± 0.04) compared to doll-face (0.29 ± 0.08; P < 0.001). The endocranial volume was significantly lower in doll-face than peke-face Persians (89.6 ± 1.27% versus 91.76 ± 2.07%; P < 0.001). The cranial index was significantly correlated with this variable (Spearman's r: 0.7; P < 0.0001). Mean ventricle: Brain ratio of the peke-face group (0.159 ± 0.14) was significantly higher compared to doll-face Persians (0.015 ± 0.01; P < 0.001).	High grades of brachycephaly are also associated with malformations of the calvarial and facial bones as well as dental malformations. As these dysmorphologies can affect animal welfare, the selection for extreme forms of brachycephaly in Persian cats should be reconsidered.",Animal-other,5,1
1135,37749080,Nature communications,Blockade of interferon signaling decreases gut barrier integrity and promotes severe West Nile virus disease.,"The determinants of severe disease caused by West Nile virus (WNV) and why only ~1% of individuals progress to encephalitis remain poorly understood. Here, we use human and mouse enteroids, and a mouse model of pathogenesis, to explore the capacity of WNV to directly infect gastrointestinal (GI) tract cells and contribute to disease severity. At baseline, WNV poorly infects human and mouse enteroid cultures and enterocytes in mice. However, when STAT1 or type I interferon (IFN) responses are absent, GI tract cells become infected, and this is associated with augmented GI tract and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, accumulation of gut-derived molecules in the brain, and more severe WNV disease. The increased gut permeability requires TNF-α signaling, and is absent in WNV-infected IFN-deficient germ-free mice. To link these findings to human disease, we measured auto-antibodies against type I IFNs in serum from WNV-infected human cohorts. A greater frequency of auto- and neutralizing antibodies against IFN-α2 or IFN-ω is present in patients with severe WNV infection, whereas virtually no asymptomatic WNV-infected subjects have such antibodies (odds ratio 24 [95% confidence interval: 3.0 - 192.5; P = 0.003]). Overall, our experiments establish that blockade of type I IFN signaling extends WNV tropism to enterocytes, which correlates with increased gut and BBB permeability, and more severe disease.",Animal-other,5,1

We have considered the possibility that portasystemic shunting may be a factor determining the organ distribution of copper in patients with liver disease. Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into a sham-operated group, and a group subjected to partial occlusion of the portal vein (PPVO). Half the rats in each group were fed on normal diet and the remainder had copper added to the drinking water. Rats subjected to PPVO developed large portasystemic shunts. Over a 3-month period, none of the groups showed an increase in serum copper concentrations, or copper oxidase levels. Liver and kidney copper concentrations were similarly increased in copper supplemented sham-operated and PPVO rats, but brain copper content in both groups was similar to the unsupplemented controls. In neither unsupplemented nor copper supplemented rats subjected to PPVO, was the organ distribution of copper different from sham-operated controls. This study suggests that portasystemic shunting does not alter the organ distribution, or tissue concentration of copper.",Animal-other,5,1

We have used microarray analysis in a monkey model of neuroAIDS to identify 98 genes, many previously unrecognized in lentiviral CNS pathogenesis, whose expression is significantly up-regulated in the frontal lobe of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected brains. Further, through immunohistochemical illumination, distinct classes of genes were found whose protein products localized to infiltrating macrophages, endothelial cells and resident glia, such as CD163, Glut5, and ISG15. In addition we found proteins induced in cortical neurons (ie, cyclin D3, tissue transglutaminase, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and STAT1), which have not previously been described as participating in simian immunodeficiency virus or HIV-related CNS pathology. This molecular phenotyping in the infected brains revealed pathways promoting entry of macrophages into the brain and their subsequent detrimental effects on neurons. These data support the hypothesis that in HIV-induced CNS disease products of activated macrophages and astrocytes lead to CNS dysfunction by directly damaging neurons, as well as by induction of altered gene and protein expression profiles in neurons themselves which are deleterious to their function.",Animal-other,5,1

1139,28690033,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",Schisantherin A attenuates ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal injury in rats via regulation of TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways.,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and C5aR1 (CD88) have been recognized as potential therapeutic targets for the reduction of inflammation and secondary damage and improvement of outcome after ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). The inflammatory responses which induce cell apoptosis and necrosis after I/R brain injury lead to a limited process of neural repair. To further comprehend how these targets function in I/R state, we investigated the pathological changes and TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo models of I/R brain injury in this study. Meanwhile, we explored the roles of schisantherin A on I/R brain injury, and whether it exerted neuroprotective effects by regulating the TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways or not. The results showed that schisantherin A significantly reduced the neuronal apoptosis induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) injury in primary culture of rat cortical neurons. Also, schisantherin A alleviated neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume, attenuated oxidation stress, inflammation and apoptosis in ischemic parietal cortex of rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury. Moreover, the activated TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways were inhibited by schisantherin A treatment. In conclusion, TLR4 and C5aR1 played a vital role during I/R brain injury in rats, and schisantherin A exhibited neuroprotective effects by TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways. These findings also provided new insights that would aid in elucidating the effect of schisantherin A against cerebral I/R and support the development of schisantherin A as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke.",Animal-other,5,1

In our present study, we investigated the changes in oxygenation and analyzed the vascular perfusion of the spinal cord in a rodent model of MS. We performed multispectral optoacoustic tomography of the lumbar spinal cord before and after an oxygen enhancement challenge in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. In addition, mice were transcardially perfused with lectin to label the vasculature and their spinal columns were optically cleared, followed by light sheet fluorescence microscopy. To analyze the angioarchitecture of the intact spine, we used VesSAP, a novel deep learning-based framework. In EAE mice, the spinal cord had lower oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration compared to healthy mice, indicating compromised perfusion of the spinal cord. Oxygen administration reversed hypoxia in the spinal cord of EAE mice, although the ventral region remained hypoxic. Additionally, despite the increased vascular density, we report a reduction in length and complexity of the perfused vascular network in EAE. Taken together, these findings highlight a new aspect of neuroinflammatory pathology, revealing a significant degree of hypoxia in EAE in vivo that is accompanied by changes in spinal vascular perfusion. The study also introduces optoacoustic imaging as a tractable technique with the potential to further decipher the role of hypoxia in EAE and to monitor it in MS patients.",Animal-other,5,1
1141,33863723,Science advances,"Netrin-1 receptor UNC5C cleavage by active δ-secretase enhances neurodegeneration, promoting Alzheimer's disease pathologies.","Netrin-1, a family member of laminin-related secreted proteins, mediates axon guidance and cell migration during neural development. T835M mutation in netrin receptor UNC5C predisposes to the late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases neuronal cell death. However, it remains unclear how this receptor is molecularly regulated in AD. Here, we show that δ-secretase selectively cleaves UNC5C and escalates its proapoptotic activity, facilitating neurodegeneration in AD. Netrin deficiency activates δ-secretase that specifically cuts UNC5C at N467 and N547 residues and enhances subsequent caspase-3 activation, additively augmenting neuronal cell death. Blockade of δ-secretase cleavage of UNC5C diminishes T835M mutant's proapoptotic activity. Viral expression of δ-secretase-truncated UNC5C fragments into APP/PS1 mice strongly accelerates AD pathologies, impairing learning and memory. Conversely, deletion of UNC5C from netrin-1-depleted mice attenuates AD pathologies and rescues cognitive disorders. Hence, δ-secretase truncates UNC5C and elevates its neurotoxicity, contributing to AD pathogenesis.",Animal-other,5,1

Dependence on interactions between fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor-9.,"The growth factor signaling mechanisms responsible for neointimal smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and accumulation, a characteristic feature of many vascular pathologies that can lead to restenosis after angioplasty, remain to be identified. Here, we examined the contribution of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 2 and 3 as well as novel fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) to such proliferation. Balloon catheter injury to the rat carotid artery stimulated the expression of two distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms, differing only by the presence or absence of the acidic box, and two distinctly spliced FGFR-3 isoforms containing the acidic box and differing only by the presence of either the IIIb or IIIc exon. Post-injury arterial administration of recombinant adenoviruses expressing dominant negative mutant forms of these FGFRs were used to assess the roles of the endogenous FGFR isoforms in neointimal SMC proliferation. Dominant negative FGFR-2 containing the acidic box inhibited such proliferation by 40%, whereas the dominant negative FGFR-3 forms had little effect. Expression of FGF-9, known to be capable of binding to all four neointimal FGFR-2/-3 isoforms, was abundant within the neointima. FGF-9 markedly stimulated both the proliferation of neointimal SMCs and the activation of extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2, effects which were abrogated by the administration of antisense FGF-9 oligonucleotides to injured arteries and the expression of the dominant negative FGFR-2 adenovirus in cultured neointimal SMCs. These studies demonstrate that, although multiple FGFRs are induced in neointimal SMCs following arterial injury, specific interactions between distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms and FGF-9 contribute to the proliferation of these SMCs.",Animal-other,5,1
1143,18634851,Neuroscience letters,Deletion of both ICAM-1 and C3 enhances severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis compared to C3-deficient mice.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and leukocyte infiltration, demyelination of neurons, and blood-brain barrier breakdown. The development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for MS is dependent on a number of components of the immune system including complement and adhesion molecules. Previous studies in our lab have examined the role of C3, the central complement component, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) a key cell adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation including the CNS. In these studies we demonstrated that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE is markedly attenuated in both ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) mice. Given the pivotal role that these proteins play in EAE, we hypothesized that EAE in ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) double mutant mice would likely fail to develop. Unexpectedly, EAE in ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice was only modestly attenuated compared to wild type mice and significantly worse than C3(-/-) mice. Leukocyte infiltration was commensurate with disease severity between the three groups of mice. Spinal cord T cells from ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice produced the highest levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, despite reduced disease severity compared to wild type mice. The mechanisms behind the elevated EAE severity in ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice may relate to altered homing of leukocytes or processing of self-antigens in the double mutant background.",Animal-other,5,1
1144,15544577,"Genes, brain, and behavior",A phenotypic and molecular characterization of the fmr1-tm1Cgr fragile X mouse.,"Fragile X Syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation. It is also known for having a substantial behavioral morbidity, including autistic features. In humans, Fragile X Syndrome is almost always caused by inactivation of the X-linked FMR1 gene. A single knockout mouse model, fmr1-tm1Cgr, exists. In this report we further characterize the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of the fmr1-tm1Cgr Fragile X mouse through the use of F1 hybrid mice derived from two inbred strains (FVB/NJ and C57BL/6J). Use of F1 hybrids allows focus on the effects of the fmr1-tm1Cgr allele with reduced influence from recessive alleles present in the parental inbred strains. We find that the cognitive phenotype of fmr1-tm1Cgr mice, including measures of working memory and learning set formation that are known to be seriously impacted in humans with Fragile X Syndrome, are essentially normal. Further testing of inbred strains supports this conclusion. Thus, any fmr1-tm1Cgr cognitive deficit is surprisingly mild or absent. There is, however, clear support presented for a robust audiogenic seizure phenotype in all strains tested, as well as increased entries into the center of an open field. Finally, a molecular examination of the fmr1-tm1Cgr mouse shows that, contrary to common belief, it is not a molecular null. Implications of this finding for interpretation of the phenotype are discussed.",Animal-other,5,1
1145,2173558,The Biochemical journal,Thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor occupancy determines the fraction of the responsive pool of inositol lipids hydrolysed in rat pituitary tumour cells.,"We report that there are distinct thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-responsive and -unresponsive pools of inositol (Ins) lipids in rat pituitary tumour (GH3) cells, and present evidence that the size of the responsive pool is determined by the number of activated TRH-receptor complexes. By use of an experimental protocol in which cycling of [3H]Ins is inhibited and resynthesis occurs with unlabelled Ins only, we were able to measure specifically the effects of TRH on the hydrolysis of the Ins lipids present before stimulation. A maximally effective dose of TRH (1 microM) caused a time-dependent decrease in 3H-labelled Ins lipids that attained a steady-state value of 42 +/- 1% of the initial level between 1.5 and 2 h. After 2 h, even though there was no further decrease in 3H-labelled Ins lipids, and no increase in [3H]Ins or [3H]Ins phosphates, turnover of Ins lipids, as assessed as incorporation of [32P]Pi into PtdIns, continued at a rate similar to that in cells incubated without LiCl or unlabelled Ins. These data indicate that Ins lipid turnover was not desensitized during prolonged TRH stimulation. Depletion of lipid 3H radioactivity by TRH occurred at higher TRH doses on addition of the competitive antagonist chlordiazepoxide. Addition of 1 microM-TRH after 3 h of stimulation by a sub-maximal (0.3 nM) TRH dose caused a further decrease in 3H radioactivity to the minimum level (40% of initial value). We propose that the TRH-responsive pool of Ins lipids in GH3 cells is composed of the complement of Ins lipids that are within functional proximity of activated TRH-receptor complexes.",Animal-other,5,1

The state of the astrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). HCP and TET caused a dose-related spongiosis, but cuprizone had no significant effect on the brain. With chronic HCP treatment, the spongiosis was accompanied by astrocyte hypertrophy and proliferation, and the extent of the gliotic reaction was related to the dose of HCP. The results demonstrate that HCP can produce and maintain astrocyte proliferation in the rat brain.

1147,15680341,Brain research,The effect of central cholinergic and noradrenergic denervation on hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth and apoptosis-like reactivity in the rat.,"In this study, the effect of intraseptal injection of specific cholinotoxin 192-IgG saporin (SAP) +/- intraperitoneal injection of N-[chloroethyl]-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) (noradrenergic fiber neurotoxin) was examined in rat hippocampus. Medial septal lesions resulted not only in selective cholinergic denervation of hippocampus (Medial septal lesion + ganglionectomy; SAP + Gx) but also in hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth (IG) of adrenergic fibers (Medial septal lesion + sham ganglionectomy; SAP + IG). Saporin-induced septal lesions produced a significant reduction in hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity in all tested groups (SAP + IG +/- DSP-4 and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4), and an increase in noradrenaline concentration in the SAP + IG group. Visualization of noradrenergic fibers by histofluorescence revealed a mixture of fine and thick varicosities in the SAP + IG but only fine fibers in control and SAP + Gx animals. SAP + IG + DSP-4 lesions produced significant reduction in noradrenaline concentration in all groups with a concomitant decrease in visualization of central noradrenergic fibers in dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Treatment of SAP + IG animals with DSP-4 left mostly thick fibers, probably derived from peripheral sympathetic ingrowth. No fluorescence was seen in either the control + DSP-4 or SAP + Gx + DSP-4 animals. Apoptotic-like changes, using in situ oligonucleotide ligation techniques, were also assessed. Proapoptotic changes were seen in the SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 group as compared to CON +/- DSP-4 groups. SAP + IG regardless of DSP-4 treatment protected hippocampal cells from apoptotic cell death when compared to positive control and SAP + Gx +/- DSP-4 groups. In summary, elevated noradrenaline concentration following specific cholinergic denervation probably reflects compensatory hippocampal ingrowth originating from the peripheral sympathetic system which may be responsible for neuroprotective effects, i.e., antiapoptosis-like effect. Since cholinergic and noradrenergic systems are known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease and related cognitive function, knowing how these neurotransmitters work after specific lesions may be of importance as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease and as a potential target for Alzheimer's disease drug therapies.",Animal-other,5,1

Annual Conference,Towards a method to study neurorobotic control in a rat model of spinal cord injury.,"Neurorobotic control of prosthetic devices may bea viable therapeutic intervention that provides spinal cord injury patients with the ability to use the neuronal activity of populations of single neurons to control an external device (i.e.cursor on a computer screen or robotic arm). However, we are limited by our understanding of how spinal cord injury alters the ability of these neurons to convey information about the intention to move. Therefore, there is a need to develop animal models that 1) describe how population of single neurons encode information about different behavioral tasks (skilled vs.unskilled), 2) determine how this encoding is modulated by spinal cord injury and 3) perform neurorobotic control after spinal cord injury. To address the first question, we developed a rat model of spinal cord transection to evaluate the effects of the injury on the neuronal activity related to hindlimb activity. The model consists of training the rat to press a pedal with its hindlimbs. This paper describes the method that defines both the magnitude and latency of a neuron's activity in terms of its Peri-Event Histogram relative to the animal's movements during the task. The method provides a means by which changes in neural activation can be correlated with changes in behavior.",Animal-other,5,1

First, we found that the specific ethanol sensitivity hypothesis is not supported by the relevant literature. Second, we found that much of the ambiguity with respect to this hypothesis concerns just pentobarbital. Consequently, the major intent of this paper was to further explore what effect pentobarbital had on these two mouse lines. Additionally, we examined the effects of barbital and ethanol. Our results for each of these compounds clearly indicate that when these mouse lines can be differentiated by particular doses the long-sleep animals always displayed greater narcotic reactions. In this inquiry only one sex was employed, and testing was always initiated at the same time of day. It is our contention that many of the equivocal findings that have been reported concerning pentobarbital are due to combining data from both sexes, circadian rhythmicity, and similar procedural variables.",Animal-other,5,1
1150,4075172,Brain research,Thiamine deficiency depletes cortical norepinephrine and impairs learning processes in the rat.,"Several lines of evidence indicate that thiamine deficiency causes the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a human memory disorder. The present study examined behavioral deficits in rats after recovery from a bout of thiamine deficiency. Following behavioral testing, the brains were dissected into regions and assayed biochemically for levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and the primary metabolites of these monoamines. Based on previous findings in this laboratory, we predicted that thiamine deficiency not only produces behavioral deficits but loss in catecholamines as well. Impairments were observed for a spatial delayed alternation task that had been learned prior to experimental treatment. In addition, experimental animals were impaired in their ability to acquire two novel tasks, active and passive shock avoidance, after recovery from the acute effects of thiamine deficiency. Comparable deficits were not observed for a number of reflex responses that were measured to assess the general neurological state of the animals. Biochemical analyses revealed that the concentration of norepinephrine was reduced significantly in cortex-hippocampus and olfactory bulb but not in other regions, while dopamine and serotonin levels were not altered in any brain region examined. These data demonstrate that a bout of thiamine deficiency can produce persistent deficits in brain norepinephrine and concomitant decrements in behavioral measures of learning and memory. These results are consistent with our hypothesis and evidence that noradrenergic deficits contribute to the amnesic symptoms of Korsakoff's psychosis.",Animal-other,5,1
1151,37578236,Journal of virology,The La Crosse virus class II fusion glycoprotein ij loop contributes to infectivity and replication in vitro and in vivo.,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are an emerging and evolving global public health threat, with limited antiviral treatments or vaccines available. La Crosse virus (LACV) from the Bunyavirales order is responsible for pediatric encephalitis cases in the United States, yet little is known about the infectivity of LACV. Given the structural similarities between class II fusion glycoproteins of LACV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus from the Togaviridae family, we hypothesized that LACV would share similar entry mechanisms with CHIKV. To test this hypothesis, we performed cholesterol-depletion and repletion assays and used cholesterol-modulating compounds to study LACV entry and replication. We found that LACV entry was cholesterol dependent, while replication was less affected by cholesterol manipulation. In addition, we generated single-point mutants in the LACV Gc ij loop that corresponded to known CHIKV residues important for virus entry. We found that a conserved histidine and alanine residue in the Gc ij loop impaired virus infectivity and attenuated LACV replication in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we took an evolution-based approach to explore how the LACV glycoprotein evolves in mosquitoes and mice. We found multiple variants that cluster in the Gc glycoprotein head domain, providing evidence for the Gc glycoprotein as a contributor to LACV adaptation. Together, these results begin to characterize the mechanisms of LACV infectivity and how the LACV glycoprotein contributes to replication and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Vector-borne viruses are significant health threats that lead to devastating disease worldwide. The emergence of arboviruses, in addition to the lack of effective antivirals or vaccines, highlights the need to study how arboviruses replicate at the molecular level. One potential antiviral target is the class II fusion glycoprotein. Alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and bunyaviruses encode a class II fusion glycoprotein that contains strong structural similarities at the tip of domain II. Here, we show that the bunyavirus La Crosse virus uses a cholesterol-dependent entry pathway similar to the alphavirus chikungunya virus, and residues in the ij loop are important for virus infectivity in vitro and replication in mice. These studies show that genetically diverse viruses may use similar pathways through conserved structure domains, suggesting that these viruses may be targets for broad-spectrum antivirals in multiple arboviral families.",Animal-other,5,1
1152,34526055,Molecular neurodegeneration,Adult-onset CNS myelin sulfatide deficiency is sufficient to cause Alzheimer's disease-like neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.,"Human genetic association studies point to immune response and lipid metabolism, in addition to amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau, as major pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by microglia and astrocytes, plays a causative role in neurodegeneration in AD. Our group and others have reported early and dramatic losses of brain sulfatide in AD cases and animal models that are mediated by ApoE in an isoform-dependent manner and accelerated by Aβ accumulation. To date, it remains unclear if changes in specific brain lipids are sufficient to drive AD-related pathology.	To study the consequences of CNS sulfatide deficiency and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we developed a novel mouse model of adult-onset myelin sulfatide deficiency, i.e., tamoxifen-inducible myelinating glia-specific cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) conditional knockout mice (CST[fl/fl]/Plp1-CreERT), took advantage of constitutive CST knockout mice (CST[-/-]), and generated CST/ApoE double knockout mice (CST[-/-]/ApoE[-/-]), and assessed these mice using a broad range of methodologies including lipidomics, RNA profiling, behavioral testing, PLX3397-mediated microglia depletion, mass spectrometry (MS) imaging, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and Western blot.	We found that mild central nervous system (CNS) sulfatide losses within myelinating cells are sufficient to activate disease-associated microglia and astrocytes, and to increase the expression of AD risk genes (e.g., Apoe, Trem2, Cd33, and Mmp12), as well as previously established causal regulators of the immune/microglia network in late-onset AD (e.g., Tyrobp, Dock, and Fcerg1), leading to chronic AD-like neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment. Notably, neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment showed gender differences, being more pronounced in females than males. Subsequent mechanistic studies demonstrated that although CNS sulfatide losses led to ApoE upregulation, genetically-induced myelin sulfatide deficiency led to neuroinflammation independently of ApoE. These results, together with our previous studies (sulfatide deficiency in the context of AD is mediated by ApoE and accelerated by Aβ accumulation) placed both Aβ and ApoE upstream of sulfatide deficiency-induced neuroinflammation, and suggested a positive feedback loop where sulfatide losses may be amplified by increased ApoE expression. We also demonstrated that CNS sulfatide deficiency-induced astrogliosis and ApoE upregulation are not secondary to microgliosis, and that astrogliosis and microgliosis seem to be driven by activation of STAT3 and PU.1/Spi1 transcription factors, respectively.	Our results strongly suggest that sulfatide deficiency is an important contributor and driver of neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment in AD pathology.",Animal-other,5,1

The aim of the study was to characterize the peripheral and central neuroinflammatory process in the trigeminal pathways in response to cornea alteration induced by chronic topical instillations of 0.2% benzalkonium chloride (BAC) in male C57BL/6J mice. In vitro BAC induced neurotoxicity and increases neuronal (FOS, ATF3) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6) markers in primary mouse trigeminal ganglion culture. BAC-treated mice exhibited 7days after the treatment reduced aqueous tear production and increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the cornea. Hypertonic saline-evoked eye wipe behavior was enhanced in BAC-treated animals that exhibited increased FOS, ATF3 and Iba1 immunoreactivity in the trigeminal ganglion. Ocular inflammation is associated with a significant increase in IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA expression in the trigeminal ganglion. We reported a strong increase in FOS and Iba1 positive cells in particular in the sensory trigeminal complex at the ipsilateral interpolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) transition and Vc/upper cervical cord (Vc/C1) regions. In addition, activated microglial cells were tightly wrapped around activated FOS neurons in both regions and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was markedly enhanced specifically in microglial cells during ocular inflammation. Similar data were obtained in the facial motor nucleus. These neuroanatomical data correlated with the increase in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2) and neuronal (FOS and ATF3) markers. Interestingly, the suppression of corneal inflammation 10days following the end of BAC treatment resulted in a marked attenuation of peripheral and central changes observed in pathological conditions. This study provides the first demonstration that corneal inflammation induces activation of neurons and microglial p38 MAPK pathway within sensory trigeminal complex. These results suggest that this altered activity in intracellular signaling caused by ocular inflammation might play a priming role in the central sensitization of ocular related brainstem circuits, which represents a significant factor in ocular pain development.",Animal-other,5,1
1154,16928182,Journal of neurotrauma,Differential behavioral and histopathological responses to graded cortical impact injury in mice.,"Controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, a model of contusive brain injury in humans, is being used with increasing frequency in mice to investigate post-traumatic cell damage and death and to evaluate treatment strategies. Because cellular injury mechanisms and therapeutic approaches may depend on the severity of the initial insult, it is important to utilize a model in which outcomes are sensitive to injury severity. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized and subjected to sham injury (n = 23) or CCI injury at either 0.5 mm (n = 22) or 1.0 mm (n = 22) depth of impact at a velocity of 5 m/sec. At 2 days, brain-injured mice exhibited significant memory (p < 0.05) and motor function (p < 0.001) deficits compared to sham-injured mice; furthermore, mice subjected to an impact of 1.0 mm were significantly more impaired in both outcome measures than those injured at 0.5 mm (p < 0.05). The cortical lesion increased in size between 24 h and 7 days in both injury groups, but was significantly larger in the 1.0 mm group. Hippocampal cell loss was observed in the hilar and CA3 regions in both groups, and in the CA1 and dentate granule cell layers in the 1.0 mm group. Regional patterns of IgG extravasation and reactive astrocytosis were similar in the two injured groups, but changes were more persistent in the 1.0 mm group. Both levels of injury resulted in acute loss of neuronal MAP-2 immunoreactivity in the cortex and sub-region specific changes in the hippocampus. Thus, increasing the depth of impact led to similar structural alterations in neurons, astrocytes and the vasculature, but resulted in greater behavioral deficits and cortical and hippocampal cell death.",Animal-other,5,1
1155,36148759,Sleep medicine,Effects of dopamine transporter in the ventral tegmental area on sleep recovery after propofol anesthesia in sleep-deprived rats.,"Previous studies indicate that propofol can help with recovery from sleep deprivation and has anti-anxiety effects. However, the underlying neurochemical mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on sleep and anxiety recovery after propofol anesthesia in rats with 24 h total sleep deprivation (TSD).	Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were in natural sleep or sleep deprived for 24 h in a sleep deprivation rat system. The rats received propofol anesthesia (75 mg/kg, i.p.) or natural sleep. Dopamine transporter knockdown was performed by microinjection of AAV-DAT-RNAi vector. EEG was measured in each group to evaluate the subsequent sleep. The elevated plus maze test (EPMT) and open field test (OFT) were used to evaluate locomotion and anxiety level in rats. Immunofluorescence was used to verify virus location and transfection efficiency.	Compared with NC group, the anxiety level of Propofol group showed no significant difference, but REM sleep decreased. Compared with the TSD group, the anxiety level of the TSD + Propofol group was reduced and the sleep recovery was closer to baseline. Compared with TSD + AAV-NC group, anxiety level and sleep time increased in TSD + AAVi group, REM increased within 24 h after sleep deprivation. The sleep time of TSD + AAVi + Propofol group was between those of TSD + AAV-NC group and TSD + AAVi group. TSD + AAV-NC + Propofol group had the least sleep time and the lowest anxiety level.	1. Propofol did not change anxiety level in normal rats, but reduced REM sleep, while it could accelerate sleep recovery and reduce anxiety level in sleep-deprived rats. 2. In sleep deprived rats with DAT knockdown, propofol improved sleep and anxiety levels more slowly, especially producing more REM rebound, suggesting that the improvement of sleep and anxiety levels in sleep-deprived rats with propofol may be related to DAT in VTA region.",Animal-other,5,1
1156,6106665,Journal of the neurological sciences,Regional tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase concentrations in the brains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis-infected mice.,"The neurotransmitter biosynthesis enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase were investigated in selected brain areas of Nya : NYLAR mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. Statistically significant alterations in the concentrations of both enzymes occurred in the olfactory, caudate, and neocortical regions at 5 days postinfection. No such alterations occurred in mice given cytoxan (150 mg/kg) 3 days postinfection and examined 5 days postinfection. At 10 days postinfection, however, the cytoxan-treated animals had significantly altered enzyme concentrations in the olfactory region, though not in the caudate or neocortex. This alteration appeared to be transitory, since it was not found in cytoxan-treated animals 60 days postinfection. A possible explanation is that virus production or interference in a brain region cycles over a period of hours or days. Still undetermined is whether these neurochemical changes are a primary effect of the virus or a secondary effect due to the immune response. It is noteworthy that cytoxan caused a marked increase in the enzyme activities studied in most of the brain areas.",Animal-other,5,1
1157,34144146,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Modulation of Neuroinflammation by Low-Dose Radiation Therapy in an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Recently, several studies have reported that low-dose radiation therapy (RT) suppresses the release of proinflammatory cytokines in inflammatory-degenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). AD is the most common cause of dementia, and neuroinflammation is one of the major contributing factors in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, low-dose RT may be used clinically for treating AD. However, the appropriate doses, effects, and underlying mechanisms of RT in AD have not been determined. In this study, we aimed to determine the appropriate RT dose and schedule for AD treatment and to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of low-dose RT in AD.	We first determined the proper dose and schedule for RT in late-stage AD using 8- to 9-month-old 5x Familial AD (5xFAD) mice, a well-known animal model of AD, by comparing the effects of a low total dose with low dose per fraction (LD-LDRT, 5 × 0.6 Gy) with those of a low moderate total dose with conventional dose per fraction (LMD-CDRT, 5 × 2 Gy).	LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT were found to reduce the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines CD54, IL-3, CXCL9/10, and CCL2/4 in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, increased microgliosis assessed using Iba-1 and CD68 dual immunostaining was significantly reduced by LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. Moreover, LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT decreased the amyloid plaque burden in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice and attenuated their cognitive impairment; these effects persisted for 4 to 5 weeks.	The present study showed that LD-LDRT alleviates cognitive impairments and prevents the accumulation of amyloid plaques by regulating neuroinflammation in the late stage of AD in 5xFAD mice, with an efficacy equivalent to that of LMD-CDRT. Furthermore, the findings suggest that compared with LMD-CDRT, LD-LDRT may facilitate accessible and convenient treatment in clinical trials.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1158,17524565,Neuroscience,Functional recovery in rats with ischemic paraplegia after spinal grafting of human spinal stem cells.,"Transient spinal cord ischemia in humans can lead to the development of permanent paraplegia with prominent spasticity and rigidity. Histopathological analyses of spinal cords in animals with ischemic spastic paraplegia show a selective loss of small inhibitory interneurons in previously ischemic segments but with a continuing presence of ventral alpha-motoneurons and descending cortico-spinal and rubro-spinal projections. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of human spinal stem cells (hSSCs) implanted spinally in rats with fully developed ischemic paraplegia on the recovery of motor function and corresponding changes in motor evoked potentials. In addition the optimal time frame for cell grafting after ischemia and the optimal dosing of grafted cells were also studied. Spinal cord ischemia was induced for 10 min using aortic occlusion and systemic hypotension. In the functional recovery study, hSSCs (10,000-30,000 cells/0.5 mul/injection) were grafted into spinal central gray matter of L2-L5 segments at 21 days after ischemia. Animals were immunosuppressed with Prograf (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg) for the duration of the study. After cell grafting the recovery of motor function was assessed periodically using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system and correlated with the recovery of motor evoked potentials. At predetermined times after grafting (2-12 weeks), animals were perfusion-fixed and the survival, and maturation of implanted cells were analyzed using antibodies recognizing human-specific antigens: nuclear protein (hNUMA), neural cell adhesion molecule (hMOC), neuron-specific enolase (hNSE) and synapthophysin (hSYN) as well as the non-human specific antibodies TUJ1, GFAP, GABA, GAD65 and GLYT2. After cell grafting a time-dependent improvement in motor function and suppression of spasticity and rigidity was seen and this improvement correlated with the recovery of motor evoked potentials. Immunohistochemical analysis of grafted lumbar segments at 8 and 12 weeks after grafting revealed intense hNSE immunoreactivity, an extensive axo-dendritic outgrowth as well as rostrocaudal and dorsoventral migration of implanted hNUMA-positive cells. An intense hSYN immunoreactivity was identified within the grafts and in the vicinity of persisting alpha-motoneurons. On average, 64% of hSYN terminals were GAD65 immunoreactive which corresponded to GABA immunoreactivity identified in 40-45% of hNUMA-positive grafted cells. The most robust survival of grafted cells was seen when cells were grafted 21 days after ischemia. As defined by cell survival and laminar distribution, the optimal dose of injected cells was 10,000-30,000 cells per injection. These data indicate that spinal grafting of hSSCs can represent an effective therapy for patients with spinal ischemic paraplegia.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1159,36370926,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,Intermittent fasting protects the nigral dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-mediated dopaminergic neuronal injury in mice.,"Dietary restriction through low-calorie intake or intermittent fasting benefits many organs, including the brain. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of fasting in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We found that fasting every other day rather than weekly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor in the nigrostriatal pathway. Therefore, we maintained the animals on alternate-day fasting for 2 weeks and injected MPTP (30 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) for five days. We observed that alternate-day fasting attenuated MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss and astroglial activation in the substantia nigra and the striatum. Moreover, neurochemical analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography showed that alternate-day fasting reduced MPTP-induced depletion of striatal dopamine. Consistent with these results, behavioral tests showed that fasting suppressed the motor impairment caused by MPTP. Furthermore, fasting increased the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase B, which are downstream signaling molecules of neurotrophic factors. Fasting also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and cAMP response element-binding protein, further supporting the involvement of neurotrophic factors in the observed neuroprotective effects. Hence, our results demonstrated the dopaminergic neuroprotection of intermittent fasting in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, supporting the idea that fasting could be an instrumental tool for preventing neurodegeneration in the brain.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1160,37211337,Brain stimulation,Long-lasting restoration of memory function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity by focused ultrasound in Alzheimer's disease.,"Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a medical technology that non-invasively stimulates the brain and has been applied in thermal ablation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, and neuromodulation. In recent years, numerous experiences and indications for the use of FUS in clinical and preclinical studies have rapidly expanded. Focused ultrasound-mediated BBB opening induces cognitive enhancement and neurogenesis; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated.	Here, we investigate the effects of FUS-mediated BBB opening on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive function in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We applied FUS with microbubble to the hippocampus and LTP was measured 6 weeks after BBB opening using FUS. Field recordings were made with a concentric bipolar electrode positioned in the CA1 region using an extracellular glass pipette filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Morris water maze and Y-maze was performed to test cognitive function.	Our results demonstrated that FUS-mediated BBB opening has a significant impact on increasing LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 synapses and rescues cognitive dysfunction and working memory. These effects persisted for up to 7 weeks post-treatment. Also, FUS-mediated BBB opening in the hippocampus increased PKA phosphorylation.	Therefore, it could be a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases as it remarkably increases LTP, thereby improving working memory.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1161,21114367,Physiological research,Rehabilitation intervention in animal model can improve neuromotor and cognitive functions after traumatic brain injury: pilot study.,"The aim of the present study was to quantify the effect of multisensory rehabilitation on rats' cognition after an experimental brain trauma and to assess its possible clinical implications. The complex intermittent multisensory rehabilitation consisted of currently used major therapeutic procedures targeted at the improvement of cognitive functions; including multisensory and motor stimulation and enriched environment. We have confirmed this positive effect of early multisensory rehabilitation on the recovery of motor functions after traumatic brain injury. However, we have been able to prove a positive effect on the recovery of cognitive functions only with respect to the frequency of efficient search strategies in a Barnes maze test, while results for search time and travelled distance were not significantly different between study groups. We have concluded that the positive effects of an early treatment of functional deficits are comparable with the clinical results in early neurorehabilitation in human patients after brain trauma. It might therefore be reasonable to apply these experimental results to human medical neurorehabilitation care.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1162,27081159,Physiological reports,Monitoring of cerebral blood flow during hypoxia-ischemia and resuscitation in the neonatal rat using laser speckle imaging.,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is associated with alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) as a result of perinatal asphyxia. The extent to whichCBFchanges contribute to injury, and whether treatments that ameliorate these changes might be neuroprotective, is still unknown. Higher throughput techniques to monitorCBFchanges in rodent models ofHIEcan help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology. We developed a laser speckle imaging (LSI) technique to continuously monitorCBFin six postnatal-day 10 (P10) rats simultaneously before, during, and after unilateral hypoxia-ischemia (HI, ligation of the left carotid artery followed by hypoxia in 8% oxygen). After ligation,CBFto the ligated side fell by 30% compared to the unligated side (P < 0.0001). Hypoxia induced a bilateral 55% reduction inCBF, which was partially restored by resuscitation. Compared to resuscitation in air, resuscitation in 100% oxygen increasedCBFto the ligated side by 45% (P = 0.033). Individual variability inCBFresponse to hypoxia between animals accounted for up to 24% of the variability in hemispheric area loss to the ligated side. In both P10 and P7 models of unilateralHI, resuscitation in 100% oxygen did not affect hemispheric area loss, or hippocampalCA1 pyramidal neuron counts, after 1-week survival. ContinuousCBFmonitoring usingLSIin multiple rodents simultaneously can screen potential treatment modalities that affectCBF, and provide insight into the pathophysiology ofHI.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

1164,21951913,Molecular brain,Transplantation of human neural stem/progenitor cells overexpressing galectin-1 improves functional recovery from focal brain ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil.,"Transplantation of human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSPCs) is a promising method to regenerate tissue from damage and recover function in various neurological diseases including brain ischemia. Galectin-1(Gal1) is a lectin that is expressed in damaged brain areas after ischemia. Here, we characterized the detailed Gal1 expression pattern in an animal model of brain ischemia. After brain ischemia, Gal1 was expressed in reactive astrocytes within and around the infarcted region, and its expression diminished over time. Previously, we showed that infusion of human Gal1 protein (hGal1) resulted in functional recovery after brain ischemia but failed to reduce the volume of the ischemic region. This prompted us to examine whether the combination of hNSPCs-transplantation and stable delivery of hGal1 around the ischemic region could reduce the ischemic volume and promote better functional recovery after brain ischemia. In this study, we transplanted hNSPCs that stably overexpressed hGal1 (hGal1-hNSPCs) in a model of unilateral focal brain ischemia using Mongolian gerbils. Indeed, we found that transplantation of hGal1-hNSPCs both reduced the ischemic volume and improved deficits in motor function after brain ischemia to a greater extent than the transplantation of hNSPCs alone. This study provides evidence for a potential application of hGal1 with hNSPCs-transplantation in the treatment of brain ischemia.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1165,21606375,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,ES cell-derived renewable and functional midbrain dopaminergic progenitors.,"During early development, midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuronal progenitors (NPs) arise from the ventral mesencephalic area by the combined actions of secreted factors and their downstream transcription factors. These mDA NPs proliferate, migrate to their final destinations, and develop into mature mDA neurons in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Here, we show that such authentic mDA NPs can be efficiently isolated from differentiated ES cells (ESCs) using a FACS method combining two markers, Otx2 and Corin. Purified Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells coexpressed other mDA NP markers, including FoxA2, Lmx1b, and Glast. Using optimized culture conditions, these mDA NPs continuously proliferated up to 4 wk with almost 1,000-fold expansion without significant changes in their phenotype. Furthermore, upon differentiation, Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells efficiently generated mDA neurons, as evidenced by coexpression of mDA neuronal markers (e.g., TH, Pitx3, Nurr1, and Lmx1b) and physiological functions (e.g., efficient DA secretion and uptake). Notably, these mDA NPs differentiated into a relatively homogenous DA population with few serotonergic neurons. When transplanted into PD model animals, aphakia mice, and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, mDA NPs differentiated into mDA neurons in vivo and generated well-integrated DA grafts, resulting in significant improvement in motor dysfunctions without tumor formation. Furthermore, grafted Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells exhibited significant migratory function in the host striatum, reaching >3.3 mm length in the entire striatum. We propose that functional and expandable mDA NPs can be efficiently isolated by this unique strategy and will serve as useful tools in regenerative medicine, bioassay, and drug screening.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Embryonic neural stem cells were obtained; 26 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: five had a sham operation; eight (controls) had a bilateral cavernosal nerve crush and injection of culture medium into the corpora cavernosa; four had an injection of neural embryonic stem (NES) cells into the major pelvic ganglion (MPG); and nine had bilateral cavernosal nerve crush and injection of NES cells into the corpora cavernosa. Erectile response was assessed by cavernosal nerve electrostimulation at 3 months, and penile tissue samples were evaluated histochemically for nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-containing fibres, tyrosine hydroxylase and neurofilament staining.	The groups injected with NES cells into the MPG and corpora cavernosa had significantly higher intracavernosal pressures than the control group. Immunohistochemical staining also revealed differences in the quality of the NOS-containing nerve fibres.

A focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model on Macaca mulatta was performed with a modified middle cerebral artery occlusion method. Among the nearly 8000 genes, approximately 8% of the total number of genes examined were affected after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Major altered genes were downregulated. In EA-treated monkeys, approximately 10% of the total number of genes examined were affected. Major altered genes were upregulated, including signal transduction-, cell-cycle-, metabolism-, stress response-, DNA repair-related genes. One of the representative upregulated genes encodes insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was confirmed using in situ hybridization. Results showed that after ischemia/reperfusion injury, IGF-1 mRNA expression decreased in ipsilateral striatum, whereas increased in ipsilateral hippocampus. No expression changes were observed in cortex. EA treatment could obviously upregulate the IGF-1 mRNA expression in striatum, and further enhance its expression in hippocampus. Therefore, the data presented suggest a possible mediator underlying the mechanisms of anti-ischemic effect of acupuncture. In conclusion, the protective mechanisms of EA against stroke include several related pathways and gene expressions. Microarray analysis may provide a framework for understanding these complicated mechanisms and yield valuable, clinically relevant insights and potentially therapeutic targets of stroke.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Therefore, we investigated the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on neurologic recovery after 15-min complete global cerebral ischemia in a canine model. Complete global ischemia was induced in 19 dogs by occlusion of the ascending aorta and the caval veins. Nine dogs were randomized to treatment with hyperbaric oxygenation (3 atmospheres absolute, 100% oxygen for 1 hr) at 3, 24, and 29 hrs after ischemia under spontaneous respiration, while the other ten dogs served as the control group without hyperbaric oxygen therapy (group C). Neurologic recovery was evaluated based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) activity score (1 = normal; 5 = isoelectric) and the neurologic recovery score (100 = normal; 0 = brain death) over a 14-day postischemic period.	The survival rates were 3/10 (30%) in the control group vs. 7/9 (78%) in the group treated with hyperbaric oxygen (p < .05). Over the 14-day postischemic period, the best (lowest) EEG scores of each dog were significantly (1.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.3; mean +/- SE, p < .01) lower in the hyperbaric oxygen-treated group. The best neurologic recovery scores of each dog were significantly (69 +/- 6 vs. 48 +/- 5; mean +/- SE, p < .05) higher in the treated animals. The number of dogs that recovered to a neurologic recovery score of > 65 (assessed as a slight disability) were 1/10 in the control group and 6/9 in the group treated with hyperbaric oxygen (p < .02).	Hyperbaric oxygen therapy performed in the early postischemic period accelerated neurologic recovery and improved the survival rate in dogs after 15-mins of complete global cerebral ischemia.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

We investigated whether treatment with BVA (0.25 and 0.8 mg/kg) at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoints, located lateral from the anterior border of the tibia, has a beneficial effect in a myelin basic protein (MBP)(68-82)-induced acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model. Pretreatment (every 3 days from 1 h before immunization) with BVA was more effective than posttreatment (daily after immunization) with BVA with respect to clinical signs (neurological impairment and loss of body weight) of acute EAE rats. Treatment with BVA at the ST36 acupoint in normal rats did not induce the clinical signs. Pretreatment with BVA suppressed demyelination, glial activation, expression of cytokines [interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-17, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-1β], chemokines [RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α], and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB (p65 and phospho-IκBα) signaling pathways in the spinal cord of acute EAE rats. Pretreatment with BVA decreased the number of CD4(+), CD4(+)/IFN-γ(+), and CD4(+)/IL-17(+) T cells, but increased the number of CD4(+)/Foxp3(+) T cells in the spinal cord and lymph nodes of acute EAE rats. Treatment with BVA at six placebo acupoints (SP9, GB39, and four non-acupoints) did not have a positive effect in acute EAE rats. Interestingly, onset and posttreatment with BVA at the ST36 acupoint markedly attenuated neurological impairment in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(35-55)-induced chronic EAE mice compared to treatment with BVA at six placebo acupoints. Our findings strongly suggest that treatment with BVA with ST36 acupoint could delay or attenuate the development and progression of EAE by upregulating regulatory T cells and suppressing T-helper (Th) 17 and Th1 responses. These results warrant further investigation of BVA as a treatment for autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

To investigate the effect of manipulating AHNPCs before grafting by predifferentiation, ie, initiating neuronal differentiation before transplantation, and to determine whether this cell priming would affect their ability to migrate in vivo.	AHNPCs were prepared from temporal lobe resections for epilepsy. Seven days after global brain ischemia, predifferentiated AHNPCs (exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor, heparin, and laminin) were transplanted to the left hippocampus. Four and 10 weeks after transplantation, brain sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.	Transplanted primed cells expressed committed neuronal markers at a much earlier stage compared with nonprimed AHNPCs and were found colabeled with human markers within the damaged CA1 region 4 weeks after grafting. Furthermore, predifferentiated AHNPCs migrated preferentially into an ischemic lesion, similar to their undifferentiated counterparts. The chemoattractant effect from the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) in ischemic CA1 on AHNPCs expressing CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) may explain this preference in migration in vivo.	The plasticity of neural progenitors derived from the adult human brain may be greater than previously assumed in that manipulation before grafting may influence the phenotypes seen in vivo. The SDF-1α-CXCR4 axis is involved in the targeted migration toward an ischemic lesion in the adult rat brain, similar to previous reports on endogenous progenitors in rats and grafted fetal human neural progenitors.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

For the commercial capsule, a complex formulation is used to maintain the acidic microenvironment required for maximal absorption. Consequently, its efficacy and safety are similar with or without concomitant intake of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). A simplified DE tablet formulation was developed and tested in two studies. One investigated bioequivalence (BE) of the novel DE tablet versus the commercial DE capsule. The other investigated DE bioavailability (BA) under pretreatment with the PPI rabeprazole and assessed the effect of elevated pH on exposure to dabigatran.	BE of the novel DE tablet versus the DE capsule was assessed in a randomized two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence crossover study (NCT03070171). The effect of rabeprazole on the BA of the DE tablet was assessed in an open-label, single-arm study (NCT03143166). Both studies were conducted at sites in Japan. Participants were healthy male volunteers, aged ≥ 20-40 years. In the BE study, participants received the DE tablet or capsule (single oral dose, 110 mg); primary endpoints were area under the concentration-time curve from baseline to the last quantifiable data point (AUC0-tz) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of unconjugated dabigatran. In the relative BA study, participants received the DE tablet (single oral dose, 110 mg) with or without rabeprazole pretreatment (once daily for 5 days, 20 mg); primary endpoints were AUC0-tz and Cmax of total dabigatran.	In total, 160 participants were randomized in the BE study; 36 participants were enrolled in the BA study. The 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean (gMean) ratios for AUC0-tz (101.4-116.0%) and Cmax (101.8-116.6%) of unconjugated dabigatran were within pre-defined acceptance criteria for BE. In the relative BA study, the gMeans of AUC0-tz (667 to 192 ng h/mL) and Cmax (83.1 to 21.8 ng/mL) were decreased by approximately 70% when the tablet was administered under rabeprazole pretreatment. The reduction in BA was observed at a mean gastric pH of 5.3. Treatment was well tolerated; no deaths, serious adverse events (AEs) or significant AEs were reported in either study.	The DE tablet demonstrated BE to the capsule; however, at high gastric pH, BA of the tablet was reduced by approximately 70%, which may lead to reduced efficacy. Data indicate the importance of examining not only BE under standard conditions, but relative BA at elevated gastric pH. Such investigations may avoid the reduced BA at elevated pH that is quite common in the target population (the elderly and/or patients treated with gastric-acid modifying co-medications), and therefore reduce treatment failure with DE.

ADS-5102 is an extended release amantadine capsule formulation, designed for once-daily dosing at bedtime (qhs) to provide high concentrations upon waking and throughout the day, with lower concentrations in the evening. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADS-5102 were assessed in two phase I studies in healthy subjects, and a blinded, randomized phase II/III dose-finding study in PD patients.	The first phase I study assessed single ADS-5102 doses (68.5, 137, and 274 mg) in a crossover design, whereas the second phase I study evaluated ADS-5102 137 mg for 7 days followed by amantadine IR 81 mg twice daily (or reverse order). In the phase II/III double-blind study, PD patients with dyskinesia were randomized to ADS-5102 (210, 274, or 338 mg) or placebo for 8 weeks.	Single ADS-5102 doses resulted in a slow initial rise in amantadine plasma concentration, with delayed time to maximum concentration (12-16 h). Amantadine plasma concentrations were higher in PD patients versus healthy volunteers. The steady-state profile of once-daily ADS-5102 was significantly different from that of twice-daily amantadine IR, such that the two formulations are not bioequivalent. PK modeling suggested the recommended daily ADS-5102 dosage (274 mg qhs) resulted in 1.4- to 2.0-fold higher amantadine plasma concentrations during the day versus amantadine IR.	ADS-5102 can be administered once-daily qhs to achieve high amantadine plasma concentrations in the morning and throughout the day, when symptoms of dyskinesia occur.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
1177,6986939,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,Clomipramine and exposure for obsessive-compulsive rituals: i.,"Forty chronic obsessive-compulsive ritualizers were randomly assigned to treatment with oral clomipramine or placebo for 8 months. During weeks 4 to 7 these two groups were each randomly split into treatment by relaxation or by exposure in vivo, and during weeks 7 to 10 all patients had exposure in vivo. Double blind assessments were made at weeks 4, 7, 10, 18, 36, 62 and 114. Results are reported to one year. Clomipramine produced significant improvement in rituals, mood and social adjustment, but only in those patients who initially had depressed mood. The clomipramine effect was maximum from weeks 10 to 18 and diminished thereafter. On stopping clomipramine patients often relapsed and improved again on restarting the drug. Relaxation produced little change. Exposure produced significant lasting improvement in rituals, but less change in mood; improvement generalized to social adjustment at follow-up. Clomipramine plus exposure had a slight additive but not interactional effect. Clomipramine enhanced compliance both with exposure and with relaxation. Clomipramine is useful for compulsive ritualizers with depressed mood, but may need continuation for over a year and combination with exposure in vivo. Exposure in vivo remains the treatment of choice for rituals without depressed mood.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

The CENTURION study was the first phase 3 study of lasmiditan in Caucasian and Chinese patients with migraine. This post hoc analysis further demonstrates the safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population and was urgently needed.	Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to lasmiditan 200 mg lasmiditan 100 mg, or a control group. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), their severity, and incidence by treated attacks for frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 5%) were evaluated. The duration, onset, and relationship of efficacy with very common TEAEs (≥ 10%) was analyzed.	A total of 281 Chinese patients were included in this post hoc analysis. No deaths and no study drug-related treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were reported. The incidence of at least one TEAE was higher in patients receiving lasmiditan 200 mg (73.9%) and 100 mg (66.3%) versus placebo (26.6%). TEAEs were generally mild or moderate in severity, and the incidence of frequently reported TEAEs was generally highest during the first attack. Very common TEAEs with lasmiditan included dizziness, asthenia, somnolence, muscular weakness, fatigue, and nausea. The duration of dizziness was longest during the first attack. There were no cardio-cerebrovascular ischemic events and serotonin syndrome. The presence of very common TEAEs (except nausea), and severe dizziness, did not appear to have a negative influence on the efficacy.	In the Chinese population of the CENTURION study, most of the TEAEs were neurologic, of mild or moderate severity, and self-limiting. The distribution of frequently reported TEAEs at the first attack differed from the primary cohort, while the overall safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population was generally consistent with the CENTURION primary cohort. No new safety concerns were observed in the Chinese population.	NCT03670810.	Although there is significant unmet medical need among patients with migraine, there has been no novel compound for treatment of migraine over past two decades in China. These unmet medical needs persist because the current available medications for the acute treatment of migraine are reported to have safety and tolerability issues. Lasmiditan is a new class of acute migraine medication (5-HT receptor agonist with high selectivity for the 5-HT1F receptor) with a proven efficacy and safety in phase 2 and 3 studies. Owing to some differences in clinical practice between China and western countries, there is need to get additional evidence on safety of lasmiditan in the Chinese population to support its usage in clinical practice.This post hoc analysis was conducted to present the detailed safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population using data from the CENTURION study. Approximately half of the analyzed population was not covered in the published primary cohort.The results show that in the Chinese population of the study, most of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neurologic, of mild or moderate severity, and self-limiting. The distribution of frequently reported TEAEs at the first attack differed from the primary cohort with no new safety concerns observed in the Chinese population. The overall safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population was generally consistent with the primary cohort. The results provide additional evidence and emphasize that lasmiditan may be considered as a useful acute treatment option with acceptable safety profile for patients with migraine in China.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

In a placebo-controlled 2X2 design, 7-14 year-olds (N = 95) in parallel pilot trials (depression N = 72; bipolar N = 23) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of Ω3 supplementation (1.4 g eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], 0.2 g docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], and 0.27 g other Ω3 per day); psychoeducational psychotherapy (PEP); their combination; or placebo (mainly oleic and linoleic acid) alone. Blood was drawn at baseline (N = 90) and endpoint (n = 65). Fatty acid levels were expressed as percent of total plasma fatty acids. Correlational and moderator/mediator analyses were done with SPSS Statistics 23.	At baseline: (1) DHA correlated negatively with alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (r = -0.23, p = 0.029); (2) Arachidonic acid (AA, Ω6) correlated negatively with global functioning (r = -0.24, p = 0.022); (3) Total Ω3 correlated negatively with age (r = -0.22, p = 0.036) and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.31, p = 0.006). Moderation: Baseline ALA moderated response to Ω3 supplementation: ALA levels above the sample mean (lower DHA) predicted significantly better placebo-controlled response (p = 0.04). Supplementation effects: Compared to placebo, 2 g Ω3 per day increased EPA blood levels sevenfold and DHA levels by half (both p < 0.001). Body weight correlated inversely with increased EPA (r = -0.52, p = 0.004) and DHA (r = -0.54, p = 0.003) and positively with clinical mood response. Mediation: EPA increase baseline-to-endpoint mediated placebo-controlled global function and depression improvement: the greater the EPA increase, the less the placebo-controlled Ω3 improvement.	Ω3 supplementation at 2 g/day increases blood levels substantially, more so in smaller children. A possible U-shaped response curve should be explored.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over study followed by an open treatment over 3 weeks.","In primary care, sedating antidepressants are often used for treating insomnia, although their underlying sleep-promoting mechanisms are only incompletely understood. Since enhanced evening and nocturnal plasma cortisol levels are supposed to maintain insomniac sleep complaints, a functional link between sleep and cortisol secretion in the mode of action of antidepressants in insomnia might be suspected.	We therefore investigated the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin on nocturnal sleep and plasma cortisol concentration in ten patients (age 41.3+/-9.5 years) with chronic primary insomnia between 1700 hours and 0800 hours.	Single infusions of placebo and 25 mg doxepin were applied following a double-blind, randomized cross-over design. Afterward, all patients received 25 mg doxepin p.o. for 3 weeks in an open-study design.	Both doxepin application forms improved sleep significantly and reduced mean cortisol levels from 9.0+/-1.7 microg/l (single placebo i.v.) to 7.5+/-1.6 microg/l (single doxepin i.v.) or 7.6+/-2.0 microg/l (subchronic doxepin p.o.). The duration of the quiescent period of the cortisol rhythm was significantly prolonged following both doxepin administrations compared with placebo.	The results implicate that the sleep-improving effects of doxepin are mediated at least in part by a normalization of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functions. Although in some patients rebound insomnia and specific side effects must be considered, our findings give a further rationale for the use of antidepressants in the treatment of primary insomnia.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Access to evidence-based treatments for opioid use disorders is extremely limited.	HIV Prevention Trials Network 058 (HPTN 058) was a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the impact of 2 medication-assisted treatment (MAT) strategies on HIV incidence or death among opioid-dependent people who inject drugs (PWID). HIV-negative opioid-dependent PWID were recruited from 4 communities in Thailand and China with historically high prevalence of HIV among PWID. A total of 1251 participants were randomly assigned to either (1) a 1-year intervention consisting of 2 opportunities for a 15-day detoxification with buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) combined with up to 21 sessions of behavioral drug and risk counseling [short-term medication-assisted treatment (ST-MAT)] or (2) thrice-weekly dosing for 48 weeks with BUP/NX and up to 21 counseling sessions [long-term medication-assisted treatment (LT-MAT)] followed by dose tapering. All participants were followed for 52 weeks after treatment completion to assess durability of impact.	Although the study was stopped early due to lower than expected occurrence of the primary end points, sufficient data were available to assess the impact of the interventions on drug use and injection-related risk behavior. At week 26, 22% of ST-MAT participants had negative urinalyses for opioids compared with 57% in the LT-MAT (P < 0.001). Differences disappeared in the year after treatment: at week 78, 35% in ST-MAT and 32% in the LT-MAT had negative urinalyses. Injection-related risk behaviors were significantly reduced in both groups after randomization.	Participants receiving BUP/NX 3 times weekly were more likely to reduce opioid injection while on active treatment. Both treatment strategies were considered safe and associated with reductions in injection-related risk behavior. These data support the use of thrice-weekly BUP/NX as a way to reduce exposure to HIV risk. Continued access to BUP/NX may be required to sustain reductions in opioid use.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

It was hypothesized that DVP in combination with quetiapine would be more effective than DVP alone for treating mania associated with adolescent bipolar disorder. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that quetiapine would be well tolerated.	Thirty manic or mixed bipolar I adolescents (12-18 years) received an initial DVP dose of 20 mg/kg and were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of combination therapy with quetiapine, which was titrated to 450 mg/day (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15). Primary efficacy measures were change from baseline to endpoint in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score and YMRS response rate. Safety and tolerability were assessed weekly.	The DVP + quetiapine group demonstrated a statistically significantly greater reduction in YMRS scores from baseline to endpoint than the DVP + placebo group (F(1,27) = 5.04, p =.03). Moreover, YMRS response rate was significantly greater in the DVP + quetiapine group than in the DVP + placebo group (87% versus 53%; Fisher exact test, p =.05).

Long-term alcohol use leads to an altered perioperative hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and immunity.	The aim of this study was to evaluate HPA intervention with low-dose ethanol, morphine, or ketoconazole on the neuroendocrine-immune axis and development of postoperative pneumonia in long-term alcoholic patients.	In this randomized, double-blind controlled study, 122 consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery for aerodigestive tract cancer were included. Long-term alcohol use was defined as consuming at least 60 g of ethanol daily and fulfilling the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence. Nonalcoholic patients were included but only as a descriptive control. Perioperative intervention with low-dose ethanol (0.5 g/kg body weight per day), morphine (15 mug/kg body weight per hour), ketoconazole (200 mg four times daily), and placebo was started on the morning before surgery and continued for 3 d after surgery. Blood samples to analyze the neuroendocrine-immune axis were obtained on the morning before intervention and on Days 1, 3, and 7 after surgery.	In long-term alcoholic patients, all interventions decreased postoperative hypercortisolism and prevented impairment of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte type 1:type 2 ratio. All interventions decreased the pneumonia rate from 39% to a median of 5.7% and shortened intensive care unit stay by 9 d (median) compared with the placebo-treated long-term alcoholic patients.

1187,25710916,BMJ open,'Do Well B.': Design Of WELL Being monitoring systems. A study protocol for the application in autism.,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties in communication and social interaction resulting from atypical perceptual and cognitive information processing, leading to an accumulation of anxiety. Extreme overloading experienced internally may not be externally visible. Identifying stressful situations at an early stage may avoid socially problematic behaviour from occurring, such as self-injurious behaviour. Activation of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) is involved in the response to anxiety, which can be measured through heart rate variability and skin conductance with the use of portable devices, non-intrusively and pain-free. Thus, developing innovative analysis of signal perception and reaction is necessary, mainly for non-communicative individuals with autism.	The protocol will take place in real life (home and social environments). We aim to associate modifications of the ANS with external events that will be recorded in a synchronous manner through a specific design (spy glasses with video/audio recording). Four phases will be carried out on ASD participants and aged-matched controls: (1) 24-hour baseline pre-experiment (physical activity, sleep), (2) 2 h in a real life situation, (3) 30 min in a quiet environment, interrupted by a few seconds of stressful sound, (4) an interview to record feelings about events triggering anxiety. ASD and control participants will be together for phases 2 and 3, revealing different physiological responses to the same situations, and thus identifying potentially problematic events. The novelty will be to apply time-series analyses (which led to several Nobel Prizes in quantitative finance) on ANS series (heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance) and wrist motion.

However, none of the studies have directly compared the effectiveness between the two interventions on treating sleep disturbance in children with ASD. Without direct comparison, we do not know which intervention is better. Thus, we designed a study to compare which intervention is more effective to treat sleep disturbance in children with ASD and to examine whether the combination of the two could be the most efficacious. We present a protocol for conducting a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of physical exercise and melatonin supplement on treating sleep disturbance in children with ASD.	The proposed study will be a four-group randomised control trial (RCT) design, with equal allocation of participants to the three intervention groups and one control group.	All eligible participants will be randomly allocated to a morning jogging group, a melatonin supplement group, a combination group and a control group. Changes in sleep quality will be monitored through actigraphic assessment and parental sleep logs. Melatonin levels represented by 6-sulfoxymelatonin will be measured from the participants' 24-h and the first morning void urinary samples. All the assessments will be carried out before the intervention (T1), in the mid of the study (5 weeks after the commencement of the study) (T2) and after the 10-week intervention (T3). Level of statistical significance will be set at 5% (i.e. p < .05). The results of this trial will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journal.

The primary endpoint is the area-under-the-curve concentration of serum biomarkers (S100B, NSE, GFAP, MMP9, MBP, and cellular microparticles) in the first five days after treatment. Secondary endpoints are the number and volume of new ischemic lesions in magnetic resonance imaging and clinical outcome evaluated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the modified Rankin Scale, and neuropsychological tests at six and twelve months. All outcome variables will be determined by observers blinded to group allocation. This study was approved by the local institutional Ethics Committee (UN5164), version 3.0 of the study protocol, dated 20 October 2013.	This study uses the elective treatment of intracranial aneurysms as a paradigmatic situation to explore the neuroprotective effects of RIPC. If effects are demonstrable in this pilot trial, a larger, prospective phase III trial will be considered.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
1190,7802126,The American journal of psychiatry,Laboratory response of patients with panic and obsessive-compulsive disorders to 35% CO2 challenges.,"The DSM-III-R anxiety disorders section includes both panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. To evaluate the relationship between these two disorders, subject responses to inhalation of a 35% CO2 and 65% O2 mixture were assessed.	Twenty-three patients with panic disorder, 23 with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 12 with both obsessive-compulsive and panic disorder, and 23 healthy comparison subjects were given a single vital capacity inhalation of 35% CO2 and 65% O2 or a placebo mixture of compressed air. A double-blind, random, crossover design was used.	Patients with panic disorder and patients with both panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder showed similar strong anxiogenic reactions to 35% CO2; while patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder alone did not differ from comparison subjects.	These results confirm that obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are two distinct syndromes and that patients with these disorders have different sensitivity to CO2 inhalation.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1191,23985232,American journal of health behavior,Knowing quitters predicts smoking cessation in a homeless population.,"To examine the impact of knowing quitters on cessation among homeless smokers.	Secondary analysis of data derived from a community-based randomized controlled trial of 430 homeless smokers. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine whether knowing quitters impacted the likelihood of cessation (salivary cotinine ≤ 20 ng/ml) at 26-week follow-up.	Multivariable logistic regression showed cessation was more likely for smokers who knew ≥ 5 quitters compared with those who knew no quitters (Odds Ratio = 3.79, CI = 1.17, 12.27, p = .008), adjusting for age, education, income, and time to first cigarette in morning.	Knowing former smokers was associated with increased likelihood of achieving smoking abstinence among homeless smokers.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
